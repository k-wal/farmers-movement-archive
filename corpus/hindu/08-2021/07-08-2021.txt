07 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC backs Amazon plea against Future-Reliance merger plan||The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in favour of e-commerce giant Amazon against the proposed Rs. 24,713 crore merger deal between Future Retail Limited (FRL) and Reliance Retail. A Bench of Justices Rohinton F. Nariman and B.R. Gavai upheld the validity and enforceability of a Singapore-based Emergency Arbitrator (EA) award, which restrained FRL, India’s second largest offline retailer, from going ahead with the disputed transaction. Justice Nariman recorded that the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (MDA) Group, which owns Reliance Retail, was among the “restricted persons” or “prohibited entities” with whom FRL, Future Coupons Private Limited (which owns 9.82% shareholding in FRL) and the Biyanis could not “deal”. Despite this, the court noted that FRL entered into a transaction with the MDA Group. The deal envisaged “the amalgamation of FRL with the MDA Group, the consequential cessation of FRL as an entity, and complete disposal of its retail assets in favour of the group”. The EA in October 2020, injuncted FRL “from taking any steps to complete the disputed transaction with entities that are part of the MDA Group”. The judgment dismissed FRL’s argument that the “Emergency Arbitrator is not an arbitral tribunal” under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996. Senior advocate Harish Salve had argued that the EA, which functions under the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, is ”‘a foreigner to the Indian Arbitration Act”. He contended that Amazon, represented by senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, by urging to enforce the EA award, was trying to “fit a square peg in a round hole”. Mr. Subramaniam, on the other hand, had argued that the EA award can never be characterised as a nullity and ignored.Justice Nariman upheld the validity of the EA award. The judgment laid down that the award is “exactly like an order of an arbitral tribunal” contemplated under Section 17 of the 1996 Act. Hence, an award by the EA was like an order under Section 17(1) (interim measures ordered by an arbitral tribunal) of the Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-backs-amazon-against-future-reliance-merger/article35779309.ece

07 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Post talks, India, China pull back troops from Gogra||India and China have undertaken disengagement from Gogra area of eastern Ladakh following an agreement at the 12th round of Corps Commander talks, the Army said on Friday. This is the second friction area from which disengagement has been done after Pangong Tso in February as part of efforts for overall disengagement and de-escalation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh to end the standoff that began in May last year. “As per the agreement, both sides have ceased forward deployments in this area in a phased, coordinated and verified manner. The disengagement process was carried out over two days, August 4 and 5. The troops of both sides are now in their permanent bases,” the Army said in a statement. All temporary structures and other allied infrastructure created in the area by both sides have been dismantled and mutually verified, the Army said. “The landform in the area has been restored by both sides to pre-stand-off period.” This agreement ensures that the LAC in this area would be strictly observed and respected by both sides, and that there was no unilateral change in status quo, the Army said. With this development, the focus of further talks would be on disengagement at PP15 in Hot Springs, according to a defence official. Some progress had been made but some issues remain, he said. On the 12th round of Corps Commander talks that went on for nine hours, the Army said the two sides had a “candid and in-depth exchange of views on resolution of the remaining areas” related to disengagement along the LAC in the western sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-china-back-off-from-gogra/article35779312.ece

The court suggested the formation of a special force to protect judges, especially trial judges who decide criminal cases involving high-profile accused. ‘No freedom’ “We have seen that in criminal cases involving high-profile people, there is a new trend of maligning judges.

07 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Rs. 37 crore of PF funds illegally withdrawn; four suspended||Several crores of Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) savings have been drained out through fraudulent withdrawals at a regional office in Mumbai with the connivance of some Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) officials. By Wednesday, Rs. 37 crore of such withdrawals, most of which are learnt to have been partial withdrawal claims from EPF, had come to light, as per sources aware of the development. Four officials have been suspended so far and an audit team of the EPFO has been dispatched to scrutinise transaction records at the regional EPF office in Kandivali. The EPFO has confirmed that administrative and criminal action has been launched, along with efforts to recover the funds. A source close to the development said the fraud also involved preparing fake claim requests against EPF accounts where no fresh contributions have been made for a prolonged period. “About 25%-30% of the balances in the affected accounts were withdrawn and transferred out through the NEFT banking system. This was facilitated by junior and clerical-level officers, including social security assistants, acting in concert to process the withdrawal claims,” the person explained. EPF offices in the Mumbai region have tightened withdrawal processes, citing these fraud cases and issued an advisory to avoid fresh malfeasance in the settlement of claims, amid concerns that the same modus operandi may have been replicated in other PF offices. Responding to The Hindu ’s detailed queries on the matter , Central PF Commissioner (CPFC) Sunil Barthwal’s office conceded that an internal probe has found balances have been withdrawn from “non-existent accounts”, stressing that “the EPF balance in the account of any member is not fraudulently withdrawn and balances of EPF members are safe”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rs-37-cr-of-pf-savings-withdrawn-illegally/article35779305.ece

07 August 2021||New Delhi,||Child has right to use mother’s surname: HC||The Delhi High Court on Friday observed that every child has the right to use his or her mother’s surname if he or she wishes to. Justice Rekha Palli made the observation while hearing a petition by a minor girl’s father seeking direction to the authorities to reflect his surname in his daughter’s documents and not her mother’s. “A father does not own the daughter to dictate that she should use only his surname. If the minor daughter is happy with her surname, what is your problem?” Justice Palli said, while declining to pass any direction on the father's plea. Advocate Anuj Kumar Ranjan, appearing for the man, submitted that his client’s daughter is six years old and cannot decide such issues on her own. Mr. Ranjan contended that the child’s surname was changed by his client’s estranged wife. ‘Violation of rules’ The lawyer said the surname of the child was changed on the birth certificate on the pretext of correction of spelling. This was in violation of provisions under Section 11 of the Delhi Registration of Births and Deaths Rules, the advocate submitted. The High Court, however, disposed of the petition with a liberty to the man to approach his daughter’s school to show his name as the father.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/child-has-right-to-use-mothers-surname-hc/article35779490.ece

Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar issued the order on a writ petition by S. Kuttappan Chettiar of Thiruvananthapuram and another person challenging the order. Petitioners’ contention The petitioners contended that in view of the provision in Article 342A, introduced to the Constitution in terms of the 102nd Amendment with effect from August 15, 2018, the State government had been divested of its power to specify any class of persons as socially and educationally backward. In fact, only the President of India had the power to make such specifications. Therefore, the order issued by the government was unconstitutional as it was against Article 342A. Prima facie case The court observed that the petitioners had made out a prima facie case for an interim order and, therefore, the order would remain stayed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-stays-inclusion-of-nadars-on-sebc-list/article35779660.ece

All sorts of allegations are made. It is very confusing. You are making complaints all the time, but now you want to stay there,” the Bench said. “Now there is a prayer against transferring [the accused] out of there.

07 August 2021||New Delhi,||Opposition leaders attend farmers’ stir||Leaders of at least 12 Opposition parties, including former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, on Friday attended the farmers’ parliament at Jantar Mantar to express solidarity with protesting farmers, who are demanding the repeal of the farm laws.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/opposition-leaders-attend-farmers-stir/article35779729.ece
07 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Amid adjournments, Lok Sabha passes two Bills||The Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day in the first half of the sitting itself and at the end of a third week of protests by Oppositions MPs on the Pegasus snooping issue and the three contentious farm laws, but managed to pass the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, and the Central Universities (Amendment) Bill, 2021, without debate or discussion. The House was adjourned a few minutes after it was convened, with Speaker Om Birla urging the protesting members to participate in the Question Hour. But continuing protests saw the House being adjourned till 12 noon. When it reconvened, Rajendra Agarwal, as presiding officer, asked the protesters to participate in discussions on the two Bills listed. Leader of the Congress legislature party in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhary, spoke before both the Bills were passed, urging the government to “give up” its “obduracy” in not considering the demands of the Opposition. To this, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal said it was the Opposition that was blocking discussions, including the one proposed by Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) MP N.K. Premachandran on the COVID-19 pandemic. In the midst of it, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman moved the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill for consideration and passing. It had been introduced in the Lok Sabha on Thursday. Making a short statement before the Bill was put to vote, Ms. Sitharaman said the Bill was a clarificatory amendment. The 2012 Finance Act provision that amended the Income Tax Act, making offshore transactions involving Indian assets (including those set up prior to the law being enacted) liable for tax in India, was considered “bad in law” as far as the BJP was concerned. Former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had set up a high-level committee after the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government came to power in 2014 to look into the issue, as the BJP, and later the government, did not support retrospective taxation. The Act had been caught up in litigation in courts in India and abroad, and the government was waiting for the conclusion of these actions to bring a law scrapping the retrospective tax. The Bill was passed by voice vote and without debate. Ladakh Central varsity Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan moved the Central Universities (Amendment) Act for setting up a Central university in Ladakh. He said this would help in the emotional integration of the people of Ladakh, Leh and Kargil with the rest of the country. The university, to be named Sindhu University, would have a 110-acre campus. Again, this Bill was passed in the din with no discussion. The House was adjourned for the day after the passage of the two Bills.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amid-adjournments-lok-sabha-passes-two-bills/article35779012.ece
07 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||Assam, Meghalaya to form regional panels||The Assam and Meghalaya governments on Friday decided to start settling the “less complicated” areas of the dispute along the 884.9 km border between them before moving on to the more complicated ones. They also decided to form three regional committees each to first get the views of the people living in the disputed areas and prepare a recommendation within 30 days for a decision at the level of the Chief Ministers. The decisions were taken at a meeting between Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Meghalaya counterpart Conrad K. Sangma in Guwahati. “Today’s [Friday’s] meeting was a follow-up of the July 23 meeting we had in [Meghalaya capital] Shillong. We agreed that the disputes have carried on for far too long and things need to be settled amicably and respectfully,” Mr. Sangma said after the meeting. “We agreed that some areas of differences are less complicated, some are more complicated and the rest very complicated. We decided to approach the issues phase-wise and start with six of the 12 disputed areas that are less complicated,” he said. These areas are Upper Tarabari, Gazang Reserve Forest, Hahim, Boklapara, Khanapara-Pilangkata and Ratacherra involving West Khasi Hills, Ri-Bhoi and East Jaintia Hills districts of Meghalaya, and Kamrup, Kamrup (Metropolitan) and Cachar districts of Assam. The more complicated areas of dispute are Langpih, Borduar, Nongwah, Matamur, Deshdemoreah Block I and Block II, and Khanduli. “The Meghalaya government gave a presentation with their perspective on the issues during the July 23 meeting. Today, we presented our point of view,” Dr. Sarma said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-meghalaya-to-form-regional-panels/article35779023.ece
07 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC asks govt. if it wants tribunals closed||The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Central government point-blank to come clean on whether it intends to “close” tribunals across the country by not filling up vacancies that have been pending for years. “The question here is whether you really want these tribunals to continue or do you intend to close them... Is it that the bureaucracy does not want these tribunals?” Chief Justice of India (CJI) N.V. Ramana asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. Justice Surya Kant, on the Bench, pointed out that with tribunals defunct and High Courts having no jurisdiction over the areas of law wielded by tribunals, litigants have nowhere to go for justice. Chief Justice Ramana read out in open court the details of over 240 vacancies in key tribunals, making them redundant in their slow death. The court said certain tribunals do not even have presiding officers. Recommendations of names by the selection committees led by sitting Supreme Court judges to fill up the vacancies have been largely ignored by the government. The CJI, accompanied by Justice Surya Kant, read out the exact vacancies in each tribunal, including the National Green Tribunal, Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Central Administrative Tribunal, only to name a few. The Solicitor General said he “genuinely shared the Lordships’ concerns”. He assured the court that he would inform the government. Justice Kant observed, “If you don't want these tribunals, allow us to restore their jurisdictions to the High Courts. On the other hand, if you want these tribunals to continue, fill up the vacancies... You can't take away the right of the people to access justice”. Chief Justice Ramana said the situation revealed a “very sorry state of affairs”. Mr. Mehta agreed, saying “something needs to be done speedily”. Justice Kant said, “Wherever selection committees, presided over by sitting Supreme Court judges, have recommended names, can’t you make those appointments?”. Mr. Mehta submitted that appointments may have been held up due to litigation in the Supreme Court. Justice Kant said the litigation was about the tenure of the members of the tribunals. The government could have gone ahead with the appointments regardless of the litigation and later fixed the tenure subject to the final outcome of the litigation. The Supreme Court issued notice to the Centre and the GST Council in a PIL plea filed by advocate Amit Sahni seeking the constitution of national and regional GST tribunals. The court has listed the case for hearing on August 16.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-asks-govt-if-it-wants-tribunals-closed/article35779053.ece
07 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Iran, India can play a useful role’||Iran would welcome an Indian role in stabilising Afghanistan, said Iran’s new President Ebrahim Raisi, during a meeting with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in Tehran, where the Minister attended Mr. Raisi’s swearing-in ceremony. Mr. Jaishankar will meet Qatar’s special envoy on Afghanistan on Saturday, adding to a series of meetings on the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan. “Iran and India can play a constructive and useful role in ensuring security in the region, especially Afghanistan, and Tehran welcomes New Delhi’s role in establishment of security in Afghanistan,” a statement from the Iranian President’s office said after the meeting on Friday. “The fate of Afghanistan must be decided by the Afghans themselves, and we believe that if the Americans do not sabotage the situation, this issue will be resolved quickly,” Dr. Raisi said. Mr. Jaishankar’s Tehran visit comes on the back of a number of engagements with Iran in an effort to improve flagging bilateral ties as well as to find a common course on Afghanistan. Mr. Jaishankar visited Tehran last on July 7, and met Foreign Minister Javad Zarif at the same time as a Taliban delegation was in the city, also to hold consultations with Mr. Zarif. On July 21, Iran’s official agency IRNA reported that the two Ministers spoke on the telephone to discuss the rapid developments in Afghanistan, where the U.S troops were completing their pullout amidst a rapid escalation in violence by the Taliban forces who are attacking different cities, including Kandahar, Lashkar Gah, Herat and Kunduz. Envoy’s visit Meanwhile, Qatari special envoy for Counterterrorism and Mediation of Conflict Resolution Mutlaq Bin Majed Al-Qahtani arrived in Delhi on a two-day visit on Friday, and met the Ministry of Extenal Affairs’ (MEA) official in charge of Pakistan-Afghanistan-India Joint Secretary J.P. Singh. In June last, it was Mr. Qahtani who had given the first official confirmation that Indian officials were in talks with Taliban representatives based in Doha. Subsequently, the MEA confirmed that India is engaging “various stakeholders” in Afghanistan, and government sources said they had made contact with some Taliban factions.  While the meetings are likely to focus on the reconciliation process in Doha, where the Intra-Afghan dialogue has hit an impasse, New Delhi is also expected to point out that despite being regional powers, neither India nor Iran had been included yet in the meetings of the “Troika Plus” grouping of U.S.-Russia-China and Pakistan, due to be held in Doha on August 11. Both India and Iran have stressed on the “legitimacy” of the democratically-elected Ghani government in Afghanistan. According to the Iranian President’s office, Mr. Jaishankar said that the current level of relations “is not favourable, and we are determined to establish long-term cooperation in the interests of our nations, given the serious will of the Iranian side.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/iran-india-can-play-a-useful-role/article35779029.ece
07 August 2021||New Delhi,||Oppn. leaders attend farmers’ stir||Leaders of at least 12 Opposition parties, including former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, on Friday attended the “Kisan Sansad”  (farmers’ Parliament) at Jantar Mantar in the city to express their solidarity with protesting farmers, who are demanding the repeal of the three farm laws. Organising themselves at Parliament House, Opposition leaders then moved to Jantar Mantar, the venue of the protests against the farm laws by a select few leaders of farmers’ organisations, who have been given permission by the Delhi police to do so. Since July 22, these farmer leaders have been protesting close to Parliament to mark over seven months of farmers’ protests at Delhi’s border points against the laws. The leaders left Parliament at 12.30 p.m. in a bus to reach Jantar Mantar. However, none of the political leaders either gave a speech or sat on the dais. Instead, they were part of the audience and listened to the leaders of various farmers’ organisations. “Today, all the Opposition parties decided to support farmers and demand the withdrawal of the three farm laws. We want to give our entire support to all the farmers,” Mr. Gandhi told presspersons. “It will not work with a discussion on the farm laws. These black laws will have to be withdrawn,” he responded, when pointed out that the government was willing to talk with farmers over the provisions of the farm laws. Alleging that the government was not allowing the Opposition to raise the Pegasus spyware issue in Parliament, Mr. Gandhi said, “ We want to discuss the Pegasus [snooping] issue and they are not allowing it to happen. [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi has got into every telephone.” Other leaders present at Jantar Mantar included the Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut; Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Manoj Kumar Jha; Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Elamaram Kareem; Communist Party of India (CPI) leader Binoy Viswam; Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader Mohammed Bashir; and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader Tiruchi Siva. Members of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Trinamool Congress were not present at the Kisan Sansad even though they had attended the Opposition’s joint strategy meeting in the morning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/oppn-leaders-attend-farmers-stir/article35779003.ece
07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Trinamool Congress MPs being singled out for suspension’||Trinamool Congress MP Dola Sen , one of the loudest protestors in the Rajya Sabha and among the seven lawmakers suspended from the current monsoon session, says her party MPS are being singled out though members from other parties were also shouting slogans and had torn papers.  So far, seven Trinamool MPs have been suspended in the monsoon session of Parliament. Do you believe that the party is being singled out for disciplinary action? It is clear that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scared of our Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. It is not as if Trinamool Congress MPs were standing alone in the well. MPs from the Congress, the Left parties, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were also in the well, but no one else was suspended except for us. In fact, the Congress and the AAP MPs tore papers too, but no action was taken against them. On Wednesday, when six of us were suspended, like the other days, most of the Opposition members were holding posters. But Trinamool was singled out. We don’t care; it is a matter of pride for us. Hours after your suspension on Wednesday, it was reported that you and your colleagues tried to storm into the Rajya Sabha chamber, injuring a female security officer. What exactly transpired? It is unfortunate that the Leader of the House, Piyush Goyal, stood on the floor of the Parliament and lied. Mr. Goyal claimed that the Rajya Sabha chamber was closed down for sanitation, which is absolutely incorrect. The MPs were still walking in and out of the chamber. Out of the six Trinamool MPs who were suspended, four of us are ladies. We were carrying bags, which we had left behind on our seats. After we were informed about our suspension, we stood outside the door of the Rajya Sabha chamber and continued with our protest. At 3:30 p.m., the House adjourned for the day, which means our suspension for the day, too, ended. When we returned to the chamber to pick our bags, a male security official stopped us from entering. Why is Mr. Goyal lying to cover up a mistake committed by a marshal? But in your protest on Pegasus, aren’t other important issues like the high fuel prices also getting washed out? We have clearly said three issues need to be discussed threadbare — Pegasus cyber attack, repeal of the three farm Acts and frequent fuel price hike. Now, with due respect, IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw is not the policymaker for this government. It is the Prime Minister and Home Minister Amit Shah who drive the policy, so let them answer our questions. In the din, the government is managing to clear crucial Bills without recording any objection from the Opposition. Aren’t you, in a way, helping the government? This is a pattern with the government. In September 2020, too, I was suspended similarly, when the government bulldozed through the three farm laws. They denied us a division on the Bills. They refused to hear our objections... The BJP is shameless, they passed 30 Bills and then they themselves curtailed the session... This time around, too, on an average, only seven minutes are spent on each Bill.  It is the PM and the Home Minister who drive the policy, so let them answer our questions||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trinamool-congress-mps-being-singled-out-for-suspension/article35779005.ece
07 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Khel Ratna named after Dhyan Chand||The Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna stands renamed as the “Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna”. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to Twitter on Friday to announce the change of name in honour of the hockey wizard. “I have been getting many requests from citizens across India to name the Khel Ratna Award after Major Dhyan Chand. I thank them for their views. Respecting their sentiment, the Khel Ratna Award will hereby be called the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award!” read Mr. Modi’s tweet. The announcement came a day after the men’s hockey team ended a 41-year wait for an Olympic medal by taking the third spot, and on a day when the women’s team finished fourth after some heart-winning performances, including a stunning victory over Australia. Greatest hockey player Dhyan Chand, a three-time Olympic gold medallist, is considered India’s greatest hockey player. His birthday, on August 29, marks the National Sports Day, when the National Sports Awards are presented each year. Though Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala welcomed the move to rename the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna awards in memory of the legendary hockey player, he accused the Prime Minister of “petty politics” and challenged the Union government to rename stadia that have been named after BJP politicians, including the Narendra Modi stadium in Gujarat and the Arun Jaitley stadium in Delhi. “Modi ji should have not used his myopic political motives to drag a celebrated player like Major Dhyan Chand. Rajiv Gandhi ji doesn’t need any awards for recognition. He is known for his sacrifice and the ideas that helped India transform into the 21st century,” Mr. Surjewala said. He said from now on, various stadia should be named after celebrated players like P.T. Usha, Milkha Singh, Mary Kom, Sachin Tendulkar, Pullela Gopichand, Sania Mirza and Leander Paes, among others. He also accused the government of reducing the sports Budget by Rs. 230 crore in an Olympic Games year. However, discussions on renaming the Khel Ratna awards have been on at least for the past two years. The change of name was suggested by the Committee for Review of Sports Awards and Special (Cash) Award Scheme, constituted by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports in February 2019. The committee, under Justice (Retd.) Indermeet Kaur Kochar, consisted of members like Shiva Keshavan, Ashwini Nachappa, Mohandas Pai, Rajesh Kalra and S.P.S. Tomar (Deputy Secretary in the Sports Ministry and in charge of sports awards). Following deliberations, the committee noted, “Rajiv Gandhi has not been directly associated with sports, but the award is being given carrying his name for the last 26 years. Bhartiya Khel Ratna would be more appropriate.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/khel-ratna-named-after-dhyan-chand/article35779007.ece
07 August 2021||Kolkata,||Celebrations begin to mark 150 years of iconic artist Abanindranath Tagore||Year-long celebrations marking 150 years of Abanindranath Tagore will kick off on Saturday, with a host of online workshops and talks paying tributes to the leading light of the Bengal School of Art. Abanindranath, a nephew of Rabindranath Tagore and a decade younger to the poet, helped shape modern Indian art and was the creator of the iconic ‘Bharat Mata’ painting. The celebration, titled Abanindranath at 150: Bichitra Revisited , is being organised jointly by Victoria Memorial Hall, Kolkata, and DAG. This collaboration, according to the organisers, is in the spirit of experimentation and exchange that took place at Abanindranath’s Bichitra Studio at Jorasanko (the ancestral home of the Tagore family in Kolkata). The iconic south verandah of Jorasanko was established as a studio and laboratory by the artist and his brothers Gaganendranath and Samarendranth and it hosted art classes, plays, performances, adda s, and magic shows. “Abanindranath Tagore was arguably the first major exponent of an artistic idiom that sought to modernise the Mughal and the Rajput styles in order to counter the influence of Western models of art under the colonial regime. His unique interpretation of swadeshi themes created a new awakening and heralded a revival of Indian art,” Jayanta Sengupta, secretary and curator of Victoria Memorial Hall, told The Hindu . Victoria Memorial Hall is the custodian of the Rabindra Bharati Society collection, the single-largest collection of works by the artist. For DAG, the artist is central to its exhibition on the National Art Treasure artists at the Drishykala Art Museum in Delhi as well as the foundation of the galleries on the Bengal School of Art at Ghare Baire, Kolkata. Sumona Chakravarty of DAG said: “Abanindranath’s work is timeless, we continue to be amazed and delighted by it. He witnessed an important point in the nation’s history when there were questions around the identity of India, and he responded by creating a new language for art that was so wide-ranging and diverse that even today it is a powerful reminder of the syncretic tradition we have inherited and need to safeguard.” On Saturday, four events will be held — over Zoom — through the day with special workshops for children, performative dialogues, and conversations. These events also mark the launch of a year-long celebration of the artist through digital projects, films, performances and workshops by contemporary artists who are re-engaging with his oeuvre and the spirit of the Bichitra Studio.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/celebrations-begin-to-mark-150-years-of-iconic-artist-abanindranath-tagore/article35779032.ece
07 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Plea seeks contempt action against PM||Lawyer Manohar Lal Sharma has moved the Supreme Court seeking contempt action against the Prime Minister, the Union Home Minister and the Ministry of Home Affairs for the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner. Mr. Sharma accused them of “wilful denial” of a Supreme Court judgment of July 2018, which had directed the State governments to send to the Union Public Service Commission the names of the probables three months before the incumbent Director General of Police were to retire. The Supreme Court, in March 2019, had further clarified that only officers with a minimum residual tenure of six months should be considered for DGP postings. The lawyer said Mr. Asthana had only very few days left to retire. He contended that the Prime Minister is the head of the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet. The decision to appoint Mr. Asthana was jointly taken with the Home Minister. So they were liable for contempt, the plea said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/plea-seeks-contempt-action-against-pm/article35779042.ece
07 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||IAF chief flies on Israeli F-15 fighter||Indian Air Force (IAF) Chief Air Chief Marshal (ACM) RKS Bhadauria on Friday flew a sortie on an Israeli F-15 fighter jet along with the Commander of the Israeli Air Force, the IAF said. “As part of the visit, the Chief of Air Staff (CAS) and Maj. Gen. Amikam Norkin, Commander, Israeli Air Force, visited the “Yad Vashem” and paid homage at the memorial. During the visit from August 3 to 6, ACM Bhadauria and Maj. Gen. Norkin held wide-ranging discussions on all bilateral Air Force interactions, the IAF said. He was given an overview of the Israeli Air Force’s operational environment, it stated. The visit of the CAS to Israel marks a milestone in the ties between the two Air Forces with both sides reaffirming a shared vision of enhanced bilateral engagements, the IAF said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/iaf-chief-flies-on-israeli-f-15-fighter/article35779020.ece
07 August 2021||Kolkata,||Slogans like ‘BJMool’ created confusion, says CPI(M) note||The Communist Party of India (Marxist), in an internal party note, has said slogans such as “BJMool” describing the Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party as two sides of the same coin created confusion among the people and did not work in favour of the Left party in the recent West Bengal Assembly election. “The understanding of the CPI(M) is that the BJP is not like any other political party, since the BJP is governed by the fascist RSS. This is the party’s understanding. But during the election, some confusion was created that the BJP and the TMC were alike. Slogans like BJPMool and calling BJP and TMC two sides of the same coin gave rise to confusion,” an internal note circulated by the party earlier this month said. Internal assessment The document says the internal assessment of the party is “the BJP and the TMC are never the same. But something that needs to be kept in mind is that from the very start of Trinamool, its registration and the symbol, everything has been done as per the instructions of the RSS,” the statement said. The note, titled “Circumstances during elections and our work”, tries to resolve the ideological question which not only the CPI(M) but most Left parties in the State are grappling with — who is their bigger enemy in West Bengal, the BJP or the TMC. Political observers feel that several years after the former Chief Minister and veteran communist leader Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee gave the slogan “BJP Hatao Desh Bachao, TMC hatao Rajya Bachao [Defeat BJP to save country, Remove TMC to save State”], the party has not been able to give a new clear message to its supporters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/slogans-like-bjmool-created-confusion-says-cpim-note/article35779291.ece
07 August 2021||New Delhi,||Officers appointed according to IT rules, Twitter tells Delhi HC||Twitter informed the Delhi High Court on Friday that it had appointed a permanent Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), a Resident Grievance Officer (RGO) and a Nodal Contact Person in compliance with the new Information Technology (IT) Rules. Justice Rekha Palli, however, asked Twitter to put this development on record by filing a proper affidavit. The court posted the case for hearing on August 10. Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya represented Twitter. In previous hearings, the court had expressed reservations over Twitter changing the status of the CCO appointment from “interim” to “contingent” in its affidavit. Justice Palli had said the rules mandated the appointment of a senior employee as CCO, but Twitter, according to its affidavit, has appointed a “contingent worker” through a third party contractor. The court had remarked, “I don’t know what you want to do. If you want to [comply with the rules], do it wholeheartedly”. Additional Solicitor-General Chetan Sharma, appearing for the Centre, had said Twitter was acting in “abject non-compliance of the rules” as the CCO cannot be a contingent worker. Earlier, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology had stated that despite three months time granted to all Significant Social Media Intermediaries (SSMIs) to comply with the Information Technology (IT) Rules, 2021, Twitter has failed to fully comply with the same. It had said that Twitter failed to comply with India’s law regulating tech companies rendering services as ‘intermediaries’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/officers-appointed-according-to-it-rules-twitter-tells-delhi-hc/article35779027.ece
07 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Nearly 58 lakh vaccine doses administered in last 24 hours’||Nearly 58 lakh COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered in the last 24 hours, with more than 2.3 crore balance and unutilised doses still available with the States and Union Territories, and private hospitals, to be administered, noted a Health Ministry press release issued on Friday. Speaking on the vaccination drive across the Southeast Asia region, Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, World Health Organization (WHO), said countries across the region were making unprecedented efforts to reach more and more people with life-saving COVID-19 vaccines, demonstrating their commitment to containing the pandemic at the earliest. “We must continue these and also, stringently implement public health and social measures,” she said. More than half a billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the WHO South-East Asia Region, with more vaccine doses becoming available and countries scaling up efforts to rapidly expand coverage amid a recurrent surge in cases, noted a release issued by the WHO. “Vaccines are an important tool in our fight against the pandemic as they are effective, even against Variants of Concern [VOC], in preventing severe disease, hospitalisation and death,” Dr. Singh said. As of August 6, 618.5 million doses have been administered. As many as 146 million people have received two vaccine doses and are fully vaccinated. The maximum — 489 million doses — have been administered in India, which reached 8.6 million people on Day 1 of its reinvigorated campaign in June, the release said. “With more doses available in recent weeks through COVAX, all possible efforts need to be made to expand COVID-19 vaccination coverage even further,” Dr. Singh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nearly-58-lakh-vaccine-doses-administered-in-last-24-hours/article35779034.ece
07 August 2021||Chennai,||Railways to ensure calls on landline phones are attended||The Ministry of Railways has directed General Managers of all Zonal Railways, Production Units and other establishments across the country to update the online telephone directory regularly and make sure that calls made to landline numbers are attended properly. The advisory issued a couple of days ago follows an order of the Central Information Commission directing the Railway Board that landline numbers provided in the public domain should be attended properly. The case arises out of a petition filed by Anil Kumar Jain, who wrote to the Director (Telecom), Ministry of Railways, seeking to know under the Right to Information Act whether the Closed User Group (CUG) bills of mobile phone numbers used by the Chairman, Railway Board; Personal Assistant (PA) to the Minister for Railways; PA to the Minister of State for Railways; Member, Traffic; Director, Coaching; and others, were paid from the public account, and also called for details of the numbers. CUG bills Responding to his plea, the Public Information Officer, Railway Board, replied that CUG bills were being paid from the public account of the Ministry of Railways. He said that Section 4(1)(b)(ix) of the Act required every public authority to publish a directory of its officers and employees. In compliance with this provision, the Ministry had displayed contact details of the Chairman, Railway Board, and others, on the online telephone directory athttp://dir.railnet.gov.in. Appeal filed However, not satisfied with the reply, Mr. Jain filed an appeal saying that he was not provided with complete information and the updated online telephone directory only displayed landline numbers and not the CUG numbers. The Central Information Commission noted that an appropriate reply had been provided to the petitioner and advised the Railways to make sure that the landline telephone numbers in the public domain were attended to properly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/railways-to-ensure-calls-on-landline-phones-are-attended/article35779040.ece
07 August 2021||New Delhi,||Pegasus spyware matter is sub judice, says govt.||The Narendra Modi government has disallowed a question posed by Communist Party of India (CPI) MP Binoy Viswam seeking details on a possible Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the government and Israeli cybersecurity firm NSO Group to deal with terrorist activity, citing that the matter is sub judice . Reports by the Pegasus Project, an international consortium of media organisations, have revealed that phones of politicians journalists, activists, Supreme Court officials, among others, were infected with the Pegasus spyware, a military-grade software that is sold by the NSO group only to governments. So far, the government has neither denied nor confirmed purchasing the software. Mr. Viswam said, “I had asked three questions to the Ministry of External Affairs — the number of MoUs the government has entered into with foreign companies, the details sector-wise; (b) whether any of these MoU’s with foreign companies has been in order to curb terror activities through cybersecurity, the details of the same; and (c) whether the government has entered into an MoU with NSO Group in order to curb terror activities through cybersecurity across the nation, if so, provide details thereof.” He said the question was filed about two weeks back and was listed for August 12. He was informed that the question would not be admitted since the matter was already in the Supreme Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pegasus-spyware-matter-is-sub-judice-says-govt/article35779008.ece

The EPFO chief’s office also elaborated on its reliance on IT-enabled systems to validate members’ identities and process claims with “adequate checks and balances”. While it did not dispute The Hindu’s question about Rs. 37 crore of the EPFO corpus being siphoned out, the CPFC’s office said: “The quantum of such withdrawals of frivolous credits from non-existent account is being ascertained.”“Suitable administrative and criminal action has been initiated against such unscrupulous officials/persons and necessary action initiated for recovery of the withdrawals of frivolous credits,” it added. “Considering the sensitivity of the issue involved, any publication which may lead to panic amongst the EPF subscribers may please be avoided since most of them are in low-income group,” Mr. Barthwal’s office added. “Certain instances have been reported in past where fraud has been committed in connivance either with staff from EPFO or outsiders,” Regional PF Commissioner Ganesh Kumar of a zonal EPF office in Mumbai said in an advisory dated July 29, adding that senior officers must remain vigilant about their sections and conduct ‘surprise checks’. To prevent a recurrence of such frauds, no staff should have overlapping roles at different stages of the claim settlement process, and strict action must be taken if any staffer is found using others’ user id and password, the advisory had suggested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rs-37-cr-of-pf-savings-withdrawn-illegally/article35779009.ece
07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||SC backs Amazon against Future-Reliance merger||Senior advocate Harish Salve had argued that the EA, which functions under the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, is ”‘a foreigner to the Indian Arbitration Act”. He contended that Amazon, represented by senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, by urging to enforce the EA award, was trying to “fit a square peg in a round hole”. Mr. Subramaniam, on the other hand, had argued that the EA award can never be characterised as a nullity and ignored. It must be obeyed, he had contended. Justice Nariman upheld the validity of the EA award. The judgment laid down that the award is “exactly like an order of an arbitral tribunal” contemplated under Section 17 of the 1996 Act. Hence, an award by the EA was like an order under Section 17(1) (interim measures ordered by an arbitral tribunal) of the Act. Besides, Justice Nariman observed that a party (FRL) “cannot be heard to say, after it participates in an Emergency Award proceeding, that it will not be bound by an Emergency Arbitrator’s ruling”. It further held that the order passed by a Single Judge of the Delhi High Court to enforce the award was not appealable. “No appeal would lie under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act against an order of enforcement of an Emergency Arbitrator’s order made under Section 17(2) of the Act,” Justice Nariman wrote. With this, the court upheld the orders of the Single Judge to FRL to maintain ‘status quo’ on the sale of its retail assets to Reliance. The Single Judge twice upheld the EA award. On February 2, the judge restrained the continuation of the FRL-Reliance Retail deal. Again, on March 18, the judge passed a detailed judgment upholding the validity of the EA award under the Arbitration Act. Both the orders were stayed by a Division Bench successively on February 8 and March 22. Following this to and fro, the Supreme Court had stayed the proceedings in the High Court on April 19 and decided to hear the case by itself. “The judgments of the Division Bench, dated February 8 and March 22, are set aside,” Justice Nariman ordered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-backs-amazon-against-future-reliance-merger/article35779010.ece

Chidambaram on Friday welcomed the Union government’s move to amend the taxation laws and nullify the provisions for retrospective taxation. However, Congress Lok Sabha member Manish Tewari’s tweet on the issue exposed the fault lines within the party. ‘Put an end’ “On the withdrawal of the Retrospective Tax (Vodafone), I am glad that we have put an end to an issue that has been troubling us for 8 years,” Mr. Chidambaram tweeted moments after the Lok Sabha passed the Bill with a voice vote. On Thursday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which would allow the government to drop any tax demands made on any transaction before May 2012 or return any tax already collected, but without any interest payments. Taking to Twitter, Mr. Tewari said, “Because NDA/BJP made a complete hash of defending its case qua @CairnEnergy in arbitral tribunal does not mean you give up sovereign right to Tax retrospectively.” The retrospective clause was brought in by the late Pranab Mukherjee as the Finance Minister after the Supreme Court, in an order, held that Vodafone could not be taxed for a 2007 transaction involving its acquisition of 67% stake in Hutchinson Whampoa for $11 billion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chidambaram-welcomes-amendment-to-tax-laws/article35779014.ece
07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||CBI, police ignoring judges’ complaints: SC||The court suggested the formation of a special force to protect judges, especially trial judges who decide criminal cases involving high-profile accused. “We have seen that in criminal cases involving high-profile people, there is a new trend of maligning judges. There is no freedom for judges to work. The CBI, the police, the IB do not help the judiciary...,” Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana said. “I am making this statement with some sense of responsibility... In several cases across the country involving gangsters and high-profile and powerful accused, they threaten judges, not just physically but also mentally through abusive messages, peeping into judges’ online accounts, etc. We are very sorry to say that the CBI did nothing about complaints made to it... There is still no change in its attitude,” CJI N.V. Ramana said. Attorney General K.K. Venugopal, who was asked to assist the court, related an incident of a magistrate who was threatened on the eve of taking up a case against some gangsters. “His daughter’s life was threatened. So, given a choice between his daughter’s life and doing justice, he adjourned the case... Judges as a class are more vulnerable, say, than bureaucrats,” Mr. Venugopal said. The court asked whether Jharkhand had “washed its hands of” any responsibility of investigating the daylight murder of judge Uttam Anand by transferring the case to the CBI. The court said the death was a result of the State government’s “negligence” to protect its judges. The CJI said the State government chose to ignore threats to judges like Mr. Anand, who was working in Dhanbad district, where the powerful coal mafia reigns. Mr. Venugopal said the frequent attack on judges highlighted the need for the formation of a special body to protect the judiciary and ascertain the danger to them. On Judge Anand’s death, the court directed the CBI to be represented on Monday. “We want to hear the CBI,” the Chief Justice said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbi-police-ignoring-judges-complaints-sc/article35779015.ece

Mr. Prabhunath was the Controller of Examination, according to the First Information Report. The CBI had initiated a preliminary enquiry into the allegation in February 2019. It is alleged that Mr. Prabhunath and other officials accepted representations of some candidates even after the last date and some candidates were allowed to change their computer certificates. The agency has also alleged recklessness in the evaluation and scrutiny of answer sheets. According to the probe agency, some unknown Commission officials were involved at various stages of the examination and evaluation process from 2010 to 2017 and that experts were not involved, due to which several deserving candidates were left out. ßIn some cases, computer certificates of the candidates were found to be forged, but they were declared qualified.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbi-books-former-top-official-of-up/article35779017.ece

07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Karma phala data||In the Devi Bhagavata Purana, Vyasa further explains about the workings of karma to Janamejaya, and says that none but the omniscient Lord can officiate as a judge in the lives of all mortal beings as He is the sole ‘karma phala data.’ It is shown that the prime effect of karma is janma by which the jiva exhausts past karma, and since karma is not easily exhausted, the jiva is born repeatedly in samsara, pointed out Sri K. Srinivasan in a discourse. Sometimes a single birth or many births would be needed to exhaust even a single karma, for it depends on the type of karma and the corresponding fruits. Also, it is not that karma phala is experienced in accordance to the chronological order in which the karmas are done and these experiences may pertain to this world or to other lokas also. Some are born rich while some are poor; while some are born with congenital defects, and so on. One may have a sound mind, intellect and well-functioning sense organs but yet cannot know what karma is responsible for his present state. These disparities are all owing to the jiva’s past karma about which only God is aware. Based on all these factors God decides the kind of birth for every jiva. Even at the laukika level, the judge dealing with offence and punishment is bound with a certain amount of freedom and responsibility. He does not allot punishment purely on the basis of the code of laws. He evaluates the crime and the offender from various angles. Is it a first time offence? What was the motive? Does the person need time for reforming? At the spiritual level, God, as the ‘karma phala data’ for all mortals, meticulously allots the reward and punishment for each one’s merits without prejudice in this never ending cycle of samsara.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/karma-phala-data/article35779036.ece

The agency searched the office premises of Novus Path Labs, DNA Labs, Max Corporate Services, Dr. Lal Chandani Labs Private Limited and Nalwa Laboratories Private Limited. The residential premises of their directors were also searched in Dehradun, Haridwar, Delhi, Noida and Hisar. The ED has initiated money laundering investigation on the basis of a First Information Report registered by Uttarakhand police. “During the money laundering investigation, it was revealed that the said laboratories were given the contract by the Uttarakhand government for conducting Rapid Antigen Test/RT-PCR tests for COVID during the Kumbh Mela this year,” said the agency. It is alleged that these laboratories barely carried out any tests. They made fake entries and raised bogus bills in order to earn illegal financial gains, as alleged. “An amount of Rs. 3.40 crore has already been received by them from the Uttarakhand government as part payment,” said the ED. The accused made multiple entries against mobile numbers and addresses to inflate the data. The tests were shown to have been conducted on persons who had never visited the Kumbh Mela. Positivity rate “Due to false negative testing by these labs, positivity rate of Hardwar at that time was shown at 0.18% against the actual 5.3%,” the ED said. During the ongoing searches, the agency has so far seized bogus bills, laptops, mobile phones and property documents, apart from cash.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-conducts-raids-in-fake-covid-testing-case-during-kumbh-mela/article35779300.ece

According to police, Karuppaiah had gone to Palani’s house to bring back his daughter, Madubala. However, the girl refused to go with her parents and said that she wanted to marry Kaleeswaran.

07 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC frowns upon Registry for attempting to discharge judicial functions||The Madras High Court on Friday frowned upon its own Registry for attempting to discharge judicial functions by segregating connected cases and listing one set of those cases before a Division Bench and the other before a single judge. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu directed the Registrar General to ensure that the staff at the Registry are made aware of the elementary principles. Training programme The judges said a training programme could be conducted for them at the Tamil Nadu State Judicial Academy, as early as possible, so such mistakes are not repeated. The orders were passed when it was brought to the notice of the court that a batch of writ petitions were filed in the court challenging the validity of Section 462 of the Companies Act of 2013, which empowers the Centre to issue notifications stating that certain provisions of the law will not be applicable to a class or classes of companies. The petitioners had also challenged a notification issued by the Centre in 2017, in exercise of its powers under Section 462, and also a few connected orders issued by the Centre under sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act. The Registry segregated those cases and listed the challenge to Section 462 and the 2017 notification before a Division Bench and the other cases before a single judge. “This was utterly ridiculous and completely devoid of any element of sense... A statutory provision or a rule may not be challenged in vacuum without there being a sequitur thereto. Courts do not take up provisions of statute and academically decide on the validity thereof without first ascertaining the relevance of such a decision in the context of the lis [dispute],” the first Division Bench wrote. Authoring the order, the Chief Justice went on to state, “The Registry should restrain itself and not delve into judicial acts or require the ridiculous separation of the immediate challenge from the challenge to the validity of any statutory provision or rule.” “ There have also been instances recently in this court where the matter has been disposed of, but the legal issue has been referred to a larger Bench, which is equally fallacious because the answer to the reference cannot be applied to any matter and no reference may be taken up for any academic purpose,” the Chief Justice added. The first Bench took exception to the arbitrators and arbitral tribunals being needlessly impleaded as respondents whenever orders or awards passed by adjudicating bodies or arbitrators were put to challenge. “Unless allegations are levelled against the adjudicating authority qua the conduct of the adjudication or against an arbitrator or the arbitral tribunal on grounds of personal misconduct, adjudicating authorities and arbitrators or arbitral tribunals are utterly unnecessary and imminently avoidable,” the Bench said. The Bench ordered that the Registry should insist on striking off unnecessary parties.  This was utterly ridiculous and completely devoid of any element of sense...

07 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Metro Rail will lease trains for a section of phase II||For the first time, the Metro Rail will be leasing trains for a section of the phase II project, whose work has recently started. In the phase I and phase I extension projects, Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) had floated tenders and acquired trains which were manufactured by Alstom, a French firm. While a few were built in Sao Paolo, Brazil, a majority of them were commissioned from Sri City near the city. But for the phase II project, they had to go in for leasing trains because they had to cut down on the capital cost of the project, sources said. Initially, the cost estimates for the project, which covers 118.9 km, was touching as much as Rs. 88,000 crore and subsequently, after a constant push from the Centre on the high cost and the need to bring it down substantially, CMRL trimmed the budget over a period of time. The final cost now stands at Rs. 61,843 crore. Sources said as part of the exercise to decrease the cost, one of the ideas being considered was to lease trains instead of purchasing them. According to officials of CMRL, they have now sought expression of interest (EOI) from firms to provide 42 trains — all three coach units — on lease. This is just to look at how many companies are willing to invest in this leasing project, and how much they will charge for maintenance, a source said. The lease will be for 39 years. “While the capital cost can be done away with, the actual expenditure, and a rather hefty one at that, may come when CMRL begins paying the operating and rental cost later when services begin,” an official said. Based on the response to the EOI, CMRL will call for tenders to award contracts for manufacturing trains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/metro-rail-will-lease-trains-for-a-section-of-phase-ii/article35779405.ece
07 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Power agencies told to pay relief for curtailing solar units||The Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (Aptel) has directed Tangedco and the Tamil Nadu State Load Despatch Centre to jointly pay compensation to solar energy developers for curtailment of generation from March 1 to June 30, 2017. The tribunal had asked the Power System Operation Corporation Ltd. (POSOCO) to prepare a report on the issue. Based on the report, it concluded that the curtailment instructions were issued for reasons other than grid security and fixed the compensation at 75% of the tariff per unit as per the power purchase agreements. The order was delivered on an appeal filed by the National Solar Energy Federation of India, a non-profit organisation. The federation had moved the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) and sought compensation for the capacity which could not be utilised and power supplied due to backing down instructions. Plea rejected The TNERC rejected the plea, saying there was no provision for it in the power purchase agreements. The tribunal agreed with the TNERC’s view that that there was no provision for compensation in the power purchase agreements. However, it said the back down instructions were issued for commercial reasons, which was evident from the finding in the POSOCO report that the solar generators with per unit cost of Rs. 7.01 were curtailed more. Arbitrary curtailment resulted in solar generators failing to repay their loans, and thus they were entitled to compensation. The tribunal directed POSOCO to conduct a similar exercise till October 31, 2020, and submit a report to the TNERC within three months. The TNERC was asked to allow compensation for the backed down energy at the rate of 75% of the tariff fixed in the power purchase agreement, after considering the curtailment quantum based on the POSOCO report. The compensation for the entire period would be paid along with 9% interest, the tribunal said. It said for curtailment of renewable energy for reasons other than grid security, a compensation at tariff per unit as per the power purchase agreement would be paid in future based on the report from the POSOCO. This methodology would be adopted till such time the Forum of Regulators or the Union government formulates guidelines in relation to curtailment of renewable energy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/power-agencies-told-to-pay-for-curtailing-solar-units/article35779431.ece
07 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Commuters protest at Ponneri railway station||Suburban train services on the Gummidipoondi section were disrupted for more than three hours after a large number of commuters demanding operation of additional services began protesting during peak hours in the morning on Friday. They were agitated by the Southern Railway operating few services, especially during the morning and evening peak hours on the north Chennai section. S. Purushothaman, a resident of Kanniga Nagar in Ponneri, said north Chennai, despite having a large working class population, had poor public transport facilities, lacking sufficient Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses and suburban train services. Particularly after the lockdown, residents have been facing severe hardships to reach their workplaces in the city and so they depend more on suburban trains as the ticket fares in buses are costly. In this situation, the Southern Railway had been operating limited workmen special trains. On Friday, commuters gathered together and organised a protest to highlight their grievances. Adding to their woes was the “cancellation” of train services due to track development work being carried out on the section. Officials give assurance A senior official of Southern Railway said the agitation, which lasted for three hours from 9 a.m., was finally withdrawn after officials, including the Additional Divisional Railway Manager, rushed to the Ponneri railway station and assured the protesters that train services would be increased. More than six trains towards the Central railway station and three trains towards Gudur were affected by the agitation. A few express trains were also delayed for a few hours during the agitation, he added. Currently, Southern Railway operates a total of 90 workmen specials on the Chennai-Gummidipoondi section, with services available every 20 to 30 minutes during peak hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/commuters-protest-at-ponneri-railway-station/article35779407.ece
07 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Three persons killed in road accidents around the city||Three persons were killed on Thursday night in three separate incidents around the city. Munusamy, 54, of Gummidipoondi, who worked as a lineman in Tangedco, was returning home on his two-wheeler on Thursday, when a truck ran over him. The police said the lorry driver did not notice Munusamy taking a turn. He was declared dead on arrival at the Gummidipoondi Government Hospital. The police registered a case and arrested the driver. Crushed to death In another accident, Sivakumar, a truck driver from Tambaram working in a private stone quarry, was killed. On Thursday evening, he had taken a load of gravel from the quarry to a crusher unit in Thiruneermalai. The police said he had parked the truck, and was talking over the phone standing near a tree. An earthmover, which was returning from the quarry, crushed him to death. The traffic investigation police, Chromepet, arrested Rajasekaran, the driver of the earthmover. Run over by car On Thursday, Subramani, 60, a daily wage labourer from Thiruninravur, was travelling home in an autorickshaw. When the vehicle was on the Thiruninravur-Poonamallee High Road, a car rammed it from the rear. In the impact, Subramani fell out of the autorickshaw and the car ran over him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/three-persons-killed-in-road-accidents-around-the-city/article35779408.ece
07 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Floods in the Adyar can be reduced by regulating reservoir operation, finds study||The Northeast monsoon is just a few months away and the storage in city reservoirs that meet drinking water needs is on a steady rise. A study by the Department of Geology, Anna University, suggests that flood peaks in the Adyar can be reduced up to 38% with controlled reservoir operation and water release during extreme weather events. The combined storage in five reservoirs has touched nearly 69% of their capacity of 11.75 tmc ft as on Friday. About 700 cusecs of Krishna water enter the State through the Kandaleru-Poondi canal. Since July 1, nearly 2.08 tmc ft of Krishna water has been added to the storage at Poondi reservoir. The study by the Department of Geology has come up with a box model approach that suggested that maintaining different initial water levels between 50% to 75% before receiving the heavy inflow during the monsoon and releasing water accordingly would reduce the flood peaks in the river from 13% to 38%. L. Elango, professor, Department of Geology, said the enhanced box model was integrated with the hydrological modelling system and the HEC-river analysis system to assess the performance of the Chembarambakkam reservoir with data from the 2015 floods. “We developed a step function to improve the box model to define a target storage at the end of such weather events. This is to ensure that the reservoir would have enough water for supply after monsoon,” Prof. Elango said. Titled “Integrated modelling of rainfall-runoff process and reservoir operation for balancing water supply and flood mitigation — a case study from Chennai”, the study was published in the Journal of Earth System of Science . Based on the inputs such as rainfall forecast, storage in the reservoir, inflow and the evaporation of flow, the model simulated different reservoir operation scenarios to balance both the water supply and to decrease flood. P. Anandharuban, a research fellow who authored the study, said, “We worked out scenarios for discharge of surplus water on an hourly basis based on rain forecasts and inflow. It is possible to reduce the inundation area by 4.71 sq km and the storage of the reservoir can be maintained at 81.5% to provide water supply if the initial water level is maintained at 50%.” He recalled that about 81,400 cusecs flowed in the Adyar during the 2015 floods at the Thiruneermalai confluence point. With the study’s suggestions, flood peak flow can be decreased to 49,910 cusecs during similar events. The study suggested that additional storage capacity and an accurate inflow forecast system would help in better reservoir operations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/regulated-reservoir-operation-can-reduce-floods-in-the-adyar/article35779417.ece
07 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Climate change is a key problem facing humanity, says Chief Minister||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin said on Friday that the Tamil Nadu government recognised climate change as a very important issue facing humanity and urged environmentalists to suggest ideas for the government to tackle the problem. He was addressing the inaugural session of an international conference on ‘Ensuring food and nutrition security in the context of climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic’ at M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) here on Friday. He said that every day, the impact of climate change was being felt increasingly. Monsoons had become difficult to predict, and there were reports that a few places in the world were reaching wet-bulb temperatures, beyond which the human body would lose the ability to cool itself. Mr. Stalin said the government was keen on taking measures to tackle climate change and protect nature and was ready to take all suggestions from environmentalists with an open mind. He said the government was committed to making the State self-sufficient in food production, increasing the spread of agricultural land and making agriculture profitable. He listed the measures being planned, including a budget for farming, special focus on organic farming, forming of village markets, and regulating groundwater usage. He said MSSRF founder M.S. Swaminathan had made the State proud. Wishing him for his 96th birthday falling on Saturday, Mr. Stalin said he was looking forward to participating in Prof. Swaminathan’s 100th birthday celebrations. He recalled how late Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi readily agreed to allot land and provide all support when Prof. Swaminathan, accompanied by the Director of The Hindu Group Publishing Pvt. Ltd., N. Ram, met him in 1989 with the idea of opening MSSRF. Mr. Ram commended the State government for its approach to governance. Rooted in the values of rationalism, science and social justice, Mr. Stalin’s government had set its priorities with clear sight. He highlighted how the government had assembled world-class expertise to advise it on developing the economy around the core of social justice. Prof. Swaminathan recollected Karunanidhi’s contributions and the importance he gave to science and technology, particularly their use in agriculture. The present government was carrying on in that tradition, he said, complimenting Mr. Stalin on his efforts to make the State progressive in agriculture. He said farmer-centric agriculture, with adequate scientific support and assured and remunerative marketing facilities, was the need of the hour. Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist, World Health Organization, lauded the State for launching ‘Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam’. She said it was an important step towards ensuring universal health coverage. MSSRF chairperson Madhura Swaminathan said 40 experts and 1,200 people from 13 countries were participating in the conference, and the policy recommendations coming out of it would be shared with the State and Central governments. MSSRF executive director K.S. Murali presented the annual report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/climate-change-a-key-issue-facing-humanity/article35779420.ece
07 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK goes all out to strengthen base in western T.N.||The ruling DMK is pulling out all the stops to strengthen its organisation in the western region of Tamil Nadu, where the AIADMK continues to call the shots and the BJP is trying to expand its reach. The region contributed immensely to the AIADMK’s victory in 2011 and 2016; even in 2021, when the election was held without AIADMK leader Jayalalithaa, it defied the DMK’s efforts to break through. Of the 68 seats in the Kongu region, the DMK was able to win just 24, after a sweeping victory in the Lok Sabha election two years ago. “The trend will change in the coming elections,” said Thoppu N.D. Venkatachalam, former AIADMK Minister who recently joined the DMK. Former AIADMK leader and Minister S. Muthusamy, of Erode, who joined the DMK a decade ago, is now the Housing Minister. The DMK also took in R. Mahendran, former vice-president of the MNM, a well-known face in the region. P. Palaniappan, a key leader of the AMMK and former AIADMK Minister, has also been inducted into the party to boost its prospects in Dharmapuri. Mr. Venkatachalam attributed the AIADMK’s victory to its strong presence in grass-root organisations such as local bodies, co-operatives and weavers’ societies. “Unlike the MLAs and the MPs, the elected representatives of the local bodies and the co-operative societies maintain a good rapport with the voters. When they enter the campaign, they are able to sway the votes in favour of the AIADMK,” he felt. DMK sources said the party lost its base after leaders such as M. Kannappan, A. Ganesamoorthy and Tiruppur Duraisamy, having ideological commitment and good standing in the local community, joined the MDMK launched by Vaiko. “It paved the way for the emergence of leaders known for loyalty and not any organisational and intellectual calibre,” the sources said. Mr. Venkatachalam agreed that the Kongu region voted overwhelmingly for the AIADMK because of its natural affinity with Jayalalithaa and the party having projected Edappadi K. Palaniswami, a leader from the region, as the chief ministerial candidate. Though a socially and economically powerful community, the Gounders had to wait for decades to get the post for Mr. Palaniswami, after K. Subbarayan, the former premier of Madras Presidency. The appointment of former IPS officer Annamalai as the BJP president in the State is seen as a counter to the DMK’s efforts to woo the region. “Since the days of the Chola Empire, the Kongu region was highly ‘Sanskritised’. Though the trend changed and the region produced pioneers of the Dravidian movement, their achievement and the DMK government’s contributions to the region were not properly propagated,” said Karthikeya Sivasenapathy, a party leader who lost to former Minister S.P. Velumani in Thondamuthur. He said the backward caste status granted to Gounders by the Karunanidhi government and the irrigation projects it initiated and other factors contributed to the development of the region in education, agriculture and industry. “There is a cluster industry every 20 km. But there is a disconnect between the party and the people. We need a full-time leader in Coimbatore who will act as a bridge between people and the government and offer help when it comes to government schemes,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-goes-all-out-to-strengthen-base-in-western-tn/article35779437.ece
07 August 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Court proceedings against Minister, 3 others quashed||The proceedings in a job scam against Electricity Minister V. Senthilbalaji and three others have been quashed by the Madras High Court. Counsel for the co-accused submitted this before an additional special court for the trial of cases related to Members of Parliament and Members of the Legislative Assembly on Friday. Police sources said this was one of the three criminal cases pending against Mr. Senthilbalaji, filed by the AIADMK government for his alleged involvement in job scams. Mr. Senthilbalaji was the Transport Minister in the AIADMK government from 2011 to 2015. The case relates to a complaint filed by Arul Mani, who claims to be employed with the Metropolitan Transport Corporation, alleging that he gave Rs. 40 lakh, collected from various people, to Mr. Senthilbalaji’s associates at his house. The complainant said the money was collected on the assurance that the people would be employed in the Transport Corporation. The Minister and his associates failed to provide jobs as promised. The case was registered by the Central Crime Branch, Job Racket, in 2018, under various Sections of the IPC. The chargesheet was also filed, naming Mr. Balaji and three others — Ashok Kumar, Shanmugam and Raj Kumar alias Jayarajkumar. The case was adjourned by the special court to Friday for serving copies of the chargesheet to the accused. When the matter came up for hearing, the counsel for three people, including Mr. Senthilbalaji, filed a petition seeking to dispense with personal appearances. Mr. Shanmugam was present. Counsel for the accused filed a memo stating that the High Court had quashed the proceedings 10 days ago. The court then directed them to produce the order’s copy on August 19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/court-proceedings-against-minister-3-others-quashed/article35779443.ece
07 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State legislature has equal authority to repeal a statute as it has to enact it, says HC||The Madras High Court on Friday disposed of a public interest litigation petition filed by former Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam of the AIADMK, seeking allocation of funds for smooth functioning of the Dr. J. Jayalalithaa University in Villupuram, since the incumbent DMK government had decided to repeal a law enacted in February this year for establishment of the varsity. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy recorded the submission of Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram that the Higher Education Department had issued a Government Order (G.O.) on August 3 expressing its intention to repeal Dr. J. Jayalalithaa University Act, 2021, enacted during the fag end of the previous tenure of the AIADMK government. “There is no doubt that the State legislature has equal authority to repeal a statute as it has to enact a statute in respect of matters falling within its legislative domain,” the judges said. They, however, added that as long as the law continues to be in force and its operation had not been stayed by any court, the provisions of the statute need to be followed scrupulously. Therefore, the Bench quashed a notification issued by Thiruvalluvar University on June 25 inviting applications for postgraduate courses from students in Kallakurichi, Villupuram and Cuddalore districts, which fall within the jurisdiction of Dr. J. Jayalalithaa University. It also set aside all steps that had been taken by Thiruvalluvar University to conduct those courses at its extension centre in Villupuram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-legislature-has-equal-authority-to-repeal-a-statute-hc/article35779423.ece

Jagannathan, chairman of TTK Prestige, has contributed Rs. 10 crore to his alma mater, the Indian Institute of Technology- Madras, to establish an endowment for research work. A graduate of the 1970 Mechanical Engineering batch, Mr. Jagannathan won the gold medal that year for his academic performance. He turned around his family business, the TTK group. The Institute has named an auditorium after him to commemorate his contribution to the world of business. Mr. Jagannathan, who commissioned the eponymous auditorium on Friday, said he had the highest regard for the institution where he enjoyed many rewarding years. “My donation is a small way to repay IIT-M for all that it has given me,” he said and added that he was humbled and grateful that the institute had named the auditorium after him. Institute director Bhaskar Ramamurthi said Mr. Jagannathan “is a role model for our students and budding entrepreneurs”. Shanthi Ranganathan, founder of T.T. Ranganathan Clinical Research Foundation, said the family had a tradition of philanthropy in the areas of health and education long before the concept of corporate social responsibility came into being. Mr. Jagannathan won the IIT-M’s distinguished alumnus award in 1996.

07 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Governor has powers to release Rajiv case convicts: Ramadoss||PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Friday said the Supreme Court has shown a new path for the State government on the issue of releasing seven persons convicted in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in Tamil Nadu several decades ago. Dr. Ramadoss said that Chief Minister M.K. Stalin should immediately call a meeting of the Council of Ministers and pass a resolution recommending the release of seven convicts and send it to Governor Banwarilal Purohit. In a statement, Dr. Ramadoss said the Supreme Court had said that prisoners who are serving life sentences can be released by the Governor should the State Cabinet recommend it. “This verdict has been given by the Supreme Court in the case of releasing a prisoner serving life sentence in Haryana before completing a 14-year sentence,” he said. “This verdict has given a new light to the release of seven Tamils, including Perarivalan (in the Rajiv Gandhi Assassination case),” Dr. Ramadoss said, and added that the recent Supreme Court verdict had shown that the Governor’s decision to refer this matter to the President after a resolution was passed by the State Cabinet in September 2018, then headed by Edappadi K. Palaniswami. He referred to another judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in September 2018, which said that the Governor had the powers vested in him through Article 161 of the Constitution to release Perarivalan who has spent 31 years in jail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/governor-has-powers-to-release-rajiv-case-convicts-ramadoss/article35779449.ece
07 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Cornea donations greatly reduced because of pandemic, finds study||A multi-centre study of corneal donations in Aravind Eye Hospital found that during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the number of donations had fallen drastically. This hurt patients who required corneal transplant to heal ulcers. Some of them have lost their sight permanently. The study ‘Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on infectious Keratitis Outcomes: A Retrospective Multi-center Study in Tertiary Eye Hospitals of South India’, published in a peer-reviewed journal Cornea ,  found that the delay in presentation and acute shortage of donor corneal tissues for emergency keratoplasty because of the pandemic had resulted in irreversible blindness in a significant number of patients. The study that pertained to the five centres of Aravind Eye Hospital found that from 1,265 corneal donations in 2016-17, it fell to 61 in 2020-21. Any injury to the eye could result in a whitish scar, leading to the cornea losing its transparency, and the person would require a corneal transplant. In India, an estimated 6.8 million people have unilateral blindness due to corneal diseases and around a million (14.5%) are blind in both eyes. Every year around 25,000 to 30,000 more suffer corneal blindness, said Josephine S. Christy, director of Aravind Eye Bank Association of Pondicherry and senior consultant, cornea and refractive services, Aravind Eye Hospital, Puducherry, and lead author of the study. The study was done during the first lockdown in 2020. “For almost two years, we are running short of cornea donors. There is another group of people who may have blindness due to corneal scars. They have been waiting for two, three years. For the past 18 months, we have not done a single transplant,” she said. “Since March 24, 2020, when we received notification from the Health and Family Welfare Ministry, we did not collect corneas and were drastically short. Even now, until we have a negative RT-PCR report, we are unable to harvest corneas as when deaths occur at home it is difficult to get negative results,” Dr. Christy explained. “We took data from all five centres of patients, who had corneal ulcers and lost their sight for want of donors. We found that 20%-25% have permanently gone blind. These are people who came to the hospital for treatment, but there were many more who were not able to come due to travel restrictions,” she said. In previous years, less than 2% of people would became blind permanently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cornea-donations-greatly-reduced-because-of-pandemic-finds-study/article35779412.ece
07 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||The number of tests increasing, says Health Minister||Though the daily difference in COVID-19 case count swings between 30 and 50, Tamil Nadu’s positivity rate remains at 1.2%, Health Minister Ma. Subramanian said on Friday. “The number of tests that is being conducted is increasing. On Thursday, we conducted nearly 1.58 lakh RT-PCR tests. In India, over 1.5 lakh tests are conducted only in Tamil Nadu. So we have variations in cases by 30 to 40 every day... but the positivity rate remains under control at 1.2%. Several measures are being taken to reduce cases further,” he told mediapersons. He added that people entering the State from Kerala by trains would be tested at railway stations. Tests would be conducted at stations where trains from Kerala have stoppages, he said. Asked about the number of people who had received both doses of the vaccines, he said of the State’s total coverage of nearly 2.5 crore, up to 60 lakh people had been fully vaccinated. “So far, the State government has received 2,28,01,650 doses, of which 2,26,01,212 have been administered. We have 8,26,560 doses in hand as of last night, and are expecting another 3.3 lakh doses of Covishield today. So we will have nearly 11 lakh doses that will be sufficient for two to three days,” he said. Following the State government’s initiative to make free vaccinations available in private hospitals through CSR funds, he said the private sector had received 20,38,680 doses so far, of which 16,34,959 had been administered, leaving a stock of 4,03,721 in hand. “In total, we have administered 2,42,36,771 doses — first and second doses. We require 12 crore vaccine doses, and are nearing 2.5 crore doses. We need another 9.5 crore doses,” he said. Last month, the State received additional doses due to good performance, he said, adding, “If the Union government provides additional doses this month, we will be able to cross a coverage of 3.5 crore this month,” he said. Breastfeeding rooms On the lack of facilities in breastfeeding rooms opened at bus terminals by the previous government, he said the previous government started the rooms without basic facilities, including fans. “In two months, we will start breastfeeding rooms in all government hospitals and government medical college hospitals,” he said. Through the ‘Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam’ scheme, the government plans to screen 30 lakh families by the year-end. “We want to identify one crore people and provide appropriate treatment for diabetes and hypertension by the end of December. As of now, 20 lakh people diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension will receive medication at their doorstep,” he said. Mr. Subramanian and MLA J. Karunanithi donated a month’s salary for improving public health centres at an event to hand over a hepa filter by a donor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/swing-in-covid-19-daily-case-count-is-due-to-more-tests-says-health-minister/article35779435.ece

The hospital also plans to establish a 30-bed paediatric COVID-19 ward. R. Jayanthi, dean of the Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital, said the paediatric ICU had been established as a matter of preparedness for the anticipated third wave of COVID-19. Each bed is fully equipped with ventilators, high-flow nasal cannulas, biphasic defibrillator and multipara monitors. “We have pepped up the ambience with cartoon characters and artistic works,” she added. Dr. Jayanthi said presently, there was a small surge in fresh coronavirus infections. “From 60 to 70 in-patients, the number has crossed 100 now. We have a total of 950 beds of which 375 are ICU beds. To start with, we have set up a paediatric ICU with 15 beds. We are planning to have a 30-bed paediatric COVID-19 ward as well. Additional beds can be earmarked if the situation arises,” she also added. Reiterating that all these facilities were created only as part of preparing for any eventuality, she said, “Whether there is a third wave or not, prevention is ideal. Children can be protected if adults follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour such as masking, avoiding crowding, going out unnecessarily, hand washing and maintaining physical distancing. This is of paramount importance. Children should not venture out unnecessarily. Every adult in a family must be vaccinated,” she said. A special lactation lounge has also been set up at the hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-omandurar-hospital-sets-up-paediatric-icu/article35779415.ece

07 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai hospital does renal transplant across blood groups||A COVID-19 survivor recently underwent a rare renal transplant with a kidney from a donor who had a different blood group at a private hospital in the city. He is recovering well. The 29-year-old man with ‘B’ blood group received a kidney from a donor with ‘A’ blood group. R. Balasubramaniyam, chief nephrologist, Kauvery Hospital where the transplant was doine, said a kidney transplant predominantly involved donations among compatible blood groups. “If the transplant is performed with different blood groups, the antibodies present in the patient’s blood would react to the donor blood group antigens that are present not only on the red blood cells but also on the surface of all other cells, including those in the kidneys. The antibodies that are provoked may lead to rejection of the organ at the time of transplant leading to immediate failure (called hyper acute rejection),” Dr. Balasubramaniyam said. The hospital tried the ABO incompatible transplant by reducing antibodies in the blood through treatment before and after transplant. Since the patient had recently recovered from COVID-19, antibodies against SARS CoV-2 virus were naturally present in his blood. The challenge for doctors was to ensure that SARS CoV-2 antibodies were not lowered so that he did not become vulnerable to infection. They lowered blood group antibody through plasm-apheresis to protect the new organ. The patient was monitored and the transplant was done when the donor and the recipient were physically fit. The donor was discharged three days after the surgery while the recipient was discharged after being kept under observation for one more week. The patient was discharged a week later. “He is now leading a better quality of life,” Dr. Balasubramaniyam said. Aravindan Selvaraj, the hospital’s executive director, lauded the team of doctors for its effort.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/renal-transplant-across-blood-groups-performed/article35779409.ece

In a statement on Friday, Mr. Anbumani said he was saddened to see the entire Indian women’s hockey team in tears after losing to Great Britain. “They may have lost the match, but they have won the hearts of the Indians. There is no need to shed tears. Rather, they have made India proud,” he said. Mr. Anbumani pointed out that this was the first time the Indian women’s hockey team had reached the semifinals of the Olympic Games. “Not many would have known the pain and the hardwork that had gone into this achievement. While other teams had world class training facilities, the Indian team did not have it. They trained in local grounds under severe restrictions. Teams of other countries received several crore rupees in sponsorship deals, but the Indian team didn’t. While they got money from the Odisha government, it wasn’t enough to cover their basic expenses for the team to participate in the Olympics,” he said. “The team, led by Rani Rampal, had 8 players participating in their first Olympic games out of the total of 16 players. Also, the players were under mental distress because some people indulged in violence outside Vandana Katariya’s house. Despite all these hardships, the team defeated strong teams like Australia and went to the semifinals. This achievement should be etched in golden words in the history of women’s hockey in India,” he said. “Though you led in the first half against Great Britain, the game changed only in the end. There is no need to shed tears. The world is going to see all of you win the gold medal in the next Olympic Games and shed tears of joy. I would like to congratulate all of you for that now. I would like to present Rs. 10 lakh on behalf of Pattali Makkal Katchi,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pmk-leader-anbumani-announces-rs-10-lakh-prize-money-to-womens-hockey-team/article35779432.ece
07 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Corpn. must halt work on stormwater drains on ECR’||The Greater Chennai Corporation should not carry out any further work on the stormwater drain project on East Coast Road, except covering the protruding iron rods for the safety of residents, the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed. “More than that, in the guise of doing that [safety measure], they are not expected to do any other construction work, which require clearances under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification,” the bench said. The case relates to the Rs. 270 crore stormwater drain project being implemented by the Greater Chennai Corporation on East Coast Road that has been opposed by a section of the residents. The Advocate General informed the tribunal that after the stop work memo was issued, the Corporation halted construction of stormwater drains, though a major portion of the work was completed even before that. The Advocate General further added that the Corporation had only taken safety measures to avoid danger to the public owing to the protruding iron rods used for construction in the sites. The Corporation will also consider the recommendations made by the Joint Committee regarding the future action to be taken with respect to the project. Earlier this year, a Joint Committee appointed by the NGT, in its report, said there was no provision for obtaining ex-post-facto clearance and recommended action in the matter. However, the Superintending Engineer (south) of Metrowater shared a dissenting view that CRZ clearance was not required for the project since it was part of the infrastructure to be provided in the construction of roads since the project did not fall under CRZ 1A.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-must-halt-work-on-ecr-stormwater-drains-says-ngt/article35779411.ece

07 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Legislative council unnecessary, says Kamal||Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan on Friday said any attempt to revive the legislative council in Tamil Nadu would not be in sync with the times, and the State government should not pursue the idea. While the Assembly has a legislature where elected members are present and a number of advisory councils have been formed to advise the State government, there is no need for a legislative council, Mr. Haasan said. “The outdated council has been abolished by several States. It does not add any value or development to the lives of the people. At the same time, there is no benefit to the people of Tamil Nadu, except more expenditure for the State government,” Mr. Haasan said. In a press statement, the MNM founder explained, “At one point, leaders such as Rajaji [C. Rajagopalachari], Annadurai [C.N. Annadurai] and MGR [M.G. Ramachandran] were part of the council, and lively debates took place, but political interference reduced its dignity. When a bankrupt person was appointed to the council, a controversy erupted and then Chief Minister MGR abolished it.” Mr. Haasan said democratic forces must explain why revival of the council was unnecessary at this juncture, when Tamil Nadu’s financial situation was bad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/legislative-council-unnecessary-says-kamal/article35779446.ece

The insolvency petition was filed by Bank of India for non-payment of dues totalling Rs. 28.24 crore. In its petition, Bank of India said the company had three integrated sugar plants with a combined crushing capacity of 10,000 tonnes a day, a co-generation plant with a capacity to generate 35 MW of power and a distillery with a capacity of 160 kilo litres a day. Dharani Sugars had availed credit facilities from a consortium led by Bank of India for projects across Tamil Nadu. The account was declared a non-performing asset on October 31, 2018, and the dues had not been settled, Bank of India said. In its response, the company said sugar industry in the State had been facing major challenges because of the vagaries of monsoon and government policies. The NCLT said the consortium of lenders had not accepted the one-time settlement proposed by the company.

Karthigaivasan, general manager of District Industries Centre. The units that employed a large number of workers, such as ready made garments and foundries, were all following standard operating procedures. “We are able to trace contacts and isolate them if there are reports of COVID-19 positive cases,” he said. Further, there were pool testing and regular testing of workers at industries. With regard to vaccination, for every allotment of vaccine to the district, 1,000 doses were allotted to the industries. These were given to the industrial associations. “We have created a roster system among industry associations and distribute vaccines based on the roster,” he said. Regarding reports of a textile mill recently seeing a cluster of cases, he said that was a standalone case and there were not any other unit that reported such clusters. According to a source in the textile mill industry, migrant workers are reluctant to get vaccinated. The government should make vaccination mandatory for all industrial workers and work out a system to ensure all workers get the vaccination. It should also ensure that all workers wear masks and follow the SOPs. In a memorandum to the Finance Minister, the Coimbatore District Small Industries Association said COVID-19 vaccinations should be arranged immediately on priority for all the eligible persons through special campaigns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/focused-efforts-help-contain-covid-19-spread-in-industries/article35779465.ece

They would let out the water for about two to three hours and only thereafter start collecting the water. They would, however, not use the stored water for cooking or drinking but only bathing. This is because the Corporation had been supplying water contaminated with sewage, said M.I. Nizamudeen, a resident of Poonga Nagar Second Street. “The Corporation supplies water once a week or about 10 days. We wait for a couple of hours until the sewage is flushed out of the drinking water supply system to begin collecting it. And, the collected water is used only for bathing and that too after boiling it,” Mr. Nizamudeen said For cooking and drinking needs, the residents buy water cans. The residents took up the issue several times with the Corporation officials concerned. On two occasions the Corporation responded by sending workers to stop the contamination, but the relief was short lived, complained N.I. Jalaludeen, a resident and civic activist. “The workers came, dug a pit or two and after a few hours said they had arrested the contamination. But the relief was only till the next water supply,” he recalled. During the last supply on Thursday too Corporation supplied water contaminated with sewage, he said and added that the odour of the contaminated water was unbearable. After taking up once again with the Corporation on Thursday, the civic body had begun work to stop the contamination. Corporation engineers said initial investigation revealed that the contamination of the Pilloor water supplied to the area from the service reservoir (overhead tank) in Town Hall was elsewhere and not in the locality or happening at multiple places. A Corporation official said sewage from broken underground drainage pipelines was entering the drinking water pipeline through a leak or crack. The Corporation was looking at replacing the pipeline in the area under the 24x7 drinking water supply scheme. The residents said they wanted the Corporation to complete the work before the next cycle so that they could start getting clean water.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-begins-work-to-stop-sewage-mixing-with-water-in-poonga-nagar/article35779471.ece

They travel 2 km every day, and sit on the side of a road that passes through a reserve forest where connectivity is available to attend classes. Located in the Sathyamangalam Panchayat Union, Gundri panchayat is 94 km from Erode and 15 km from Kadambur by road, including a 9.5 km stretch that passes through the Guthiyalathur Reserve Forest in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR). There are about 1,800 households with over 6,200 people living there depending on agricultural land and working under the MGNREGS. Fifteen students from the panchayat travel on the forest road to a spot where network connectivity is available. “I have been attending classes from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily for the past five months sitting on a boulder,” said M. Jessy of Kovilur habitation, who is pursuing her final year B.Sc. Nursing at a college in Coimbatore. She said mobile signals were very weak in the area, and got disconnected frequently. “At least 20 to 35 times, I have to reconnect to attend the online classes,” she said. She takes a break from noon to 1 p.m. for lunch. “Once an elephant trumpeted, and a bear was seen along the road, after which I left for home,” she recalled, adding that despite her fears, she continued to pursue her studies. Class XII and college students also attend online classes every day. However, due to poor connectivity, they leave early. While there are over 250 students in Class XI, Class XII and higher education, only a few turn up at the spot to attend online classes. C. Devaraj of Chinna Gundri said only a few parents possessed smart phones and other students were unable to attend online classes. “Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, parents have refused to admit their children in schools and colleges from last year onwards,” he added. The existing BSNL tower with CDMA technology is outdated and has not been in use for the past 10 years. Sources said new equipment would cost Rs. 2.8 crore while cable-laying, labour and other expenses would come to about Rs. 40 lakh. Two private telecom companies recently inspected the panchayat, and are studying the feasibility of installing towers. M. Mahesh Madhesh, president of the panchayat, said representations had been made to the district administration demanding a mobile tower as the students were badly affected. V.P. Gunasekaran, State committee member, Tamil Nadu Tribal People Association, urged the State government to allot special funds to install a mobile tower in the panchayat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/students-travel-2-km-daily-sit-on-road-to-attend-online-class/article35779427.ece

07 August 2021||Erode,TAMIL NADU||Teenagers travel 2 km daily, sit on road to attend online class||For students living in 15 habitations of Gundri panchayat, a hilly area in Kadambur without internet connectivity, attending online classes is a major challenge. They travel 2 km every day, sit on the side of a road that passes through a reserve forest where connectivity is available, to attend classes. Located in the Sathyamangalam Panchayat Union, the Gundri panchayat is 94 km from Erode and 15 km from Kadambur by road, including a 9.5-km stretch that passes through the Guthiyalathur Reserve Forest in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR). There are about 1,800 households with over 6,200 people living there depending on agricultural land and working under the MGNREGS. Fifteen students from the panchayat travel on the forest road to a spot where network connectivity is available. “I have been attending classes from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily for the past five months by sitting on a boulder”, said M. Jessy of Kovilur habitation, who is pursuing her final year B.Sc. Nursing at a college in Coimbatore. She said that mobile signal was very weak in the area, and got disconnected frequently. “At least 20 to 35 times, I have to reconnect to attend the online classes”, she said and added that she takes a break from noon to 1 p.m. for lunch. “Once an elephant trumpeted, and a bear was seen along the road, after which I left for home”, she recalled and added that despite fears, she continued to pursue her studies. Class XII and college students attend online classes every day. However, due to poor connectivity, they leave early. While there are over 250 students in Class XI, Class XII and higher education, only a few turn up to the spot to attend online classes. C. Devaraj of Chinna Gundri said that only a few parents possess smart phones and other students are unable to attend online classes. “Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, parents have refused to admit their children in schools and colleges from last year onwards,” he added. The existing BSNL’s tower with CDMA technology is outdated and has not been in use for the past 10 years. Sources said that equipment would cost Rs. 2.8 crore while cable-laying, labour work and other expenses would come to about Rs. 40 lakh. Two private telecom companies recently inspected the panchayat and were studying the feasibility to install towers. M. Mahesh Madhesh, president of the panchayat, said representation had been made to district administration demanding a mobile tower as students were badly affected. V.P. Gunasekaran, State committee member, Tamil Nadu Tribal People Association, urged the State government to allot special funds to install a mobile tower.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teenagers-travel-2-km-daily-sit-on-road-to-attend-online-class/article35779583.ece

07 August 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Have proposals to increase farm productivity’||The Agrofood Chamber of Commerce and Industry president S. Rethinavelu on Friday urged the State government to have proposals to increase the farm productivity and farmers’ revenue motivating youth to become involved in agriculture with the latest technology. Submitting a pre-budget memorandum to the Agriculture Minister M.R.K. Panneerselvam and Finance Minister P.T.R. Palanivel Thiagarajan in Chennai and releasing a copy to the media, he said that 17 % of the State population was involved in agriculture or related activities. It was welcome to have an exclusive budget for the farmers. The chamber president had suggested enhancing moringa exports. The coverage of moringa cultivation may be increased by declaring Theni, Dindigul, Karur, Thoothukudi, Tirupur, Ariyalur and Madurai districts, accounting for 73% of moringa cultivation, as moringa export zone. Farmers should be motivated to involve in milk farming to get an assured income throughout the year. Out of the total milk production of about 53 crore litre per day in the country, Tamil Nadu’s share was 2 crore litres per day. About 50 % of the milk produced by farmers here was purchased by organised dairy units, i.e., 33 lakh litre by Aavin and 69 lakh litres by private dairy units. The farmers were paid every week and there was no fluctuation in price. Thus, in milk farming, there was profitability and liquidity to farmers. The government should give more sops to attract more farmers towards milk farming. He welcomed the proposal to enhance the number of Uzhavar Sandhais from 180 to 300. The memorandum wanted the government to expedite more river link projects as in the last decade only two projects were given shapes. If rivers were linked, more districts would benefit. Like the Spices Board, the budget should have Pulses Board and the natural calamity crop insurance scheme and a well-equipped market committee would give the much needed strength to the farming community, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/have-proposals-to-increase-farm-productivity/article35779756.ece
07 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC dismisses anticipatory bail plea in illegal sand quarrying case||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Friday dismissed the anticipatory bail plea of Manuvel George, the main accused in the Tirunelveli illegal sand quarrying case. He was imposed a penalty of Rs. 9.5 crore for the offence by the authorities. Justice B. Pugalendhi took a serious view of the illegal sand quarrying and refused to allow the petitioner’s counsel to withdraw the anticipatory bail petition. The court said that only if the main accused was apprehended, the involvement of others would come to light. Earlier, a Division Bench of the High Court transferred the investigation into the illegal sand quarrying case to the CB-CID. Manuvel George was granted licence for storing and processing rough stone, m-sand, gravel and crusher dust in Kallidaikurichi, Ambasamudram in Tirunelveli district. But, he indulged in illegal sand quarrying in adjacent lands including the Vandala Odai dam. The Tahsildar, Ambasamudram, inspected the site, the illegal activities were ascertained and subsequently the Sub-Collector of Cheranmahadevi also inspected the site and imposed the penalty of Rs. 9.5 crore. The registration certificate issued to Manuvel George was cancelled and a criminal case was registered against him. It was also brought to light that government officials from various departments like revenue, police, agriculture and mining facilitated the illegal sand quarrying. The accused Manuvel George, a resident of Kerala had misused the quarry licence granted to him.

According to Rajesh, who was employed with a private company, he wanted to start a business for which he required Rs. 2 lakh. Not knowing whom to approach, he stumbled upon an advertisement that popped up on his Facebook page. When he dialled a mobile number mentioned in the advertisement on July 28, there was no response. However, after a few minutes, he got a call from a man, who claimed to be the manager of a nationalised bank.

She was brought by her parents on Wednesday from Karaikudi in an emergency condition of severe wheezing and breathlessness. Pulmonologists Dr. Bharathi Babu and Dr. Harikrishnan said it was a high risk emergency procedure given the baby's fragile lungs and distressed condition. After the CT chest evaluation detected the foreign object to be a peanut, they immediately planned to pull it out. The team of doctors, including ENT surgeon Dr. Arun Prabhu Ganesan and anaesthetist Dr. Prabhu, took three hours to clear the baby's airway. Managing her was not easy as a bronchoscopy had to be introduced inside the tiny lungs, that could worsen her breathlessness.

07 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘Focus is on fast-tracking Perspective 2025’||Jayanti S. Ravi, the newly-appointed Secretary of Auroville Foundation, is advocating a mission-mode approach to advance the vision of Mirra Alfassa (The Mother) for Auroville, the universal township she founded on February 28, 1968. Auroville’s Master Plan (Perspective 2025) is a blueprint, evolved from The Mother’s envisioning of a galaxy-shaped experimental township — the founder’s Auroville Charter conceived it as a piece of earth belonging to none in particular but rather to humanity as a whole, a place of unending education and a bridge between the past and the future. Under the 2025 perspective plan, Auroville would house an integrated global community of 50,000 with the Matrimandir as its soul. “Auroville now has a community of over 3,000 members from 58 countries. We need to have the social infrastructure in place if we are to rededicate ourselves to the Mother’s goal,” Ms. Jayanti Ravi, who will be on deputation for a period of three years, told The Hindu . Since getting started on the “unique assignment”, Ms. Jayanti Ravi has been reading up on The Mother and listening to a diverse spectrum of the residents, from old-timers to the youth, to appreciate their views and aspirations for Auroville’s path to the future. “The development of Auroville has to be wholly community-driven. I see my role as more of a facilitator,” said Ms. Jayanti Ravi, a 1991-batch IAS officer of Gujarat cadre, who hails from Chennai. And, what better occasion for a fresh impetus to the pursuit of the vision than the 150th birth anniversary year of The Mother’s spiritual mentor, Sri Aurobindo, she says. Emphasis on timelines “Apart from moving away from tourism as a revenue stream...which was an important learning from the COVID-19 pandemic...it is important for Auroville to show a demonstrable commitment to implementation of projects against specific timelines. This can, in turn, bolster the case for more Budgetary support,” said the AF secretary. One of the priorities is to expedite land acquisition for Auroville — a two-front challenge of acquiring new lands as well as regaining the encroached terrain — with the support of the Tamil Nadu administration. The master plan for systematic development on an area of about 2,000 ha includes establishing residential zone, international zone, industrial zone and cultural zone. Detailed project plan A detailed project plan is being prepared to expedite the implementation of pending proposals, including starting off on the Crown project — a circular lifeline-like pathway ringing the Matrimandir, interconnecting the zones and featuring colonnades, plazas, cafes, cinema halls, exhibition galleries and art studios. The Town Development Council has been tasked with evolving an action plan with the in-house expertise of pioneering architect Balkrishna Doshi. The Auroville governing board is also being reconstituted shortly, the Secretary said. On whether managing diversity in Auroville can be as much a challenge as its strength, especially for evolving a consensus on the way forward, Ms. Jayanti Ravi says she is optimistic that even in a situation of conflicting views, the shared vision would ultimately prevail as an unifying force for the community. The Auroville community, she said, needs only to look within to draw inspiration from the incredible spirit of volunteerism of the first caravan of free-thinkers from France, who abandoned material possessions to embrace the philosophy of The Mother, and created a township out of nowhere — an unprecedented afforestation mission that turned a red-brown barren sprawl into the richly green bio-region of today. Auroville is protected by a unique Act of Parliament of 1988. The UNESCO has, since 1966, passed five resolutions endorsing the Auroville project. “There is, of course, the eternal source of inspiration of The Mother whose far-sightedness led her to imagine in her writings, pedestrian pathways and eco-friendly electric vehicles with speed limits of 15 kph as modes of transportation within Auroville zones as early as the Sixties,” said Ms. Jayanti Ravi. In fact, there are so many inspiring models that Auroville can impart to the world in aspects spanning human unity, sustainable living/livelihoods, urban settlement planning and successful integration of the global with the local reflected in the co-option of local communities in the Auroville journey. While there is no illusion of engendering Utopia; the focus, rather, looks to be on attaining the closest approximation of The Mother’s ideal with zero-to-minimum compromise.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/focus-is-on-fast-tracking-perspective-2025/article35779861.ece
07 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Left parties, VCK demand free education for Dalits||The Left parties and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi held a demonstration in front of the Education Department to press for various demands. The demands, included immediate implementation of the scheme to provide free education for Dalits from kindergarten to research, as well as extending the benefits to students from the backward classes. The political parties also sought implementation of the 10% reservation proposal for government school students in medical education, ensuring 50% of medical seats in private medical colleges for government quota and setting up a Board of School Education for the Union Territory. Leaders of CPM, CPI, CPI (ML) and VCK addressed the protesters. Later, they submitted a memorandum to the Director of Education, pressing for the implementation of their demands. Though Puducherry has become a hub of educational institutions, proper educational opportunities were being denied to the students here, particularly those hailing from the socially backward and economically vulnerable sections. The government had miserably failed in fulfilling its responsibility of providing education to all. Government educational institutions lacked proper infrastructure and the schemes evolved by the State were not reaching the needy, the memorandum said. The memorandum urged the Director to take appropriate steps to immediately implement the scheme granting full fees to the SC and ST students pursuing school education and higher and technical professional courses in Puducherry.

07 August 2021||Ramanathapuram,TAMIL NADU||Man missing case booked in 2018 solved; three held for murder||A man missing complaint registered in 2018 in Ramanathapuram district has turned out to be a gruesome murder with the police arresting three persons. Superintendent of Police E. Karthik said on Friday that following a complaint from Alagulingam of Kannirajapuram village, the Sayalkudi police registered a case in December 2018. According to the complainant, his younger brother Muthu (38) was missing since December 24, 2018. The police could not trace him. On a petition from the relatives of Muthu, the Madras High Court Madurai Bench had directed the police to examine the case. Recently a team led by Inspector Navaneethakrishnan zeroed in on the suspects and interrogations revealed that Muthu was abducted by a four-member gang in a car, forced to consume liquor and later beaten to death. The gang poured petrol and set his body ablaze in Panangaadu area, near Sayalkudi. The police recovered his mortal remains and a DNA examination concluded that the body was Muthu’s. Police said the murder was a fallout of a failed property deal for which Muthu had taken Rs. 50,000 advance. The gang comprised of Gunasekaran, his relatives Vedamanickam, Paul Pounraj and Joseph Rajan. As Gunasekaran had died in 2020 due to cancer, police arrested the remaining three accused based on their confessions. The police also said that Gunasekaran, Paul Pounraj and Joseph Rajan figured in a double murder case reported in 2015 and that trial in the case was under way in the fast track court in Ramanathapuram district.

07 August 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Forum to implead itself in litigation against HR & CE||The Deiva Thamizh Peravai has decided to implead itself in the case filed at the Madras High Court against Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department by an individual challenging the Department’s decision to ensure the performance of ‘archanas’ in Tamil and appointment of people belonging to all castes as temple priests. A resolution in this regard was passed at its executive meeting held at Samarasa Suddha Sanmarga Sangam at Thiruveragam near Kumbakonam on Thursday where it was decided to approach the Madras High Court seeking to dismiss the individual’s petition. Stating that ‘archana’ in a language other than Tamil should be performed at the temples only if the devotee pleads, the forum urged the State government to enact legislation to make Tamil the mandatory language for performing ‘archana’ and ‘puja’ since the government orders issued in this regard in the past have not been implemented properly. Claiming that the Supreme Court had made it clear in its order delivered on December 16, 2015 that ‘agamas’ did not prevent a person from becoming an ‘archakar,’ the forum contended that the Apex Court had not specified that the ‘archana’ should be performed in a particular language only or a person born in a specific caste alone can become a priest. The government should open ‘archagar’ training schools across teh State to provide `Tamizh Vazhipattu’ training in addition to the appointment of already trained 200 persons as `archakars,’ the forum added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/forum-to-implead-itself-in-litigation-against-hr-ce/article35779538.ece
07 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Kerala officer accused in dowry death dismissed||The State government has decided to dismiss from service S. Kiran Kumar, husband of S.V. Vismaya who allegedly ended her life due to dowry-related harassment. Kiran Kumar, 30, was employed as Assistant Motor Vehicle Inspector at the Kollam regional office of the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD). The dismissal disqualifies him from future employment in government service. He would not be entitled to a pension since he was on probation, Minister for Transport Antony Raju told a press meet on Friday. The action was taken in accordance with the provisions of the Kerala Civil Services Rules, 1960, and consequent on a departmental inquiry, the Minister said. Kiran Kumar was accused of breaking the law, misogynistic conduct, and tarnishing the image of the government and the MVD. First instance This was the first time that a government employee was being dismissed from service in Kerala in connection with the dowry-related death of his wife, Mr. Raju said. Vismaya, a BAMS student, was found dead at her husband’s home at Sasthamcotta in Kollam on June. After the Sooranad police registered a criminal case against him, the department had placed Kiran Kumar under suspension on June 22 pending a department-level investigation by a senior officer. Memo issued Subsequently, the accused was issued a memo listing the charges against him. His side of the incident was heard and the statements by witnesses were taken into account. The decision to dismiss him from service was taken as per Rule 11(1)(viii) of the Kerala Civil Services Rules, 1960, as the charges were found to be true, the Minister said. Although the police investigation into the death was still in progress, it did not have any bearing on the government’s decision to dismiss him from service. “They are two distinct procedures. This is purely a departmental action,” he said. A message The government decision would send across a message against the recurrence of such incidents, Mr. Raju said. He added that he would visit Vismaya’s family on Saturday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kerala-officer-accused-in-dowry-death-dismissed/article35779065.ece

07 August 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||‘Bone density screening helps detect osteoporosis’||“One-third of women and one-fifth of men aged above 50 years are prone to osteoporosis and its early detection can help in preventing fractures,” said Government Medical College Dean J. Sangumani. After participating in a special camp for osteoporosis screening held at the Government Medical College Hospital here on Friday, he said that mobility was life. The camp was held in connection with National Bone and Joint Day observed on August 4. “People with low bone density are prone to get fractures even on sustaining mild injuries and they could be rendered bed-ridden. Hence, people aged above 50 years should screen their bone density and take treatment to avoid fractures,” he said. Around 150 patients underwent bone mineral density screening using DEXA scanner. “Usually, this scanning would cost around Rs. 3,000 but was done free of cost today,” he said. Osteoporosis can be treated with calcium-rich diet, said Resident Medical Officer N. Aravind Babu. People who have pain or strain in their hip, arm or wrist, lower back, stooped posture and neck pain should get themselves scanned for bone density. They can increase intake of milk, diary products, chicken, mutton, pork, crab, egg, almonds, groundnuts, pista etc. Among calcium-rich vegetables, are cauliflower, fenugreek, spinach, ladies fingers, beetroot, cabbage, figs, and fruits like dates, oranges, raisins, apple, banana and papaya. Exposing the body to sunlight for 15 minutes can help in getting Vitamin D, he added. Head of the Department (Ortho), Maheswaran, was present at the camp.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bone-density-screening-helps-detect-osteoporosis/article35779561.ece

They pointed out that a majority of the students could not attend online classes [owing to network and gadget issues],” Mr. Stalin said. He announced that medical and nursing colleges and those offering related programmes would be allowed to resume classes from August 16. “Students and teachers in these colleges, classified as medical staff, have been vaccinated,” he said. To prevent crowding at public places, Mr. Stalin announced that worship at religious places would not be allowed on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. The local bodies must ensure that there is no crowding at meat and fish stalls by spreading them out in the open space. The Chief Minister reiterated that shops must supply hand sanitisers to customers and enforce mask mandates and physical distancing norms. “Action will be initiated against commercial and other establishments that do not follow the guidelines and allow more customers than the stipulated number,” Mr. Stalin said. Collectors and local bodies are to undertake micro-level containment activities, he said. The test-track-treat-vaccinate COVID-19-appropriate behaviour formula is to be strictly followed.

07 August 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Prepare for third wave: Karjol||Govind Karjol, Minister appointed to supervise COVID-19 management in Belagavi district, has asked officers to prepare for the third wave of the epidemic. At a meeting on Friday, he said the State government would release additional funds to manage the third wave. He asked officers to send a detailed proposal to the government including the need for beds, oxygen, medicines and equipment. He also asked officials to document the availability of beds, equipment, medicines and oxygen supply in private hospitals. “Officials tell me that we have 418 beds for children in the government district and taluk hospitals. However, we need a count of the beds reserved for children in private hospitals. Government officers should not only seek information from private hospitals, but also inspect them to assess and ascertain the facilities available to them, as per provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897,” the Minister said. The district administration should also send a list of qualified doctors and paramedical staff to the State government and indicate scarcity. The government would re-allot trained doctors from neighbouring districts to hospitals that need them. However, paramedical staff units should be prepared in the district by training local youth, he said. He asked Regional Commissioner Amlan Aditya Biswas to see that the oxygen plant in the district government hospital was ready in time. He suggested that officers could sanction works of setting up oxygen plants to local industries. “You can issue work orders to local units. The State government will approve them,” he told officers. Mr. Biswas said that local youth would be trained to be paramedical staff under the Special Component Plan and Tribal Sub Plan programmes. The RC also asked officers to procure immunity boosting medicines for children. Figures so far S.V. Muniyal, District Health and Family Welfare Officer said that the number of active cases had gone down to 496. As many as 5.6 lakh tests have been conducted and the positivity rate is around 0.84% and death rate was around 2.34%. Over 300 of the 460 black fungus case were cured. The disease had claimed 49 lives, he said. I.P. Gadad, officer in charge of immunisation, said that a total of 18 lakh persons have received the vaccination. This includes 30,000 people in relief centres. Vaccines have been given in border villages also, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/prepare-for-third-wave-karjol/article35779587.ece
07 August 2021||BELAGAVI,KARNATAKA||Jarkiholi brothers adopt a ‘wait-and-watch’ strategy||Amid dissent and disappointment in the State BJP unit over the Cabinet expansion and jubilation by followers of those who got ministerial berths, the Jarkiholi camp of Belagavi is witnessing an unusual calm, probably indicative of a “wait-and-watch” approach. When journalists met the former Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi outside his house in Gokak on Thursday while he was returning from a badminton game, he appeared rather cool and said the Cabinet expansion was not in his mind at all. “I may become a Minister in future or else I will remain an MLA,” he said. Particularly after his resignation over the sleaze video CD, Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi has kept himself aloof. He did not go when the former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa visited flood-hit Gokak taluk. While his brother Balachandra Jarkiholi made multiple visits to Bengaluru and Delhi, the last time Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi left Belagavi was in June when he went to meet seer of Suttur Mutt in Mysuru. He neither met party organising general secretary for State Arun Kumar when he came to Belagavi nor did he attend the legislature party meeting which elected Basavaraj Bommai as the Chief Minister, a party leader confirmed. Keeping himself aloof is being seen as an expression of discontent against some party leaders who did not stand by him when he was in crisis. Supporters say they are adopting a “wait-and-watch” strategy. They would wait for the court order and also want to get clarification on whether Mr. Balachandra Jarkiholi can continue to be KMF chairman even after being made a Minister. In case of delay or adverse verdict, Mr. Balachandra Jarkiholi would take his elder brother’s place, said a former legislator. They are relying on the precedence of JD(S) leader H.D. Revanna holding two posts simultaneously, sources said. Above all, the Jarkiholi camp wants to know whether the BJP still considers Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi as a frontline leader of the Nayaka community as an alternative to B. Sriramulu, who is a Minister now. “They are seeking answers to these issues. This was promised when Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi defected to the BJP,” said a former zilla panchayat member of the BJP. The brothers were also said to be keen to see that an “outsider” was made the district in-charge Minister so that when Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi or Mr. Balachandra Jarkiholi make it to the Cabinet, it would be easy to take over. This explains why Govind Karjol was made the district in-charge Minister, a supporter pointed out. Bheemshi Bharamannavar, Gokak BJP city unit president and a close confidante of the Jarkiholi brothers, said that unlike others, the brothers were not desperate to become Ministers. “This is the first time in two decades that there is none from the Jarkiholi family in the State Cabinet. But still, the brothers are not goading the party to induct them. Because of a false case, Mr. RameshJarkiholi suffered public humiliation and he will think twice before joining the Cabinet again,” Mr. Bharamannavar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/jarkiholi-brothers-adopt-a-wait-and-watch-strategy/article35779386.ece
07 August 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Headmaster suspended for sending lewd messages||The Department of Education has suspended a government school headmaster on charges of sending obscene messages to a Health Department employee and two other women in a village in Belagavi district. Suresh Chavalagi of Degaon village has been suspended pending further enquiry. This was after complaints were received from three women that he had sent them obscene messages. The headmaster had collected the number of a nurse on the pretext of asking her the availability of vaccines for his colleagues. Then he started sending messages. Roughed up When the woman told this to her colleagues and family members, they came to the school and roughed him up. Later, two other women complained to the Education Department officers that he had sent them similar messages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/headmaster-suspended-for-sending-lewd-messages/article35779604.ece
07 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||FSL getting a flood of property documents for investigation||The economic growth has brought not only value to the real estate but also disputes along with it. In the last couple of years, the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) is increasingly getting more cases of forgery of documents to probe. The forged papers pertaining to land or property disputes are related to general power of attorney or sale agreement. In the last few years, the FSL has received over 500 cases each year, and pendency of cases in the last three years is about 1,000 owing to shortage of staff to examine the documents. At the end of 2020, the pendency of cases in questioned documents was 1,017, data from the Police Department shows. In all, 9,958 articles in 1,017 cases needed to be analysed at the end of 2020. Of these, three cases are from 2016. Additional Director-General of Police (Crime and Technical Services) R. Hithendra acknowledged that the number of questioned documents before the FSL had increased in the last couple of years. He pointed out at real estate becoming a prime economic mover in cities such as Bengaluru. “In many cases, the analysis of questioned documents is taking at least one-and-a-half years to be completed. New officers are being hired and efforts are being made to bring down the pendency and the time taken for analysis is expected to come down to about a month.” Scientific officers with skills to analyse documents are being recruited and that is expected to bring down pendency, he added.  Case analysis rate According to Mr. Hithendra, the current case analysis rate is about60 to 70 questioned documents, which is expected to be increased to analysis of 80 to 100 documents, which will sharply bring down the pendency. Besides, the time required to issue a report by the FSL would be brought down to about one month from the current 15 to 17 months. The FSL, apart from criminal cases, also receives civil cases referred by civil courts by appointing a handwriting examiner as court commissioner. Such cases are being returned without examination citing a large number of pending criminal cases. If accepted, these cases further aggravate pendency, a note said. While 111 court-referred cases were returned without examination in 2018, it was 124 and 120 in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The High Court of Karnataka has already rapped the State government over the delay by taking up a suo motu case after it found several cases piling up due to delayed reports by the FSL. This has led the government to draw a three-year action plan to upgrade forensic assessment and research in the State by investing on infrastructure and personnel. While the High Court-mandated improvement in the Forensic Science Laboratory is being put in place, initial proposals to have branches other than the traditional 13 sections — such as vehicle forensics, drones forensics, and forensics to analyse electronics — is also being mooted. “With most modern cars having chips from where data can be recovered, investigation of accidents and thefts need to be upgraded. As there is an increase in the number of drones, there is a necessity to have skills to assess impacts of drones,” Mr. Hithendra said. Among others, he said in the years to come as e-wallets and smart homes increase, these also need to have skilled analysers in these sections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fsl-getting-a-flood-of-property-documents-for-investigation/article35779388.ece
07 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Weekend curfew in 8 border districts of State from today||In the wake of rise in COVID-19 cases in the last few days in the neighbouring States, the Karnataka government has decided to impose weekend curfew (from 9 p.m. on Friday to 5 a.m. on Monday) in the eight border districts adjoining Kerala and Maharashtra from August 7 to 16 as a precautionary measure. The government has also increased the duration of the night curfew in the entire State by one hour with immediate effect. From now night curfew will be enforced from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. as against the earlier system of 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. The above decision was taken by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai after a meeting with experts from health and education sectors as well as officials in Bengaluru on Friday. Mr. Bommai told reporters after the meeting that the curfew would be imposed on Saturdays and Sundays in border districts of the State to prevent the spread of the pandemic. The State districts bordering Kerala are: Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu, Mysuru, and Chamarajanagar, while districts bordering Maharashtra are: Belagavi, Vijayapura, Bidar, and Kalaburagi. Mandatory The government had made RT-PCR negative reports and two doses of vaccination mandatory for those entering Karnataka at the inter-State borders with Kerala and Maharashtra from August 1. All social, political, and religious congregations have been prohibited. However, marriage and family functions can be conducted by involving not more than 100 people following COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. Funerals will be allowed with a maximum of 20 people, according to the new guidelines issued by the government. Places of worship are allowed to open, but with strict adherence to COVID-19 norms. Temple festivals, processions, and congregations are not allowed. Shops providing essential services and goods, street vendors, standalone liquor shops, and public distribution system shops would be allowed to open from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. during the weekend curfew in eight districts. Restaurants and eateries will be allowed only for takeaway and home delivery. Home delivery of all items should be encouraged 24x7 to minimise movement of individuals outside their homes, state the guidelines. Movement of general public remains strictly prohibited during weekend curfew. Patients and their attendants requiring emergency treatment, and eligible persons intending to take vaccination are allowed to come out of their houses with minimum proof. Movement of trains and air travel are permitted. Movement of public transport, private vehicles, and taxis to and from airports, railway stations and bus terminals/stops/stands are allowed for facilitating transport of passengers by air, rail, and road. Movement would be allowed only on displaying valid travel documents/tickets. The government has also permitted operation of all industries/companies/organisations dealing with emergency and essential services and requiring 24x7 work. Movement of employees of such organisations should be allowed on producing valid ID cards issued by their respective organisations. However, to the extent possible, employees should be encouraged to work from home, it said. Employees and vehicles of telecom and internet service providers should be allowed to move on producing valid ID cards issued by their respective institutions. Only essential staff/employees of IT and ITeS companies should work from office, the guidelines said. Physical classes for IX to XII to resume from Aug. 23  The State government has permitted schools/colleges to reopen for classes IX to XII from August 23 in the first phase. A decision to this effect was taken after Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai held consultations with education and health experts on Friday. Students would be divided into two batches and each batch would be asked to attend classes on alternate days, the Chief Minister said. This means students will have to attend classes three days a week, he explained. Describing this as the first phase of reopening, Mr. Bommai said a decision on resuming classes for 1 to 8 as part of the second phase would be taken at the end of August based on the prevailing situation. It may be noted that managements of several private schools had appealed to the Chief Minister to allow them to reopen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/weekend-curfew-in-8-border-districts-from-today/article35779351.ece
07 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Schools ready, but parents aren’t||While the State government has decided to reopen schools and PU colleges later this month, many parents say they are not yet ready to send their children to school as the children are not vaccinated yet. However, school managements feel it is high time that they reopened schools and will begin classes even if a small number of students attend. Classes for high schools started in a phased manner this January, but schools were ordered to shut down again in March. Many private schools chose not to reopen as they were worried that their schools would become hotspots, while in some other cases, the schools did not have adequate infrastructure to follow the SOP. Shweta Sharan, founder of Bangalore Schools, a parent support group, said that while most parents were not ready to send their children to school, some were keen to do so. “Many parents are not willing to send their children to school because they are worried about a third wave and the Delta variant. They also say that in our country, with many schools having a large number of children per class, social distancing and COVID-19 protocol will be hard to follow,” she said. At the same time, there is a small but steadily growing group of parents who believe that the reopening of schools cannot be delayed any more. “These parents believe that children need to go back to school because missing out on crucial years in school has deprived them of academic and social skills, not to mention the mental toll that it has had on them because they have not interacted with their peers.” While parents whose children have access to gadgets and Internet connectivity say they are comfortable with their children attending online classes, some others are glad that the government has decided to reopen schools. Murthy S., an autorickshaw driver, said, “My son is a first generation learner and he has not been able to learn much in the last one and half years. I will gladly sign the consent form and send him to school on the first day.” Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of management, DPS Group of Schools, said they would assess the willingness and the response of the parents the following week. “We will conduct classes even if there are only a small number of students who choose to attend; the remaining students can continue to attend classes online. As it is a pandemic, we need to go the extra mile and ensure that everyone is comfortable,” he said. Schools are asking all students to submit details of their family members and their vaccination status. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, also urged the government to ensure that they treat parents of school students as a priority group and ensure they are given preference during vaccination drives. “This would help ensure that students are indirectly safe as their first circle would be vaccinated even though they themselves are not.” However, Sumanth Narayan, founder of Shanthinikethana School, said that they would not reopen immediately as there was a possibility of schools being closed again with a third wave of infections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/schools-ready-but-parents-arent/article35779374.ece
07 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Reopen lower primary classes also’||While the State government has decided to reopen Classes XI and above from August 23, many school managements and parents have now joined the chorus and want lower primary classes also to be opened. Many experts on the committee appointed by the State government to discuss the reopening of schools had pointed out that the lower classes would have to be reopened first as the students in lower grades were most adversely affected when compared to those in higher classes. However, the Department of Public Instruction had suggested reopening high school classes first. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said the decision regarding the reopening of schools was a welcome one. “However, we also want to reopen primary classes. Students who are affected the most academically with schools being closed are the primary school students,” he said. Rajath S., a parent whose sons study in Classes I and VI, said, “My children have not had access to one gadget each during the pandemic and hence find it difficult to attend online classes. There is a need to ensure that schools reopen as my children have started forgetting even the basics they learnt in earlier grades.” Gurumurthy Kasinathan, of the National Coalition for the Education Emergency, said that educationists were unanimous that school closure had harmed the younger ones the most. “Not going to school means language skills are not being developed, and neither is basic socialisation skills. On the other hand, there is clear evidence that young children are least affected by the virus, as both cases and fatalities are negligible the world over,” he said. He said termed the decision to keep primary schools closed as “criminally callous” and said it would lead to a larger number of school dropouts over the next few years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/reopen-lower-primary-classes-also/article35779372.ece
07 August 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||ED raid: DKS expresses surprise over Zameer’s statement||KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar on Friday expressed surprise over party MLA B.Z. Zameer Ahmed Khan’s statement that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) raid on his properties on Thursday was in connection with his personal assets and not related to the Rs. 4,000-crore IMA scam. “It’s surprising to me that the ED will conduct a raid in connection with assets,” Mr. Shivakumar told reporters here. He said as per his knowledge, the Income Tax (I-T) Department conducts raids in connection with assets and income and not the ED. “The I-T [Department] should do it”. If the I-T Department finds money-laundering, then the ED commences the probe,” he said. Mr. Shivakumar pointed out that Mr. Khan in the Legislative Assembly had said that justice should be provided for all 40,000 people who had lost money in the IMA scam. “This is our party’s stand too,” the KPCC chief said. Apparently, he mocked the party MLA’s statement that the ED raided his properties with regard to his sources of income and not the IMA case. Referring to CBI raid on his residence last year, Mr. Shivakumar said the ED and the I-T Department registered cases against him after obtaining permission from the government. On Minister S.T. Somashekhar’s comment in Mysuru that Mr. Shivakumar might be responsible for the raid on Mr. Khan’s properties as he was projecting Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah as the party’s chief ministerial face for the 2023 elections, the KPCC president laughed off and said, “I am so happy. My old friend Somashekhar believes that the ED is under my control”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ed-raid-dks-expresses-surprise-over-zameer-ahmeds-statement/article35779393.ece

The ED had raided premises linked to Mr. Khan and the former MLA Roshan Baig in connection with the Rs. 4,000-crore IMA scam on Thursday. Mr. Khan claimed ED authorities did not ask him any questions regarding the IMA scam, but only about his recently built palatial house and other property transactions. “ED officials told me that someone had filed multiple complaints against me raising doubts about the finances of my house. I have built this house over seven yearsand have declared everything to the IncomeTax Department. I had also heard that some of my opponents were targeting me over the house. So it is for my own good that the ED probe has also been launched. It had to happen someday.

07 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Kingpin of hashish oil supply held||The city police have busted one of the kingpins of the supply of hashish oil, a cannabis concentrate, in the city and recovered 15 kg of the drug. This is the largest haul of this particular narcotic in the State till date. Nabaran Chakma, 31, a BCA dropout hailing from Assam, was arrested at a flat in Hennur on Friday morning. The police had been trying to apprehend him for the past year and a half. The Central Crime Branch (CCB) had unearthed a narcotics ring in Ramamurthy Nagar and arrested Sinto Thomas, 35, hailing from Kerala, and recovered 4.3 kg of hashish oil in February 2020. His interrogation revealed that he was only a sub-dealer, who bought narcotics from one Chakma. However, all efforts to identify and nab Chakma had failed over the past year and a half. Sustained investigation led to a breakthrough on Friday morning. The police recovered 15 kg of hashish oil and thousands of small bottles of 10 gram and 5 gram capacity each. Much in demand in the city recently, at a conservative estimate, hashish oil costs between Rs. 8,000 and Rs. 10,000 for 10 grams. “Unlike ganja or other synthetic drugs, the market for hashish oil is niche. Chakma is one of the main suppliers to several sub-dealers in the city,” a senior CCB official said. The police have also arrested three of his main sub-dealers through whom he was targeting customers, mainly techies and students, in the city. The arrested are Mobin Babu from Andhra Pradesh, Roland Rodney, a dog breeder from the city, and Tarun Kumar Lalchand, also from the city. From the four arrested, the police have recovered 11 kg of ganja, 530 grams of charas, and four hydro ganja plants, apart from a large cache of hashish oil, totalling an estimated worth of Rs. 6 crore. According to preliminary investigation, Chakma used to stay in apartments and changed houses often to escape detection, sources said. Other arrests The city police have also unearthed two other narcotics rings, in two separate, unrelated cases. The Commercial Street police arrested a lorry driver named Sameen, hailing from Andhra Pradesh, who was procuring ganja from his State and selling it here. They recovered 8 kg of ganja worth Rs. 2 lakh. In another case, CCB sleuths from the Narcotics Wing arrested a Nigerian man, Onyeka Emmanuel James, 31, from Baiyappanahalli, who was staying illegally while peddling drugs on Thursday. The police recovered 25 Ecstasy pills and 13 LSD strips worth Rs. 5 lakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-arrest-kingpin-of-hashish-oil-supply-recover-15-kg-of-drug/article35779376.ece

07 August 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Bommai calls for discussion on changing values, laws||“There is need for elaborate discussions at State and national level on the values, laws and relations that changed according to the times and also social values of laws,” Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Friday. He was inaugurating the ‘National Webinar on Socio-legal Values in Mitakshara, Vachana, Dasa and Folk Literature in Karnataka: An Exploration’ organised by Karnataka State Law University under the aegis of Vijnaneshwara Adhyayana Peetha, via video conference on Friday. Mr. Bommai said that society and law were inseparable and Constitution was the mother of all laws. “This constitution is standing on the pedestal of equality, justice and values. And the foundation of the Constitution was laid by social reformers the country had seen. Karnataka’s contribution in the field of social reforms is rich as we had great reformers like Basavanna, Kanakadasa, Sarvajna and writers like D.V. Gundappa, Kuvempu and many others who strongly condemned the discrimination and advocated the objectives of the Constitution like equality, fraternity and justice,” he said. The CM referred to the incident of Ambedkar not being allowed to practice law when he returned from abroad and how then Education Minister in Bombay Presidency, Siddappa Kambali (from Hubballi), gave him shelter. During this stay, Ambedkar had the influence of ‘Vachana Literature’ of Basavanna and others, which could be found in the Constitution, he said. Referring to the Burmese tribals, who have settled in hilly regions and where there were no courts, police stations and hospitals and how the tribals had imbibed the essence of tolerance and fraternity, Mr. Bommai said that despite various degrees of education, the dissent and intolerance had only increased across the globe. Referring to the Vijnaneshwara Study Chair, which was established by his predecessor B.S. Yediyurappa, the CM said that the study chair should be a reformative one. “The Mitakshara law should be related to the present day and the chair should give suggestions on how to change the present situation through the age-old concepts and how to strengthen the judiciary and make laws more humane,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-calls-for-discussion-on-change-in-values/article35779378.ece
07 August 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Strict action against rapists sought||Condemning the alleged rape and murder of a minor girl in New Delhi, the Dharwad District Committee of All India Mahila Samskrutika Sanghatane (AIMSS) has demanded strict punishment of the perpetrators. A delegation comprising of AIMSS district president Madhulata Goudar, vice-president Gangubai Kokare, and Joint Secretary Devamma Devatkal submitted a memorandum in this regard to the district authorities on Friday. It said this was another shock to the country, that was yet to recover from the shock of the Hathras gang rape case in Uttar Pradesh. The 9-year old who had gone to fetch water from the cooler had been raped by the priest of the graveyard and others and then killed. When the girl’s mother questioned them about the incident, she had been told a lie that she died of electrocution and cremation had been in a hurry to cover up the issue. What was shocking was that even the police had joined hands in covering up the issue by not filing the FIR in connection with the incident, the AIMSS members alleged in the memorandum. It was highly condemnable that even after 74 years after Independence, the mentality of considering women as ‘an object of pleasure’ was still prevalent. Rapes of women and minor girls were continuing unabated because the policing system and the administration’s inactivity had allowed rapists to roam free in society, the members said. They said that slogans like ‘Beti Bachao Beti Badhao’ had lost meaning because they were not supported by requisite action on the ground. They demanded a ban on pornographic literature and films and sought that the recommendations of Verma Committee be implemented. AIMSS would also demand stringent punishment for the rapists, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/strict-action-against-rapists-sought/article35779591.ece

07 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Tech to produce and preserve ready-to-cook and non-acrid edible aroids transferred||The National Institute of Technology – Karnataka (NIT-K), Surathkal transferred a technology to produce and preserve ready-to-cook and non-acrid edible aroids to a private company during the 62nd Foundation Day of the institute on Friday. The technology transfer agreement was signed by Ananthanarayana, Deputy Director NIT-K, and Naveen G.V., founder of nGV Naturals on the occasion. The nGV Natural Industry Pvt. Ltd. which purchased the technology is in the business of packaging and selling vegetables in a ready to cook form in Bengaluru. It has established its business in processing and selling banana stems, tender jackfruit and bamboo shoots in the ready to cook form, a release from the NIT-K said. The technology has been developed by Prasanna B. D., Associate Professor, Department of Chemical Engineering, and his team. The team filed for its Indian patent in this April. Using this technology, the acridity present in various edible corms of elephant foot yam (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius), taro (Colocasia esculanta var esculanta), tannia (Xanthosoma violaceum) and giant taro (Alocasia macrorrhiza) can be removed and they can be preserved for six months under ambient conditions. Calcium oxalate crystals present in these corms are responsible for the acridity. Consumption of unprocessed aroid corms containing calcium oxalates causes caustic effects, irritation to the intestinal tract and absorptive poisoning and oxalosis. Total oxalates are removed traditionally by cooking, baking, frying or fermentation with additives like organic acids, baking soda etc. Although these strategies are successful in reducing oxalate content to some extent, colour/ flavour changes occur inevitably, the release added. Due to tedious steps involved in the preparation of these vegetables, most of the urban consumers are reluctant to use them.

07 August 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||COVID-19 control measures to be reviewed||A meeting of officials of the district administration and people’s representatives of Mysuru district has been convened in the city on Saturday to review measures in place at various places including tourist destinations and religious centres to control spread of COVID-19. S.T. Somashekar, who returned to the Council of Ministers under the new dispensation of Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, told reporters that the meeting will take stock of the COVID-19 situation in the district and discuss the measures that were needed to prevent the spread of the pandemic without affecting public health and inconveniencing businesses. Asked if he had been appointed the Minister in charge of the district, Mr. Somashekar said the Chief Minister has entrusted him with the responsibility of reviewing the COVID-19 and flood situation in Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts. “We have to give a report to the Chief Minister and the government in the regard”, he said. Mr. Somashekar, who visited Chamarajanagar on Friday, is scheduled to hold review meetings in Mysuru on Saturday. Asked about his ministerial portfolio, Mr .Somashekar said he had been given a berth after he had performed with commitment and honesty in former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s Cabinet. He said he would not press for any particular portfolio and was ready to discharge any responsibility entrusted to him. Preference However, he said he would prefer Bengaluru Development portfolio if he were to be given an option. Also, Mr. Somashekar said he would like become the Minister in charge of Bengaluru City. ED raid Fielding queries on the raid by Enforcement Directorate (ED) on the premises belonging to former Minister and Congress MLA representing Chamarajpet Assembly segment in Bengaluru B.Z. Zameer Ahmed Khan, he ruled out the oissibility of the raids being politically motivated. The ED had also raided former Minister R. Roshan Baig in connection with the IMA issue in which thousands of investors had been cheated. During the questioning, Mr. Khan’s name too may have cropped up and the ED was inquiring if there was any link between him and IMA. ‘No need to fear’ “If he is honest and had no link with IMA, there is no need for him to fear the ED or IT”, Mr. Somashekar said before clarifying that there was no politics involved in the matter. When his attention was drawn to Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) President D.K. Shivakumar’s allegation that the raids were politically motivated, Mr. Somashekar wondered why Mr. Shivakumar himself should not be behind the raids on Mr. Khan’s premises. “Mr. Shivakumar was annoyed with Mr. Khan for repeatedly projecting Congress leader Siddaramaiah as the next Chief Minister. Since, Mr. Shivakmar was already familiar with the ED, why should he not be behind the raids,” Mr. Somashekar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-control-measures-to-be-reviewed/article35779800.ece
07 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Implement strict checks at Kodagu border, install CCTVs’||Minister Kota Srinivasa Poojari on Friday said lockdown may once again become inevitable in the border district of Kodagu if the test positivity rate that currently stands at 2.81%, crosses 5%. Because of its proximity with Kerala, the district is at risk and therefore officials must strengthen vigil at the border check-posts, he added. Speaking after reviewing the COVID-19 situation with Kodagu being identified as one of the high-risk districts in view of the spike in Kerala, the Minister told the district administration to consider installing CCTVs at the check-posts for ensuring stringent checks with cases surging in Kerala causing fears of an impending third wave. Mr. Poojari said cases were on the rise after lockdown curbs were eased. The influx of travellers from Kerala is also on the rise. Only those with RT-PCR negative report not older than 72 hours must be allowed and this has to be strictly ensured at the check-posts for containing the spread, he said. K.G. Bopaiah, former Speaker and MLA, complained that checks are not strict at Kutta, Makutta, Karike, Sampaje, and Thithimathi check-posts in Kodagu. The surveillance staff need to get facilities as they work even during rain, screening travellers. They are working under duress and they need to get proper facilities like food besides restrooms at the check-post, he said. Responding to Mr. Bopaiah, Mr. Poojari said the government gives funds for COVID-19 management to each district and this needs to be properly utilised. Moreover, all departments must work together to contain the pandemic. Mr. Bopaiah also complained about drop in testing, especially when people from Kerala are coming to Kodagu after curbs were eased. Mr. Poojari told Deputy Commissioner Charulatha Somal to act against those who flout her orders for controlling COVID-19. The Minister said task forces set up in each GPs must become active again in the wake of third wave fears. This has been discussed with the Chief Secretary and the Deputy Commissioner, he told the meeting. The Minister also reviewed the floods and rain situation and assured help to the affected. Additional Deputy Commissioner Raju Mogaveera said the loss estimated due to rain and landslips since June this year was Rs. 90.61 crore. As many as 95 houses had been damaged and crops in over 14.5 hectares had been destroyed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/implement-strict-checks-at-kodagu-border-install-cctvs/article35779599.ece

Somashekar on Friday said border districts like Mysuru and Chamarajanagar are at risk with the surge in COVID-19 cases in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Therefore, surveillance at the borders must be stepped up with foolproof checks for containing the pandemic spread. Speaking to reporters after inspecting the check-post at Kekkenahalli bordering Kerala and Tamil Nadu in Chamarajanagar district, he said rising cases in Kerala was a concern in view of cross-border travel. The responsibility lies on us to step up checks and ensure guidelines are strictly complied with by check-post staff, he said. While stating that inter-State trade and business should remain unaffected, he said it is necessary to take certain strict measures so that the threat of spread was eased. The checks are inevitable though it can cause inconvenience. “Do not allow entry to those not carrying the RT-PCR negative reports not older than 72 hours,” he directed officials who accompanied him.

Mr. Rajeeve said Rs. 10 crore had been sanctioned to distribute the price of coir procured by the Coirfed.

It was flagged off by Industries Minister P. Rajeeve. He said the managements of public sector units (PSUs) in the State had been asked to prepare master plans. “The government will give its nod to master plans before August 15. One-time financial assistance will be given to each PSU based on the master plan,” the Minister said. Mr. Rajeeve said steps had been taken to fill 29 vacant head posts in various PSUs. Autokast, which was accorded Class A Foundry status by the Lucknow-based Research Design and Standards Organisation in 2019, bagged a ‘development order’ in March 2020 for manufacturing five Casnub bogies for goods trains for Northern Railway. The remaining four bogies will be delivered before September, Autokast officials said. By successfully delivering the initial order for Casnub bogies, officials said Autokast had become eligible to participate in Railways’ tenders. Apart from manufacturing Casnub bogies, Autokast recently supplied deck-mounted closed chocks for INS Vikrant, India’s first indigenous aircraft carrier. It recently supplied three super heater header castings in machined condition to the Golden Rock Railway Workshop in Tiruchirappalli for steam locomotives. Turnaround The remarkable turnaround of Autokast, which was once listed for privatisation, can be attributed to the previous Left Democratic Front government’s efforts to revive sick public sector undertakings in the State. The government had injected money into Autokast, which helped it modernise the unit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/autokast-despatches-first-casnub-bogie/article35779713.ece

07 August 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||As apples ripen, Kanthallur awaits visitors||As another apple season arrives in Kanthallur and nearby Marayur, fruit farmers are a worried lot with the pandemic yet to be contained. They have gained additional income over the years with farm visits on the itinerary of most tourists. The pandemic had hit their hopes last year as tourists did not turn up following the lockdown. Among the beneficiaries of farm tourism are those who grow a few apple trees to those with orchards. The apple flowering season is from January to February with harvesting from mid-July to August end. Role of tourists Usually, farmers retain fruits on trees till the end of Onam season to draw in visitors to the farms. They get better income as tourists are allowed to pluck apples from the tree. As the apple saplings experimentally cultivated by a few farmers were found to be a success, other farmers also followed suit converting sabarjilli farms into apple farms. Apple cultivation gained strength after the State government in association with the Kanthallur grama panchayat promoted ‘every home with a fruit tree’ scheme. Slowly Kanthallur became a favourite destination for farm tourism. Though other fruits are also grown in Kanthallur, it was apple cultivation that gave the grama panchayat a firm footing in farm tourism. The proximity to Munnar also worked in its favour. Apple varieties such as Royal Delicious, Gyanismith and Gyaniland brought from Kodaikanal and Himachal Pradesh are mainly cultivated, though Kashmiri varieties are also cultivated. Farmers say they get an annual yield of over 40 kg from a tree. Other fruits Tourists reach the farms throughout the year as one or the other fruit, including orange, sweet lemon, strawberry, tree tomato and blue passion fruit are there for the taking. Remunerative income Chandran Valiyaveettil, a fruit farmer, says no tourists have turned up so far. He says apple is ripe and selling it to local vendors will not provide a remunerative income. “Those arriving with family pay us a far better price if it is apple, orange or any other fruit,” he says. As commercial sale of apple is not done, fruit farmers like him are worried they will lose this season also.

Workers launched the agitation on July 15 after the estate authorities denied job for as many as 40 workers citing financial crisis, A. Devaraj, president, INTUC Kambamala unit, said. The Kambamala tea plantation project, spread over 100 hectares, was launched in 1979 to provide employment to repatriates from Sri Lanka. Close to 120 families were rehabilitated under the project, Mr. Devaraj said. “All the workers are relatives of retired workers of the estate but they are considered as casual workers. Though they had been working in the estate for the past nine years, the authorities are yet to make them permanent,” he said. As the work in the estate is the sole means of income for their families during the pandemic, they should be retained, he said. “We had also submitted a memorandum seeking the intervention of the Chief Minister in the issue,” he said. If the authorities failed to consider the fair demands of workers, the agitation would be intensified, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/workers-stir-enters-21st-day-at-kambamala-tea-estate/article35779677.ece

At an online meeting of people’s representatives and officials convened at the district level, officials of the Forest Department said that solar fences would be set up in such areas. The meeting was held in the wake of widespread destruction of crops and threat to life in the hilly areas of the district due to increasing man-animal conflicts. District Collector Bhandari Swagat Ranveer Chand, who presided over the meeting, said that steps had been taken to prevent wild animal attacks, and that the issue would be brought to the attention of the government. Panchayat presidents and people’s representatives, who attended the meeting, spoke about the miserable life of people living in the hilly areas. People’s representatives complained that no compensation was being paid to farmers when animals destroyed crops. Forest Department officials said the government had permitted shooting of wild boars that caused damage to crops, and that a list of those having gun licence would be prepared. Divisional Forest Officer Ajit K. Raman said the department would take measures to prevent wildlife incursions, and the emphasis would be on setting up hanging solar fences. He said a 10-km-long solar power fence would be set up under the Kasaragod Forest range, and an elephant protection trench would be dug for 10 km. N.A. Nellikunnu, M. Rajagopalan, C.H. Kunhambu, E.

He was replying to a submission by T.J. Vinod, MLA. The project to rejuvenate Konthuruthy, Chilavannoor, Edappally, Thevara, Thevara-Perandoor and Market canals (all of which were navigable till over half a century ago) in Ernakulam had got the in-principle nod of the government. Mr. Vijayan said the social impact assessment for the project had been completed. A total of 1,641 families are expected to be affected by the project. The rehabilitation of 257 families without title deeds has been entrusted with Bhavanam Foundation Kerala. Tender proceedings are on to build seven 10-storey apartments in Kakkanad to rehabilitate them. Land acquisition is in progress for the rest. Survey As many as 178 families on the banks of the Konthuruthy canal will be rehabilitated under the project. The District Collector and the Kochi Corporation Secretary have been directed to submit a survey report, based on which Bhavanam Foundation will prepare an estimate and initiate follow-up action. The Kochi Corporation, which will bear the rental expenses, will handle temporary rehabilitation of families.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/257-families-near-six-canals-being-rehabilitated-says-cm/article35779684.ece
07 August 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Hope not lost for extension of Seaport-Airport Road||Even as little progress has been made in establishing full-fledged seaport connectivity of Seaport-Airport Road, the deadlocked land acquisition process to extend the corridor from HMT Junction to the international airport at Nedumbassery has got a shot in the arm, with the Naval Armament Depot (NAD) expressing willingness to surrender land for the extension project, in return for the Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala (RBDCK) widening HMT-NAD Road. Hassles associated with acquiring 5.30 acres owned by NAD and four acres owned by HMT have been cited as reasons for the inordinate delay in the airport extension of the corridor. Sources in the RBDCK, which built the 11.50-km HMT Junction-Irumpanam stretch of Seaport-Airport Road 17 years ago and handed it over to the PWD later, exuded confidence that the NAD-owned land would be handed over in the coming months. “We hope HMT too surrenders the land necessary for the airport extension, since it was once government-owned land and had been handed over free of cost to the agency for industrial activity which did not take place as envisaged. The State government is making efforts to reach a negotiated settlement, although a litigation is pending before the Supreme Court. In addition, the KWA ought to relocate a pipeline on HMT-NAD Road,” official sources said. The social impact assessment (SIA) for the airport extension is over. The notification process under Section 11(1) of the Land Acquisition Act is under way. It will be followed by Revenue officials issuing compensation for people whose plots were acquired. From HMT Junction, the airport extension will pass through Mahilayalam and Chowara, before ending near the airport. Even as the RBDCK widened the 2.5-km HMT Junction-Bharata Mata College stretch into four-lane, most other junctions on the rest of the stretch that ends at Irumpanam are severely congested, despite vacant space being available. The worst is the plight of Collectorate Junction, where bellmouths on all four sides are extremely narrow, with the result that traffic congestion is the norm. The PWD, which owns the road now, too has made little headway in widening the rest of the stretch.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hope-not-lost-for-extension-of-seaport-airport-road/article35779689.ece
07 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Rosewood felling: NGT seeks report||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has called for an action-taken report on illegal felling of centuries-old rosewood trees from revenue land assigned to farmers for cultivation in the forested Wayanad district. The Southern Bench of the tribunal comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member K. Satyagopal took suo motu notice of media reports that the Revenue and Forest departments had failed to check illegal tree felling in South Muttil village in Wayanad. A similar loss of protected trees was also reported from other districts, it said. Impact on forest ecology The Bench said the matter required the intervention of the Tribunal, as the valuable trees were protected under the Kerala Preservation of Trees Act, 1986. Besides attracting provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, the reported tree felling also comes under the purview of the Environment Protection Act, 1986, as the felling of huge number of trees from the area will have an impact on forest ecology and wildlife, it added. The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), Thiruvananthapuram, and the respective District Collectors have to submit independent reports on allegations of illegal tree felling. They need to assess the extent of damage caused to the environment on account of large-scale removal of protected trees. The officials have to explain the prosecution steps initiated against those involved in the illegal act. The reports have to mention the loss caused to the government following tree felling by applying the principles of net present value (NPV) as observed by the Supreme Court in the T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad vs Union of India and Others case. Nature of violations It may also be reported whether any trees have been cut in the guise of the impugned government order. The government has to explain the nature of violations committed by those behind tree felling. The respondents have to submit their reports before August 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ngt-seeks-report-on-rosewood-felling/article35779670.ece

He was opposing the bail pleas of former Gujarat Director General of Police R.B. Sreekumar, two former police officers, and a former Intelligence Bureau (IB) officer in the ISRO espionage frame-up case. Mr. Narayanan said that if India had developed the technology, most countries would have approached India for launching satellites as there was a huge difference between the cost of their launch in India and the U.S. ISRO’s plans This had prompted the U.S. to see to it that India did not develop cryogenic engine technology. In 1992, the U.S. had threatened India and Russia not to facilitate a transfer of cryogenic engine technology from Russia to India, Mr. Narayanan said. In 1994, India renegotiated with Russia and inked an agreement to purchase cryogenic engines, without any associated technology transfer. The plan of the ISRO was to develop cryogenic technology indigenously after procuring cryogenic engines from Russia. He was appointed as Project Director and D. Sasikumaran as Assistant Director of the Cryogenic Engine Development Project. The U.S. was under the impression that Russia had transferred production technology too to India along with the cryogenic engine sale. Hence, the U.S. was waiting for an opportunity to thwart the possible development of cryogenic engines by India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nambi-narayanan-sees-us-hand-in-isro-spy-case/article35779708.ece
07 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Shock at Messi’s potential Barcelona exit||Football fans were sent into a tailspin on Thursday night when news broke about the potential exit of Lionel Messi from FC Barcelona. Social media groups of fans literally exploded in the wake of what could be perceived as one of the most momentous developments in the football world in recent times. Though it was initially written off as a rumour, the Club shortly confirmed in an official statement that Messi might indeed leave owing to “financial and structural obstacles”. For FC Barcelona fans in Kerala, it seemed like a dream turning into a nightmare as their association, Cules of Kerala, was officially recognised by the Catalan Giants only last month. “Fans are in deep shock and can hardly believe it as it was least expected. People like me were drawn to the club by Messi though the loyalty towards the club has outgrown since then,” said Anjan Kumar. Nishad Razaq, State president of Cules of Kerala, could hardly sleep for a couple of hours, as he was kept awake by anxious fans on social media. “It [Messi’s departure] will definitely leave a small dent in the fan base, as he has been the club’s icon for so long. But it may be sorted out, as informed sources observe that it could be a pressure tactic by the club to force LaLiga, the top division in Spanish football, to relax the strict wage regulations to retain Messi in the league and thereby its brand value,” he said. On social media, it rained memes as Barca fans were not exactly the favourite of rival fans. A particularly viral one said 99% of Barcelona fans were now free agents, hinting that a majority of the club’s fans could switch allegiance with Messi. (Free agent in footballing parlance means a player who has run out of contract with current team and is free to join another club.) The more optimistic of rival fans came up with photoshopped images of Messi in their team’s jersey. Rahul Babu, a Manchester United fan, perfectly summed up the influence of Messi on FC Barcelona. “I don’t remember seeing a Barcelona fan’s jersey without Messi for a long time,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shock-at-messis-potential-barcelona-exit/article35779687.ece

The district mission is planning three-day fairs in the lead-up to Onam at the level of all Community Development Societies (CDS) in strict compliance with the COVID-19 protocol. “We have given 42 CDSs the infrastructure to set up fairs, in addition to Rs. 12,000 to all rural CDSs and Rs. 15,000 to all urban CDSs. These fairs remain the sole lifeline for the 4,000-odd micro-entrepreneurs and 2,000-odd activity groups, which get activated during festivals seasons and such other occasions with potential for doing business,” said S. Ranjini, district coordinator, District Kudumbashree Mission. Kit distribution The order for contributing chips and ‘sharkaravaratty’ to one lakh Onam kits of Supplyco has come as a boon to women entrepreneurs during these tough times. With Supplyco distributing 4 lakh kits in Ernakulam alone, they are expecting more orders in the days to come. Though the district mission used to hold a mega district-level fair during the Onam season, it has not yet received consent from the authorities for holding it this time in view of the pandemic restrictions. Even the 101 Onam fairs by CDSs are in a shroud of uncertainty considering that they will be allowed subject to restrictions at the local body level depending on COVID-19 spread. “We have decided to focus on the products of our units steeped in loss owing to the pandemic and that of our joint liability groups. We have also asked CDSs to come up with innovative marketing ideas like delivery of special Onam kits at the doorstep,” said Ms. Ranjini. The entrepreneurs remain desperate for Onam fairs to be held considering the devastation they have faced by way of complete washout of potential markets owing to the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kudumbashree-entrepreneurs-pin-hopes-on-onam-fairs/article35779681.ece

07 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Vadakara-Kainatty NH stretch a nightmare for motorists||The absence of street lights and faulty functioning of traffic signal lights have emerged as the biggest safety threat for motorists on the Vadakara-Kainatty stretch of the Kozhikode-Kannur national highway. Faulty speed detection cameras are yet to be replaced on the accident-prone stretches of the highway. Recently, four persons succumbed to injuries in freak road accidents on the route. More than 15 persons have suffered grave injuries. Youths from the area allege that there is no permanent mechanism to attend to emergency repairing works of traffic signal lights. They also say that the street protests organised by them to draw the attention of the authorities to the issue are yet to evoke any response. “Night riding is tough on the route because of the absence of street lights. Since this monsoon season, many motorists have been complaining of poor road visibility in accident-prone areas,” says Poikayil Venuraj, a taxi driver from Nadapuram. He also points out that vehicles parked along the road double the chances of accidents. The reluctance of local police stations to post sufficient number of officials for traffic control is a hurdle for the smooth movement of vehicles through junctions where signal lights are out of order. Drivers in the area say the absence of police in junctions encourages many erring motorists to defy speed limit regulations and ignore lane discipline. Though a few local youth organisation workers recently submitted a memorandum to the Public Works Minister in this regard, the department is yet to take any action. The call for filling some of the large potholes, which emerged as death traps for motorists, also went in vain. A local body member from Vadakara says some of the avenue trees were found posing a threat to the safety of motorists on the national highway. “There should be a safety audit at the earliest on the route so that it could address many issues on time,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vadakara-kainatty-nh-stretch-a-nightmare-for-motorists/article35779678.ece
07 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Rise in suicides causes concern||Despite the active functioning of helplines and counselling services for supporting those in distress, the recent spike in the number of unnatural deaths continues to be a concern for the district amid its fight to survive the pandemic threat. The death of nine persons within a week has come as a shocker for many in the counselling field. To the dismay of the Health Department, some of those who took the extreme step had been tested positive for COVID-19. Psychiatric counsellors say one of the major reasons behind the suicides was the pandemic-induced financial crisis which dealt a heavy blow to many low-income families. Mental illness too was a reason. The death of a father and his mentally-challenged daughter at Ramanattukara last week was one of such shocking incidents in the district. According to their family sources, the father was in a miserable situation as he could not continue the treatment of his daughter owing to the pandemic-induced financial crisis and curbs on movement. “Free counselling service has been in place since the initial days of COVID-19. It has been found helpful for many to overcome trauma during quarantine period and treatment,” says a nun who is currently part of a leading counselling network in the State. She also points out that family members of COVID-19 patients should be mindful of changes of their dear and near ones after their recovery and seek medical support in case they show symptoms of depression. Financial constraints are the villains in low-income families. Small-scale traders and taxi drivers are the most vulnerable group as the pandemic crisis had hit many of them badly. “On Thursday, two autorickshaw drivers were found dead in two different spots in Kozhikode district. There were many such incidents in other parts of the State. It was mainly the extreme restrictions during the lockdown period that claimed their lives,” says N. Sajid, an autorickshaw driver from Vadakara. He adds that the mental and financial support extended by drivers’ associations had come as a relief for many in the field. Some of the hoteliers in the district also attribute the cause of increasing unnatural deaths to the worsening financial situation. A hotel entrepreneur from Vadakara had ended his life recently due to financial problems. According to them, a temporary aid or waiver of taxes with retrospective effect by the government will give the much-needed relief for many ailing segments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rise-in-suicides-causes-concern/article35779679.ece

Kunhalikutty, MLA. The IUML leadership will meet here on Saturday to sort out the issue even as detractors of Mr. Kunhalikutty continued their onslaught on the party. The meeting will take place at the IUML office here. Party sources said the leadership would consider taking disciplinary action against IUML State president Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal’s son Syed Mueenali Shihab, who had spoken in public against Mr. Kunhalikutty. Mr. Mueenali, vice president of the Muslim Youth League, had said in a press conference at Kozhikode on Thursday that Mr. Kunhalikutty was responsible for the Enforcement Directorate (ED) summoning his father in connection with an alleged fraud in Chandrika newspaper. He also had alleged that Mr. Kunhalikutty’s actions had pressured his father so much that he fell sick and had to seek medical aid. Mr. Thangal is currently under treatment for physical ailment in a private hospital in Kozhikode. IUML sources said his condition was stable. Panakkad family meet Meanwhile, the Syed Shihab family of Panakkad is also likely to hold a meeting on Saturday to discuss the situation that has brought a shadow over the family.

Kunhalikutty. Although no leader within the party has come out in support of Mr. Mueenali, a small group that opposes Mr. Kunhalikutty and his style of functioning has begun work to strengthen the allegations raised by the Thangal scion. Mr. Mueenali is a vice president of the Muslim Youth League. However, his latest allegations against Mr. Kunhalikutty, linking him with a money laundering case against party mouthpiece Chandrika daily, have brought so much damage to the party. Silence was the reply from several leaders when the media approached them for their response. “We will speak at the appropriate forum,” they said. Party sources on Friday said Chandrika ’s finance manager P.M.A. Sameer, who was a party State secretariat member, was entrusted to appear before the Enforcement Directorate as Hyderali Thangal was in hospital.

The Fort Police have taken the two men, habitual offenders who have been accused in various cases in the past, into custody. The accused have been identified as Rafeeq, 34, from Vallakadavu and Rashid, 41, from Karimadom. Meanwhile, doctors under the aegis of the Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association (KGMOA), are boycotting outpatient duties at the hospital and are staging a protest against the repeated attacks on doctors. According to Fort Circle Inspector Rakesh, the duo had arrived at the hospital around 12.30 a.m. on Friday and demanded that they be treated. Since around 10 others were waiting for treatment, and with the injuries of the duo being visibly minor, Malu Murali, the doctor on duty, reportedly asked them to wait for their turn. However, the duo refused to wait and allegedly assaulted her and showered expletives. Doctor’s arm twisted According to the police, they twisted her arm during the assault. A security staff member who came running to her rescue also came under attack. Both of them sustained injuries in the attack. Minister V. Sivankutty said no attack against health personnel would be tolerated. He said stringent action would be taken. Two days ago, a doctor who was on duty at the Parassala Taluk Hospital was attacked by a gang of four people in an inebriated condition after they were asked to follow COVID-19 protocols, leading to similar protests from doctors. Doctors have been pointing at the relative lack of security while on night duty.

They were soon rescued and freed by members of the Forest Department’s rapid response team (RRT). Only a short distance away from the Neyyar Deer Rehabilitation Centre, forest fringe areas including Kuttichal, Kottoor and Nettukaltheri have reported presence of spotted deer. The stray deer population has been on the rise in the region after the department had released 30 deer to the wild in 2005 in view of the increasing count of deer at the centre. Leaping into the well The particular incident occurred near Kuttichal native Shajida’s house around 12 p.m. when her son witnessed the pair taking a leap into the 10-foot-deep well. On being alerted, the Thiruvananthapuram RRT led by section forest officer Gangadharan rushed to the area and commenced rescue operation of the two animals. Within two minutes, the team saved the animals, one at a time, using a rescue net. They were later released into the forest. Both deer were found to be uninjured. Not rare Paruthippally range forest officer Shaji Jose T.F. said while the presence of deer was not rare in the region, it was uncommon to receive calls for rescuing them from open wells.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/two-deer-rescued-from-well/article35779855.ece

UDF legislators walked out of the House after Speaker M.B. Rajesh rejected an adjournment notice moved by Congress legislator K. Babu to discuss the issue. They slammed the order as ‘high-handed and outrageous.’ Mr. Babu said the government urgently required a dose of the ‘common sense’ vaccine. Health Minister Veena George said the restrictions were not forever. However, they were necessary to blunt the accelerating spread of the highly virulent Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. More than half the State’s population remained vulnerable to the disease. The second COVID-19 surge was yet to abate, and the spectre of a third loomed. The Supreme Court had warned the government against any relaxation that would expose citizens to the virus. The State has stepped up vaccination and enhanced testing. Ms. George said the government had decided on the fresh directives after detailed contemplation. High population density, lifestyle diseases, and increasing number of elderly people were major causes of worry with regard to the COVID-19 spread, she said. “Though the lockdown restrictions have been lifted, the government is forced to continue other simplified curbs due to these factors,” she said. ‘Rs. 500 every three days’ Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said that as per the order, an unvaccinated person would have to shell out a minimum of Rs. 500 once every three days to get tested for COVID-19. The decree did not seem to apply to liquor retailers and bar owners.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udf-terms-new-curbs-anti-people/article35779711.ece
07 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||State revises treatment guidelines||The State has brought out a revised treatment protocol for COVID-19, based on the latest evidence and essentially focussing on mortality reduction, especially in those considered to be at the highest risk of developing complications. “We have highlighted a therapeutic stewardship of COVID-19, which essentially means the right drug at the right time, dosage, and for the right duration, to the right patient. The protocol clearly says antibiotics like Azithromycin or vitamins are not indicated for COVID-19 patients. The primary aim of this revised protocol is to ensure that mortality is further brought down by focussing on the highest risk groups like pregnant women and those with end-stage organ damage due to diabetes,” says R. Aravind, Head of Infectious Diseases, Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College. For categories There is no change in the risk stratification of patients as mild, moderate and severe. The mild and moderate category patients would be re-assessed every 24-48 hours. Category A, mild patients need isolation, rest and intensive monitoring and there is no role for antibiotics or vitamins for them. In category B, moderate patients, focus is on those with the highest risk factors. Those with the “highest risk factors” are defined as diabetes patients with an HbA1C levels over 10 and those with end-stage organ disease due to diabetes. The new protocol has removed drugs like Ivermectin, Favipiravir, and Hydroxychloroquine that were not really supported by evidence; Remdesivir has been retained on the basis of emergency use authorisation; Tocilizumab remains. The new addition on this list is JAK inhibitors (Baricitinib/Tofacitinib). Pregnant women Another highlight is a separate chapter on critical-care guidelines for treating pregnant women. Kerala had seen mortality among pregnant women contracting COVID-19 shooting up in the second wave. The other important chapter deals with Multisystem Inflammatory Disease in Adults. The protocol also stresses on infection control and antibiotic stewardship.  The focus is on the right drug at the right time, dosage, and for the right duration, to the right patient, so as to reduce mortality||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/state-revises-treatment-guidelines/article35779714.ece

07 August 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Drive to check COVID spread||As part of intensifying measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the district, a joint drive by sectoral magistrates, rapid response teams and the police will be held in the district. A meeting convened by COVID-19 special officer A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish on Friday took decision in this regard. The special officer gave instructions to the rural and city police to bring stringent measures to control crowds at functions, including weddings. Steps should be taken to sanitise the markets in the district. Screening tests on the coastal belt would be increased. He gave instructions to the District Medical Officer and other officials concerned to improve the facilities at the domiciliary care centres on the coastal belt. An emergency meeting of health workers, traders, police, and office-bearers of the 13 panchayats and municipalities of the coastal belt was convened by the COVID Special Officer to discuss strategies to bring down the test positivity rate at the coastal areas. “The coming two weeks are critical. People have to be careful against the spread of the pandemic,” the meeting observed. Meanwhile, various traders’ organisations expressed their willingness to cooperate with the guidelines of the government to check crowds at business establishments. However, they raised apprehensions about conditions such as RT-PCR-negative certificates and vaccination certificates for allowing entry to shops. 2,167 cases The district reported 2,167 fresh COVID-19 cases on Friday. In all, 2,584 patients recovered from the disease. The test positivity rate on Friday was 14.54%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/drive-to-check-covid-spread/article35779854.ece
07 August 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Thread-winged lacewing discovered in Kerala||Researchers at the Shadpada Entomology Research Center (SERL), Christ College, Irinjalakuda, have discovered Thread-winged lacewing (family: Nemopteridae; order: Neuroptera) for the first time in the State.  Croce filipennis is the species that have been found from Irinjalakuda in Thrissur and Pudunagaram in Palakkad. Research student T.B. Suryanarayanan and research supervisor and Assistant Professor Bijoy C. discovered the species.  Croce filipennis is the only species under the subfamily Crocinae reported from India, says Dr. Bijoy. Neuroptera is one of the major groups of holometabolous insects, which includes various structurally and biologically heterogeneous members. Nemopteridae is an exciting family of Neuroptera due to their attractiveness and mosquito-like appearance. They feed on soft-bodied insects, including agricultural pests, in their larval and adult stages and are thus useful in biological control measures. Nemopteridae comprises two extant subfamilies, Crocinae (thread-wings) and Nemopterinae (spoon and ribbon-wings). Ribbon-like hind wings The family is distinguished by their elongated ribbon or thread-like hind wings and specialised mouthparts with a long rostrum for pollen and nectar collection. This family is called Thread-winged lacewing because of long ribbon-like hind wings. “Even though adult Nemopterids are obligate nectar and pollen feeders, the larvae are specialised predators, with elongated mandibles and maxillary laciniae adapted for piercing and ingesting the internal tissues of small arthropods,” Dr. Bijoy points out. The subfamily Crocinae is marked by its long thread-like hind wings that function as tactile sensors and mate recognition systems. The larvae of Crocinae found among dust and refuse on floors, under-rock overhangs or hollow tree trunks, while the adults are mainly nocturnal and crepuscular.  Scanning of the literature revealed the absence of Nemopteridae from Kerala. So, the discovery of Croce filipennis forms the first record of the family Nemopteridae in the State, Dr. Bijoy adds. The finding is published in the national scientific journal Records of the Zoological Survey of India. The research was conducted with financial assistance from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/thread-winged-lacewing-discovered-in-kerala/article35779907.ece

Sources in the party said that the Chief Minister had sent the list to the party high command, and it would be announced as soon as the central leadership approves it. Meanwhile, several Ministers continued lobbying for preferred portfolios, which may have delayed the allocation process, the sources said. While many are keen to retain the portfolios they handled under the previous dispensation, many others are also aspiring for key portfolios such as Public Works, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, Power, Water Resources, and Bengaluru Development. Meanwhile, those who failed to make it to the Cabinet — Ramesh Jarkiholi, C.P.

Chandrababu Naidu to blame the State government for the Amara Raja Batteries reported move to shift its base to Tamil Nadu. Addressing the media here, Ms. Roja, who was former APIIC chairperson, said that the A.P. Pollution Control Board (APPCB) had issued notices to 54 industrial units in the State, directing them to comply with the parameters of pollution control. “Unfortunately, Mr. Naidu has chosen to make it a political issue, unmindful of the safety of the lives of human beings and pollution caused to air, water and land in the surroundings of the factory,” Ms. Roja said. The State government was never opposed to the functioning of factories as long as they complied with with the APPCB norms, she said, and added that the government never wanted the Amara Raja factory to close down its unit in the State. ‘Adhere to HC directive’ Ms. Roja asked the factory management to adhere to the A.P. High Court’s directions on pollution control and keep in view the public interest involved.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/incorrect-to-blame-govt-for-amara-raja-exit-says-roja/article35779841.ece
07 August 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Commission asks Rlys. to pay compensation to passenger||A consumer commission directed South Central Railway (SCR) to pay a passenger over Rs. 14 lakh for jewellery and Rs. 3 lakh for silk garments stolen while she was in the train, and cough up a compensation of Rs. 50,000. The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission-II, Hyderabad, was dealing with a complaint filed by Sheetal Kulkarni against the General Manager of SCR. The complainant stated that on August 21, 2017, she and her mother-in-law boarded the Kacheguda-Yesvantpur Express to attend her sister-in-law’s engagement. They had gold and silver ornaments, including engagement rings of the soon-to-be-bride, weighing 530 gm, and silk garments worth Rs. 3 lakh in their luggage. After reaching their destination, they found the items missing from their luggage, and saw that the bag was slit open from the bottom. They approached the rural police station at Yesvantpur and lodged a complaint. She claimed that since the SCR was paid extra charges for reservation of seats, they are duty-bound to provide safety to their passengers, and their belongings. For their part, the SCR denied all allegations, even as they pointed out that a complaint with the police was lodged six hours after the incident. They contended that the said instance was not covered by consumer laws. The SCR is liable only when instances come under Section 100 of the Railways Act of 1989, which largely deals with the administration not being responsible for loss of property, unless a railway official has booked the luggage and issued a receipt. Taking the evidence and arguments placed on record, the commission stated that every railway passenger is a consumer, thus, attracting consumer laws. It cited judgments of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, and the Supreme CourT. The commission also noted that the complainant had suspected three persons who were standing near their luggage for the theft, even as it pointed out that the SCR had not filed records of officials who were deputed that day, nor the statements of the coach attendants and travelling ticket examiner. It stated that the SCR was negligent in preventing ‘unauthorised’ persons into the coach who managed to divert the attention of the complainant and her family, resulting in the theft. It also imposed costs of Rs. 5,000 on SCR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/commission-asks-rlys-to-pay-compensation-to-passenger/article35779069.ece

It is slated to come into effect from October 14. The State has sought the postponement of the 13th meeting (emergency) of the board citing the cases involving Telangana coming up before the National Green Tribunal, Southern Zone Bench, Chennai and Supreme Court over the contempt issue in the matter of carrying out of work by Andhra Pradesh on its Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme (RLIS) and on its withdrawal petition over the Krishna water sharing in the Supreme Court on August 9.

07 August 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||KCR to announce loan waiver on August 15||A meeting of State government with 42 bankers was informed on Friday that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao would formally announce crop loan waiver in the range of Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 50,000 on August 15. In the first phase, the government had waived all loans borrowed by farmers up to Rs. 25,000. A Cabinet meeting recently decided to waive loans above Rs. 25,000 and below Rs. 50,000 this year. Friday’s meeting chaired by Finance Minister T. Harish Rao was a sequel to this decision. Addressing the meeting, Mr. Harish Rao asked the bankers to ensure that the loan accounts of farmers showed zero balance after the government released the money from August 16. The farmers should be eligible for fresh loans after that. The money released by government should not be adjusted against any other debit balances of farmers. He said the government would release Rs. 2,006 crore to six lakh farmers in this phase of loan waiver. The bankers and government officials should work in coordination to credit the amount to eligible farmers. Bulk SMS messages in the name of the Chief Minister should go to farmers’ phones after the money was credited to accounts. The messages should also announce that the farmers were eligible for fresh loans hereafter. Parallelly, the banks should also also send separate SMS messages to farmers that the outstandings from them were received. Agriculture Minister S. Niranjan Reddy asked the banks to extend loan waiver to farmers unconditionally. The meeting was attended by Principal Finance Secretary K. Ramakrishna Rao, Agriculture Secretary Raghunandan Rao and other senior finance and agriculture officers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kcr-to-announce-loan-waiver-scheme-on-august-15/article35779649.ece

07 August 2021||KADAPA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Two women killed in Kadapa||Two women were hacked to death in D. Nelaturu village in Brahmamgari Matham mandal of Kadapa district on Friday. The police suspect that it could be part of the family revenge drama that unfolded in 2019. When the residents of D. Nelaturu found Anjanamma and her daughter Lakshmi Devi dead in a pool of blood, they alerted the police. The incident is believed to be a sequel to the death of Anjanamma’s daughter-in-law Charishma. Charishma’s parents had filed a case against Anjanamma and Lakshmi Devi then, dubbing it as a case of murder for dowry. The deceased girl’s father Ramanjaneya Raju had even buried the body in Anjanamma’s house and built a ‘Samadhi’ there. Upon getting bail, the two women decided to stay in B. Matham town, away from their D. Nelaturu village, to avoid friction. When the two women reached their home on Friday after more than a year, they were found dead at their home within a few hours. Police suspect it to be the handiwork of Charishma’s father Ramanjaneya Raju and his younger brother Srinivasa Raju, who had allegedly vowed to take revenge on the duo. The police registered a case based on a complaint received from the local VRO, as the victims’ family members were not immediately available.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/two-women-hacked-to-death-family-revenge-suspected/article35779832.ece

07 August 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Marital rape a ground for divorce, rules Kerala HC||Holding that marital rape is a ground for divorce, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court observed on Friday that treating a wife’s body as something owned by the husband and committing sexual acts against her will was nothing but “marital rape”. The Bench of Justice A. Muhamed Mustaque and Justice Kauser Edappagath further observed that just because the law did not recognise marital rape under penal law, it did not inhibit the court from recognising the same as a form of cruelty to grant divorce. The court made the observation while dismissing an appeal of a man challenging a family court order allowing his wife’s plea for divorce on grounds of marital rape. ‘A choice not to suffer’ The court said sex in married life was the reflection of the spouses’ intimacy. In this case, the wife was subjected to sexual perversions against her will. A spouse in a marriage had a choice, a choice not to suffer, which was fundamental to the autonomy guaranteed under natural law and the Constitution. The law could not compel a spouse to suffer against his or her wish by denial of divorce by the court.  In matrimony, the spouse possesses privacy as an invaluable right inherent in him or her as an individual. Marital privacy was intrinsically connected to individual autonomy and any intrusion, physically or otherwise, into such space would diminish privacy. This essentially would constitute cruelty, the court added. The Bench also held that if a spouse had insatiable urge for wealth and sex, that too would amount to cruelty. In this case, the insatiable urge for wealth and sex of the husband had forced the wife to take a decision for divorce. His licentious and profligate conduct could not be considered part of normal conjugal life.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/marital-rape-a-ground-for-divorce-rules-kerala-hc/article35779061.ece

Rajasekhara Reddy. At a press conference here on Friday, the TDP leaders alleged that after the Congress government came to power in 2004, it launched the ‘Jalayagnam’ programme, under which the Pulichintala project was the first to be started. “The project was taken up by Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, and he had termed it his dream project and drew up the agreement in October, 2004. Work began in June 2005. However, the quality of the work was compromised by the introduction of the EPIC model - Engineering, Procurement, and Construction,” Mr. Srinivasulu alleged. “The foundation was reduced by five metres instead of a concrete structure, and many portions were made of earthen soil,” the TDP leader said. In the main structure, in the 754 m span of the spillway, 33 gates were first proposed but later the number was reduced to 24, only to siphon money from the project,” the TDP leader alleged. “The project gate broke and was washed away because of a lack of quality in work. About 34 tmcft of water has gone into the sea. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy may not be personally responsible for this, but his father and other leaders at that time who compromised on the quality of work in order to secure commissions are responsible for what happened,” Mr. Srinivasulu alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysr-responsible-for-pulichintala-gate-collapse/article35779825.ece
07 August 2021||NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Storage up in Penna basin reservoirs, thanks to floods in Krishna river||The prospects of major reservoirs in the Penna basin getting copious water for a second year in a row has brightened, thanks to floods in river Krishna during the early phase of the southwest monsoon. The storage in Somasila and Kandaleru has started improving with both the reservoirs getting inflows from Krishna basin in August itself. As a result, the storage in the reservoirs in the Penna basin is now a comfortable 160.56 tmcft as against 72.32 tmcft during the corresponding period last year, according to data compiled by the State government. Inflows Somasila reservoir, the lifeline of SPSR Nellore district, received an inflow of 10,648 cusecs on Friday. The discharge was maintained at 7,300 cusecs. With this, the storage improved to 53.58 tmcft of water (68.69%), leaving a flood cushion of 24.42 tmcft. The storage in Kandaleru reservoir also went up to 37.88 tmcft (55.68%) following an inflow of 4,300 cusecs. The reservoir still has a flood cushion of 30.15 tmcft now. If the floods in river Krishna continued without a break, the reservoirs in the Penna basin would surplus in the next two months, sources in the Irrigation Department said. As a result, the prospects of Chennai metropolis getting its full quota of Krishna water this year improved. With the available storage, water release to Chennai is now being maintained at about 1,500 cusecs by the irrigation authorities, he said. After accounting for seepage and evaporation losses, over 750 cusecs of water gets added at the Poondi reservoir in neighbouring Tamil Nadu. “We will be able to release water to the metropolis without any hitch this year too,” Telugu Ganga Project Chief Engineer K. Harinarayana Reddy told The Hindu . In the last 25 years, it was for the first time that Chennai realised 8.05 tmcft of water last year. It was a record of sorts. During the last water year, the Kandaleru Reservoir, which augments drinking water supply to, among other cities, Chennai and Tirupati, received a maximum of 65.144 tmcft from the Somasila Reservoir across the Penna river for the first time after its construction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/storage-up-in-penna-basin-reservoirs-thanks-to-floods-in-krishna-river/article35779829.ece

Nineteen people, including two pilots, died on August 7, 2020, after Air India Express’ Boeing 737 aircraft fell into a gorge while landing and split into two parts. The flight was carrying passengers from Dubai under the Vande Bharat Mission for repatriation of Indians stranded abroad due to travel restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19. Days after the crash, the Director General of Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) appointed a five-member team to probe the accident. The team was tasked with completing the probe “preferably” within five months. “The investigation by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is in progress and is likely to be completed by August 2021,” Minister of State for Civil Aviation V.K. Singh said in the Lok Sabha on Thursday to a question from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. Since the accident, wide-body operations at the airport have been suspended and a decision on their resumption will depend on the outcome of the probe, the Minister added. The airline has paid a total of Rs. 3.9 crore as interim compensation for those who died in the accident as well as those who were injured. This includes a sum of Rs. 1.7 crore for the 19 who lost their lives. Air India Express also paid a final compensation to 73 passengers amounting to Rs. 60.35 crore. The airline is awaiting acceptance offers from 92 injured passengers and the next of kin of 19 deceased passengers. Of these, 25 injured passengers and the next of kin of 18 deceased have engaged a UAE-based law firm to represent them directly before the reinsurers, Mr. Singh told Parliament. The compensation-related liabilities of the aircraft are insured with New India Assurance, which in turn has re-insured them in the international market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/probe-report-on-kozhikode-air-crash-likely-this-month/article35779056.ece

Ramesh Naidu alleged here on Friday. Moreover, the State government was forcing closure of existing industrial units run by groups promoted by leaders of opposition parties, he alleged while referring to the closure notices served by the State Pollution Control Board on Amara Raja Batteries.

MEIL, in a press release, said that every year, 3,000 TMC of water from the Godavari goes waste into the sea. This is much higher than the water consumed in Andhra Pradesh. If this water is utilised, Andhra Pradesh has the potential to develop and move forward in all sectors. With this in view, the government has decided to build a hydroelectric power plant along with the Polavaram project. The Polavaram project will store 194 TMC of water once its construction is completed. Out of this, 120 TMC of water will be used for power generation and irrigation purposes. The remaining 70 TMC of water will be stored and can be used for cultivation and drinking water needs of the people in the Godavari river basin, especially in the East and West Godavari and Krishna districts, MEIL said. The Polavaram Hydroelectric Power Station is being built with a capacity of 960 MW of hydroelectric capacity. It will have 12 vertical Keplan turbines with a capacity of 80 MW each. For these, 12 pressure tunnels will have to be dug. Each tunnel will be 145 m long and nine metres deep. These will have 12 generator transformers, each with a capacity of 100 MW. For the power project, a 206 m-long approach channel, and 294 m wide, will have to be dug.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pressure-tunnel-work-begins-at-polavaram/article35779382.ece

07 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jagan claiming credit for welfare schemes: BJP||The Union government is funding a slew of welfare schemes, but the YSRCP dispensation in the State is claiming entire credit for it by giving every programme a new name, BJP State president Somu Veerraju has alleged. Addressing the media here on Friday, Mr. Veerraju said the ‘Nadu - Nedu’ programme that focussed on development of schools was in fact a part of the Union government’s Sarva Siksha Abhiyan first launched by former Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee. “The Centre provides Rs. 5,000 crore annually to the State for development of schools and to ensure education is accessible to all. While its share is 60%, the State is expected to fund the remaining. This money is being diverted to the Nadu-Nedu programme,” he said. Referring to the housing scheme, Mr. Veerraju said the Centre had sanctioned 16 lakh houses for the State and promised to give Rs. 1.9 lakh for each house built. “But Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is claiming that the houses are being built by his government. In the ‘Jagananna Housing Scheme’, the State’s contribution is only 40%,” Mr. Veerraju said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jagan-claiming-credit-for-welfare-schemes-bjp/article35779851.ece

The seized ganja is estimated to be worth over Rs. 2 crore in some of the northern States. Based on credible information, a team led by Chodavaram Circle Inspector Syed Ilyas Mohammed intercepted a lorry at Garikabandhi check-post, where they seized the ganja. According to Sub-Inspector of V. Madugula police station, P. Rama Rao, two accused Chikkan Pradhan and Chandan had come from Odisha a week ago and procured the ganja from interior parts of the Agency area from the district. They loaded the ganja in a lorry and were heading to Bhubaneswar from Paderu. “In order to escape from the police checks, the accused dumped loads of overripe pineapples, so that the odour would camouflage the smell of ganja. However, after thorough checks, we recovered ganja bags,” Mr. Rama Rao said. The police have recovered 69 bags of ganja, each weighing around 32 kg. Cases were booked and further investigation is on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/over-2000-kg-ganja-seized-two-persons-from-odisha-arrested/article35779933.ece
07 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Porata committee leaders submit memorandum||Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee representatives, under the leadership of its chairman Mantri Rajasekhar, submitted a memorandum to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman seeking continuation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) in the public sector. Earlier in the evening, Mr. Rajasekhar, INTUC leader Neerukonda Ramachandra Rao and others were stopped by the police at Sheelanagar, when they were on their way to the airport to submit a memorandum to the Finance Minister and to express their protest against privatisation of the steel plant. Meanwhile, CPI(M) district committee secretary K. Lokanadham condemned the arrest of the committee leaders Ganga Rao, Ayodhyaram and others, apart from the steel plant workers, who staged a protest on the entry road to the airport, much before the arrival of the Union Finance Minister. They only staged a peaceful protest and wanted to submit a memorandum to her, he said. Mr. Lokanadham alleged that the BJP government was showing a ‘step-motherly’ treatment towards Andhra Pradesh. The Centre had invested a mere Rs. 5 crore on the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant but the latter had paid back Rs. 51,000 crore to the Union and State governments in the form of dividends and taxes over the years. The failure of the Centre to allocate captive mines to VSP has resulted in the plant being pushed into losses. The Centre was now planning to handover the plant to corporate groups on a platter, he alleged. CPI(M) city secretary and 78th Ward Corporator Ganga Rao said that it was unfortunate that the Union government was unmoved by the agitation by steel workers in Delhi against the decision to sell the VSP. He warned that any Union Minister coming to the city would be stopped by the committee hereafter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/porata-committee-leaders-submit-memorandum/article35779934.ece

They sought exemption of capital gains tax to the extent of loan repayment, if a firm or promoter sells an asset or stocks to clear bank debt. The GST payment should be made payable on receipt of payment rather than on submission of invoice, they said. They noted that many PSUs and State government organisations are delaying payments for months due to which the firms are unable to pay GST without receipt of principal, and the various State governments are not even paying interest, whereas the firms are forced to pay interest and penalty on delay in paying GST. The credit rating of companies should not be affected due to their performance during the lockdown, they said. Other demands include: release of SEIS and MEIS incentives for the years 2019-2020 and 2020 - 2021 to improve cash flow of the firms and directing banks not to levy foreclosure charges on loan accounts for one year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/industry-seeks-fms-support-to-improve-eodb-ranking/article35779937.ece

07 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Centre to stop allocation of anti-Black Fungus drug||The Centre has decided to discontinue allocation of anti-Mucormycosis drug Liposomal Amphotericin B to States and Union Territories in view of decline in fresh cases of the fungal infection as well as improved availability of the medicine. “As the number of active patients have come down and supply position of the medicine has also improved considerably, it is felt that there is no more need and justification for allocation of Liposomal Amphotericin B to States and Union Territories,” the Department of Pharmaceuticals said. Conveying the decision to discontinue allocation, the Department in a communication to the Health Secretaries of States and Union Territories recently said the drug can be procured, as per their requirements, from the manufacturers and importers. The move marks a significant change from the situation prevailing a few months ago when a sharp increase in number of people contracting Mucormycosis or Black Fungus led to demand for the drug also soaring. Black marketing Amid the rush and panic, there were reports of black marketing of the injection that even at its selling price of around Rs. 6,000 per vial was out of the reach for many families. A patient required 4-6 doses of the injection daily, with the treatment lasting for two-three weeks. Sources said at the height of the crisis, unscrupulous elements were offering the injection at a Rs. 40-50,000 per vial. After the Centre stepped in, took control of Liposomal Amphotericin B supplies and started allocation of the drug for equitable distribution from May 11, Telangana formed a committee headed by a senior official to streamline the availability and ensure against diversion and black marketing. Hospitals had to make a requisition, sharing details of the patients, based on which the committee instructed the drug distributors to supply. Allocation Over 16.08 lakh vials of Liposomal Amphotericin B were allocated to States and Union Territories between May 11 and July 24, the department said. Towards augmenting availability, the Centre had also permitted more companies to manufacture the product. “The steps taken have resulted in increased availability and no instances of shortage are being reported. Manufacturers and importers are reporting they are not getting sufficient purchase orders from many States,” the Department said. Sources in pharma companies and trade confirmed demand for the drug and number of Mucormycosis cases have reduced substantially in recent weeks. While there is a glut, the Centre continues to monitor and seek data on the availability, a senior executive of a pharma firm said.

Rama Rao said that a total of 31 sewage treatment plants (STPs) are being developed phase-wise in Hyderabad. Speaking after laying the foundation stone for the STP being built by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) at Fathenagar on Friday, Mr. Rama Rao said Hyderabad stands ahead of eight major cities in the country in sewage treatment, by recycling 40% of its sewage. While the city produces 1,950 million litres sewage per day (MLD), the existing facilities of the water board can treat 772 MLD, through 25 existing plants, he said. These apart, 17 new STPs are being developed with an estimated cost of Rs. 1,280.87 crore in Kukatpally, Quthbullahpur, and Serilingampally circles with combined capacity to treat 376.5 MLD of sewage water. Fourteen more STPs will be developed in the coming days, taking the total number to 31, the Minister shared, adding that construction of these plants will be a watershed moment in development of Hyderabad as global city. Managing Director of water board M. Dana Kishore said that this was the first time after 2007 that the board is taking up such a mega project. State-of-the-art technology will be deployed in construction of the STPs, he said. A statement from HMWS&SB informed that the 31 STPs are being taken up in three packages. Under Package-I eight STPs are being built in Alwal, Malkajgiri, Kapra and Uppal circles with Rs. 1,230.21 crore, in order to treat 402.5 MLD of sewage water. Under Package-II, six STPs will be developed with an expenditure of Rs. 1,355.33 crore in Rajendranagar and L.B. Nagar circles, with capacities to treat 480.5 MLD of sewage water. The plants already under construction are taken up under Package-III, and they will be completed in the coming two years, the statement informed. The plant in Fathenagar is being developed under Package-III, in 11 acres, using sequential batch reactor technology. It has the capacity to treat 100 MLD of waste water generated from Balanagar, Jeedimetla, Kukatpally, Suraram and Jagadgirigutta, and let the treated water out into Musi river.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/31-stps-to-be-developed-in-city/article35779640.ece
07 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Survey to identify dalit beneficiaries||The State government started survey to ascertain the living economic status of dalit families in the villages spread across the State a day after Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao informally launched the prestigious scheme at his adopted village Vasalamarri in Yadadri-Bhongir district. The survey teams are understood to have been given questionnaire asking about the details of caste (sub-caste), number of members, their educational qualifications, employment details, earning members in the family and other issues to ascertain the economic status of the families. The survey teams have been asked to submit their reports to the Chief Secretary through the MPDO/Additional Collector concerned before August 14. The scheme, aimed at providing Rs. 10 lakh each to eligible families without bank guarantee, for starting their own entrepreneurship ventures is billed as the biggest cash transfer scheme in the country, if implemented. The scheme envisaged coverage of over 12 lakh out of the estimated 17 lakh dalit families in the State, involving direct transfer of Rs. 1 lakh crore. Though the government had announced its intentions to launch a dalit empowerment programme during the current year in the budget session, its extent and guidelines like modalities that would be adopted for identification of beneficiaries were not finalized. Although the Chief Minister had been repeatedly asserting that the government would cover all eligible families in a phased manner, there is no clarity on the extent of its implementation. An all-party meeting convened by the Chief Minister in June endorsed its implementation for 100 families in each of the 119 Assembly constituencies involving Rs. 1,190 crore initially. But, the situation has changed since then with the Chief Minister announcing his resolve to cover all eligible families, albeit in a phased manner. Doubts are also being raised about the manner in which finances would be mobilised for implementation of the programme as it would further burden the government. The State is currently spending more than 50% of the budgetary resources on a string of welfare programmes, including the flagship Rythu Bandhu with an estimated cost of over Rs. 15,000 crore every year. Senior officials said the operational guidelines could be finalised once the survey report was submitted as it would enable the officials concerned to assess the appropriate number of families that could be covered under the scheme and the budgetary outgo. There could be some eliminations of creamy layer like families of government employees based on the survey which would form the basis for implementation of the scheme. Steps would thereafter be taken for setting up centres for dalit enterprise in all the districts for skill development of aspiring entrepreneurs. A mechanism is being evolved for facilitating continuous monitoring of the progress made by the beneficiaries. Towards this end, the government is actively considering setting up programme implementation teams at different levels, drawing surplus staff from different departments, and the officials concerned are reportedly sounded out in this regard.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/survey-to-identify-dalit-beneficiaries/article35779654.ece
07 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Animal deaths on NHs make Mancherial youth cycle 2,700 km in 38 days||With a tricoloured message board carrying the slogan ‘Save Animals - Save Nature’ affixed to his bicycle, a backpack and a small camping tent mounted on the cycle pannier rack, a 31-year-old social activist from Mancherial, in north Telangana, who was moved by the deaths of animals due to rash driving on the national highways, pedalled 2,700 km on his bicycle to create awareness on the subject. Having no fluency in Hindi was not a barrier for Padma Sandesh Gupta as people could easily connect with the cause he espoused. His bicycle journey began on June 27 from his home in Mancherial to Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and he returned home on August 4, a record 38 days. The champion of this noble endeavour, who had pedalled such a long and arduous journey, had many encouraging encounters on his odyssey. Most of the interactions he had were with the truck drivers, taxi drivers and common public along the national highway at dhabas, petrol pumps and prominent towns and villages. ‘People concerned’ Speaking to The Hindu about his journey, Mr. Gupta said that people were concerned and appreciative of his effort. Some of the truck drivers also empathised with his cause and said blood spattering on the highways and flattering of the carcasses was an awful sight and urged the concerned authorities to clear the roads. “Not just authorities, even people can stop their vehicles, pick up the carcasses and place them aside. It would be great if they can spare some time to give the murdered animals a decent last rite by burning them in an open place along the highway,” the activist, who founded Friends Animal Trust Telangana, said. During the 38-day marathon cycling, he would begin pedalling at 6 a.m. and end the day at 6 p.m., pedalling an average distance of 70 km a day. He would rest for the night at dhabas, temples and petrol pumps and continue his journey the next morning. Mr Gupta was accorded a grand welcome by Mancherial Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Akhil Mahajan, and the former’s friends and family members as he returned home after a successful awareness campaign. He is planning to take up another bicycle journey espousing the same cause to Rameshwaram in September.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/youth-cycles-2700-km-to-stop-animal-deaths-on-nhs/article35779656.ece
07 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Nation is indebted to police officers: Union Minister||Ranjeeta Sharma, an IPS probationer from Faridabad in Haryana, was the cynosure of all eyes on Friday morning as she became the fifth woman in the history of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy, Hyderabad, to command the Dikshant Parade (passing-out parade), considered a prestigious honour for any probationer. She is also the first woman officer (P) to bag IPS Association’s Sword of Honour for Best Outdoor Probationer. She was also awarded the Prime Minister’s Baton and Home Ministry’s Revolver for Best All-round IPS Probationer of the 72nd batch of IPS among several other trophies. Ms. Sharma has been allotted Rajasthan cadre. Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, who presided over the Dikshant Parade and inducted the probationers into the mainstream, after nearly two years of strenuous training said the nation was indebted to police officers and personnel of police forces, who have laid down their lives at the altar of duty to maintain the security of this nation. “Police personnel have also been frontline warriors in the current pandemic and more than 2,000 police personnel have made the supreme sacrifice in this fight. I express my deep respect for their commitment and dedication to duty,” he said. He also quoted the Iron Man of India Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who had said that ‘the Union will go, you will not have a united India if you do not have a good All India Service, which has the independence to speak out its mind’. “I appreciate the perseverance, dedication, honesty and contribution of the officers of the IPS in keeping the country united,” he said, adding that policing should bring transformational leadership as a result of their professional competencies developed by the academy. “Crime against women and children remains a matter of concern in our society and it should be your prime responsibility to deal with them,” Mr. Rai said, urging the newly commissioned officers to train the men and women working under them on latest technologies, for at least 100 hours every year for extraordinary results. Further, he mentioned that the country remains entangled in serious problems such as terrorism, insurgency, communalism, religious fundamentalism, Left Wing Extremism, cybercrime etc. He hoped that the officers would live up to their idealism and standards of excellence and the values enshrined in the Constitution of India. The Minister also congratulated 33 foreign officers, including 12 from Royal Bhutan police, 10 from Nepal, eight from the Maldives and five from Mauritius, who had completed their training at the NPA and would head back to their home country, and said he is confident that the ties built during the training will further strengthen the friendly relations between the nations. The 144 IPS probationers of the latest batch, including 23 women, who began their basic training on December 16, 2019, participated in the Dikshant Parade, along with 34 foreign officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/nation-is-indebted-to-police-officers-union-minister/article35779637.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday held an elaborate meeting with senior officials to discuss the stand to be taken by Telangana government at the meetings of the boards shortly. The discussions will continue on Sunday, a release from the CMO said. It added that the meeting closely reviewed the legitimate share of water for Telangana in Krishna river in the spirit of Bachawat and Brijesh Kumar tribunal awards vis-a-vis the gazette notification. The share of water for Telangana and AP was compared in detail. It was decided that there was no question of Telagnana government relenting on its rights for water in irrigation and protecting the interests of farmers. The government machinery should work with commitment to achieve the goal. The release quoted Mr. Rao as asking senior officials to voice the stand of Telangana vigorously at the meetings. The meeting was attended by Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, Chief Advisor to government Rajeev Sharma, Special Chief Secretary (Irrigation) Rajat Kumar, Engineer-in-Chief of Irrigation C. Muralidhar, former Advocate General Ramakrishna Reddy and senior irrigation officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/scope-of-river-management-boards-discussed/article35779657.ece
07 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Scaling up surveillance, vaccination key to limiting third wave impact’||Stepping-up surveillance, vaccination and following protocols would hold the key to the severity of the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic in the country, director of CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) Vinay K. Nandicoori said on Friday. Stating that there was no reason to give a go-by to the basic safety protocols — maintaining social distancing and wearing mask — he said they were increasingly relevant even now when the size of population not vaccinated and without antibodies was coming down, increasing the possibility of infection among the remaining sections. Speaking at a FICCI webinar on ‘COVID-19: Vaccination & The Next Wave’, he said that changes in receptor binding, immune-escape mutations and potential to escape diagnostics would make the third wave possible. He, however, said that the intensity of the third wave could be reduced by not allowing super spreader events — cultural, religious, entertainment, sports/games, social gatherings such as weddings, political events — to prevent and slow down the virus transmission. He suggested that models integrating detection for test and trace, sequencing for variants of concern, sero-surveys, vaccination effectiveness surveys and viral load in environment would be needed to monitor and forecast outbreaks. Subodh Kandamuthan, director and professor of Centre for Health Care Management at ASCI, underscored the need to test continuously since new Delta variants were a cause of concern. He also emphasised the need for private sector collaboration at all levels of care – surveillance, testing, diagnostics and treatment. Lives and livelihoods Opening up economy does not mean giving a go-by to COVID norms as both lives and livelihoods were important. He said the proportion of healthcare budget has not really increased either at the Centre and in States, and the governments were required to focus on it to prevent pandemics in future. Stating that over 90 lakh population was susceptible to infection in Telangana as they were either not vaccinated so far or have no infection/antibodies, Officer on Special Duty to Chief Minister Gangadhar Taduri said the impact of third could be much lesser and shorter as a sero-survey conducted by the CCMB had found that 63% population of the State had developed antibodies. Subscribing to the view that the length of third wave could be shorter, Raches Ella, clinical project lead at Bharat Biotech, said tweaking the vaccine strategy would hold the key to mitigating the pandemic in the days to come as the virus would keep tweaking itself. He felt that combination of intra-muscular and intranasal vaccine may lead to enhanced efficacy. Oncologist Hari Menon and paediatrician K. Bhasker Reddy were among those who spoke at the webinar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/scaling-up-surveillance-vaccination-key-to-limiting-third-wave-impact/article35779618.ece
07 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Process set in motion to fill government posts||The State government has set in motion the process for filling vacant posts in different government departments. The government has announced the scheme for organisation of local cadre posts in different departments. Posts are accordingly being organised into district, zonal and multi-zonal posts in line with the Telangana Public Employment (Organisation of Local Cadres and Regulation of Direct Recruitment) Order 2018. The development follows the Presidential assent to the State government’s decision to create seven zones and two multi-zones providing 95%t reservation to locals in public employment. The stipulation The order stipulates that the government should organise classes of posts in civil services and classes of civil posts under the State into different local cadres within 36 months of issue of the order in August 2018. Senior officials said organisation of local cadres in different departments would be the first step in the direction of recruitment. This was in line with the Presidential orders and would assure final allocation of employees to different departments. The government had hitherto made provisional allocation of employees and their final allocation would facilitate identification of the exact number of vacancies in different departments. The government had already initiated the process for identification of vacancies that arose because of promotions at different levels and the process was said to be nearing completion. The government could go ahead with issuing notification for recruitment once the vacancies under direct recruitment as well as those created due to promotions were established. It may be recalled that Principal Finance Secretary K. Ramakrishna Rao, after elaborate exercise with different departments, had submitted report to the government that there were more than 50,000 vacancies in different departments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/process-set-in-motion-to-fill-government-posts/article35779648.ece

07 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Budget schools seek launch of ‘Teacher Bandhu’||The Telangana Recognised Schools Managements Association (TRSMA) has urged the government to introduce a scheme on the lines of “Amma Vadi” of the Andhra Pradesh government to save ‘budget schools’ from extinction. TRSMA president, Kandala Papi Reddy, general secretary S.N. Reddy, treasurer K. Sreekanth Reddy and spokesperson Chinthala Ramchander felt that “Teacher Bandhu” on the lines of Rythu Bandhu and Dalit Bandhu should be launched to save about two lakh teachers in the private budget schools. Budget schools numbering about 8,000 in Telangana were saving the government from the burden of thousands of crores assuming that the government spends Rs. 50,000 on each student in government schools. “We provide quality education at an affordable price ranging from Rs. 500 to Rs. 2,000 per month in cities, small towns and rural areas, and our schools should be protected,” Mr. Kandala Papi Reddy said. He said parents and people in society were unfortunately equating these budget schools with corporate schools and international schools that collect exorbitant fee. Mr. Reddy said the budget schools played a crucial role in the Telangana agitation extending active support to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and the TRSMA expected the government to support them when corporate schools were expanding into rural areas, putting burden on parents through their marketing strategies. He appreciated the government for supporting private teachers with Rs. 2,000 and 25 kg of rice in April, May and June this year but it had been stopped for July and August. “We hope the government continues it till the offline classes are held and hold teachers in the profession for the students’ future,” he said. Stating that the demands of TRSMA budget schools were reasonable, Mr. S.N. Reddy wanted the government to provide health cards to all private teachers, reduction in property tax and shifting the power charges category from category 2 to 7 apart from abolishing property and water taxes completely for the Coronavirus period. Mr. Ramchander and Sreekanth Reddy said the government should conduct exams even if they were online.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/budget-schools-seek-launch-of-teacher-bandhu/article35779651.ece
07 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘SR Kalyanamandapam’ movie review: An overdrawn, melodramatic and misogynistic film with a sliver of a story||What SR Kalyanamandapam , with the tagline Est. 1975, needed the most was a sharp pair of scissors at the editing table. It rides on a sliver of a story and packs in a cocktail of segments meant to appeal to the ‘mass’ audience in theatres along with melodramatic scenes of father-son bonding. The 148-minute film is an ordeal. Kiran Abbavaram made his debut with Raja Vaaru Rani Gaaru (2019), a small-town musical romance that won hearts. In SR Kalyanamandapam , he takes on the responsibilities of story and screenplay. He is promising as an actor; he has a screen presence, can emote well and hold attention. But a film needs to be more than a show-reel. We are introduced to Dharma (Sai Kumar) who has wasted himself over alcohol. His high-pitched exchanges with his wife Shanti (Tulasi), whom he refers to as Sivagami for her fieriness, are a daily fixture. The family’s only reason for pride in the village is SR Kalyanamandapam established by Dharma’s father that is at the risk of being frittered away. It’s no surprise that Dharma’s son Kalyan (Kiran Abbavaram) is tasked with restoring the family’s honour as well as mend his broken bond with his father. But what strained their relationship? Never mind. Some time into the film and it doesn’t seem to matter. Because there are other problematic tropes — like the hero’s fixation with the heroine’s midriff. Misogyny plays out in the way Dharma rebukes his wife, who retaliates with anger and tears, and in the way Kalyan keeps objectifying Sindhu (Priyanka Jawalkar). In a post-interval scene, Sindhu slaps Kalyan and declares that she has never reciprocated his advances. Finally something about consent! But this happiness is short-lived. In the following scene, she declares her love for him. Once Kalyan and his friends restore the wedding hall to its glory, the story seems more or less done. But soon, Sindhu has a new suitor and the film continues for over an hour, unleashing more drunken stupors, fights and dances. The cold war between the father and the son also has no gravitas. It just paves way for dialogue-heavy emotional scenes before they patch up. Even a song by Sid Sriram at the fag end cannot resurrect interest. The hugely popular Gangavva chuckles away watching the happenings at Dharma’s house. Then there’s Dharma who often looks for the nearest pillar or wall to bang his head. Both these, more or less, sum up a viewer’s plight.

According to the police, the accused used to come to the city, commit the offences and head back to Kadapa with the booty. After a series of chain-snatchings, cases were reported under Medipally police station recently. The Commissioner of Police Mahesh Bhagwat constituted special teams consisting of CCS LB Nagar, IT Cell and Medipally police, who within no time apprehended the accused with technical clues collected with a continuous hunt by analysing huge data of CCTV footages. Police said that the IT team tracked the video footages for several kilometres in the city to get clues that ultimately led to the arrest in the wee hours of Friday. On questioning, they confessed to committing 36 chain-snatchings and two vehicle thefts across Telangana and AP for the last one-and-a-half-year.

Jeevan Reddy has urged the government to reserve 75% of seats in the SC, ST and BC Welfare Residential Schools for children who pursued their primary education in government schools. In a letter to the Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, he said the entrance test to these residential educational institutions is open to all the students who completed their fourth class irrespective of where they studied. However, children studying in government schools are unable to compete with children coming from private schools in the entrance examinations held for residential educational institutions. So to plug this gap, he said, the government should reserve 75% of seats in these institutions to government school children. He welcomed the recent decision of the government to reserve 50% of seats to the local area candidates of the respective institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/reserve-seats-in-welfare-schools-for-govt-school-students/article35779626.ece

07 August 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||21 villagers held for assaulting forest staff||The Konijerla police have arrested 21 villagers of Yallanna Nagar, including several women, on charges of assaulting a forest beat officer and other field staff when the latter tried to take up a plantation drive in the forest land abutting the village as part of Haritha Haram programme on Tuesday. Based on a complaint filed by the forest staff of the Gubbagurthi forest block, the police booked as many as 21 villagers, mostly women, under Sections 307, 353 and 148 r/w 149 of the IPC. The arrests drew flak from the CPI (ML-New Democracy) State committee. In a statement on Friday, CPI (ML-ND) State assistant secretary Potu Ranga Rao said an attempt to murder case was registered against several women farmers, including two nursing mothers, of Yallanna Nagar at the behest of the forest ranger“Three women farmers with their month-old babies in their laps were among those arrested and sent to jail,” he alleged, charging the forest staff concerned with adopting vindictive attitude towards “podu farmers” without heeding to their requests to desist from "destroying" their crops. The government should withdraw the "false cases" foisted against farmers of Yallanna Nagar and take action against those responsible for resorting to "repressive measures" against women farmers, he said. Meanwhile, sources in the forest department refuted the charges made against the forest ranger. District Forest Officer Praveena said some vilagers of Yellanna Nagar assaulted the forest staff when the latter tried to take up preparatory works for plantation drive as part of Haritha Haram under Gubbagurthi reserve forest on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/21-villagers-held-for-assaulting-forest-staff/article35779889.ece
07 August 2021||MYSURU,TELANGANA||Explosives recovered from quarries||The authorities in Mandya who had cracked down on illegal quarrying and mining in the district recovered explosives on Friday. The mobile squad constituted by the district administration came across four explosives in Chinnakurali hobli of Pandavapura taluk. The explosives were unearthed while monitoring quarries where activities have been banned. A few more explosives were found in survey number 158 and 127 in Honaganahalli. The authorities said the monitoring drive will continue for a few more days and the ban on mining and quarrying will be strictly enforced. Earlier this week, the Mandya district administration and the task force on mining had revoked the licenses of 11 quarrying units besides more than 30 crushing units for either not possessing environmental clearance or for posing danger to the public as the quarries were located within 100 m of district highways. The ongoing drive against illegal quarrying comes close on the heels of Sumalatha Ambareesh, Mandya MP, expressing concern over illegal mining and raising apprehensions over the safety of the KRS dam due to use of explosives. Ms. Ambareesh had also sought a high-level probe into illegal quarrying in Mandya district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/explosives-recovered/article35779379.ece

According to Town Inspector B. Ramesh, Jyothsna is a resident of Shanthi Nagar. Her husband Shiva Shankar is a cashier at a bank. They had two children Rudraksh (6) and Devansh (4). While Rudraksh had a chronic kidney problem, Devansh was suffering from frequent motions. Doctors told the couple that it would take a long time to cure them.

07 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Mahapanchayat held for aborting construction of Haj House||Scores of people gathered in Dwarka sector 22, where the government has allotted land for the proposed construction of Haj House, demanding its cancellation. Calling the event a ‘Mahapanchayat’, protesters chanted slogans during the two-hour agitation. Ajit Swami, president of All Dwarka Residents' Federation – which along with neighbouring villages and right wing outfits – said the allotment should be cancelled because they don’t want the government to spend money only on one religion. “There are so many communities in Dwarka and Muslim population is the least. Why should the government spend crores on building for members of one community? They should build something that can be used by all – like a hospital or a school,” he said, adding that the government will spend money on maintaining the place as well “which is not right”. The body had earlier sent a letter to Lt. Governor Anil Baijal. “There is a strong apprehension that brotherhood, harmony and peace in the society, apart from law and order, will be disturbed if the Haj House is allowed to be constructed in Dwarka,” it stated. DCP (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said that an FIR has been registered under relevant Sections as DDMA guidelines on COVID-19 were flouted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/mahapanchayat-held-for-aborting-construction-of-haj-house/article35779506.ece
07 August 2021||Mumbai,||MahaRERA extends real estate project timelines by six months||In view of the second wave of COVID-19, the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) on Friday invoked the force majeure provision to give a six-month extension for real estate projects whose completion date, revised completion date or extended completion date expired on or after April 15, 2021. “For all MahaRERA registered projects where completion date, revised completion date or extended completion date expires on or after April 15, 2021, the period of validity for registration of such projects shall be extended by six months. MahaRERA shall accordingly issue project registration certificates, with revised timelines for such projects, at the earliest. The above automatic extension shall not apply to projects that were to be completed before April 15,” said the order. The order said the devastating second wave and consequent lockdowns disrupted supply chains for obtaining construction material, led to migration of workforce and caused slowdown in construction work. “It is a welcome move that will give major relief to all developers who are reeling under the pressure of meeting the RERA guidelines amid the second wave of COVID-19,” said Ashok Mohanani, president, NAREDCO. Pritam Chivukula, honorary secretary, CREDAI MCHI, said construction activity was adversely affected due to lockdowns. “The six-month extension by Maha RERA will surely provide much-needed relief to the ailing real estate sector,” Mr. Chivukula said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharera-extends-real-estate-project-timelines-by-six-months/article35779530.ece
07 August 2021||Mumbai,||11 districts prone to extreme weather events: study||Eleven of the 36 districts in Maharashtra are highly vulnerable to extreme weather events, droughts and dwindling water security, and account for almost 40% of the cropped area across central Maharashtra, a report by agencies under the Central government has revealed. The study is titled ‘Socio-economic vulnerability to climate change – Index development and mapping for districts in Maharashtra’. It was conducted by Chaitanya Adhav from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)-National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana, under the guidance of Dr. R. Sendhil from ICAR-Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research. The study revealed that Nandurbar is the most vulnerable district to cyclones, floods, droughts, changing rainfall patterns and extreme temperatures, affecting its crop production. The other 10 vulnerable districts include Buldhana, Beed, Jalna, Aurangabad, Hingoli, Parbhani, Nanded, Akola, Amravati and Washim. According to the study, 37% of the State’s agricultural area spread over 14 districts is moderately vulnerable, which takes the tally to three-fourth of Maharashtra’s cropped regions as high to moderate vulnerable to the prevailing climate crisis. These include Dhule, Jalgaon, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Sangli, Solapur, Osmanabad, Latur, Yavatmal, Wardha, Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gondia and Gadchiroli. However, the study did not include Mumbai and suburban districts in the analysis. The dominant crops which will bear the brunt of climate change include jowar, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton, ragi, cashew nut, barley and millets. Nine districts — Palghar, Thane, Raigad, Nashik, Satara, Kolhapur, Ahmednagar, Nagpur and Pune — were found to be least vulnerable to climate agricultural distress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/11-districts-prone-to-extreme-weather-events-study/article35779529.ece

Mr. Patil said after the meeting that though they discussed politics, there was no talk of an alliance between them. The BJP leader, however, said the two “Hindus” would soon meet. Mr. Patil said, “As an individual, I have told him that the people of Maharashtra want to see him as their leader. The infrastructure available with the MNS may delay that from happening for some time. Therefore, he needs to join hands with someone with bigger resources.

According to sources present at the meeting, after detailed discussions and deliberations with experts, it was decided to undertake aggressive and targeted surveillance and testing in areas, locations and specific activities to ascertain and address any trends of concern. Friday’s meeting came a day after Mr. Baijal had chaired a similar one with government officials following which Mr. Kejriwal had accused him of holding the meeting “behind the back of the elected government.” According to sources, experts, while appreciating the efforts undertaken to achieve and maintain the current status, stressed upon continued vigil and caution. They also suggested that all steps relating to preparedness for any probable surge or wave of infections, in terms of hospital infrastructure and oxygen and drugs’ availability should be put in place and operationalised by the end of August. Advanced sero survey According to sources, it was also suggested to the health department that the comfort provided by the current controlled situation be utilised for undertaking an advanced sero survey that takes into account extended epidemiological dimensions so as to identify susceptible pool and augment the genome sequencing efforts with an aim of prioritising vaccination. The authority also reiterated the need for continuing the test, treat and track strategy and constant vigil and strict enforcement on COVID-appropriate behaviour.

07 August 2021||New Delhi,||Goel to move SC against ‘snatching’ powers||Delhi Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel on Friday announced that he would approach the Supreme Court against the BJP-led Centre for allegedly “snatching” the powers of House Committees through the amended GNCTD Act 2021. A senior Delhi Assembly official said Mr. Goel was scheduled to move the apex court over the issue in his capacity as the Speaker over the coming days after the notification of the Act which gives the Lieutenant Governor more teeth to the city’s administration. “We will approach the Supreme Court on this matter. We will challenge only that portion of the GNCTD Act which is regarding snatching away the powers of the Assembly Committees. We are taking legal opinion on the matter,” Mr. Goel said at a media briefing. The GNCTD Act passed by the Centre on April 27 this year, which the Speaker termed “a black day”, was “unconstitutional” as well as in violation of the July 4, 2018, Supreme Court Constitutional Bench judgment. Mr. Goel said that the Supreme Court had in July this year given a verdict in favour of the Assembly Committee on Peace and Harmony, which is examining the role of social media platform Facebook in the north-east Delhi riots of February, 2020. Facebook had approached court after the Assembly Committee had summoned its executives in connection with the probe. “This verdict came after Centre’s notification of the GNCTD (Amendment) Act 2021. In the order the court had clearly said that the Assembly and its committees have the power to conduct inquiries and issue summons in this connection,” the Speaker said. Mr. Goel also criticised L-G’s alleged directives to government officials to not provide answers to questions on reserved subjects that include land, police and public order. On March 29, 2018, the Speaker said, the L-G wrote to the then Law Secretary who in turn wrote to the Assembly that questions on any reserved subject will not be accepted. “This was unconstitutional. We know that the House cannot make laws on reserved subjects; but from 1993 to 2018, the Assembly held discussions on such subjects. There are 34 questions which were asked by MLAs on reserved subjects but their answers were never provided,” Mr. Goel said. Two such questions on matters related to services and police were asked by legislators Somnath Bharti and Bandana Kumari in the recently-concluded monsoon session but answers were not provided and this matter, Mr. Goel said, will be sent to the Privilege Committee of the Assembly. He added that the Assembly will make “the act of not answering such questions” as the base and approach of the top court against those provisions of the GNCTD Act which “curtailed” the powers of the Assembly panels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/goel-to-move-sc-against-snatching-power/article35779525.ece
07 August 2021||New Delhi,||Tug of war between AAP govt. and BJP may spill beyond vicinity||The tug of war between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government and the Opposition BJP, so far confined to the Delhi Legislative Assembly, could spill beyond its vicinity over the coming days. Delhi Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel on Friday announced that he would approach the Supreme Court to challenge the BJP-led Centre’s alleged bid to make House Committees toothless through the amended GNCTD Act 2021. BJP sources said senior leaders from the party’s State unit were preparing to throw their weight behind the formation of an expert committee to examine the functioning of the Delhi Assembly – especially the alleged stifling of the Opposition’s voice in the House by ruling AAP MLAs – and seeking the framing of “lasting solutions” regarding its functioning in future. The senior leadership of the BJP’s State unit has sought time from President Ram Nath Kovind and is awaiting the conclusion of the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament to call on Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to discuss alleged “irregularities” and “procedural discrepancies” in the functioning of the Delhi Assembly, sources said. “The Speaker is well within his rights to approach the judiciary on any matter of his choice and so are we; we have sought time from the President and Lok Sabha Speaker to discuss major issues related to the functioning of the Delhi Assembly. No rights of the existing House Committees have been taken away due to the amended GNCTD Act 2021,” Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said when asked for comment. Done away with norms “The only rights which are being trampled upon are those of the elected representatives of the people of Delhi whose representatives, that is the MLAs, are not allowed to raise issues concerning them in the House. This applies as much to ruling AAP MLAs as it does to us,” Mr. Bidhuri added. From not holding a meeting of the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) prior to a session to not sending Bills scheduled for discussion in the House well in advance to legislators, “significant procedural norms” had been done away with since the AAP government was formed, the LOP alleged. Opposition MLAs, Mr. Bidhuri further said, were not even allowed to speak or debate issues in the House where a time limit of just 20 minutes had recently been allotted to the LOP to speak. Some Opposition MLAs were told that they would be barred from attending future sessions for a whole year. “They have snatched the rights of the Opposition to even speak in the House and then claim that their democratic rights have been trampled upon,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/tug-of-war-between-aap-govt-and-bjp-may-spill-beyond-vicinity/article35779526.ece
07 August 2021||New Delhi,||BJP demands reopening of weekly markets, stages stir||The BJP on Friday staged a protest near Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence demanding to reopen weekly bazars, failing which the Delhi government should compensate those who were associated with the bazars. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta wondered how there could be no law governing the reopening of liquor stores but not weekly bazars. As many as 2,700 bazars were closed due to the pandemic. “The pandemic now is largely under control and several things have been reopened. So why this continued injustice with these poor people?” Mr. Gupta asked. Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri warned that his party would never tolerate the injustice being meted out to the small traders associated with such markets. “Whether it is metro, DTC buses, Assembly session, all have begun operating; even liquor shops with people buying liquor in large numbers are open. Then why not reopen the weekly bazars?” Mr. Bidhuri asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-demands-reopening-of-weekly-markets-stages-stir/article35779521.ece
07 August 2021||New Delhi,||‘New excise policy to take revenue up to Rs. 10K crore’||Terming it a “smashing success”, the Delhi government on Friday claimed its recently-announced excise policy had broken all estimates and targets of revenue generation from the bidding process and is set to take excise revenue figures up to Rs. 10,000 crore. According to the government, it has already earned around Rs. 5,300 crore in the initial rounds where licenses in 20 zones were awarded. A zone-wise revenue of around Rs. 265 crore is further expected to be received from the bidding of the remaining 12 zones. Ending monopoly “The Delhi government’s new Excise Policy 2021-22 aims at minimising corruption and providing fair competition in liquor trade, as seen in the recent tender bidding process,” the government stated. “Beating all estimates and targets, the 20 zones that have been awarded have already generated around Rs. 5,300 crore in revenue in the bidding process,” it also stated. According to the government, the tender process forbids a bidder from bidding in more than two zones, which will bring in more players into the market preventing instances of monopoly. Under the previous excise policy regime, the yearly growth rates in revenue were limited to 5 to 7% but under the new policy a growth of around 35% is expected and is well on track to achieve, the government stated. Under the previous excise regime, the government said, a total of Rs. 6,358 crore was collected in the fiscal year 2019-2020 after collection of excise from Indian and foreign liquor, VAT collected from wholesale and retail sales, HCR excise, and retail licensing fees. Under the new policy in addition to the Rs. 8,800 crore expected from the auctions, the additional projected revenue after collecting excise, VAT, import fees, CSDN, HCR Licenses, Wholesale Licenses, and HCR VAT will be approximately Rs. 650 crore, taking the total projected revenue close to Rs. 9,500 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/new-excise-policy-to-take-revenue-up-to-rs-10k-crore/article35779523.ece

07 August 2021||Pune,||MVA govt. to provide incentives to set up IT projects in tier 2, 3 cities||To shore up infrastructure in tier 2 and tier 3 cities and reduce the rush of job-hunting in Pune and Mumbai, the Maharashtra government will roll out a policy with notable incentives for the information technology (IT) sector for setting up projects in Nagpur, Amaravati, Latur, Satara, and other cities. Minister for Information Technology and Home Satej Patil said the Maha Vikas Aghadi government aimed to develop these cities into IT hubs and reduce the burden on Pune and Mumbai, which are saturated with IT parks. “We now want to take this progress to tier 2 and 3 cities like Nagpur, Satara, Amaravati, Latur, and Nanded by giving incentives to industries there. Industries will be helped with facilities like electricity through a separate IT policy. We have come out with a request for proposal model to facilitate the sector with simplified procurement process,” he said. Mr. Patil was speaking at the ‘Engage Maharashtra, Reboot, Reform, Resurge’ round table conference organised by Indian Merchant Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He said the State has been at the forefront in the IT sector and the government would ensure that it gives full-fledged support and incentives for the development of the sector. The Minister said, “Cities like Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad have been proven IT hubs and the human resources available in these cities have kept the State on the top in the IT sector. The government, through its ‘MahaIT’ initiative has undertaken and implemented many key projects like disbursing the loan waiver to more than 30 lakh farmers last year, while about the same number of students today are being benefited with scholarships directly transferred to their accounts.” Healthcare platform Another major application of IT was forthcoming in the form of a healthcare platform, which would connect the public health centres with civic hospitals and medical colleges in urban pockets, informed the Minister. “This platform will address healthcare needs at the click of a button. We are connecting district authorities with hospitals and clinics so that the people can get their health issues addressed within minutes. Thus far, we have connected 12,000 gram panchayats in 25 districts and cities in the State with optical fibre-enabled internet using ‘Mahanet’ and ‘Bharatnet’ platforms,” Mr. Patil added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mva-govt-to-provide-incentives-to-set-up-it-projects-in-tier-2-3-cities/article35779534.ece
07 August 2021||Kabul,||Taliban capture first provincial capital||The Taliban have captured their first provincial capital since launching an offensive to coincide with the departure of foreign troops, a senior official confirmed on Friday, a significant psychological blow to a government desperately defending a string of cities against the insurgents. “The city of Zaranj, provincial capital of Nimroz, has fallen to the Taliban,” Roh Gul Khairzad, the Deputy Governor, said. She said the city — in southwest Afghanistan near the Iranian border — had fallen “without a fight”, and social media showed clips of insurgents roaming the streets, being cheered by residents. The veracity of the videos could not immediately be confirmed. The fall of Zaranj comes the same day the Taliban claimed responsibility for killing the head of the Afghan government’s media information department. The insurgents warned just days earlier they would target senior administration figures in retaliation for increased air strikes. The assassination of Dawa Khan Menapal, one of the government’s leading voices, followed another bloody day of fighting as the war increasingly spills into Kabul. The news from southwestern Afghanistan also comes as the UN Security Council meets in New York to discuss the conflict. ‘Cowardly act’ “Unfortunately, the savage terrorists have committed a cowardly act once again and martyred a patriotic Afghan,” Interior Ministry spokesman Mirwais Stanikzai said of the death of Menapal. Menapal was popular in Kabul’s tight-knit media community, and known for pillorying the Taliban on social media — even jokingly at times. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the death, with spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid sending a message to media saying “he was killed in a special attack carried out by mujahideen”. The murder comes after the militants warned on Wednesday of more attacks targeting Afghan government leaders. The day before, Defence Minister Bismillah Mohammadi escaped an assassination attempt in a bomb-and-gun attack. The Afghan and U.S. militaries have stepped up air strikes in their fight against the insurgents in a string of cities, and the Taliban said Tuesday’s Kabul raid was their response. Fighting in Afghanistan’s long-running conflict has intensified since May, when foreign forces began the final stage of a withdrawal due to be completed later this month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taliban-capture-first-provincial-capital/article35778999.ece
07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Biden govt. non-committal on support for India’s UNSC bid||While the U.S. has in the past backed India’s bid for a permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), the Biden administration has continued to remain non-committal on the issue. “Well, we value working with India at the United Nations, including in the context this month of the Security Council. We believe that a reformed Security Council that is representative, that is effective, and that is relevant is in the best interest of the United States and all of the UN member states. And we look forward to the opportunity to working very closely with India in the context of the Security Council in the coming weeks,” State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said in response to a question on the U.S. position. The Obama and Trump administrations had supported a permanent seat for India on the Security Council. Mr. Price said the U.S. offered qualified support for building a consensus for enlargement of the UNSC — in terms of permanent and non-permanent members. However, the U.S. would not support an expansion of the veto — given to the P-5, the current five permanent members: China, France, Russia, the U.K and the U.S. “Well, we support building a consensus for modest enlargement of the Security Council for both permanent and non-permanent members, provided it does not diminish its effectiveness or its efficacy and does not alter or expand the veto,” he said. At her Senate confirmation in January, the U.S.’s U.N Ambassador, Linda Thomas Greenfield, had also refrained from saying the U.S. supported India and other members of the G4 (Japan, Germany and Brazil) for a permanent UNSC seat, citing regional disagreements on who should get the seat. Ms. Thomas-Greenfield was possibly alluding to the Uniting for Consensus (UFC) group — Pakistan, South Korea, Italy and Argentina — which opposes the G4 plan. China also opposes the bids of India and Japan. India is currently (in 2021 and 2022) a non-permanent member of the UNSC and is president for the month of August.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-govt-non-committal-on-support-for-indias-unsc-bid/article35778991.ece
07 August 2021||COLOMBO,||India, Sri Lanka and Maldives to collaborate on security||India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives have agreed to work on “four pillars” of security cooperation, covering areas of marine security, human trafficking, counter-terrorism, and cyber security, in a recent virtual meeting of top security officials of the three countries. The Deputy National Security Adviser-level meeting was hosted online by Sri Lanka on Wednesday, and chaired by General LHSC Silva, Chief of Defence Staff and Commander of Army of Sri Lanka. Pankaj Saran, Deputy National Security Adviser of India, and Aishath Nooshin Waheed, Secretary, National Security Adviser’s Office of the Maldivian President participated. Intelligence sharing The discussion comes nine months after National Security Adviser Ajit Doval visited Colombo for deliberations with Secretary to Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Defence, Kamal Gunaratne, and Defence Minister of Maldives, Mariya Didi, in which the three countries agreed to expand the scope of intelligence sharing. Their meeting marked the revival of NSA-level trilateral talks on maritime security in the Indian Ocean Region after a gap of six years. Following up on that, the Deputy NSA-level meeting this week identified “four pillars” of cooperation in Marine Safety and Security, Terrorism and Radicalisation, Trafficking and Organised Crime, and Cyber security, a press release from the Indian High Commission here said on Friday, adding “specific proposals” for cooperation in each area, including joint exercises and training were discussed. The ‘Colombo Security Conclave’ among the three neighbouring countries seeks to “further promote” maritime security in the Indian Ocean Region, and was initiated by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2011, when he was Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, according to a media release from the Sri Lankan Army. The initiative, grounded in military and security collaboration, assumes significance in the region, in the wake of the current geostrategic dynamic that India shares with Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Earlier this year, India aired security concerns over China being awarded development projects in an island off Sri Lanka’s northern province, close to India’s southern border. Engagement with Quad On the other hand, the Maldives’s engagement with members of the India-United States-Japan-Australia grouping, known as the ‘Quad’, has been growing over the last year, especially in the area of defence cooperation. The Ibrahim Mohamed Solih government signed a ‘Framework for a Defence and Security Relationship’ agreement with the United States last year, an initiative that India welcomed. In November 2020, the Maldives received a Japanese grant of $7.6 million for the Maldivian Coast Guard and a Maritime Rescue and Coordination Center. Meanwhile, Male’s foreign policy choices are increasingly being challenged by sections, mostly opposition groups, wary of “Indian boots on the ground”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/india-sri-lanka-maldives-to-collaborate-on-security/article35778996.ece
07 August 2021||Avaza,||Central Asian leaders warn of chaos as Taliban gain ground||Central Asian leaders sounded the alarm over the spiral of war in neighbouring Afghanistan at a summit in Turkmenistan Friday, as U.S.-led forces withdraw from the country and the Taliban advances. The talks in the resort town of Avaza on the Caspian Sea came after the militant group made sweeping gains in provinces near Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan — the three ex-Soviet countries bordering Afghanistan. After weeks of a blistering offensive through the countryside, the Taliban is now challenging Afghan government forces in several large cities. In a joint declaration, the five Central Asian countries — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan — pledged to “provide all possible assistance” towards achieving peace in Afghanistan. The Taliban has established official contacts with both Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Its charm offensive has included guarantees to support and secure regional economic projects, including a planned multi-billion dollar energy pipeline that would connect Turkmenistan’s giant gas reserves to markets in India and Pakistan through Afghanistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/central-asian-leaders-warn-of-chaos-as-taliban-gain-ground/article35778992.ece

The violence shows no sign of abating,” India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, T.S. Tirumurti said at a Security Council meeting on Afghanistan. The Council, under the current Presidency of India, held a meeting to discuss the situation in Afghanistan amid increasing military offensives by the Taliban as the U.S. forces withdrew from the country. President of the Security Council, Mr. Tirumurti, making a statement in his national capacity, said the international community cannot afford to set the clock back. “It needs to be ensured that Afghanistan’s neighbours and the region are not threatened by terrorism, separatism and extremism. There needs to be zero tolerance for terrorism in all its forms,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/terrorist-safe-havens-must-be-dismantled-immediately-india/article35779289.ece
07 August 2021||Abuja,||Nigeria bombs bandit camp, kills 78: military||Nigerian forces have killed 78 gunmen, known locally as bandits, during military operations including air strikes in northwestern Zamfara State, the Air Force said in a statement. Heavily-armed bandits have wracked northwest and central Nigeria for years, but the groups have recently stepped up attacks on schools, kidnapping hundreds of students for ransom and prompting a military response. “On 2 August 2021, Nigerian Air Force... locked on armed bandits on bikes moving into Kwiambana Forest Reserves (in Zamfara State)... over 78 bandits were neutralised, and their camps destroyed,” Air Force spokesman Edward Gabkwet said in the statement late on Thursday. The bandits were tracked to “extensive and well concealed camps with numerous huts” that were destroyed by the Air Force “in liaison with ground troops forming blocking forces around the targeted areas of the forest”, it added. It said surviving bandits escaped and abandoned the camp. The Nigerian military first deployed to the area in 2016 and a peace deal with bandits was signed in 2019 but attacks have continued. Violence linked to these groups is just one of the challenges facing President Muhammadu Buhari’s security forces, who are also battling a more than decade-long jihadist insurgency in the northeast and separatist agitation in the southeast.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/nigeria-bombs-bandit-camp-kills-78-military/article35778993.ece

07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The complex story of rising cases in Kerala||“Two people have died. Please come and pack the bodies,” a nurse tells the cleaning staff who are on a break. Within a few minutes, cleaning assistants Asokan M. and Dileep Kumar and a few others begin to prepare the bodies. It is August 3 and two elderly men have succumbed to COVID-19 at the Government Medical College Hospital in Manjeri. The relatives of the dead request the staff to dress the bodies in new clothes one last time. The hospital staff, witness to four-five deaths every day on average since April, are used to the routine. They clean the bodies and pack them in specially designated body bags. The Manjeri Medical College is the biggest referral hospital for COVID-19 in Malappuram, the most densely populated district in Kerala (1,265 persons per square kilometre). It has 344 beds dedicated to COVID-19 cases and 203 beds dedicated to non-COVID-19 cases. The second wave may be on the wane in most places in India, but here things are hectic. The hospital staff are under great pressure. No one here contests the fact that the Medical College Hospital, which admits only C-category patients (those whose recovery is impossible without proper medical intervention), is not adequately equipped to treat the many patients coming from a district of 48 lakh people. Malappuram is currently the worst-hit district in the State, reporting the maximum number of daily new cases (3,645 new cases on August 5). While many are wondering why Kerala, which seemed to have a grip of the pandemic at one point, seems to be floundering now, Malappuram is often cited as a case in point. Chinks in Kerala’s armour Until a while ago, Kerala seemed like it had an exceptional pandemic story to narrate to the world, but today, the chinks in its armour are beginning to show. The State has seen a steady rise in cases since the second week of July. Over the past eight days, Kerala has recorded 20,000-22,000 new cases daily. Between July 29 and August 4, it recorded nearly 1.45 lakh new cases and 754 deaths and accounted for 43% of the nation’s active case pool. Following the first wave, Kerala’s epidemic curve plateaued out but never hit the baseline as rallies were held before the Assembly elections and people gathered in large numbers everywhere. In January-February this year, it reported 1,500-3,000 cases daily, accounting for 45%-50% of India’s active case load. Then the Delta variant struck. By the second week of April, when the second wave was ferociously sweeping across the nation, cases began to go up in Kerala. By mid-May, the State was in the grip of a crisis, reporting over 42,000-44,000 cases daily. When a total 15-day lockdown was imposed, the case graph again hit a plateau and 10,000-15,000 new cases were reported daily. This, however, was in stark contrast to other States where new cases and hospitalisations began to slide rapidly. Public health experts in the State say that the second wave began a month later in Kerala than the rest of the country. Kerala’s strategy, they say, has been to spread out the curve, keep a tight hold on disease transmission, and restrict activities, so that the virus doesn’t go on a rampage and overwhelm the health system. The strategy worked well because even at the peak of the second wave, intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy in the State was just 67%. However, Kerala is now being forced to take a re-look at its containment strategies and the socio-economic aspects of the pandemic, which are threatening to overshadow its successes. It is also being compelled to re-examine the quality of care delivered. While it encouraged home care and isolation for patients who had mild COVID-19, it is doubtful whether the health workers were properly trained to diligently follow up with the patients because the ill began to reach hospitals at a later stage of the disease — after hypoxia had set in — and many could not be saved. High pressure, few precautions One COVID-19 patient reached the Manjeri Medical College every 10-15 minutes on August 2. Most of them were in the age group of 50-70 years. All of them had been referred to the Medical College by other COVID-19 hospitals in the district through the COVID-19 war room. Although there are 5,093 beds earmarked for COVID-19 treatment across the district in seven government hospitals, 69 private hospitals, 12 second line treatment centres, and 10 first line treatment centres, the 547 beds at Manjeri Medical College remain crucial in the fight against COVID-19. “The signs are ominous, yet people are oblivious to the dangers of COVID-19,” says Hari Prasad, an ambulance driver who has brought an 85-year-old woman from the Government Taluk Hospital, Tirurangadi, 30 km away from Manjeri. Two volunteers of a community youth organisation come forward to help the woman get on a stretcher. As the stretcher is taken, she gasps for breath in spite of having an oxygen mask on her face. The volunteers wear no protective gear other than two masks. Many people walk busily through the hospital veranda taking little precaution against COVID-19. Two casualty wards — one for COVID-19 patients and the other for non-COVID-19 patients — function side by side. Security guards on duty seem to be able to do little to restrict the movement of patients and those accompanying them. One security guard looks worried. Five of his co-workers have been infected; they all contracted the virus on the same day. Of the 43 security staff, 10 have been isolated after testing positive for COVID-19. Doctors in the casualty wards face tremendous pressure as patients, mostly from the lower middle class, stream in. “We have 56 doctors at the hospital apart from doctors from the medical college. The delay in the arrival of the house surgeons of the 2016 MBBS batch has begun to affect us,” says Sheena Lal, Deputy Superintendent. Lal is in charge of the hospital as Superintendent K.V. Nandakumar is in quarantine after testing positive along with the resident medical officer. Lal is, however, confident that the pressure on doctors handling the casualty and COVID-19 wards and ICUs will ease with the arrival of the house surgeons in a couple of weeks. The high patient load compels junior resident doctor Mohammed Shareef to take the risk of alternating between the two casualty wards. He admits that the pressure is so high that precautions often go for a toss in the COVID-19 zone. Shareef says the hospital is facing space constraints and staff shortage. But the hospital has more than tripled the number of ventilators and vastly enhanced its oxygen capacity since it reported its first COVID-19 case on March 16, 2020. The number of non-invasive ventilators (NIVs) has gone up from 21 to 73, including 10 portable and four neonatal ventilators. There is centralised oxygen supply in all the wards following the setting up of a liquid oxygen plant. An oxygen generator is also ready at the hospital. “This was done in recent months,” says Lal. Signs of a third wave are clear and present, she says. A poorly performing district Malappuram breathed easy during the first wave of the pandemic as many patients did not require NIV support. But during the second wave, it fell miserably short of NIVs. Manjeri Medical College witnessed 15 deaths on a single day, May 27, during the peak of the second wave. Nearly 10 were on account of oxygen failure. This happened despite Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s assurance that Kerala had adequate oxygen supply. The government joined hands with philanthropists and enhanced the facilities. Although the hospitals in the district have 162 ventilators today, several of them are not working. According to the Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association (KGMOA), the district lacks sufficient health staff and infrastructure. Population-wise, Malappuram is five times the size of Wayanad and four times the size of Pathanamthitta. When the State has an average of one hospital bed for 879 people, the bed ratio in Malappuram is 1:1,643. Malappuram’s lone Government Medical College with 547 beds is spread across 23 acres, while the Government Medical College in Alappuzha, a district with only half of Malappuram’s population, is spread across 145 acres and has more than 1,100 beds. A KGMOA study before the COVID-19 outbreak found that Malappuram was responsible for one-fifth of the State’s infant mortality and one-fourth of maternal mortality. Government hospital facility for delivery is available only for 16.64% of pregnant women in Malappuram. Prior to COVID-19, the district had stood behind others in immunisation and topped in dengue deaths, lifestyle diseases and road accidents. The strain posed on the health staff in Malappuram district is much higher than what their counterparts in other districts face. If a junior public health nurse serves 5,000 people in other parts of Kerala, she serves 15,000 people in Malappuram. If there is a public health centre (PHC) for every 39,000 people elsewhere in the State, in Malappuram there is one PHC for every 53,500 people. If there is a community health centre for every 1.4 lakh people elsewhere in Kerala, in Malappuram there is one for every 2.4 lakh people. Because the General Hospital was upgraded to a Medical College eight years ago, Malappuram lost super-specialty wings such as cardiology, nephrology, urology, and neurology. It also lost the General Hospital and the Woman and Children Hospital. A week ago, a Central team led by P. Raveendran from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare visited the district. Blaming the district officials for the shortcomings, Raveendran’s team suggested tighter measures for Malappuram to address the pandemic. District Medical Officer Sakeena K. says that despite the constraints, they were able to restrict COVID-19 deaths to well below 1%. The number of COVID-19 deaths reported in Malappuram is 1,638. “This number against a population of 48 lakh is only 0.03%. In fact, that tells us how hard the medical team in the district fought COVID-19,” Sakeena says. Measures taken by Sakeena and her team, such as traveller surveillance, contact tracing, telemedicine facilities, the triage system at the block level, and prevention of cluster formations won the State’s approval in the initial phase of the pandemic. Now the team is setting up 326 additional oxygen beds at seven government hospitals in the district and strengthening the paediatric wards in anticipation of a third wave. Vaccination on the rise In spite of the initial reluctance of the people towards COVID-19 vaccines, the district is now witnessing a heavy rush for inoculation. According to health officials, it was the second wave that changed the people’s mindset towards vaccines. While 39% of the population have taken at least one dose of a vaccine, 16% have been given two doses. However, the district with 106 civic bodies, including 12 municipalities, finds it tough to plan any massive vaccination campaign because the vaccines allocated for Malappuram are distributed through 116 health centres. The State seems to be doing very well on the vaccination front with 42.81% having received the first dose and 17.86% both the doses. In the 45-plus age group, 83% have been administered the first dose while 43% have received both the doses. The current predicament of rising cases in the State should be weighed against the unique situation created by the circulation of the Delta variant, which has been leading to re-infections as well as breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated individuals, says a public health professional. “It is high time the State paid attention to the disaggregated data of new infections because the proportion of re-infections and breakthrough infections among new cases will help the State identify pockets where active transmission is on. The false sense of security among vaccinated individuals might keep the Delta transmission chains alive for a long time as it is now established (by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) that vaccinated persons have viral loads similar to that of unvaccinated persons, which helps them transmit the infection easily,” a senior public health professional says. The State has the lowest seroprevalence rate in India. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research’s fourth round of seroprevalence study in June, only about 44% of the State’s 3.5 crore population had developed antibodies to the virus. Since mid-May, the Delta virus variant has been driving up cases, causing a prolonged epidemic.  People’s behaviour in Malappuram has always been a subject of criticism. When shops opened, crowds thronged the stores. Marriages took place and the police turned a blind eye to the numbers attending the wedding celebrations. Traffic jams were common in several of Malappuram’s towns during the lockdown. “Usually it takes 38 minutes for us to cover 46 km to reach Kozhikode Medical College from Manjeri Medical College. But there were days when it took nearly one and half hours on emergency trips during the lockdown,” says Pavin A.R., an ambulance driver. Rakhal Gaitonde, public health expert and Professor, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, says, “It is ironic that while the government was clamping down on public life and movement, the business community and markets as part of its containment measures, congregations and celebrations were going on uninterrupted in private spaces, potentially sustaining disease transmission.” Pandemic fatigue But while this is just disease epidemiology that one cannot alter, a team from the National Centre for Disease Control has come down heavily on the State for its failure to implement home isolation and care effectively, for poor and inadequate contact tracing and containment measures, and for a low proportion of RT-PCR tests, which it says have led to the current surge in infections. Kerala’s testing levels have been consistent throughout the pandemic. Tests were increased when the second wave hit — an average of 1.5 lakh tests were done daily — but a large proportion of them were Rapid Antigen Tests. While officials refused to comment on this, health officials admit that the diligence and thoroughness with which the State used to do contact tracing, isolation and follow-up is no longer possible. The same goes for home care and follow-up too, which has been faltering. With patients coming to hospital at a later stage of the disease, mortality is going up. “Earlier, health workers were supported by the local bodies, volunteer groups, police and teachers. One and a half years later, we are on our own. We are acutely short-staffed, overworked and tired. The same group is being roped in for all COVID-19-related activities: from testing to vaccination, apart from mmunisation and vector control,” a field worker says. “Pandemic fatigue has affected everyone and communities and health workers need more support and incentives from the government. Districts need to be supported with strategies that have a more local context,” says Gaitonde. Mortality reduction is another area where public health experts feel that the State can do more. There were wide fluctuations in the mortality rate, from 0.2% to 1.2%, between April and July, 2021, and also between districts. Health Minister Veena George said in the Assembly this week that disease severity seemed to have reduced due to rising vaccination numbers. Even when cases were rising, hospitalisation and ICU occupancy seemed to remain stable, she said. The re-infection rate has come down but breakthrough infections are now being reported, she said. On Thursday, the government announced in the Assembly that it was replacing its Test Positivity Rate (TPR)-based containment strategy, which it had been following for the past six weeks, with a micro-containment strategy wherein only specific localities – wards in rural areas and streets in urban areas – will be under lockdown, depending on the number of new infections in a locality. The TPR-based strategy had been widely criticised as unscientific and counter-productive because TPR can be easily manipulated. TPR is the proportion of positive cases from the total tests done and therefore, large-scale testing amongst people who are unlikely to be infected can artificially bring down the TPR. But the government had refused to listen to the criticism. With the lockdown affecting the livelihood and freedom of people, it became important for the local bodies to reduce the TPR so they could maintain their political image and local popularity. A high TPR and a lockdown was projected as being a measure of their inefficiency. Thus, all local bodies were competing with each other to reduce the TPR somehow by herding in everyone to test, rather than testing appropriate groups. This had seriously affected actual disease containment. Clearly, Kerala is facing its toughest challenge yet. If, till now, it was a struggle to save lives, a rising case graph and pandemic fatigue is forcing the government to gear up to the bigger challenge of striking a balance between saving lives and protecting livelihoods.  Pandemic fatigue has affected everyone and communities and health workers need more support and incentives from the government.

07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||India’s schoolchildren need their childhood back||The economy is open. Malls, bars, restaurants, and some offices are open, but schools have been closed for 16 months and counting. They have sporadically opened for the higher grade students, and the Board examinations have been a key discussion point. There is indeed some basis to the old joke that Indian parents have a razor-sharp focus on academics and want their children to be a doctor or an engineer. This focus is not entirely misplaced, for academic results in the higher grades are important to determine colleges and professions, and for many Indians, a chance at a better life. The wide-ranging impact However, let us not forget our youngest children. Six year olds who have spent more time outside the classroom than inside. Five year olds who have never been inside school nor ever met their teachers or classmates. Let us not lose sight of the importance of education in the younger years as well as the overall purpose of education. In-person school education teaches children to share, wait for their turn, negotiate, and compromise; by depriving them of social contact, we are depriving them of essential learning and development. For children from economically weak backgrounds, schools are a key source of nutrition. For some, schools serve as safe spaces from the chaos of their homes. For many children, particularly those who do not have educated parents or cannot afford home tutors, the denial of education results in learning losses and, ultimately, denial of a chance to earn a livelihood. For parents, school closures have added to childcare and teaching duties. Household incomes are reducing amidst rising inflation as parents, mainly mothers, have quit their jobs. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recently stated that “once India starts considering, it will be wise to open primary schools first and then secondary schools. Also, we have to ensure that all support staff[,] whether it be school bus drivers, teachers and other staff in the school[,] need to be vaccinated” (https://bit.ly/3AhqX7T). Researchers do agree, however, that children are at low risk of developing severe COVID-19 compared to adults. Expert opinion In June 2021, commenting on the World Health Organization-All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) serosurvey, AIIMS Director, Dr. Randeep Guleria said, “This study also looked at sero surveillance among children. In the less than 18 years of age group, it was found that more than 50 per cent of children and in some areas, more than 80 per cent of children from both urban and rural areas had antibodies. This means they were already infected and developed antibodies.” The ICMR recently released results of the Fourth National Sero-Prevalence Survey which showed that more than half of the children (6-17 years) were seropositive and sero-prevalence was similar in rural and urban areas. Given the above, it is possible to think about starting schools in areas where the community level of infection is low. A one-size-fits-all approach across India will not work. This means that in some States such as Kerala or Maharashtra, where COVID-19 cases could be surging again, students should stay home, while their counterparts in other States where positivity rates are lower, can start going to school. There are a host of recommendations on how to open schools safely, including by the World Bank, SRCC Children’s Hospital, Mumbai and the Lancet COVID-19 Commission India Task Force (https://bit.ly/37o7Exl). Schools cannot be opened overnight. There is a large amount of preparation required, and the longer we wait to begin planning, the longer it will take to implement. As immediate measures, governments should: call for lists of school staff and procure full vaccination for them. Scientists should confirm if the gap between doses can be made shorter akin to health-care workers; engage relevant experts to undertake public campaigns to make school staff and parents aware of the low risk of transmission in schools and low severity in children, urge them to understand the science and encourage them to commit to a social contract to be ever-vigilant and keep a sick or exposed child home; issue guidance for staggered re-opening of primary schools — e.g., 50% attendance or smaller groups of students on alternate days or weeks; upgrade school infrastructure to facilitate a hybrid system of learning where parents who do not wish to send their children to school have the choice to continue with online learning; train school teachers in hybrid learning; formulate and issue guidance on COVID-19 protocols to be adopted by schools — distancing to the extent possible, outdoor classes weather-permitting, masking, hand hygiene, and proper ventilation (scientists have indicated that even the humble pedestal fan can do wonders for ventilation); finalise logistics such as packed meals and transport; and ensure availability of medical consultation so that staff and parents need not scramble for assistance. Other required long-term measures, which will also require funding, time, and effort, include greater investment in health-care facilities, particularly paediatric facilities, and implementation of systems to track local level of infections. Managing the risks As parents, we must recognise the costs of isolation and online learning for our young children. We cannot wait for children to get vaccinated because this may take years. According to a media report, Britain has said that “it has decided against giving mass COVID-19 vaccinations to all children and they would only be offered in certain situations such as when young people have underlying health conditions”. We cannot expect schools to provide a 100% guarantee that our children will be safe. Nothing is risk-free; risk must be managed with mitigation strategies. Instead, we must build mutual trust among governments, schools, and citizens. Each of us must implement and adhere to COVID-19 safety protocols recommended by scientists. Each of us must be vigilant and responsible, ensure all adults in our households are fully vaccinated and ensure children stay home if sick or exposed. Until a greater proportion of the population is vaccinated, we should endeavour to curtail unnecessary travel or exposure because we know from serosurveys that adults are bringing infections home. Parents’ groups on social media are abuzz with requests for ‘pods’ of students and home tutors. Education, like oxygen and medicines during the second novel coronavirus wave, is becoming the responsibility but also a privilege of private citizens. We cannot let status quo continue any longer — we need to stop asking whether schools are safe and start acknowledging that in-person school is essential. Extensive literature based on studies on transmission in schools is clear — children are not super-spreaders, schools are not hotspots or driving viral spread. For young children, even a few hours of interaction per week with their teachers and other children would be an excellent starting point. As Robert Jenkins, Global Director of Education for UNICEF, said, “There are many countries in which parents can go out and have a nice steak dinner, but their seven-year-old is not going to school. That’s a problem (https://go.nature.com/3rVrzND).” We need to come together to fix that problem and give our young children their childhood back.

07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||South Asia’s emerging digital transformation||COVID-19 has forced South Asia to take a quantum leap in digitalisation. The shift to remote work and education has propelled an unprecedented spike in Internet penetration, with even smaller nations such as Nepal recording almost an 11% increase in broadband Internet users. For a region with threadbare public health infrastructure, the digitisation of health-care services was a watershed moment, providing novel solutions to the public health crises. In India, COVID-19 accelerated the launch of the National Digital Health Mission, enhancing the accessibility and the efficiency of health-care services by creating a unique health ID for every citizen. The pandemic-induced suspension of bricks-and-mortar businesses spurred South Asia’s embrace of e-commerce, boosted by digital payment systems. Bangladesh alone witnessed an increase of 70-80% in online sales in 2020, generating $708.46 million in revenues (https://bit.ly/3CpGy79) The yawning divide As one of the world’s poorest regions, a wide digital divide persists in access and affordability, between and within the countries of South Asia. Despite having the world’s second largest online market, 50% of India’s population are without Internet with 59% for Bangladesh and 65% for Pakistan (https://bit.ly/3itJUOQ). With monetary and health assistance schemes distributed online, 51% of South Asian women were excluded from social protection measures during the pandemic (https://bit.ly/3xoe7ml). Children too were at the receiving end, with 88% lacking access to Internet powered home schooling (https://uni.cf/2TYn5cp). This disruption could permanently put children out of school, place girls at risk of early marriage, and push poor children into child labour costing economies billions of dollars in future earnings. Businesses too have paid a heavy price for the gap in digital solutions, whereby many South Asian firms failing to embrace e-commerce or other cloud-based technologies to survive the financial chaos of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The region recorded a 64% decline in sales, with small and women-led firms faring the worst (https://bit.ly/3lE2HbR). With COVID-19 transforming work life, the acute skills gap among youth will continue, creating unemployment. Digital inevitability, dividend Digital transformation is a global imperative with adoption of advanced technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, the Internet of things, Big Data, etc., key to success. From banking to manufacturing and retails, the role of digital technology is too important to be overlooked as countries embrace the digital revolution to drive their development agenda. At the forefront of Asian digitalisation are countries such as Singapore, Japan, and South Korea recognised as global technological hubs. Owing to increased smartphone and Internet penetration, coupled with the availability of trusted digital payment platforms, China’s e-commerce industry is said to reach $3 trillion in 2024 (https://bit.ly/37qITjW). The digital boom in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economies is pushing a “common market” initiative, fostering regional economic integration and enhancing global competitiveness. South Asia has also made significant strides in the adoption of digital technologies. The Digital Bangladesh Vision 2021 envisages transforming Bangladesh into a prosperous, digital society, whereas India’s biometric identification systems intend to improve the efficiency of welfare programmes through digital innovation. However, the region still has a long way to go. E-commerce could drive the post-pandemic growth in South Asia, providing new business opportunities and access to larger markets. In India, e-commerce could create a million jobs by 2030 and be worth $200 billion by 2026. Fintech could drive significant growth and reduce poverty by building financial inclusion. For instance, Pakistan’s digital financial sector could boost GDP by 7%, if faster payment gateway, lower costs and fast track licensing are put in place. A timely, inclusive, and sustainable digital transformation can not only bolster productivity and growth but also serve as a panacea for some of the region’s socio-economic divides. A checklist for change To reap the dividends of digital transformation, South Asia needs to address legal, regulatory and policy gaps as well as boost digital skills. A robust digital infrastructure is a sine qua non and there exists a huge financing gap. India alone needs an annual investment of $35 billion to be in the top five global digital economy and public-private partnership needs to be leveraged for the region’s digital infrastructure financing. Regulatory roadblocks need to be addressed as e-commerce regulations are weak in South Asia. For the sector to drive growth, issues such as customer protection, digital and market access regulation, etc. need to be addressed. There would be no digital revolution without universal digital literacy. Governments and businesses need to come together to revamp the education system to meet the demand for digital skills and online platforms. The crossflow of data and personal information calls for stringent cybersecurity measures as many have experienced painful lessons in data privacy during the pandemic. In South Asia, only a third of the inter-regional trade potential has been exploited, losing out on $23 billion in revenues (https://bit.ly/37ohgIr). By addressing issues such as regulatory barriers on currency flows inhibiting online payment to transport-related constraints for cross-border e-commerce activities, South Asia can emulate the European Union’s Digital Single Market Proposal. During the pandemic, South Asian nations joined hands to collectively battle the crises by contributing towards a COVID-19 emergency fund, exchanging data and information on health surveillance, sharing research findings, and developing an online learning platform for health workers. If the eight nations (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) can start walking the talk, partnership for a successful digital revolution is plausible. It will need vision, wisdom, and commitment at the highest level of the region’s political leadership. Collaboration needed COVID-19 has rendered old ways of operating redundant. Concerted collaboration at all levels is needed to push South Asia out of stagnancy and towards a digital future of shared prosperity. The right concoction of regulatory and physical infrastructure, skill sets and regional cooperation can lead toward a digital utopia whereas, the lack of which can breed a dystopian tomorrow. Adequate support is needed for those who risk falling through the net of digital progress. A shared “digital vision” could place the region on the right track towards the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Rewind to fast forward||A tortuous taxation tale that began with global telecom major Vodafone’s $11 billion entry into India, is nearing its climax 14 years on, with the company having frozen fresh investments for a few years and its Indian operations now on the brink of collapse. On Thursday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced tax law changes to scrap the retrospective provisions brought in by the late Pranab Mukherjee in the Union Budget 2012-13. I-T demands have been made in 17 cases, including from Vodafone and Cairn, using those retro-active clauses in the I-T law. That this government took so long to undo Mr. Mukherjee’s gambit after losing a tax pursuit against Vodafone is disappointing. Even before 2014, the BJP had called the retrospective provisions ‘tax terrorism’. Yet, it did not walk the talk despite a resounding parliamentary majority, while promising global investors that it does not approve of such measures. Whether this was a result of political dithering, bureaucratic bungling or ill-informed legal advice, the ‘sore point for potential investors’ remained on the statute. This should now lead to a formal burial of a matter that has cost India dear. In Cairn’s case, the tax department began action in January 2014, but the assessment orders were passed, and its shares sold off to recover ‘retrospective’ tax dues under this regime’s watch, pending international arbitration. By December 2020, the Vodafone and Cairn arbitration cases had been lost and investors hoped the Government would abide by the legal process and close this sordid chapter. Instead, appeals were filed, with the Government asserting as recently as May that it will ‘vigorously defend’ its sovereign right to tax and had ‘never agreed to arbitrate a national tax dispute’. On Friday, Ms. Sitharaman said the Government was waiting for those cases to ‘reach their logical conclusion’; now that they have, the BJP is fulfilling its commitment that it does not believe in retrospective taxation. If that were indeed the case, the Government could have introduced these changes in the Budget instead of wasting more legal resources on filing appeals. It is quite clear the U-turn has been prompted by Cairn Energy’s relentless pursuit to enforce the arbitration award. That it has sought to get Air India labelled as the Government’s ‘alter ego’, creating fresh doubts for the airline’s potential buyers, and a French court has permitted it to freeze Indian assets in Paris, must be significant triggers. Whether Cairn will back down from those claims or forfeit the interest and damages, as offered by the Government to close the chapter, will likely depend on its institutional shareholders. Irrespective of the outcome, global capital is unlikely to immediately forget the ‘ad-hoc’ approach to this critical policy issue and rush in. Be it fluctuating trade tariffs or shifting GST rates and rules, India needs to demonstrate greater clarity and consistency in policy across the board to fix its broken credibility.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/rewind-to-fast-forward/article35778976.ece
07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||It’s hockey||A splendid fortnight in Tokyo has steered Indian hockey back to the limelight tinged with an Olympic halo. Before this, for years the sport, much akin to the West Indies in cricket, had only the good-old-days cliché to fall back upon. Champions of the distant past but plagued by middling results, was the standard template. There was the odd flicker and the nostalgically inclined with their fond remembrance of legends such as Dhyan Chand, Mohammed Shahid and Dhanraj Pillay, would hope for a sunrise. It often proved to be a mirage while cricket, football, tennis and Formula One lured the fans. That India had to wait for 41 years for its next Olympic hockey medal tells a long tale of diminishing hope. Thankfully an upward graph has been finally etched due to the grit and skill-sets of Manpreet Singh’s men, who despite an early 1-7 loss to Australia held their own and winged into the semifinals where they ran into eventual champion Belgium. The soul-numbing defeat was quickly cast aside and India prospered to wrest the bronze with a 5-4 triumph against Germany during Thursday’s third-place play-off. Mentored by coach Graham Reid, India had turned a corner and hockey was the flavour of the season. The ancient game which melded magical wrists, sprinting feet, sticks and a speeding ball, has seemingly reclaimed its Indian heart. If men as diverse as Manpreet and goal-keeper P.R. Sreejesh showed that India was at home in modern hockey, their female counterparts showed they are equal to the very best. Rani Rampal’s unit had a dream run but a bronze was missed by a whisker. It is one of the greatest fourth-place results in Indian sporting history and on a par with where Milkha Singh and P.T. Usha finished in their respective 400m and 400m hurdles finals during the 1960 Rome and 1984 Los Angeles Games. If the men revived an old romance with hockey, the women stole hearts with a riveting performance. A semifinal berth followed by a 3-4 loss to Great Britain during Friday’s third-place play-off, left the nation with a lump in its throat as the women gave it their all on the ground. Rani, goal-keeper Savita Punia, Salima Tete and other stars showed that India has its heroes on either side of the gender-divide. To battle past stereotypes, misogyny, poverty and casteist boundaries, demands a bigger heart. The women’s hockey team had it in abundance and credit is also due to coach Sjoerd Marijne, who ended his tenure on a high. The effort put in by SAI and the sponsorship from the Odisha Government, played a big part too. Indian hockey has found its feet and this is a redemption song of the finest kind.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/its-hockey/article35778977.ece
07 August 2021||Mumbai,||RBI holds rates, MPC splits on stance||The Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on Friday voted unanimously to keep the repo rate unchanged at 4% as part of the RBI’s sustained effort to help the economy recover from the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. One member, however, voted against the MPC’s majority decision to retain the ‘accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis’, while ensuring that ‘inflation remains within the target going forward’, Governor Shaktikanta Das said in a statement. The central bank retained its projection for real GDP growth in the current fiscal year at 9.5% as it pegged Q1 growth at 21.4% followed by 7.3% in Q2, 6.3% in Q3 and 6.1% in Q4. The MPC, however, raised its forecast for retail inflation for the year to 5.7%, from the 5.1% pace it had projected in June as the faster-than-expected CPI inflation readings in the first quarter and continuing price pressures forced it to recalibrate projections for the next three quarters: “5.9% in Q2; 5.3% in Q3; and 5.8% in Q4 of 2021-22, with risks broadly balanced”. “Going forward, the revival of south-west monsoon and the pick-up in kharif sowing, buffered by adequate food stocks should help to control cereal price pressures,” the MPC said in its statement. “Input prices are rising across manufacturing and services sectors, but weak demand and efforts towards cost cutting are tempering the pass-through to output prices. With crude oil prices at elevated levels, a calibrated reduction of the indirect tax component of pump prices by the Centre and States can help to substantially lessen cost pressures,” it added, reiterating an exhortation it has been repeatedly making to the governments. “We are in a much better position than at the time of the MPC’s meeting in June 2021,” Mr. Das said, announcing the policy decision. “As the second wave of the pandemic ebbs, containment eases and we slowly build back, vaccine manufacturing and administration are steadily rising. “Yet the need of the hour is not to drop our guard and to remain vigilant against any possibility of a third wave, especially in the background of rising infections in certain parts of the country,” he added. ‘Conditions still weak’ Mr. Das said the outlook for aggregate demand was improving, but the underlying conditions were still weak. “Aggregate supply is also lagging below pre-pandemic levels. While several steps have been taken to ease supply constraints, more needs to be done to restore supply-demand balance in a number of sectors of the economy,” he stressed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rbi-holds-rates-mpc-splits-on-stance/article35778962.ece

After India’s sensational 5-4 win over Germany in the bronze medal play-off, V.J. Phillips wept in relief and joy. “I could not stop shedding tears. For me the win was equivalent to India winning the World Cup in Kuala Lumpur in 1975, a competition where I took part. Now, it seemed as if I had won the bronze,” Phillips said to The Hindu on Friday. Oustanding Phillips was an outstanding winger for India in his time, tearing down the right flank. His words are significant because he was a key member of the Indian team that last won a bronze in the Olympics, in Munich ‘72, before Tokyo happened. Although India triumphed in Moscow, ‘80, the field was severely depleted. Significant breakthrough Thus, after the bronze in ‘72, this is India’s most significant breakthrough in hockey. Phillips remembered Munich. “We played on grass, won bronze. Then, we had to play on astro-turf in the Montreal Olympics in ‘76. It did not suit our style. We did not qualify for the semifinals.” Since then, with the lone exception being India’s diluted triumph in Moscow, the country failed to qualify for the Olympics semifinals. Phillips said, “Each Olympics we would go with high hopes, only to miss out on semifinals. “For us all, it was agonising and painful.” Rising blood pressure And Phillips’ blood pressure shot up in the final moments of the clash against Germany. “Thankfully, Sreejesh made that crucial save. This team had cohesion, speed and skill. “It was able to come back against European teams, that is extremely tough. Simranjeet was brilliant in front of goal.” For Phillips, hockey is all about heart and emotions. And he is smiling now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/relief-and-joy-for-phillips/article35779331.ece
07 August 2021||Tokyo,||India’s history-making women fall agonisingly short||It was heartbreak for the Indian women as they lost 3-4 to defending champion Great Britain in the bronze medal match at the Tokyo Olympics on Friday. It was a cagey affair to begin with, but Great Britain — which had beaten India 4-1 in the pool stage — looked the more threatening unit. Testing the defence Lily Owsley made a dizzying run down the right and won a penalty corner off Navjot Kaur in the ninth minute, and the Indian defence was tested again in the 11th. Goalkeeper Savita Punia denied Ellie Rayer and Sarah Jones from close range. If the first quarter was engaging, the second quarter was a whole different ball game, seeing five goals. Britain stormed ahead in the 16th minute when Rayer’s cross into the circle hit Deep Grace Ekka’s stick and went in. India’s first shot at goal, a 19th-minute attempt by Lalremsiami, was easily saved by goalkeeper Maddie Hinch. Nisha picked up a green card three minutes later and the British made the most of their numerical advantage, doubling the lead in the 24th minute. Shona McCallin fed the ball to Sarah Robertson, who scored with an exquisite reverse-stick finish. The Indians reacted right away, as Gurjit Kaur slammed home a penalty corner in the 25th minute. Spurred on by the goal, Salima Tete made a mesmerising run the next minute and won another penalty corner. It was almost a replay of the earlier goal as Gurjit again nestled the ball into the far bottom corner. India went ahead in the 29th minute through a goalmouth scramble. Shushila Chanu’s cross deflected off Sharmila Devi’s stick and fell to Navneet Kaur. Navneet attempted a flick but missed it completely and the British defence uncharacteristically froze. Vandana pounced on the loose ball and caressed it home to give India a 3-2 lead. Great Britain captain Hollie Pearne-Webb restored parity in the 36th minute. India ’keeper Savita produced a great save to deny Isabelle Petter. However, Sarah Jones chased the rebound and crossed it back to Petter, who padded it for Pearne-Webb to finish with a fierce strike. Britain started the fourth quarter with renewed vigour and won three successive penalty corners, before scoring off the fourth. Grace Balsdon scored what proved the match-winner, her drag-flick beating Savita. Britain defended doggedly to prevent yet another Indian comeback. India had started with three straight losses in the pool stage but displayed character and guts to stun Australia in the quarterfinals. The Indian women may have lost out on a medal but won a billion hearts. They had finished last (12th) in Rio. The Netherlands defeated Argentina 3-1 to claim the gold medal. Caia van Maasakker scored two goals for the Dutch, who had won the silver in 2016.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indias-history-making-women-fall-agonisingly-short/article35779079.ece
07 August 2021||NOTTINGHAM,||Rahul, Jadeja and tailenders give India a 95-run lead||K.L. Rahul kept England at bay before India’s tail hit out as the tourists took command on the third day of the first Test at Trent Bridge on Friday. Opening batsman Rahul, in his first match at this level for nearly two years, top-scored with 84 as India made 278 in reply to England’s 183 — a lead of 95 runs. All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja’s typically dashing 56 featured eight fours and a six and there was more pain for England when tailender Jasprit Bumrah made a Test-best 28. Ollie Robinson, playing just his second Test after being suspended following the re-emergence of racist tweets on his England debut against New Zealand at Lord’s on June, finished with five for 85 in 26.5 overs. James Anderson’s figures of four for 54 in 23 overs took him to 621 Test wickets and past the legendary India spinner Anil Kumble (619). Only the retired spinners — Sri Lanka’s Muttiah Muralitharan (800) and Australia’s Shane Warne (708) — are ahead of him in the all-time list. England, which did not help its cause by dropping Rahul on 52 and 78, was 25 for no loss in its second innings when a heavy downpour ended play for the day. In the morning, Rishabh Pant hit Robinson for six before the seamer had his revenge when the wicketkeeper mistimed a drive straight to short cover as India slipped to 145 for five. However, Rahul and Jadeja took the visitors to 191 for five at lunch. Fortunately for England, Rahul's composed 214-ball innings ended when he nicked Anderson to Jos Buttler, ending a stand of 60 with Jadeja. Jadeja hoisted Anderson for a six over square-leg and celebrated an 81-ball fifty with his familiar ‘sword’ twirl of the bat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rahul-jadeja-and-tailenders-give-india-a-95-run-lead/article35778972.ece

After rounds of 67 and 66, Aditi fought back from bogeys before and after the turn to card a 68 for a three-round aggregate of 12-under 201. Aditi is three strokes behind the leader — USA’s Nelly Korda (198) — and two ahead of the quartet comprising New Zealand’s Lydia Ko, Australia’s Hannah Green, Denmark’s Emily Kristine Pedersen and Japan’s Mone Inami. Meanwhile, Diksha Dagar carded a second straight 72 and moved up two places to tied 51st with 220. Korda, who shot an Olympic course record of 62 in the second round despite a double-bogey on the final hole, found pars on the last 10 holes for a 69. In great touch Aditi looked in great touch as she birdied the fourth, sixth and seventh holes. But a dropped stroke on the ninth pulled her down. After another bogey on the 11th, Aditi steadied herself with three successive pars. Birdies on the next two par-4s — 15th and 17th — ensured she remained second after 54 holes. “I think a lot will happen on the final day. Although it’s just one round, it feels long mentally, so definitely staying patient and hoping we have good weather. “Hope I play well tomorrow (Saturday),” said Aditi. Talking about the pressure that accompanies the frontrunners after 54 holes, Aditi said, “For sure (there will be pressure), but I’m not thinking about it that much.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/consistent-aditi-stays-second-eyes-a-medal/article35779084.ece
07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Marijne leaves with his head held high||After his last assignment with the Indian women’s hockey team, chief coach Sjoerd Marijne was proud of the girls’ fourth place finish in the Tokyo Olympics and hoped that they would inspire the newer generation of players in the country. Marijne backed the Indian team after its defeat to Great Britain in the bronze medal match on Friday. “We did not win a medal but we achieved something bigger to make the country proud,” said Marijne at a virtual press conference. Marijne highlighted the fact that the side believed in its ability and earned a creditable finish despite its low ranking, 10th place about a month before the Olympics. “We are among the best four and everybody is taking us seriously. That’s a big step.” The Dutchman, who had taken over as the coach in February 2017, revealed that the Olympics bronze medal contest was his last match with the women’s side and said more exposure, like the Hockey India League and Pro League, would help the team grow. “I don’t have any plans because this was my last match with the women. It’s up to (analytical coach) Janneke (Schopman) now.” Marijne said the girls were emotional after the defeat. “They are still emotional. They wanted to win. Only when they arrive in India will they see it’s not so bad. It will take time. “Every girl has a story and every story is amazing. The country I come from, the Netherlands, we don’t have these kinds of stories. “These stories inspire the new generation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-are-among-the-best-four-marijne/article35779075.ece
07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Italy pulls off stunning win in the 4x100m relay||One stunning show after another. This has been a fantastic Olympics for Italy. After Lamont Jacobs shocked the world by emerging as the fastest man, Italy produced another breathtaking performance by grabbing the men’s 4x100m men’s relay gold on Friday. It was Italy’s first medal in the men’s sprint relay since the bronze in 1948. This time, Jacobs’ sterling second leg and a superb finish by Filipoo Tortu saw Italy edge out Great Britain by one-hundredth of a second to win in 37.50s. In the women’s relay, the Jamaicans appeared anxious, worried whether they had messed up the first baton exchange after finishing first, till the official results announced them as winners in 41.02s. Meanwhile, Shaunae Miller-Uibo, who was planning to skip the quarter-mile a month ago despite being the defending champion, was thrilled that she had changed her mind. The 27-year-old from the Bahamas had been working on a 200-400m double at Tokyo but she was unhappy with the scheduling. Miller-Uibo had finished last in the 200m final earlier but she looked strong in the 400m on Friday and breezed to a comfortable victory in a personal best 48.36s. Felix makes history American Allyson Felix produced a brilliant finish to take bronze. It was her 10th medal, making her the most-decorated female track Olympian. Felix joined Paavo Nurmi (12) and Carl Lewis (10) as the only track and field athletes with 10 or more medals at the Olympics. Kenya’s Faith Kipyogen, who had been training with legends like marathon world record holder Eliud Kipchoge and listening to their inspiring tales, thwarted World champion’s Sifan Hassan’s plans of winning a distance treble by retaining the 1500m title. She pulled ahead after the bell, pushing Hassan to the bronze behind Britain’s Laura Muir. The Indian men’s 4x400m team of Muhammed Anas, Noah Nirmal Tom, Arokia Rajiv and Amoj Jacob rewrote the Asian record, clocking 3:00.25s to finish fourth in the second heat. The team was ninth overall and narrowly missed the final. Shiying’s surprise win China’s Shiying Liu won a surprise gold in women’s javelin with a 66.34m throw. In men’s 5000m, Joshua Cheptegei, the world record holder, ran a controlled race to take the gold in 12:58.15s. Indian women walkers, Priyanka Goswami (1:32.36s) and Bhawna Jat (1:37.38), finished 17th and 32nd in the 20km event while Gurpreet Singh failed to finish the men’s 50km walk.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/italy-pulls-off-a-stunning-victory-in-4x100-relay/article35779082.ece
07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||USA and Brazil set up gold-medal clash||It proved to be a day to remember in Tokyo for American volleyball. Or the American women’s volleyball to be precise. After April Ross and Alix Klineman gave the United States the gold in women’s beach volleyball, their compatriots stormed into the final of the women’s volleyball with a straight-set victory over Serbia in the semifinal. The US won 25-19, 25-15, 25-23to set up a final clash on Sunday with Brazil, which beat South Korea 25-16, 25-16, 25-16. It was a sweet revenge for the Americans against Serbia in the match between the bronze and silver medallists from the last Olympics. Five years ago in Rio at this stage, they had lost to their European rivals. They have an excellent chance to win their first ever Olympic gold in the event– after collecting three silver and two bronze, the last of which came in Rio. Their performance in the semifinal at the Ariake Arena certainly has raised hopes of the gold. They were too good for a strong Serbian side. Late in the opening set, Serbia had shown some pluck, saving four set points before a smash from Foluke Akinradewo ended that fightback. The Serbians could not quite replicate such resilience in the next two sets. The US was strengthened by the return to the squad of setter Jordyn Poulter. Jordon Thompson is still nursing her ankle injury though, but her replacement Andrea Drews rose to the occasion once again, scoring 17 points, more than any of her teammates.   The results (semifinals): United States bt Serbia 25-19, 25-15, 25-23; Brazil bt South Korea 25-16, 25-16, 25-16 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/usa-and-brazil-set-up-gold-medal-clash/article35779488.ece

07 August 2021||Hyderabad,||‘ATP not ensuring level-playing field for Asians’||At 34, Davis Cupper J. Vishnuvardhan believes he still has it in him to make it big in doubles and not surprisingly is training hard with another Hyderabadi and Davis Cupper Saketh Myneni. The 6’2” tennis player says that the ATP’s fresh guidelines to deduct ranking points from August 9 even if someone has played in any tournament or not in the last one year is not fair. “This will deny us a huge advantage over players from Europe and the US. Definitely, the ATP is not ensuring a level-playing field for the Asian players and neglecting their interests,” he said in a chat with The Hindu . Own example The Asian Games silver medallist in mixed doubles with Sania Mirza cited his own example. “For instance, I was ranked World No. 180 in doubles before the pandemic broke. “And not having played any tournaments since then I am now ranked No. 260,” said Vishnu, who regularly trains with Myneni. “The Asian players will be the worst-hit as neither were there any major events for close to two years now in Asia after the pandemic broke out nor is anything scheduled in the near future, while players from Europe and the USA are already playing in tournaments,” Vishnu said. “Unfortunately, this move has also resulted in quite a few promising players, who on the verge of making a mark at international level, quitting the sport,” Vishnu said. “And, it has become too expensive for many of us to even play in Europe or the US. Unless a player has sponsorship to take care of his tour plans, it is almost impossible to play there to improve the rankings,” he said. “Fortunately, I am grateful to my employer ONGC for extending complete support. Yet I find it difficult to plan any tournament schedule because of the costs,” he said. “To compound to the misery, we are not paid the cash incentives by the government which were due to us, like after winning the SAF Games gold (he and Saketh Myneni were winners). We can’t run around forever begging for these benefits,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/atp-not-ensuring-level-playing-field-for-asians/article35779487.ece
07 August 2021||Chennai,||Sathish is the star in Chepauk Super Gillies’ victory||R. Sathish is young at 40. He flings himself full length, unmindful of injuries, to stop boundaries, scores game-changing direct hits, sends down useful seam, and still conjures hurricane innings such as his explosive 32-ball 64 after arriving at 44 for four at Chepauk on Friday. And his throw from short third man caught the inform Sai Sudharsan short of the crease at the bowler’s end. He was clearly the key man in Chepauk Super Gillies’ 36-run win over Lyca Kovai Kings in this TNPL match at the M.A. Chidambaram ground.  When Lyca chased, M. Siddharth produced an absolute beauty, something between an arm-ball and a left-armer’s inswinger from round the wicket, to castle R. Kavin. Crucial wickets Super Gillies fielders put down skiers, still the bowlers picked crucial wickets. Sai Kishore dismissed Ganga Sridhar Raju with a delivery of turn and bounce. Skipper Shahrukh Khan struck some big blows before falling to R. Alexander’s left-arm spin. Abhishek Tanwar clouted seamer Sonu Yadav for huge sixes but was involved in a verbal duel after the bowler dismissed him. Earlier, Tanwar had a skirmish with Kaushik Gandhi, who walked into him, after dismissing the batsman. The night belonged to Sathish. Given width, he cut. His strong strong wrists came to the fore. Sai Kishore chipped in with an innings of 31 and added 68 for the fifth wicket with the rampant Sathish. The partnership took the game away from Lyca.  The scores: Chepauk Super Gillies 159/7 in 20 overs (Sai Kishore 31, R. Sathish 64, Abhishek Tanwar 2/26, Selva Kumaran 2/11, V. Yudheeshwaran 2/39) bt Lyca Kovai Kings 123/9 in 20 overs (Shahrukh Khan 26, Abhishek Tanwar 29, Sai Kishore 2/11, S. Harish Kumar 2/15).   Points: Super Gillies 2; Lyca 0 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sathish-is-the-star-in-chepauk-super-gillies-victory/article35779398.ece

At the Shiokaze Park in Tokyo on Friday, she finally got the medal that mattered most, at the age of 39. Along with Alix Klineman, she won the gold in women’s beach volleyball with a straight-set victory over the Australian pair of Mariafe Artacho del Solar and Taliqua Clancy in the final. The ‘A-team’ won 21-15, 21-16 in just 43 minutes. In control They were in control for most of the time in both sets. The Aussie women were forced to do the catch up, which they never really managed to. It proved an unforgettable Olympic debut for Klineman, who had switched to beach volleyball from the indoor variety only four years ago. She had been a member of the United States volleyball team. She was, in fact, part of the US team that won the bronze in the Pan American Games in 2011. The 31-year-old said it was a special moment for her while Ross paid a tribute to her partner.

07 August 2021||MUMBAI,||Mumbai likely to tour Oman later this month||Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) is likely to tour Muscat later this month for an exposure trip that is being initiated by Oman Cricket for a possible win-win for both the teams. While Oman has qualified for the T20 World Cup, to be played from October 17, it will also host the weeklong qualification stage before the marquee event moves to United Arab Emirates. As a result, Oman cricketers are keen to compete against a seasoned outfit ahead of its litmus test. For MCA, with no off-season tournaments being planned anywhere in India ahead of a proposed full domestic season, the new head coach and a new-look selection committee can try out some of the fringe players during the tour. Confirming the proposed series, Oman Cricket president Pankaj Khimji said the tour is yet to be confirmed. “It depends on the logistics and other permissions. We are discussing it and we would definitely want this to happen,” Khimji told The Hindu . “It will also be good for cricket as it will be a pre-season tour and also it is good for us as it helps us ahead of the season. We have the World Cricket League coming up in September, so it will be good if we get to play against Mumbai. It is understood that MCA secretary Sanjay Naik, after receiving a formal invitation letter from Oman Cricket on Friday, is set to deliberate the proposal with other office-bearers, coach Amol Muzumdar and chief selector Salil Ankola before taking a call later this week. With almost a dozen top Mumbai cricketers being involved either in England or for the IPL preparation, if Mumbai decides to accept the proposal, it will have to select a second-string outfit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mumbai-likely-to-tour-oman-later-this-month/article35779483.ece

07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||The taste and smell of gondhoraj lebu||The gondhoraj lebu is an incredible lemon. Add a bit of its fragrant juice — or even the leaves — to your dal or your fish curry, and the dish will taste like heaven. My in-laws had a fruit-laden plant in their garden, and we used the lemon and its juice for a host of dishes. But I’d never had gondhoraj lebu in mutton curry, and was absolutely floored when I did, some days ago. The dish, sent over by my brother-in-law, had been prepared and delivered by Sanhita Sensarma, a corporate lawyer who is now rustling up all kinds of exotic dishes. The gondhoraj mutton had the most sublime aroma of the lime, and the eggs and potatoes in the meat curry made it a memorable dish indeed. The pandemic has introduced us to a range of home chefs — from those offering basic food to restaurant-style dishes. Sanhita’s food stands out because it is, in a word, different. Just like I had never had gondhoraj mutton curry earlier, I had not eaten Jaffna meat curry either. She sent us this dark curry prepared with 15 roasted ground spices and roasted red rice. It had a lingering taste of coconut, cardamom and cinnamon. We also had her Wattala black pork curry — succulent fatty pieces of pork in a peppery and tart gravy. We enjoyed it all immensely. Last week, I asked for two dishes — pork Ularthiyathu and Kundapur seafood ghee roast. The pork, lined with fat, truly melted in the mouth. The meat was cooked sous vide (vacuum packed, then cooked in a water bath) for several hours at a low temperature with spices, and then slow pan roasted with coconut pieces and shallots. I enjoyed the Bunt prawn and squid dish, too, though I was initially taken aback by the oil. But then this was ghee roast, and the dish had been cooked in Udupi ghee, known for its fragrance. The ghee did give it a gentle kick, while the Byadgi chillies of Karnataka added to its sharp taste, as did the crunchy cashew nuts the dish had been topped with. Sanhita, who has been studying food for over 23 years, says food obsession is a gene she’s inherited. Her mother, she jokes, holds a PhD in Fish Physiology, while her daughter is set to do her MA in food studies at NYU. Sanhita tells me that she picked up the skill watching her mother in the kitchen. Every Wednesday, she publishes on Instagram (@gustobysanhita; WhatsApp: 9810427956) her new delivery menu for the weekend ahead. All non-veg dishes cost Rs. 750 and vegetarian dishes are priced at Rs. 550. A portion is enough for two. She usually doesn’t repeat her dishes, but clients often ask for traditional Bengali sweets seldom found in sweet shops. Her menu in recent times included gosht kala bhuna , pulled pork crepes, khow suey , a vegetarian platter for Rath Yatra, dal Moradabadi, and kechki maacher jhal chorchori – sprats cooked with brinjals, spring onions, garlic greens, green chilies, and coriander roots. How did she get the gondhoraj flavour in the mutton curry? She put some zest into the mutton marinade, leaves in the curry, and then finally a dash of lemon juice when it was done. She adds a Bengali version of the phrase bon appetit with the food she delivers: Kobji dubiye hok , or let’s indulge.

07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||My Olympic Gold||Thousands of cheers over thousands of years echoed through the Panathenaic stadium as I pumped my fist in victory on the medal podium, the sun glinting off my gold. Merely visiting the first stadium of the ‘modern’ Olympics in 1896 had me seeing stars (even without a knock from a shot put) — especially since my personal best in weight-lifting was hoisting a wriggling 6 kg baby. The Olympics, of course, had flagged off centuries earlier. Men chased one another around a track, togas flapping, in the 8th century BC. The Stade (the run to you and me) remained the only event for years until they gave in to the call to arms, along with legs. New sports included Pankration, which is the sort of brawl you’d now see in country liquor bars — boxing, wrestling and falling flat on one’s face. Even newer sports were added to reflect the times. The Tokyo Olympics introduced four. In homes across the world, kids sprawl before TVs, watching other kids do things their mums warned them not to, spine-curling twists upside down on skateboards. ‘Stop wasting your time and switch channels to the Olympics!’ shouts an irate parent. They are. Skateboarding and surfboarding were legit adds this year. Ah, the pressure of the board exams! Ask 13-year-old Momiji Nishiya who won the gold. Women first participated at the 1900 Olympics in Paris. In the early days, no woman could step on the track, and married women couldn’t even watch — what with those flapping togas! (The Greeks actually wore palliums, but flapping palliums isn’t quite kosher). Look at what we’re doing now, however. From Mirabai Chanu and Rani Rampal whose stories of grit and passion are making a billion eyes tear up, to Valerie Adams who won the bronze 17 years after she’d first won an Olympic medal, and held up a picture of her two kids who she’d had in between. I’ve been posting pics of my two kids, too. (As I said, I have all the makings of an Olympian). Alongside the gut-wrenching victories are other stories that we won’t forget. Siblings Hifumi and Uta Abe winning their judo competitions on the same day (parents worldwide, learn! Don’t stop your kids from pulping each other over one Lego block). Tajay Gayle, the long jump champ who twisted his knee, but continued to finish, through the pain. The one that had our hearts was Qatar’s Barshim who, having worked all his life towards this point, opted to share his gold with Italy’s Tamberi. Inspired, women are insisting their men do the dishes and the cooking. After all, the men are glued to the Olympics all day. Surely they’ve learnt to share the metal? Nothing comes near the exhilaration and crashes of sports, and some moments will seep into our vocabularies. The 11-year-old will ask for a sixthdosa, claiming he’s ‘going for gold’.

07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Has adland done justice to India’s sports queens?||Over the years, there have been quite a few commercials and ad campaigns featuring India’s female athletes. Arguably the most noticed was one that dazzled us in 2016, a piece of work for Nike by agency Wieden + Kennedy that had the nation going ‘Da-da-ding’. To be fair, it also featured Bollywood actor Deepika Padukone and a pulsating soundtrack by Gizzle & Gener8ion. But the athletes — be it Rani Rampal, then 21, who had broken into the team at the age of 15, or squash player Joshna Chinappa, who was ranked 10th in the world at the time — certainly did not play second fiddle. Yet other brands did not seize the opportunity. If they did, they did not do so with the skill and scale worthy of these achievers. And that trend seems to be continuing.  Shine before the win  There are some campaigns, however, that cut through, that married the brand with an athlete’s story or perspective. In the context of Tokyo 2020, even before Domino’s moment marketing went viral, there was an attempt to tell the story of fencer Bhavani Devi. It came from brand Rin, via agency Ogilvy. Her victory against patriarchy to qualify for the Games found alignment with the brand’s #AbWaqtHaiChamakneKa plank. JSW (think steel, cement), which started its #RuknaNahiHai campaign ahead of Rio 2016, carried forward the anthem in the context of the delayed Olympics, also conceptualised by Ogilvy. Is it a campaign featuring women athletes exclusively? No. But as do several campaigns urging India to cheer the national contingent, it features a good share of our sportswomen.  Mirabai’s meal, Lovlina’s road home  There is a lot of action with hashtags sans film on social media, but hardly anything has made an impact. Within integrated campaigns with films, the majority have played on patriotism. Very few have managed to delve into the lives and minds of the athletes. Beyond women athletes, who, in fact, find more screen time and are in general more sought after by brands (except in cricket), there is a larger factor at work — the divide between winners and the rest. One of the reasons for the lack of storytelling is brands trying to ride with the stars and play safe. Celebrity management firms are tasked with identifying the winners ahead of the Olympics, which is a big ask even if one has been tracking individual athletes’ progress regularly. Some of the managers, I am told, were in the Northeast seeking out the Chanus’ modest home before the first medal winner, weightlifter Mirabai, could return. Images of the Silver medalist’s family meal went viral soon after she won. Could that have happened prior? Elsewhere in the region, the local MLA called the father of Lovlina Borgohain, representing India in boxing at the Tokyo Games. The Public Works Department is ensuring that the road to their home is rendered motorable in time for her return because she is assured of a Bronze. So it’s not just advertisers, we in India have a bias for winners. But even if an athlete does not win, you still have a story. And the story of an Olympic dream is quite powerful by itself. If someone had hunted these stories down before the Games, the brands that told them would have been far richer in terms of RoI.  Trending like Sindhu  PV Sindhu has become the first Indian woman to win two individual Olympic medals, also only the second Indian athlete to do so (wrestler Sushil Kumar is the other). There is no dearth of endorsements in her kitty, but which are the ones that come across as having truly partnered with her? Gatorade signed her on in 2017 and the relationship went beyond acting in commercials. She went to the brand’s facilities and they tested her sweat to help arrive at the right rehydration for the star. It was clearly a long-term vision. The badminton ace had already won a Silver at the Rio Olympics and was a star, but the brand egged her (and her fans) on, in the #SweatMore work by Wunderman Thompson (2017). After she struck Gold at the World Championships 2019, they chronicled her #SweatForGold journey. After her 2021 Olympics Bronze win, when a fan tweeted asking for Sindhu to be given a Thar, Anand Mahindra replied: “She already has one in her garage.” It was gifted much earlier.  Lessons from around the world  Two international pieces of advertising for Olympics 2020 offer some pointers as to how advertisers could engage with our Olympians. The first comes from P&G, where a sustained campaign allowed it, in a sense, to own the Olympics. With #LeadWithLove, it followed up with a series of profiles on some special athletes, the ones who were shining beyond the arena with their actions. From Scout Bassett, a disabled Paralympics athlete, dedicating herself for those like her, to Tom Daley, a gay athlete, speaking up for the sake of those like him. Waking up a month before could not have delivered the impact some of these did. But the piece of work that took one’s breath away was #StrongerTogether, which underlined the spirit of the Olympic Games. It was from brand Olympics, but advertising on a theme like saluting the spirit of the Games could have come from anywhere. The film looks at what makes the Olympics special, through the eyes of athletes over the years — from 100-year old Olympics gymnastics veteran Agnes Keleti to 13 year-old debutante, skateboarder Sky Brown. The Olympics is perhaps the only sporting arena where, despite its commercialisation and expansion, the spirit of the Games stands tall. And that spirit goes way beyond medal-winning. If brands look beyond, they could well strike gold.

Pilot watches have bold, easy to see displays while diving watches have chronographs and timers to ensure dives are timed precisely. Jiten Thukral and Sumir Tagra’s design for Rado, True Square ‘Over the Abyss’, eschews all of that. Instead, the dial showcases firework-like hands — 18 spokes for the hour hand and 19 for the minutes. Taken together, the 37 spokes represent the number of time zones in the world, and, according to the New Delhi-based artists, is a way to depict human interconnectedness. “Communities cannot operate in isolation, and we empathise with this valuable insight. We wanted to connect the wearer with others,” says Tagra. A goal that takes on new urgency in the throes of a global pandemic.  Tech to last  The watch has been in the works for two years and, in the meantime, the world changed. “This comes at a time when we are all experiencing isolation, and a representation of the reunions with loved ones that we all fervently hope may soon be possible.” As the ability to move about became constrained, the duo embodied time zones, travel and migration in an object. The unique world-timer inspired display superimposes local time over the different time zones. Before the pandemic, Thukral and Tagra — who work with a variety of media, including painting, sculpture, video, and performance — had made a trip to Lengnau, Switzerland, to the Rado atelier. “It’s quite high tech, as one can imagine. Each material is tested to last for life. So the inks [and everything we used] had to be durable enough to be approved by the Rado standard,” says Tagra. For ‘Over the Abyss’, that meant achieving a new matte blue colour for the monobloc ceramic case and using cutting-edge robotics and nanotechnology to apply the vivid pink and blue gradient paint on to the delicate multi-spoke arms.  Time as a teacher  The first Indians to design a timepiece for the Master of Materials, as the Swiss watchmaker has anointed itself, the artists are aware that their watch is an emissary for the country’s art and design sector. “We are Indians and have been working over two decades to develop ideas and narratives about stories that are deeply rooted in our country. There is a gap that needs to be filled about educating people on design in India.” So, while the watch is rooted in Rado’s material innovation and capabilities — an in-house R763 automatic movement, with an 80-hour power reserve — it features the artists’ visual trademarks, like their use of pop colours. They’ve also incorporated a digital painting on the titanium caseback — an artwork from their ongoing Dominus Aeries series of paintings. Their own definition and relationship with time is interesting to note. During the virtual press conference, when asked about their work and inspiration, Tagra said, “The time owns the idea, we are only the hands that make it happen.” And when I pressed further, he explained, “Time is extremely powerful. There can be many ways to define it. For us, it is a measure, but also a teacher. It heals and it hurts at the same time. Whichever way one wants to see it, like a beating heartbeat, or melting ice, it stays as a marker of our lives.”  True Square Over the Abyss is priced at Rs. 2,15,000 and is available at select Rado stores.   This came at a time when we are all experiencing isolation, and a representation of the reunions with loved ones that we all fervently hope may soon be possible Sumir Tagra||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/squaring-the-circle/article35779262.ece
07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Ranjith steps into the ring||The storyline of the underdog boxer making it big has been told so many times, one should have been bored. But Pa Ranjith’s Sarpatta Parambarai manages to hook the audience mostly because the director invests a lot in the secondary characters rather than make them mere two-dimensional props for the protagonists. Whether Dancing Rose (Shabeer Kallarakkal) or Daddy (John Vijay), they stand out with vivid personalities that make us want to see more of them. If this is the film’s first triumph, the second is Pasupathy as boxing coach Rangan. He delivers a nuanced and quiet performance that stands head and shoulders not just above the others but above the film itself. In fact, if the film had shown the kind of restraint Pasupathy brought in, it would have gained immensely. And one doesn’t mean restraint in the ebullience or loudness of its various characters or in the noisy and very public lives they live, but in its over-long, indulgent and populist screenplay, which takes away a certain sting the film could have otherwise delivered. Which brings me to Ranjith’s third triumph — his fearless and unabashed politics. There are so many voices that insist, more so today, that politics must be kept out of cinema or art or writing, yet Ranjith has never shied away from hoisting his banners and beliefs out there for the world to see. And he does so in this film, too. Set in the 70s, in Chennai’s Black Town quarter, a tough-as-nails area populated by port workers and labourers, the film establishes that it is the period of the Emergency. The DMK is in power in Tamil Nadu, like now. And the Chief Minister is M Karunanidhi, whose son Stalin is Chief Minister now. Rangan vadiyar is a DMK party member, and very early on, his boxer emerges into the ring wearing a robe with the rising sun emblazoned on it. Even as the main boxing action and clan rivalries play out, the background chatter — from bystanders, fans, newspaper mastheads — emits a steady stream of political news. Delhi, the film states, is becoming autocratic and Tamil Nadu is pushing back. In fact, history shows that Karunanidhi held out for seven whole months, refusing to implement Emergency laws and rulings. Finally, on January 31, 1976, his government was dismissed, President’s Rule imposed, and his party functionaries jailed. But for those seven months, Tamil Nadu was a sanctuary where many opposition politicians from the North fleeing the police took refuge. Writings, speeches, and pamphlets were printed in the state for distribution elsewhere as strict censorship had resulted in most newspapers not daring to print anything critical of the government. In the film, Rangan makes a speech where he praises his leader for holding out against the repressive Centre and ends by demanding the Prime Minister’s resignation. Given the hashtags reigning on social media now, it is impossible to miss the parallels being drawn. It is interesting, however, to see Ranjith shift focus from Dalit to Dravidian politics in this film. It is not that he abandons the Dalit movement — the references to slavery and oppression, Kabilan being asked to fight for “our people”, the ghetto-like milieu invoked are patent — but he seems almost to step back from the close-up and take a longer shot that includes the Dalit struggle and the Dravidian. But alas, while Ranjith’s intentions are impeccable, he falters in execution. Till the end, the two parallels — the larger story of Tamil politics and the more intimate story of the boxer — don’t really meet. They play on different tracks, imparting a strangely detached and impassive air to what could have been a fiery historical backdrop seeping into every pore and sinew of the players. The radio commentaries, the rickshaw driver’s asides, the newspaper headlines all become, therefore, merely ornamental, a historically correct setting, rather than provide the motivation for or drive the actions of the characters. And except for Rangan’s sojourn in jail, the characters remain seemingly untouched by the larger politics. To set the film in such a fraught era and to not then make it intensely about that era seems a bit of a bummer, but if Ranjith’s intention was to simply make a straight boxing film, then Sarpatta indeed ticks all the boxes.

07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Sanah Sharma Mehra on bagging the Red Carpet Green Dress Design Contest 2020||Chennai-based Sanah Sharma Mehra, 28, has just bagged the Red Carpet Green Dress (RCGD) award for 2020. The zero-waste gown designed with Tencel (a sustainable rayon fabric made from wood pulp), a first for Mehra, has been made keeping circularity in mind. “More research-based, innovation-driven fashion brands can collectively change the narrative for the better,” believes Mehra. Conceived by actor Suzy Amis Cameron during the press tour for husband James Cameron’s film Avatar over a decade ago, RCGD ‘challenges designers to create an Oscar- worthy dress made entirely of sustainable materials’. The contest guidelines reflect this: using certified eco-friendly, organic and/or recycled materials is mandatory, as is adopting initiatives to reduce textile waste. In addition to a cash prize and mentoring, winners will ‘see their designs worn by contest ambassadors’. The Pearl Academy graduate, who developed Planar Flux — a sustainable cutting technique that halves the amount of material used — back in 2015, says the idea to apply for the contest came about thanks to influencer Kestrel Jenkins’ podcast, Conscious Chatter . After she was interviewed by Jenkins last year, Mehra had listened to an episode featuring RCGD’s CEO, Samata Pattinson. Curiosity piqued, the designer (who runs her own label, sanahsharma.com) researched the organisation and submitted her application for their Design Contest in July 2020. Excerpts from an interview:  How long did the ideation and making process take?   This gown is special because of the design process behind it. Usually designers make a sketch of a finished product and work backwards, but my approach is different. I like to design the patterns, and then watch a silhouette develop. There’s a lot of risk involved because one can’t really predict the appearance of the end product right at the beginning.  How is this outfit different from your earlier designs?    The gown uses a special cutting technique of its own that amalgamates a concept in physics with garment making. It’s zero-waste and also has embellishments that are representative of the story behind the design. Additionally, it was designed with circularity in mind. So, later in the life of the gown, it can easily be converted into handbags, table linen, perhaps another dress too.  You’re said to have an ‘academic approach’ to fashion.    While researching, I was shocked to learn that we were making clothes the same way we did in the Middle Ages. The average cutting waste is about 15%. I wanted to change that and created my own cutting technique. I was inspired by renowned pattern cutter Julian Roberts [of the Royal College of Art, UK] and reached out to him to know if my methods had a place in the world, and he began mentoring me virtually. I also engage with students at the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), Iowa State University (USA), through workshops and guest lectures on experimental pattern cutting. What are you working on now?     We retail on digital marketplaces like Etsy, and our gender-neutral pret collection [to be launched this Diwali] is going to feature Oeko-Tex certified and GRS certified fabrics in very transitional silhouettes. We’re also working on a line made entirely with recycled handloom fabrics in easy, comfortable silhouettes [a September launch].  The unveiling of the winning looks will take place at this year’s Red Carpet Green Dress event in Los Angeles in September.

About weaves that are traditional yet contemporary enough to be used beyond the festival that falls on August 21. So while his new range features Kerala’s signature ivory gold kasavu saris, they come with contemporary tweaking. “It’s not a mood board driven line. Rather, it uses the age-old techniques such as plain weave, kattikara and extra weft patterning, but combined with different layouts,” says the founder-designer of Kochi-based brand Rouka. “Some saris are reversible. Others come in pastel palettes. We’ve also added modern stripes to the traditional vocabulary — such as nautical stripes. In fact, one of the saris just has straight lines across the warp,” he says. With the last year spotlighting sustainability more than ever, Jeevan says they have been looking at how to get “more wears” from a single design. One of the experiments created along with his cluster of weavers at Chendamangalam in Ernakulam and Kuthampully near Palakkad is the mundum neriyathum (the traditional two-piece set) . “In ours, the neriyathu [the upper part] can also be used as a dupatta. So customers can buy it as a ‘separate’ and team it with something they already own.” The colour palettes are innovative, too. A gorgeous series of pastel oranges is finding fans. As is a bold red in kasavu . “Onam has broken out of its traditional connotations. Now there’s events with just friends, or with younger cousins, or at work. So people want to have different versions of the kasavu for every context.” And Rouka is delivering.   The saris are priced between Rs. 2,800 and Rs. 10,500, on shoprouka.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/breaking-tradition-this-onam/article35779213.ece
07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Prateek Sadhu: distilling India on a plate||It is a dark and stormy night. Traffic on Delhi’s pot-holed roads has been crawling for hours. In the quiet, tree-lined neighbourhood of Friend’s Colony, however, 35-odd diners at boutique hotel The Manor are getting ready for a treat: a 10-course menu featuring some of the bravest, most avant garde Indian cooking yet. Inside, chef Prateek Sadhu, 34, is readying to roll it all out. This is the first day of a three-day pop-up of Masque, his Mumbai restaurant. Tickets sold out within 48 hours of announcement. Pop-ups in four other cities are to follow — Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata and Leh, where Sadhu will keep adding elements to the dishes, building newer ones as he finds inspiration in local cuisines and ingredients.  Unique and universal  Before the pandemic hit, Sadhu had been doing precisely this at Masque — a restaurant sans a menu, where guests are encouraged to sit inside a ‘lab’ and experience how he puts together thoughts and flavours after trips to different regions and farms across the country. The restaurant, which turns five this September, recently made it to number 32 on Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list of 2021 — the only Indian entry apart from Indian Accent in New Delhi (at number 18). But this is the first time that many gourmands in other Indian cities are getting to experience Sadhu’s distinctive cooking because even within our competitive, growing restaurantscape, Masque is more niche than popular, more experimental than mass. Which is a shame because it is perhaps the only one in the country that prizes pure experimentation over commerce. If Masque was cinema, it would have been Satyajit Ray’s. Like art house cinema, there is both the unique and the universal in Sadhu’s oeuvre. Take, for example, some of his dishes from the Delhi pop-up: course one was ‘Carrot k anji , b hekti ’ — brined and cured fish, pickled Kashmiri cherry, pickled lime, gongura greens, aam papad , and carrot kanji . Sour is perhaps the least accepted of tastes with the Indian palate. But Sadhu pushes that boundary with this study in sour. Fermented traditions from across India have been layered — northern Indian kanji , eastern aam papad , southern gongura , the pickled lime of the numerous pan-Indian achars , and the elusive Kashmiri cherry. In course two, Sadhu puts out ‘Corn pani puri , kalari kulcha , ghevar and chok charwan with tomato rasam ’. What could be the thread of thought running through his mind while putting together such disparate regional influences? A study in textures: of crusts and breads from several Indian regions. The Marwari ‘pure veg’ ghevar serves as a base for Kashmiri lamb liver, startling purists, but look closely and you’ll find a redefining of the idea of Indian bread.  Food that doesn’t pander  Sadhu seems to use his individual experiences — his Kashmiri roots, travels, and the innate internationalism that comes from his stints at top global restaurants such as Alinea, Le Bernardin and Noma — as the lens to look at more universal Indian culinary traditions. Kashmiri lamb neck yakhni meets morels miso in what turns out to be his most popular dish that evening; r ogan josh sausage and katlam , the Jammu bread, masquerade with NYC casual-chic; and Pondicherry chocolate gets combined with indigenous central Indian flower liqueur mahua that not many urban Indians have tasted before. “In a way what he does is the opposite of what I do because I do not mix different regional cuisines,” says chef Manish Mehrotra, one of Sadhu’s guests that evening, who came with his teenage daughter Adah. Mehrotra, widely regarded as the father of modern Indian cuisine, whose signature Indian Accent dishes continue to be copied and regurgitated by chefs in even small towns, finds Sadhu’s voice to be among the most unique in Indian kitchens. “He mixes cuisines and is not afraid to experiment even if diners here do not accept certain tastes or the importance of things like acidity, something that all Michelin-level dining pays attention to internationally,” he points out. Sadhu’s signature style is neither purist nor populist, and it is definitely not derivative. In fact, his individualistic experimentation is one of the ways forward for modern Indian food. ITC’s Manisha Bhasin concurs. “There are two schools of thought when it comes to Indian food, one is purist and other is inventive. But what I like about Prateek’s food is that it is not about presentations; the food talks to me, there is a purity in that,” says Bhasin. ITC hotels will be the venues for Sadhu’s pop-ups in Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru. Younger chefs like Dhruv Oberoi of Olive, who was also a guest at the pop-up, add that this is perhaps the boldest experimentation in Indian gastronomy yet — with a sense of internationalism in the dishes. “While a few of the courses like the lamb yakhni were comfort, there were bold combinations like chocolate and mahua that I had never experienced before,” says Oberoi.  What is authentic?  I remember the first meal I had at Masque, in the first week of its opening in Mumbai in 2016 in a mill compound that had fallen into disuse. There was Himalayan rye bread and sea buckthorn berries from Leh, there were textures of potato using techniques like dehydration, cooking in an earthen pit, andsous vide, there was olive oil specially pressed from Rajasthan. The whole approach was described as “botanical bistronomy” — what appeared to be a mix of international styles of cooking using carefully-sourced (and often unheard of) regional ingredients. Over the last five years, that focus has sharpened. Sadhu now uses Indian ingredients as well as cooking styles and techniques and refashions them. But the sense of internationalism still binds all these. Does he see his food as Indian? “Indian food as we know it today is a result of constant evolution. What is authentic? Is my mother’s rogan josh more authentic than what my aunt cooks? Authentic is subjective; food is the result of migration and is constantly evolving. So while tradition is important, innovation is critical,” he says. His Indian food, he points out, is not about returning to regional recipes and simply plating them with new tweaks. “It demands revisiting ingredients in altogether new ways that can build cross-cultural bridges,” he adds. As you eat a bhetki with clam rogan with a puri flavoured with Goan sausage, thinking cross-cultural bridges is inevitable. The pop-up menu will continue to evolve over all its stops — much like the journey of food itself.  The upcoming pop-ups will be priced Rs. 5,500 plus taxes.

Mehrotra, widely regarded as the father of modern Indian cuisine, whose signature Indian Accent dishes continue to be copied and regurgitated by chefs in even small towns, finds Sadhu’s voice to be among the most unique in Indian kitchens. “He mixes cuisines and is not afraid to experiment even if diners here do not accept certain tastes or the importance of things like acidity, something that all Michelin-level dining pays attention to internationally,” he points out. Sadhu’s signature style is neither purist nor populist, and it is definitely not derivative. In fact, his individualistic experimentation is one of the ways forward for modern Indian food. ITC’s Manisha Bhasin concurs. “There are two schools of thought when it comes to Indian food, one is purist and other is inventive. But what I like about Prateek’s food is that it is not about presentations; the food talks to me, there is a purity in that,” says Bhasin. ITC hotels will be the venues for Sadhu’s pop-ups in Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru. Younger chefs like Dhruv Oberoi of Olive, who was also a guest at the pop-up, add that this is perhaps the boldest experimentation in Indian gastronomy yet — with a sense of internationalism in the dishes. “While a few of the courses like the lamb yakhni were comfort, there were bold combinations like chocolate and mahua that I had never experienced before,” says Oberoi.  What is authentic?  I remember the first meal I had at Masque, in the first week of its opening in Mumbai in 2016 in a mill compound that had fallen into disuse. There was Himalayan rye bread and sea buckthorn berries from Leh, there were textures of potato using techniques like dehydration, cooking in an earthen pit, andsous vide, there was olive oil specially pressed from Rajasthan. The whole approach was described as “botanical bistronomy” — what appeared to be a mix of international styles of cooking using carefully-sourced (and often unheard of) regional ingredients. Over the last five years, that focus has sharpened. Sadhu now uses Indian ingredients as well as cooking styles and techniques and refashions them. But the sense of internationalism still binds all these. Does he see his food as Indian? “Indian food as we know it today is a result of constant evolution. What is authentic? Is my mother’s rogan josh more authentic than what my aunt cooks? Authentic is subjective; food is the result of migration and is constantly evolving. So while tradition is important, innovation is critical,” he says. His Indian food, he points out, is not about returning to regional recipes and simply plating them with new tweaks. “It demands revisiting ingredients in altogether new ways that can build cross-cultural bridges,” he adds. As you eat a bhetki with clam rogan with a puri flavoured with Goan sausage, thinking cross-cultural bridges is inevitable. The pop-up menu will continue to evolve over all its stops — much like the journey of food itself.  The upcoming pop-ups will be priced Rs. 5,500 plus taxes.

07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Everything now comes home||In March 2021, Bengaluru-based Ramya Shivaram (name changed) booked and paid a leading home services company to renovate her parents’ house. Cut to four months later. The company hasn’t finished the project or even delivered the material already paid for. “The execution team at Housejoy took more than 50% of the payment in advance and has failed to deliver. All they’ve done so far is to demolish one bathroom and have left it in an unusable condition. For the last two months, we’ve been pleading with the company to either refund the amount or deliver the materials. No action has been taken and the team refuses to acknowledge calls,” says Shivaram. There was no written agreement regarding refund or payments when the company was hired. “They only sent an email/Whatsapp message mentioning the procedure of payment. We were naive enough to believe that they would start the work once we made the payment, but they didn’t.” Online reviews are flooded with similar complaints against this company and others as well. As reported on consumercomplaints.in, a client booked Urban Company for painting his home this July, and despite paying an advance, the company is denying him service. Elsewhere, a carpenter from Housejoy went missing after receiving money from the client to buy materials. Another client says they paid Rs. 10 lakh, also to Housejoy, in February 2021 for house construction but when they cancelled the project a month later, the company ignored requests for a refund. ‘The only thing provided by Housejoy till date is a 2D floorplan of my house and a soil survey report. It has been four months and no one is responding’, states the complaint posted last month. Legal action While Sanchari Sinha, the Project Manager for Shivaram’s project, refused to comment, founder and CEO of Housejoy, Sanchit Gaurav, acknowledged that several projects have been delayed due to pandemic-related issues. “Material costs have gone up and, in many cases, clients have reached out to us with cancellation requests as well. We are not a builder, but a service provider. A majority of refund requests have been accepted and the rest are on track — a new schedule is expected to roll out to clients next month,” he says. The company diversified into interiors, renovations, and construction in 2018. “It has been our mainstream growth for the last two years,” says Sinha. “The segment is expected to witness exponential growth and we will expand its services in 15 cities in the next six months.” So, what legal recourse can clients like Shivaram take? If there’s delay or default or deficiency in service, customers can approach the consumer forum for refund and compensation, says S.C. Raghuram of Chennai-based Rank Associates. “The terms of contract and nature of work will have a bearing on the issue — whether the service provider gave any assurance for any period of time or whether there’s an arbitration clause in the fine print,” he adds. Pandemic boom Despite the many on-ground concerns, it is evident that tackling an unforeseen pandemic-like scenario was challenging for the many home-service players. Yet, their popularity hasn’t dipped. Tech-led home services companies such as Housejoy and Urban Company have actually seen a sustained surge in business. Says Santhosh Kumar, Vice-Chairman, Anarock Property Consultants: “In the pre-COVID period, even while these tech companies started at-home salon services, it was not as popular as it has grown to be now after the pandemic. Between the first and second waves, we saw a demand surge month-on-month.” As restrictions ease after the second lockdown, companies are again seeing growth in demand. “It’s almost nearing pre-Covid levels in categories like beauty or even surpassing those levels in categories like house cleaning, etc.,” says Kumar. The market has also seen the entry of new players such as Better Home. Launched in 2020 by Balaji Kalyansundaram, the hyper-local site offers home improvement products from stores in your vicinity and “targets customers who want to do small renovations, repairs, or beautification”. Kalyansundaram says they enable stores “to become digital with thousands of branded products added to their online store in minutes.” Now piloting in Chennai, the company has onboarded over 400 stores. Top categories Home cleaning and fumigation services have seen high demand since the pandemic. For instance, in 2020, Urban Company launched disinfection services and, more recently, they started pilots for cooking, nail art and haircuts at home. Co-founder Varun Khaitan says they are seeing a growing demand for tech-enabled home services across Tier 1,2 and 3 cities. “The pandemic has accelerated it as people can’t step out. Salon services for men and women have seen a massive spurt, while the pandemic also offered us an opportunity to attract non-traditional customers from older age groups.” While glass, hardware, sanitaryware, electrical, and timber products are popular at Better Home, Gaurav at Housejoy says the beauty category leads booking volumes through the year. “Home cleaning bookings are high during Diwali, while home appliances see a rise in the April-May period. Under home appliances, AC installations see greater demand, particularly in North India,” he says.  Despite the many on-ground concerns, it is evident that tackling an unforeseen pandemic-like scenario was challenging for the many home-service players||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/everything-now-comes-home/article35779264.ece
07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Investing in nature-based solutions||Several years before the pandemic struck, ecologists and urban design experts across the world were pushing for cities to work on a green agenda. To find nature-based solutions (NbS) to cope with rising urbanisation and the corresponding impact on our surroundings, in terms of high pollution levels, diminishing green spaces, and the spread of diseases, to name a few. Just like we seem to understand the importance of natural elements only when struck by a calamity, this time has been no different. With the world continuing to live under the dreary shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic, the conversation around NbS for cities has taken centre-stage yet again, and for good measure. Following a two-year global consultation, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) launched its Global Standard for NbS in July 2020. Through public consultation reaching hundreds of stakeholders from 100 countries, it ‘was developed to be facilitative, incentivising and enabling users to implement strong NbS projects’. The Global Standard includes self-assessment on eight criteria and associated indicators, which address the pillars of sustainable development (economy, environment and society) and resilient project management (iucn.org). The IUCN’s official announcement also states something very important, which most international policies lack: why was an NbS needed in the first place? It states that an increased demand for NbS has ‘led to cases of misuse of the concept, and even good intentions can result in harm to nature and people’. Topping the list on how they are misused is the fact that many don’t take into account social and economic factors. For example, they explain how a tree-planting project using just one non-native species could result in poor soil biodiversity, ultimately making it more costly or impossible to sustain a diverse forest in the future. Or how, restoring a mangrove forest to reduce the risk of storm damage, could be doomed from the start if upstream and downstream processes are not considered. In India, there are many successful stories of NbS, a majority coming from the rural heartland. In the Chirgaon village of Maharashtra’s Konkan region, wildlife conservator Premsagar Mestri has successfully increased the region’s otherwise diminishing vulture population over the past few decades. Organic farmers like Telangana’s Mavuram Mallikarjun Reddy (who recently bagged the Jagjivan Ram Abhinav Kisan Puruskar from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research) are among several across the country who are gradually switching over to natural farming practices. Over the years, The Institute for Transportation & Development Policy (ITDP) has successfully created models for cycle sharing in cities like Chennai and Pune, and continues to further the cause of sustainable and inclusive transport. A 2020 blog on The World Resources Institute (WRI) mentions how, through the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN), Surat, Gujarat has designed better management of natural water bodies and prevented construction on the floodplains in the city. Similar practices have been adopted by Burhanpur and Indore in Madhya Pradesh, where with the support of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), community participation helped in conserving and managing traditional water sources. Albeit heartening, a lot remains to be done to ensure the large-scale application of such NbS projects. While education and policies that work from the ground up are crucial, so is funding. According to the UNEP, if the world is to meet the climate change, biodiversity, and land degradation targets, it needs to close a $4.1 trillion financing gap by 2050. The current investments in NbS amount to $133 billion — most of which comes from public sources. The WRI blog makes a case for managing fiscal allocations under flagship schemes and funds as a way to raise finances. The National Clean Energy and Environment Fund, National and State Disaster Mitigation Funds, Compensatory Afforestation Funds, District Mineral Foundation (DMF) etc. can be tapped for anchoring NbS. What we need to see more of are well-planned urban rejuvenation projects — reviving water bodies and wetlands, encouraging eco-waste solutions, designing and promoting nature-friendly construction techniques, making public transportation accessible, among others. As for what we need to see less of, it’s our billionaires and trillionaires jet-setting to space at the cost of mind-boggling carbon emissions. We’d rather have them pump in these funds for the earth’s recovery. If only.

07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||A luxe look for less||Staying in is the new going out. This means that our homes have to be lush, lavish, and luxurious — and as inviting as possible so that we love spending all our time in them. Even if you’re on a budget, there are ways to make your home look like a million bucks. Give the ceiling a trim Moulding may not be a very Indian thing but adding a trim of moulding — be it on the ceiling or at skirting level — can give your room a whole new look. Light up with love Replace standard wall fixtures with good-looking ones. They don’t necessarily have to be expensive — even a string of fairy lights in a wine bottle looks good at night. Get a ceiling medallion A chandelier looks much more glam and opulent when it’s hanging from a POP medallion. They’re not expensive at all and an easy way to up the luxe factor. Paint your doors charcoal Doors are routinely left the way the builder gives them to us. We suggest you call in a painter, get him to sandpaper them and apply a couple of layers of glossy charcoal paint. See the difference it makes! Take the curtains higher Sure you’ve got new curtains for the living room and your bedrooms for the festive season. But hanging them high up — just under the ceiling line — makes your space look more expansive and expensive! Play with an interesting textile Nothing makes as strong an impression as a vivid textile. Be it a rug or an indigenous fabric, say ikkat, that’s cut up to make fancy cushion covers, textiles can amp up the sophistication. Add a piece that’s old Balance the sea of new furniture and decor artefacts with something old — it could be a chair that belonged to your grandfather or a chest of drawers that you picked up at a local bazaar. Incorporating a piece with some patina and age adds age-old luxury. Get a sculptural detail You may have ensured that you have the right mix of straight lines and circular forms in the room, but consider getting an element with an interesting shape or unique silhouette. An unusual lamp or side chair will feel almost like a piece of sculpture. Bring in a brass planter There’s only one simple way to add style and some colour to an empty corner. Bring in a potted plant — forget those ceramic planters, a brass planter adds a grown-up look and updates your corner with an extravagance that no other planter can. But keep the shine on! Layer your accents Be it rugs, pillows or throws, layering helps combine textures and colours and gives your space an uber-sophisticated look. Remember to ensure that your layers have a cohesive look. Stage like a designer It’s not easy to arrange furniture and objects in your apartment in a way that’s both pleasing and zen. Do it the way designers do — by considering each corner, each vignette, each space a small part of the composite whole. The whole needs to look good, but so do the parts! Simplify your style There’s a reason the Scandinavians have nailed the stylish yet luxurious look. They believe that less is more. Instead of a makeover, aim for a make-under. Getting rid of the clutter and overdose of accessories will make your room look chic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/a-luxe-look-for-less/article35779272.ece
07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||PMRDA to power Pune’s realty transformation||Recently, the Maharashtra state government appointed the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) as the special planning authority for the 23 villages which have been merged into the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). Not surprisingly, this move is being cited as politically motivated. After all, it is the appointed planning authority that also earns revenue via building permits. But given the past work successes of the PMRDA, this bodes well for the entire Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) including Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, and its surrounding areas. We can now look forward to fast-tracked development backed by adequate infrastructure. Back in time PMRDA was formed only in 2015, but in these six years, it has earned itself the distinction of being among the most dependable development authorities within the country. It operates on perfect models for development, ensuring transparency and governance. PMRDA has been instrumental in facilitating integrated planning while at the same time ensuring both economic and ecologically sustainable development. In the last six years, the PMRDA has given shape to numerous infrastructure projects that are vital for the growth of Pune city and its surrounding areas. It is in charge of major development activities as per the development plan and town planning schemes in the whole PMR — which is now the largest municipal corporation in India. Some of these key infrastructure projects include the Metro Rail project, the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS), Pune Ring Road, and the township planning schemes. PMRDA has already fast-tracked two of these projects — the Pune Ring Road and Shivajinagar-Hinjewadi Metro line. PMRDA is also the executing authority of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) under its region — covering approx. 842 villages. Tracking progress If we look at the progress of the PMAY (U) in the Pimpri Chinchwad region, Pune and Pune (CB) together, as many as 1,57,480 homes have been sanctioned by the central government so far. Of these, nearly 1,08.943 homes have been grounded while another 83,063 homes have been completed. Replicating the Ahmedabad model for its township planning schemes, the PMRDA has already rolled out its plan to develop the first Town Planning (TP) scheme at Mahalunge-Maan. The scheme started with much fanfare in late 2018, but COVID-19 derailed its progress. However, PMRDA now aims to speed up the work on this mega high-tech city in the vicinity of Hinjewadi IT Park. According to the plan, PMRDA will take a Rs. 600 crore loan from Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) to develop basic infrastructure facilities including roads, water drainage, etc. Once the support infrastructure is ready, private plot owners can develop their land here. This scheme will be spread over 700 acres of area and divided into nine sectors with plans for roads, water, drainage, school and garden. PMRDA also plans to develop 46 similar town planning schemes around the Pune Ring Road with both these projects being developed simultaneously. Advantage realty  With high-quality infrastructure and essential utilities like public roads, running water, electricity, proper waste, telecommunications, etc. these investments are assured in the future. More than $1.5 billion in funds have already been pumped into the city by institutional investors across all real estate segments — office, residential, retail, logistics and warehousing — between 2016 and March 2021.

07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Realty’s lending game||At least 67% (or approx. $67 billion) of the total loan advances ($100 billion) to Indian real estate by banks, NBFCs and HFCs is currently completely stress-free, reveals the latest study by Anarock Capital. Another 15% (approx. $15 billion) is under some pressure but has scope for resolution with certainty on at least the principal amount. Nearly $18 billion (or 18%) of the overall lending to Indian real estate is under ‘severe’ stress, implying that there has been high leveraging by the concerned developers who have either limited or extremely poor visibility of debt servicing due to multiple factors. Shobhit Agarwal, MD and CEO, Anarock Capital says, “COVID-19 has had a cascading impact across sectors, and ‘severely stressed’ loan levels in Indian real estate were expected to go up substantially. However, real estate — particularly the residential segment — has fared better than anticipated. Towards 2019-end, of the total real estate loan of $93 billion, at least 16% was severely stressed. Despite the devastation of the pandemic over the last one year, only 18% of the total $100 billion loan value falls under this category. This is definitely far better than other major sectors such as telecom and steel.” The loan story He explains how, moreover, the entire ‘severely stressed’ loan value in realty is spread across more than 50 developers. “In telecom and steel, default by a single company equals a sizeable portion of the overall stress in the sector. Also, every real estate loan is backed by hard security, which is anywhere between 1.5 to 2 times. Even if the loan is NPA, there is enough security for the lenders to recover a significant portion of their money,” adds Agarwal. The overall contribution of NBFCs and HFCs (including trusteeships) towards the total lending to Indian real estate is at 63%. Individually, banks accounted for the largest share of total realty loans with 37%, followed by HFCs with approx. 34%, and NBFCs have 16% and 13% loans given under trusteeships. Interestingly, since 2013, the share of NBFCs and HFCs has grown considerably — at the expense of banks. However, in the past 4-8 quarters, banks have been more active than NBFCs. Of these, banks and HFCs are much better placed with 75% and 66% of their lending book in a comfortable position. Not surprisingly, nearly 46% of the total NBFC lending is on the watchlist. City-wise breakdown About 75% of the total lending to Grade A developers is safe. This presents a comfortable outlook because out of the total loans given to real estate, more than $73 billion is given to Grade A builders. Of this, $55 billion is safe and under no stress. On the other hand, a high amount of realty loans given to Grade B and C developers needs strict monitoring. Close to 55% of the loans given to Grade B developers are under ‘severe’ stress; for Grade C developers, it is over 73%. In terms of cities, Pune and NCR are both high on stress with 40% and 39% respectively of the total loan given to them, followed by Mumbai with 37%. Hyderabad, Kolkata and Chennai are well placed with just 3-4% stress (however, their overall share of the pie is limited). Bangalore with a 15% share of overall lending has 76% book with no stress at all.  * Grade A developers are players that are currently active, with excellent execution track record, having developed real estate more than 3 Mn sq. ft. till date   * Grade B developers include those currently active, with an established execution track record having developable area of more than 1 Mn sq. ft. but less than 3 Mn sq. ft. This category may also include players with excellent past execution track records but are currently largely inactive.   * Grade C comprises players with less than 1 Mn sq. ft. developable area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/realtys-lending-game/article35779266.ece

07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Mumbai sees sharp rise in data centre capacity||As per realty consultancy Knight Frank’s latest Data Centre Report 2021, the data centre market has experienced strong momentum in 2021. The report — published in partnership with leading data centre research and analytics platform, DC Byte — cites that EMEA (Europe, The Middle East and Africa) markets have seen rise of 4% in uptake in the Q1 2021, to 120 megawatts (MW) with a 10% increase in new supply overall, totalling to more than 180MW. In Asia Pacific markets, total supply increased by about 200MW in Q1 2021, reflecting a similar pace to 2020 take-up – recorded just over 800MW, making a total supply of 5800MW across the region. Topping the charts Mumbai registered the sharpest increase in supply, with 56MW supply added in Q1 2021, recording total supply at 753MW. Pandemic influenced push for digital services resulted in an acceleration of new supply in 2020 with an additional 252MW or 50% added to its development pipeline. This marked up the total supply to 697MW in the year 2020. Between 2016 and 2019, Mumbai’s IT power capacity increased from 148MW to 456MW. The Q1 report 2021, which provides comprehensive coverage of 28 key markets, has closely tracked the significant pandemic-driven data usage shift in 2020, which in turn magnified the traditional ‘buy’ cycle and led to record developments in the global data centres market. This year the data shows it is apparent that whilst some markets have kept up with this pace others, mostly Tier II cities, have reported little supply growth in early 2021. Shishir Baijal, Chairman and Managing Director at Knight Frank India says, “Mumbai is amongst the better-established data centre hubs in the APAC region. The city’s location has a strategic importance as a landing destination for undersea data-cables connecting the east and west,” adding, “The presence of an established telecom industry in India and the push for digital services during the pandemic has further fuelled the growth of data centres in Mumbai. The rise of emerging markets in APAC has brought Mumbai under the focus of multiple international operators, who wish to establish themselves in this region.” Supply and take-up The digital push from the pandemic has resulted in acceleration of data centre supply in Mumbai. With the addition of 56MW, total capacity now stands at 753MW. With respect to take-up, Q1 2021 recorded 8MW, compared to 44MW in all of 2020, states the report. Cloud companies are continuing to develop a substantial network in Mumbai, which is aided by an ongoing stream of demand. This has facilitated the creation of multiple new hyper-wholesale co-location facilities. The increased supply can provide plenty of opportunity for creating a rise in take-up in the near future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/mumbai-sees-sharp-rise-in-data-centre-capacity/article35779267.ece
07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||All eyes on the monetary policy||This is the seventh consecutive time that the RBI has maintained status quo, largely on account of the ongoing COVID-19 uncertainties. On the upside, the RBI did confirm that economic activity is reviving with the ebbing of COVID-19 in most states across the country. Also, the real GDP forecast for the FY 2021-22 remains at 9.5% in the wake of the vaccination drive that is in full swing in India. All this is positive for the residential market, which has strong correlations to the overall state of the economy. The unchanged repo rate regime works well for home loan borrowers as the floating retail loan rates, which is directly linked to external benchmark repo rates, have been at the lowest level in the last two decades. The continuation of this low interest rate regime supports the environment of affordability which has become the new hallmark of the housing market - during the pandemic, and even before.  Anuj Puri, Chairman, Anarock Property Consultants   Citing the high inflation levels to be transitory in nature driven by short term supply side constraints, RBI draws attention to the promising high frequency indicators such as consumption, investment and external demand which are regaining traction as the economy is opening up in a phased manner. With the concerns of the second wave ebbing, supported by aggressive ongoing mass vaccination, broad-based policy support, normal monsoons, and likely easing of supply side issues, RBI maintains its growth forecast for FY 21-22 at 9.5%. As the economy gradually gains a foothold in the aftermath of the receding impact of the second wave, RBI has indicated greater confidence in the resilience of the Indian economy. Green shoots in the residential sector have emerged in tandem with the gradual improvement in the economic environment as businesses reopen. Prevailing lower home loan rates supported by RBIs policy rate stance, stable prices and attractive payment plans and schemes of developers are aiding the translation of pent-up demand into sales. If the downward trajectory in COVID-19 cases is sustained, the sector is expected to make a healthy recovery in H2 2021.

07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||My Olympic Gold||Thousands of cheers over thousands of years echoed through the Panathenaic stadium as I pumped my fist in victory on the medal podium, the sun glinting off my gold. Merely visiting the first stadium of the ‘modern’ Olympics in 1896 had me seeing stars (even without a knock from a shot put) — especially since my personal best in weight-lifting was hoisting a wriggling 6 kg baby. The Olympics, of course, had flagged off centuries earlier. Men chased one another around a track, togas flapping, in the 8th century BC. The Stade (the run to you and me) remained the only event for years until they gave in to the call to arms, along with legs. New sports included Pankration, which is the sort of brawl you’d now see in country liquor bars — boxing, wrestling and falling flat on one’s face. Even newer sports were added to reflect the times. The Tokyo Olympics introduced four. In homes across the world, kids sprawl before TVs, watching other kids do things their mums warned them not to, spine-curling twists upside down on skateboards. ‘Stop wasting your time and switch channels to the Olympics!’ shouts an irate parent. They are. Skateboarding and surfboarding were legit adds this year. Ah, the pressure of the board exams! Ask 13-year-old Momiji Nishiya who won the gold. Women first participated at the 1900 Olympics in Paris. In the early days, no woman could step on the track, and married women couldn’t even watch — what with those flapping togas! (The Greeks actually wore palliums, but flapping palliums isn’t quite kosher). Look at what we’re doing now, however. From Mirabai Chanu and Rani Rampal whose stories of grit and passion are making a billion eyes tear up, to Valerie Adams who won the bronze 17 years after she’d first won an Olympic medal, and held up a picture of her two kids who she’d had in between. I’ve been posting pics of my two kids, too. (As I said, I have all the makings of an Olympian). Alongside the gut-wrenching victories are other stories that we won’t forget. Siblings Hifumi and Uta Abe winning their judo competitions on the same day (parents worldwide, learn! Don’t stop your kids from pulping each other over one Lego block). Tajay Gayle, the long jump champ who twisted his knee, but continued to finish, through the pain. The one that had our hearts was Qatar’s Barshim who, having worked all his life towards this point, opted to share his gold with Italy’s Tamberi. Inspired, women are insisting their men do the dishes and the cooking. After all, the men are glued to the Olympics all day. Surely they’ve learnt to share the metal? Nothing comes near the exhilaration and crashes of sports, and some moments will seep into our vocabularies. The 11-year-old will ask for a sixthdosa, claiming he’s ‘going for gold’.

07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Squaring the circle||The watch face has always been where heritage brands tout their credentials. Pilot watches have bold, easy to see displays while diving watches have chronographs and timers to ensure dives are timed precisely. Jiten Thukral and Sumir Tagra’s design for Rado, True Square ‘Over the Abyss’, eschews all of that. Instead, the dial showcases firework-like hands — 18 spokes for the hour hand and 19 for the minutes. Taken together, the 37 spokes represent the number of time zones in the world, and, according to the New Delhi-based artists, is a way to depict human interconnectedness. “Communities cannot operate in isolation, and we empathise with this valuable insight. We wanted to connect the wearer with others,” says Tagra. A goal that takes on new urgency in the throes of a global pandemic.  Tech to last  The watch has been in the works for two years and, in the meantime, the world changed. “This comes at a time when we are all experiencing isolation, and a representation of the reunions with loved ones that we all fervently hope may soon be possible.” As the ability to move about became constrained, the duo embodied time zones, travel and migration in an object. The unique world-timer inspired display superimposes local time over the different time zones. Before the pandemic, Thukral and Tagra — who work with a variety of media, including painting, sculpture, video, and performance — had made a trip to Lengnau, Switzerland, to the Rado atelier. “It’s quite high tech, as one can imagine. Each material is tested to last for life. So the inks [and everything we used] had to be durable enough to be approved by the Rado standard,” says Tagra. For ‘Over the Abyss’, that meant achieving a new matte blue colour for the monobloc ceramic case and using cutting-edge robotics and nanotechnology to apply the vivid pink and blue gradient paint on to the delicate multi-spoke arms.  Time as a teacher  The first Indians to design a timepiece for the Master of Materials, as the Swiss watchmaker has anointed itself, the artists are aware that their watch is an emissary for the country’s art and design sector. “We are Indians and have been working over two decades to develop ideas and narratives about stories that are deeply rooted in our country. There is a gap that needs to be filled about educating people on design in India.” So, while the watch is rooted in Rado’s material innovation and capabilities — an in-house R763 automatic movement, with an 80-hour power reserve — it features the artists’ visual trademarks, like their use of pop colours. They’ve also incorporated a digital painting on the titanium caseback — an artwork from their ongoing Dominus Aeries series of paintings. Their own definition and relationship with time is interesting to note. During the virtual press conference, when asked about their work and inspiration, Tagra said, “The time owns the idea, we are only the hands that make it happen.” And when I pressed further, he explained, “Time is extremely powerful. There can be many ways to define it. For us, it is a measure, but also a teacher. It heals and it hurts at the same time. Whichever way one wants to see it, like a beating heartbeat, or melting ice, it stays as a marker of our lives.”  True Square Over the Abyss is priced at Rs. 2,15,000 and is available at select Rado stores.   This came at a time when we are all experiencing isolation, and a representation of the reunions with loved ones that we all fervently hope may soon be possible Sumir Tagra||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/squaring-the-circle/article35779815.ece
07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Breaking tradition this Onam||For Sreejith Jeevan, this Onam is about relevance. About weaves that are traditional yet contemporary enough to be used beyond the festival that falls on August 21. So while his new range features Kerala’s signature ivory gold kasavu saris, they come with contemporary tweaking. “It’s not a mood board driven line. Rather, it uses the age-old techniques such as plain weave, kattikara and extra weft patterning, but combined with different layouts,” says the founder-designer of Kochi-based brand Rouka. “Some saris are reversible. Others come in pastel palettes. We’ve also added modern stripes to the traditional vocabulary — such as nautical stripes. In fact, one of the saris just has straight lines across the warp,” he says. With the last year spotlighting sustainability more than ever, Jeevan says they have been looking at how to get “more wears” from a single design. One of the experiments created along with his cluster of weavers at Chendamangalam in Ernakulam and Kuthampully near Palakkad is the mundum neriyathum (the traditional two-piece set) . “In ours, the neriyathu [the upper part] can also be used as a dupatta. So customers can buy it as a ‘separate’ and team it with something they already own.” The colour palettes are innovative, too. A gorgeous series of pastel oranges is finding fans. As is a bold red in kasavu . “Onam has broken out of its traditional connotations. Now there’s events with just friends, or with younger cousins, or at work. So people want to have different versions of the kasavu for every context.” And Rouka is delivering.   The saris are priced between Rs. 2,800 and Rs. 10,500, on shoprouka.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/breaking-tradition-this-onam/article35779717.ece
07 August 2021||August 07 2021 00:00 IST,||Sanah Sharma Mehra on bagging the Red Carpet Green Dress Design Contest 2020||Chennai-based Sanah Sharma Mehra, 28, has just bagged the Red Carpet Green Dress (RCGD) award for 2020. The zero-waste gown designed with Tencel (a sustainable rayon fabric made from wood pulp), a first for Mehra, has been made keeping circularity in mind. “More research-based, innovation-driven fashion brands can collectively change the narrative for the better,” believes Mehra. Conceived of by actor Suzy Amis Cameron during the press tour for husband James Cameron’s film Avatar over a decade ago, RCGD ‘challenges designers to create an Oscar- worthy dress made entirely of sustainable materials’. The contest guidelines reflect this: using certified eco-friendly, organic and/or recycled materials is mandatory, as is adopting initiatives to reduce textile waste. In addition to a cash prize and mentoring, winners will ‘see their designs worn by contest ambassadors’. The Pearl Academy graduate, who developed Planar Flux — a sustainable cutting technique that halves the amount of material used — back in 2015, says the idea to apply for the contest came about thanks to influencer Kestrel Jenkins’ podcast, Conscious Chatter . After she was interviewed by Jenkins last year, Mehra had listened to an episode featuring RCGD’s CEO, Samata Pattinson. Curiosity piqued, the designer (who runs her own label, sanahsharma.com) researched the organisation and submitted her application for their Design Contest in July 2020. Excerpts from an interview:  How long did the ideation and making process take?   This gown is special because of the design process behind it. Usually designers make a sketch of a finished product and work backwards, but my approach is different. I like to design the patterns, and then watch a silhouette develop. There’s a lot of risk involved because one can’t really predict the appearance of the end product right at the beginning.  How is this outfit different from your earlier designs?   The gown uses a special cutting technique of its own that amalgamates a concept in physics with garment making. It’s zero-waste and also has embellishments that are representative of the story behind the design. Additionally, it was designed with circularity in mind. So, later in the life of the gown, it can easily be converted into handbags, table linen, perhaps another dress too.  You’re said to have an ‘academic approach’ to fashion.   While researching, I was shocked to learn that we were making clothes the same way we did in the Middle Ages. The average cutting waste is about 15%. I wanted to change that and created my own cutting technique. I was inspired by renowned pattern cutter Julian Roberts [of the Royal College of Art, UK] and reached out to him to know if my methods had a place in the world, and he began mentoring me virtually. I also engage with students at the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), Iowa State University (USA), through workshops and guest lectures on experimental pattern cutting. What are you working on now? We retail on digital marketplaces like Etsy, and our gender-neutral pret collection [to be launched this Diwali] is going to feature Oeko-Tex certified and GRS certified fabrics in very transitional silhouettes. We’re also working on a line made entirely with recycled handloom fabrics in easy, comfortable silhouettes [a September launch].  The unveiling of the winning looks will take place at this year’s Red Carpet Green Dress event in Los Angeles in September.

07 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Kejriwal, Puri flag off services on ‘missing link’ of Delhi Metro||Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday flagged off metro services on the Mayur Vihar Pocket 1-Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake stretch of the Pink Line. With passenger operations commencing on this section, the Pink Line is now 59 km long with the corridor linking the northern and eastern parts of the Capital with markets, transport hubs and hospitals in south and central Delhi. Mr. Puri said, “The Delhi Metro rail system has delivered a world-class transportation system to our citizens. This expansion has taken place with the least possible disruptions. While the stretch might look small in terms of network length but connectivity will play an extremely crucial link.” With the inauguration of the “missing link,” the Pink Line became the Delhi Metro’s longest operational corridor. Under the Phase IV network, the corridor will be further extended from Majis Park to Maujpur, making it the longest single metro corridor in the country, at approximately 70 km. Speaking at the flagging off ceremony, Mr. Kejriwal said, “It is a moment of great delight for all the people of Delhi that this area of the city, where a high volume of population lives, is being connected to the metro.” ‘Tough period for DMRC’ “For the past one and a half years, we are all fighting with the woes of the pandemic. It has been a very tough period for all of us. This period has been especially tough for the DMRC both financially as well as from the point of view of the new projects that they had undertaken. But the DMRC showed great resilience in facing the COVID-19 crisis, whenever possible, they efficiently handled their projects,” said Mr. Kejriwal. Land-related dispute The Pink Line, which was inaugurated in 2019, failed to become completely operational due to this 290 metre stretch where there was a land-related dispute. Delhi Metro officials said the train services from Majlis Park to Sarai Kale Khan Nizamuddin and Shiv Vihar to IP Extension stations will be available at a frequency of five minutes and 12 seconds with 43 trains, including standby trains, during peak hours. “Trains will be run with a temporary speed restriction of 25 kmph between Mayur Vihar Pocket-1 and Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake stations due to the non-availability of automated signalling system on the stretch, which is still under commissioning. It is expected to get the system commissioned in about the next two months. Thereafter, trains will move with regular speed on this stretch too, eliminating the need for speed restriction,” the DMRC said. Commuters on this line will be able to access transit hubs like Nizamuddin Railway Station, Sarai Kale Khan ISBT, Anand Vihar Railway Station and ISBT and markets like Dilli Haat- INA, Sarojini Nagar and Lajpat Nagar. The Delhi Metro network now spans across 390 km with 285 stations, including the Noida-Greater Noida Aqua Line and Rapid Metro Gurugram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/kejriwal-puri-flag-off-services-on-missing-link-of-delhi-metro/article35779517.ece
07 August 2021||Bengaluru,||‘Govt. must track homeschooled children to prevent dropouts’||A government-appointed committee formed to discuss various issues, including the reopening of schools, has raised an alert on the increasing number of parents pulling their children out of school with the intention of homeschooling them. To prevent a rise in dropouts, it has suggested that parents should register their children at the government school closest to their residence. The committee, in its interim report submitted to the Department of Public Instruction (DPI), recommended the measure so that officials could track the students. It suggested that students should be provided a unique ID on the School Achievement Tracking System so that they can be monitored. This system should be put in place for students in government and private schools. Many parents who had enrolled their children in top private schools too have decided to opt for homeschooling. Preethi S., who pulled her son out of a CBSE-affiliated school, said, “My son is seven years old and online classes do not work for him. Last year, there was no improvement in his learning curve, which is why I have decided to teach him myself.” To do this, she will work only part time. “I will send him back to school next academic year on if COVID-19 is under control and schools resume physical classes.” Gowthami Saraf, a parent who homeschooled her daughter and son and started a community (Bangalore Homeschooling Champions), said that in the past she would receive enquiries from one or two parents every week. Now, she gets 15 enquiries a week. “Parents find that online classes have not been very effective. At the same time, they have apprehensions and want to know how I juggled my children’s academics, work andhome,” she said. Private tutoring Some parents have roped in private tutors as they do not have adequate time to teach their children. The tutors who come home are paid by the hour, with their charges ranging from Rs. 200 to Rs. 350 an hour. On an average, tutors spend anywhere between 10 and 15 hours a week with the students. In many instances, private school teachers, who are struggling with pay cuts, have taken up part-time jobs as tutors. However, homeschooling is only successful if a parent or tutor gives the child the attention he or she needs. “More often than not, parents are pulling children out of school as they are unable to afford the fees. Students are left to themselves and do not learn anything,” said Mullahalli Suri, president of Parents’ Association. He added that there was a need for urgent government intervention to address this problem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/govt-must-track-homeschooled-children-to-prevent-dropouts/article35779344.ece
07 August 2021||Bengaluru,||‘Stop Spitting’ campaign flagged off||‘Every time you spit, you put the nation at risk’; ‘a single act of spitting can infect over 60 people in less than 24 hours’; ‘don’t be a spitter and stop those who do’… These were some of the slogans on the publicity material of the ‘Stop Spitting’ public awareness campaign launched by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) here onFriday. After launching the campaign in association with 20 different organisations, BBMP Special Commissioner (Health) D. Randeep told reporters that spitting was already an offence and was attracting fines. “We need to create awareness among citizens about the ill-effects of spitting, which can also cause the spread of communicable diseases, including COVID-19. We had launched the campaign earlier, but want to re-enforce it now,” he said, adding that civic officials, along with marshals, would also be part of the campaign. He directed the civic officials to penalise those found spitting in public places, according to the BBMP’s solid waste management bylaws. A press release stated that spitting on footpaths, at bus stands, traffic signals, and other public places hamper the city’s aesthetics and cleanliness. “It is everyone’s responsibility to keep the city clean. If someone is spitting in a public place, the person can potentially spread diseases. So, it is important to stop spitting and raise awareness among others to do the same,” the officer said, adding that if the rule is followed by everyone, the city can score well in Swachh Survekshan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/stop-spitting-campaign-flagged-off/article35779341.ece
07 August 2021||Bengaluru,||COVID-19 cases on the rise again in city||Relief from the high peaks of the vicious second wave has been brief as Bengaluru is witnessing a slow increase in new COVID-19 cases again. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Special Commissioner (Health) D. Randeep told reporters on Friday that there has been a slow rise in infections. From around 300-odd a fortnight ago, the number of daily COVID-19 cases being reported in recent days has been well above 400. With the marginal increase in cases, the positivity rate has also seen an increase, he said. As on Thursday, there were 155 clusters, including 78 apartments and 70 individual homes. According to the BBMP COVID-19 war room report on Friday, the number of micro containment zones, also known as clusters, is 162. Of these, the highest number is in Mahadevapura (42), followed by East zone (38), Bommanahalli (28), South zone (19), Yelahanka (17), Rajarajeshwarinagar (10), West zone (5), and Dasarahalli (3). Eight wards in the city have been reporting 50 to 100 cases every day, including Horamavu, K.R. Puram, Basavanapura, Kadugodi, Hagaduru, Bellandur, Rajarajesh- warinagar, and Begur. Mr. Randeep also said that with Karnataka being among the eight States in the country with high COVID-19 reproductive rate, efforts were being made to check the spread. The sero survey has already been taken up and the results are expected in a week’s time. Better infrastructure Meanwhile, the BBMP is stepping up the health infrastructure, from COVID Care Centres (CCCs) exclusively for children to physical triage centres (PTCs). The civic body has decided to increase the number of PTCs from 16 to 27 — i.e. at least one centre per Assembly constituency. If required, given the expanse of some constituencies, more than one centre could be opened. This apart, CCCs exclusively for children will be established in each of the eight zones. This decision has been taken considering experts have predicted that children will be most affected by the third wave. Mr. Randeep said that an exclusive CCC for children with 30-bed capacity has been established in Padmanabhanagar constituency. These CCCs will have the facility to put up the parents of children who test positive for COVID-19. Special wards for children are also being set up in many government and private healthcare facilities across the city. The BBMP is also seriously testing travellers from the neighbouring States of Maharashtra and Kerala. Both States have reported an increase in COVID-19 cases over the past few weeks. The BBMP is testing all those who do not possess a negative RT-PCR report and quarantining them in hotels until they test negative. The Special Commissioner said that just around 2% of the travellers were testing positive. On Thursday, around 25 persons were quarantined in hotels near railway and bus stations. Mr. Randeep said the civic body had already tied up with hotels to earmark facilities for the purpose of quarantine. The BBMP will be paying Rs. 750 per person per day to hotels that have these quarantine facilities. “Travellers can also book rooms privately. We have asked the zones to fix the rates after coordinating with the hotels,” he said, added that the BBMP was working with the hotels’ association to have more quarantine facilities, at least in the vicinity of railway and bus stations. With regard to the Delta case detected in Bommanahalli, Mr. Randeep said the civic body had once again collected samples from the primary and secondary contacts. The samples have been sent for genome sequencing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/covid-19-cases-on-the-rise-again-in-city/article35779339.ece
07 August 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan seeks compensation for farmers from PM scheme||Rajasthan has sought compensation for the farmers affected by excessive rain from the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana after a survey of the damaged crops. According to a preliminary survey of the Agriculture Department, the crops in an area measuring 3.69 lakh hectares have been affected. Agriculture Minister Lalchand Kataria said here on Friday that soyabean and urad in Kota, Baran and Bundi districts and bajra and urad in Sawai Madhopur district had suffered more damage in comparison with other areas in the State. The affected farmers should get the relief from the Prime Minister’s scheme, he said. Other districts affected by the excessive monsoon rains are Jaipur, Sikar, Nagaur, Karauli, Jhalawar, Alwar, Tonk and Bharatpur. ‘Process initiated’ Mr. Kataria said he had instructed the officials to initiate the process for getting compensation to the affected cultivators as per rules under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. The Minister said no eligible farmer would be deprived of the crop insurance compensation. The Prime Minister’s scheme provides insurance coverage and financial support to the farmers in the event of failure of any of the notified crops because of natural calamities and diseases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rajasthan-seeks-compensation-for-farmers-from-pm-scheme/article35779497.ece
07 August 2021||Kolkata,||Slogans like ‘BJMool’ created confusion, says CPI(M) note||The Communist Party of India (Marxist), in an internal party note, has said slogans such as “BJMool’ describing the Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) as two sides of the same coin have created confusion among the people and did not work for the party in the recent West Bengal Assembly elections. “The understanding of the CPI(M) is that the BJP is not like any other political party, since the BJP is governed by fascist RSS. This is party’s understanding. But during the election some confusion was created that BJP and the TMC were alike. Slogans like BJPMool and calling BJP and TMC two sides of the same coin gave rise to confusion,” an internal note circulated by the party earlier this month said. The document says the internal assessment of the party is “the BJP and the TMC are never the same. But something that needs to be kept in mind is that from the very start of Trinamool, its registration and the symbol, everything has been done as per instructions of the RSS. One of the characteristics of the BJP is that the party which takes its support it wants to gobble it. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the contest between the two parties is not fixed,” the statement said. During the run-up to the 2021 Assembly polls in West Bengal, not only the senior CPI(M) leadership was heard raising slogans like BJMool during the Assembly polls but described the political contest between the BJP and the TMC as “shadow boxing”. Ideological question The note titled “Circumstances during elections and our work” tries to resolve the ideological question which not only the CPI(M) but most of the Left parties in the State are grappling with — who is their bigger enemy in West Bengal, the BJP or the TMC. Political observers feel that several years after the former Chief Minister and veteran communist leader Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee gave the slogan “BJP Hatao Desh Bachao, TMC hatao Rajya Bachao [Defeat BJP to save country, Remove TMC to save State”], the party has not been able to give a new clear message to its supporters. It has taken two humiliating defeats for the CPI(M) to address the question who their bigger political opponent in the State is. In 2019, the CPI(M)-led Left Front failed to win a single seat of the 42 Lok Sabha seats and in the 2021 Assembly polls also, it failed to win a single Assembly seat. Many psephologists and political leaders believe that committed cadres of the Left voted for the TMC to keep the BJP out of power in the State. The 2021 Assembly polls saw a complete decimation of the Left Front with its vote share plunging to a meagre 4.73% and the Left failing to elect any member to the Assembly almost after five decades. The issue was also discussed by the party leaders in Kolkata on Thursday, the occasion of 133th birth anniversary of Muzaffar Ahmad, one of the pioneering figures of the communist movement in the country. Senior CPI(M) leaders, including State Secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra and Polit Bureau member Md. Salim argued that slogans such as ‘BJMool’ were never meant to give the impression that the BJP and the TMC were the same. ‘Congshal’ terminology Mr. Salim referred to a terminology “Congshal” used by the Left parties in the 1970s to refer to the Congress and Naxals, who were political opponents of the Left parties. “Did we not refer to the Congress and the Naxals as Congshal in 1970s? But did it mean they were one? They are two different parties,” Mr. Salim said. He argued that such coupling meant that the two political forces complement each other and serve each other’s purpose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/slogans-like-bjmool-created-confusion-says-cpim-note/article35779498.ece
07 August 2021||Lucknow,||U.P. police’s standards ‘falling’: High Court||The Allahabad High Court has expressed annoyance at the “falling standards” in the Uttar Pradesh police department, particularly among senior officers. The court made the remark while hearing a petition filed by senior journalist Vineet Narain. He and two others were recently booked for ‘levelling baseless allegations’ against senior Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Champat Rai and his brothers of grabbing land from a gaushala in Bijnor. Mr. Rai is the general secretary of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, entrusted with the task of building a Ram mandir in Ayodhya. Police had said the three were charged with hurting the sentiments of crores of people of a community, with fake documents, house trespass and forgery. Protection from arrest The court recently granted Mr. Narain protection from arrest. On July 28, it directed the Bijnor Superintendent of Police (SP) to file a counter affidavit to disclose whether any offence under the sections mentioned in the FIR was made out or not. On August 5, it noted that a notarised affidavit of the SP, alleging it to be a counter-affidavit, without disclosing the name of the deponent and without any swearing clause, “in a most careless manner,” was filed. This “ prima facie indicates falling standards in the police department, particularly among its higher officers,” said a Division Bench of Justices Surya Prakash Kesarwani and Piyush Agrawal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/up-polices-standards-falling-high-court/article35779499.ece
07 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Two held for cheating people on the pretext of food and liquor delivery||Two Mewat-based persons have been arrested for allegedly cheating people on the pretext of delivering liquor and food, the police said on Friday. Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Anto Alphonse said the accused have been identified as Tarif Khan and Taufiq, both residents of Rajasthan’s Bharatpur. Cheated of over Rs. 80K The police said one Amit Saini complained to them that he was cheated by a person of Rs. 82,500 in the name of providing food packets. The complainant was looking for food delivery for a retirement programme in his office when he contacted a number mentioned that he found on Google for home delivery. “The accused introduced himself as employee of the food joint [a sweet shop] and sent a bar code to the complainant for advance payment. After scanning the code, the complainant saw that Rs. 82,500 was deducted from his account in four different transactions,” Mr. Alphonse said. During technical investigation, it was found that money was transferred from a UPI ID into the Bank Accounts of Mewat. Fake mobile numbers Technical investigation of the mobile phones revealed that fake numbers of Odisha were used in the offence, which was having locations of Mewat, Haryana, Bharatpur Rajasthan and Khamman Telangana. During probe, the accused were nabbed from near Agra when they were driving in a car they had bought using the cheated amount. The accused told the police that several persons in their village are involved in such crimes. Earlier, they used cheat people on OLX but during the lockdown, they came to know that people are looking for liquor as shops are closed. Next, he uploaded fake mobile numbers on various websites for home delivery of liquor to cheat people. Accused also disclosed that he has purchased a JCB Machine in Telangana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/two-held-for-cheating-people-on-the-pretext-of-food-and-liquor-delivery/article35779511.ece
07 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Man arrested for duping over 60 farmers of Rs. 3.5 crore||The Economic Offences Wing arrested a 60-year-old man from Faridabad on August 3 for allegedly duping over 60 farmers on the pretext of giving them higher returns, the police said on Friday. Prem Chand duped around 64 farmers of approximately Rs. 3.5 crores, they said. These farmers sold their crops and grains to his shop in Narela market and since he was in debt due to business losses, he started retaining the proceeds of their crops by inducing them with an assurance of higher returns and issued receipts for the same, they said. But when farmers started asking for their investments, he fled to Faridabad in Haryana. An enquiry was initiated against Chand based on a complaint filed by a group of farmers. Additional Commissioner of Police (Economic Offences Wing) R.K. Singh, said: “Chand had committed the crime in 2017-18. He had assured the farmers that his Narela mandi shop and residence is worth crores of rupees.” “But when the farmers demanded their proceeds and investment back, he fled the mandi. Subsequently, the farmers came to know that the shop-cum-residence of Narela mandi was mortgaged. It was auctioned by the bank. During the course of the investigation, a Non-Bailable Warrant was issued against him,” he said. Chand is a graduate from Delhi University, the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/man-arrested-for-duping-over-60-farmers-of-rs-35-crore/article35779513.ece
