31 August 2021||Kabul/ washington,||Rockets target Kabul airport||The Pentagon warned on Monday of a “real” and “specific” threat of new attacks at Kabul airport, just hours ahead of the U.S. deadline to complete its withdrawal from Afghanistan that has been marred by Islamic State violence, with the airport coming under rocket fire. President Joe Biden has set a deadline of Tuesday to withdraw all U.S. forces, drawing to a close his nation’s longest war, which began in retaliation for the September 11 attacks in 2001. U.S. anti-missile defences intercepted as many as five rockets fired at Kabul’s airport early in the day. Afghan media said the attack was launched from the back of a vehicle. The Pajhwok news agency said several rockets struck different parts of the Afghan capital. No deaths While there were no reports of fatalities or airport damage from the rocket attacks, they caused greater anxiety for locals already traumatised by years of war. “Since the Americans have taken control of the airport, we can’t sleep properly,” Abdullah, who lives near the airport, told AFP. The U.S. and allied forces have evacuated about 1,14,400 people, including foreign nationals and Afghans deemed “at risk”, in an effort that began a day before Kabul fell to the Taliban on August 15. Meanwhile, Afghans fearful of reprisals under Taliban rule continued to crowd the airport, appealing to foreign powers for a way out. “We are in danger,” said one woman outside the airport.

31 August 2021||Chennai,||Avani, Sumit lead India’s gold hunt at Tokyo Paralympics||Avani Lekhara and Sumit Antil led the golden charge as India gained a rich haul of medals at the Paralympics in Tokyo on Monday. India won five medals, inclusive of two golds, two silvers and a bronze. However, the lone sour note was when Vinod Kumar, who won bronze in the F52 discus throw category on Sunday, was deemed ineligible after a disability classification reassessment by the organisers. India’s overall tally stands at seven with two golds, four silvers and one bronze, and it is currently placed 26th in the table. The day started on a rousing note as Avani became the first Indian woman to win a Paralympic gold after she registered a world record equalling score of 249.6 in the R-2 women’s 10m air rifle standing finals (SH 1). Coached by former ace shooter Suma Shirur, 19-year-old Avani pipped China’s Zhang Cuiping, who got a silver with 248.9. Much later, there was a golden encore from Sumit, especially in a season where javelin throwers have excelled with Neeraj Chopra having prospered at the preceding Olympics. Sumit erased his own world record while securing gold in the men’s javelin F64 segment. Sumit threw a distance of 68.55 m but was a wee-bit disappointed as he was aiming for more. “I was hoping for a 70-metre-plus throw, maybe I can do 75m. It was not my best, I am very happy to break the world record,” he said. The joys on the javelin front multiplied as veteran Devendra Jhanjharia claimed silver in the men’s F46 section. In the same event, Sundar Singh Gurjar trailed Devendra and got the bronze. Devendra, who previously won golds in the 2004 and 2016 Paralympic Games, etched his name as India’s greatest para-athlete, given his remarkable consistency across the years. Meanwhile, in discus throw, Yogesh Kathuniya won silver in the F56 category with a throw that registered 44.38 m. It was his best effort in his sixth and last throw, which ensured the medal and added glitz to a remarkable day for India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/avani-sumit-lead-indias-gold-hunt-at-tokyo/article36194043.ece
31 August 2021||New Delhi,||25% of vaccinated health staff contracted COVID-19: study||In an indicator of the diminishing role of vaccines in preventing transmission of the coronavirus, a little over 25% of the fully vaccinated healthcare workers of a Delhi hospital contracted a fresh or ‘breakthrough’ infection. None of the nearly 600 vaccine recipients, however, reportedly required hospitalisation. While previous reports of similar infections have been reported in other studies in India, this is the first time that such a high percentage has been reported as part of a single study. The study involved healthcare workers at the Max group of hospitals in Delhi and Gurugram, and was led by scientists at the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology. It appears as a preprint and is yet to be peer-reviewed. The timing between the first and second dose varied, but 482 took the second dose within 42 days of the first. About half the recipients had been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. To confirm a reinfection, the researchers relied on levels of antibodies that were directed towards the nucleocapsid region of the coronavirus, which is different from the region (spike protein) that vaccine-generated antibodies normally target. Currently, all the vaccines are designed to produce antibodies against the spike-protein and so high levels of antibodies against the nucleocapsid region were taken to be markers of a fresh coronavirus infection. A breakthrough infection is one where someone tests positive at least two weeks after their second dose. Shantanu Sengupta of the CSIR-IGIB and one of the scientists who led the study said that 25% was a “conservative estimate” as many of the infections were likely asymptomatic and only a subset of them who manifested symptoms were likely to get themselves tested. While the infections were mild it could contribute to healthcare workers unknowingly infecting patients, said Dr. Sengupta. For their analysis, the scientists relied on blood samples taken every week—upto 90—following vaccination and because this period coincided with India’s second wave, where most infections were due to the Delta variant, it was most likely that these breakthrough infections too were due to the Delta variant. “Two doses of the vaccine weren’t protective against infection but infection followed by vaccination—even a single dose—was significantly protective against fresh infections,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/25-of-vaccinated-health-staff-contracted-covid-19-study/article36194078.ece
31 August 2021||Bengaluru,||Six new metro stations record footfall of more than 15,000||In what was termed a “promising response” on the first day of opening, the six new metro stations on the Purple Line witnessed a footfall of 15,106 passengers. According to Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) officials, on Monday, a day after the Mysuru Road to Kengeri line was inaugurated, 7,630 passengers entered from the newly opened stations and 7,476 passenger exits were recorded. The total ridership recorded on both the Purple and Green lines was 1.83 lakh on Monday. Shankar A.S., executive director (operations), BMRCL, said, “The response received on the first day was encouraging. The footfall at R.R. Nagar and Kengeri TTMC were very promising. On an average, 78 trains are operated on the newly opened line.” The BMRCL is running trains with a frequency of 10 minutes between Kengeri and Baiyappanahalli.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/six-new-metro-stations-record-footfall-of-more-than-15000/article36194075.ece
31 August 2021||CHENNAI,||Schools, colleges to reopen as planned in Tamil Nadu; beaches closed on Sundays||Schools for Classes IX-XII, colleges and polytechnics will reopen in Tamil Nadu on September 1 as planned, while beaches will be closed on Sundays and no public display of religious festivities, including for Vinayaka Chaturthi, will be allowed, the government said on Monday. Ahead of the reopening of schools and colleges, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin held a meeting with top officials to take stock of the COVID-19 situation. The government has also mandated that with the situation prevailing in Kerala, college students coming from that State must be vaccinated and produce an RT-PCR test certificate. Hostels for school and college students and working men and women hostels can function in compliance with the COVID-19 protocol. Hostel workers must be vaccinated, and schools and colleges must ensure it. Mr. Stalin requested parents and teachers to ensure that students wore masks, maintained physical distancing, and followed public health guidelines. Taking cognisance of the massive crowds seen on the beaches last weekend, the government announced that beaches would be closed on all Sundays from September 5. All places of worship would remained closed from Fridays to Sundays, and the ban on public celebration of religious festivals would continue. The government announced a ban on the public celebration of Vinayaka Chaturthi. It banned installation of Vinayaka idols at public places, processions and immersion of the idols in beaches and waterbodies. The government requested people to celebrate the festival at home. Individuals alone would be allowed to go and immerse the idols at nearby waterbodies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/schools-colleges-to-reopen-as-planned-in-tamil-nadu-beaches-closed-on-sundays/article36194228.ece
31 August 2021||MANGALURU,||State govt. to change selection criteria for Rajyotsava Award||Minister for Kannada and Culture V. Sunil Kumar said on Monday that his department is now thinking of changing selection criteria for Rajyotsava Award. Speaking at a Meet-the-Press organised by Udupi Press Club in Udupi, the Minister said that the regular selection committee to be constituted by the government was hitherto selecting award winners based on applications filed before it. Now, in addition to screening the applications filed by those who seek the award, the committee itself will identify some of the most deserving prodigies for the award. The selection committee will do the ground level search to identify such talented persons and name them for the award. The Minister said that he will speak to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and officials concerned and take a final decision on forming guidelines. “People’s opinion will be also considered to transform it to be an ideal selection method,” he added. On a State flag, Mr. Kumar said that he has no intention to stir a controversy, but he will hold discussions with the Chief Minister. The Minister said that he has asked the Finance Department to restore grants reduced to various academies in view of the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-govt-to-change-selection-criteria-for-rajyotsava-award/article36194469.ece
31 August 2021||MANGALURU,||Offline classes in Udupi from tomorrow||Minister in-charge of Udupi district V. Sunil Kumar said on Monday that offline classes for students from Class IX to second year pre-university can commence in the district on Wednesday. Speaking to media persons in Udupi, Mr. Sunil Kumar, who holds Energy and Kannada and Culture portfolios, said that COVID-19 test positivity rate in the district has dropped to 1.4% in the last three days. The district was waiting for the positivity rate to drop below 2% to re-open physical classes. Teachers conducting offline classes should have taken at least their first dose of vaccine. Educational institutions should ensure that COVID-19 protocol are followed. Referring to the demand for allowing public celebrations of Ganesh Chaturthi, the Minister said that it is everybody’s wish that the festival should be celebrated with all fun and frolic. But the guidelines issued by the government should be followed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Hence, people should cooperate as the health of people should be guarded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/offline-classes-in-udupi-from-tomorrow/article36194470.ece
31 August 2021||Chennai,||Private hospitals lift less than 10% of vaccines||Private hospitals picked up only 9.4% of the COVID vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin — between May 1 and August 17, though 25% of the doses were allotted. Out of the 9.4%, private hospitals had administered 65% by August 13. On the other hand, 90.6% of such doses reached the government centres, of which they administered 97%. The figures were ascertained from an RTI reply received from the Department of Health and Family Welfare. In 12 States and U.T.s, including Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar and Assam, the share of doses supplied to private hospitals was less than 2% of the overall supply. In eight others, including Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab and Jharkhand, the share was 2% to 4%. According to the revised guidelines, which came into effect on June 21, the Central government will procure 75% of vaccines produced by the manufacturers. The remaining 25% can be directly sold to private hospitals. In the previous policy, which was effective between May 1 until June 20, States and private hospitals could directly procure from 50% of the vaccine pool. However, between May 1 and August 17, private hospitals' share in overall supply touched 25% only in Telangana (33%), Maharashtra (29%) and Delhi (29%). Doses supplied before May 1 were not considered for analysis as 100% of doses were procured by the Central government and supplied to States. Murali Neelakantan, Principal Lawyer at amicus, Mumbai, said mandatory upfront payment and uncertain delivery date were the reasons behind poor offtake from private players. “In the latest phase, private hospitals were asked to pay upfront for the doses, which was not the practice in the previous phases. Also, there is no fixed date at which the doses will arrive. Thus, they were not able to plan the administration process efficiently. This explains why the private offtake dropped,” he said. “Moreover, when the price was capped without any prior notice, the private hospitals which had paid upfront for the vaccines, were not able to sell the doses at a price which they had planned. Meanwhile, the demand in urban areas had come down while the supply in government. hospitals had picked up. Thus, they are holding on to the stocks, looking for other profitable avenues to deliver them. This explains why the utilisation is relatively lower now", he added. The government has acknowledged the poor performance of private hospitals in both dose administration and picking up their share of vaccines. On July 14, in a high-level meeting, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan highlighted that private vaccination centres and States had not physically lifted the vaccines they paid for in some regions. Also, wherever they are lifted, the administration has been poor, he observed. On July 24, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal had rued that the private sector has not picked up the 25% quota allocated to them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/private-hospitals-lift-less-than-10-of-vaccines/article36194079.ece

31 August 2021||MADURAI,||‘Distribution speed key to PDS success’||A person who was engaged in selling or distributing fair price commodities was expected to be sincere and honest in performing his duties, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court said, while dismissing a petition filed by a dismissed fair price shop employee. The court was hearing the petition filed by S. Suresh of Sivaganga district, who had been posted as salesman at the fair price shop in Eluvankottai village near Devakottai. He was terminated from service in 2010 following an inquiry after he was placed under suspension thrice. The petitioner challenged the termination order passed against him by authorities. He sought a direction to the authorities to reinstate him in service. He said the punishment handed out to him was disproportionate to the offence committed. It was said that he was unauthorisedly absent for a long time. Justice S.S. Sundar observed that the petitioner was working in a rural area where provisions like sugar, rice, palm oil and kerosene were daily requirements of the people. The public distribution system would be a success only when essential commodities reached the people without any delay, the judge said. The petitioner was unauthorisedly absent and a huge loss was caused as several commodities were spoiled. The petitioner himself admitted the charges framed against him and the only issue that remained was whether the punishment was proportionate. Taking note of the serious charges against the petitioner, the court said the contention of the petitioner that the punishment was disproportionate to the charges proved could not be accepted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/speed-of-distribution-key-to-pds-success-says-high-court/article36194260.ece

In a letter to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), a copy of which The Hindu has seen, the owners of Shahir Travel Agency that has handled Indian visas since 2009 asked the government to revoke the August 25 order and also to expedite the e-visa system to enable genuine cases of students, businesspersons, and others associated with India in the past who would need to leave Afghanistan urgently. “We have written to the Government of India with our very legitimate concerns… The problem this fake news has created is that the current personnel in power [Taliban] have been accused of something they did not do and that puts all our Kabul staff in danger. Therefore, we have to publicly and vociferously refute all the fake news in the Indian media,” Muhammad Karim, CEO of Shahir Travel Agency, the sole Indian Visa Application Centre (IVAC) in Kabul, told The Hindu . Mr. Karim said Taliban representatives had visited their offices, along with other offices and businesses in the city, but at no point were passports containing Indian visas taken by them or misplaced. “All the visas that were issued by the Embassy were done so after complete security check in Kabul. NIC (National Informatics Centre of India) maintains details of all visa sticker issued and biometrics captured,” the agency’s letter said, adding that the government could match the passport holders at any time required. MEA officials declined to comment on the letter. They said it was unlikely that the government would revoke its decision, given the uncertainty over the security situation in Afghanistan, and particularly after the deadline for all foreign troops to leave the country expires on Tuesday. Delay in issuing visa As The Hindu has reported earlier, the Ministry of Home Affairs has delayed issuing any e-visas, as it is difficult to conduct security checks on applicants without local inputs as the Indian Embassy in Kabul is closed. On August 27, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the decision to cancel thousands of visas previously issued to Afghan nationals had been made following reports of people “raiding one of our outsourcing agencies, where Afghan passports with Indian visas were there”. He did not mention who was responsible for the reports. Several media agencies had suggested that the worry was that a Pakistan-backed group or intelligence agencies may have taken the passports in order to use them for terror attacks in India. Mr. Karim flatly denied the possibility. He said the agency would not jeopardise Indian interests, having worked closely with the Embassy for more than a decade. He also stated that the agency office was operating normally at present, and Afghan citizens who had deposited their passports for the Indian visa were being returned their travel documents, as and when they were able to visit the agency. “We sincerely hope to begin our association with the Embassy of India whenever Indian officials chose to return. But we definitely feel we deserve the support of Government of India and do not wish to be left in the lurch. We request that this be clarified immediately by MEA on a public platform,” the agency said. To a question on how many passports were in their custody, the agency said it was still bound by a contract with the Government of India and could not divulge details.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/taliban-didnt-take-passports-visa-agency/article36193858.ece
31 August 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra breaks rising COVID trend||After nearly a week of cases outweighing recoveries, Maharashtra rallied again to see a trend reversal as 4,696 patients were discharged on Monday against a comparatively low surge of 3,741 new COVID-19 cases. The active case tally dipped to 51,834. The death toll was the lowest in a fortnight, as 52 deaths took the State’s cumulative fatalities to 1,37,209. The case fatality rate remains constant at 2.12%. Minister urges caution Health Minister Rajesh Tope has urged caution, with festivities (including the Ganesha festival) round the corner, exhorting people not to let their guard down and strictly follow the pandemic norms in order to preclude a potential ‘third wave’ of the virus. The total cases have reached 64,60,680, while the cumulative recoveries have risen to 62,68,112. The recovery rate has risen incrementally to 97.02%. “Of a total 5,38,12,827 laboratory samples tested thus far, 64,60,680 [with the average case positivity falling incrementally to 12.01%] have returned positive with more than 1.53 lakh samples being tested in the last 24 hours,” said State Surveillance Officer Pradeep Awate.

31 August 2021||KOLKATA,||Ire over toy train monetisation plan||A section of people in the Darjeeling hills of West Bengal are protesting against the Centre’s proposed monetisation of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railways (DHR). They have staged protests at 10 stations of the heritage railway that connects New Jalpaiguri with Darjeeling, across 87.48 km. There are four fully functional and operational railways networks in mountains and hilly terrains in India — the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway located in the foothills of the Himalayas in West Bengal; the Nilgiris Mountain Railways located in the Nilgiri Hills of Tamil Nadu; the Kalka Shimla Railway located in the Himalayan foothills of Himachal Pradesh; and the Matheran Railway located in Maharashtra. The protests against the proposed monetisation of the DHR were led by supporters of Anit Thapa, the chairperson of Gorkhaland Territorial Administration. Nipen Chettri, one of leaders who participated in the protests, said private companies’ focus would be on profit, and local aspirations of the people would be ignored. Raj Basu, secretary general of the DHR India Support Group, said they were not against privatisation, but it could not be a unilateral decision. “The Railways, the UNESCO and the local people should sit together and create guidelines, so that the heritage site can be preserved and sustained,” he said. Mr. Basu, whose support group has about 2100 active members, wondered why private companies would invest in a Railway whose earnings were Rs. 5 crore while the investment required to sustain it was Rs. 20 crore. He said the DHR was the only surviving, fully functional two-feet gauge railway in the world and that it was the pride of the people of Darjeeling. The services of the DHR resumed on August 25, 2021, after being suspended for almost a year due to COVID-19. The toy train service known for its curves and loops had suffered major damages over the past few years due to frequent landslides. On Monday, the DHR introduced a short service from Siliguri Junction to Rongtong, to attract more tourists. Built in the British era between 1879 and 1881, the Darjeeling toy train was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ire-over-toy-train-monetisation-plan/article36193871.ece
31 August 2021||SRINAGAR,||New initiative in J&K to restore lost glory of Pashmina shawls||Over a period, the number of women associated with hand-spinning of yarns for Pashmina shawls has dwindled significantly in Kashmir, but a rare initiative to double the wages and ensure round-the-year orders is likely to see the re-engagement of women artisans in a critical production process of the world-famous hand-made shawls. The Centre For Excellence (CFE) has been set up by shawl trader Mujtaba Kadri, who owns the ‘Me&K’ brand and Aadhyam-Aditya Birla Group at the old city’s Narwara area to restore the lost hand-driven processes involved in the intricate shawl weaving industry here. It will start enrolling women weavers from September 1. Reviving lost sheen “Old techniques of weaving are fading fast in Kashmir. Poor wages and machines have played a role in driving away women who used to spin the finest yarns in the world. This initiative is aimed at reviving the lost sheen of the hand-made shawls,” Mr. Kadri told The Hindu . The CFE has decided to double the wages for women from Rs. 1 per knot, of 10 threads with 10-inch-long yarn, to Rs. 2. “Unlike the past, the first bulk of Pashmina wool tufts will be given to women spinners without any charge. This will not force them for any investment,” Mr. Kadri said. “We are hopeful that it will attract women to the old style of spinning rather than mill spinning,” he added. Spinning on a traditional Kashmiri charkha allows longer threads of Pashmina wool with fine hair-like size, unlike machines, and adds to the softness and warmth of the product. A Kashmiri woman can spin up to five grams of wool a day. “We have the potential to engage around 1,000 spinners,” Mr. Kadri said. According to one estimate, women’s participation in shawl weaving has come down significantly from one lakh to just around 10,000 in the Kashmir Valley. It has impacted the processes involved in hand-made shawls such as sorting, dusting, de-hairing, combing, spinning and finishing; all these were dominated by the female workforce. In the backdrop of this trend, the Directorate of Handicrafts and Handloom, Kashmir, has announced a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for geographical indication (GI)-certified hand-made Pashmina shawls “to sustain the old techniques”. Incentivising the ‘old’ “The minimum wage for a spinner has been fixed at Rs. 1.25 now. We have proposed Minimum Support Price of Rs. 12,000 for GI-certified plain Pashmina hand-spun and hand-woven shawls,” Mahmood Shah, Director of the Directorate of Handicrafts and Handloom, Kashmir, said. He said the government was making all necessary interventions to ensure that those who employ old techniques and processes are “incentivised and promoted”. “The fixing of wages for the first time will help in reviving hand-spinning and hand-weaving, which make Kashmiri shawls famous,” Mr. Shah said. The move is likely to generate employment and improve the economic prospects of women weavers, who have for generations sustained the intricate and fancied Kashmiri shawls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-initiative-in-jk-to-restore-lost-glory-of-pashmina-shawls/article36193879.ece
31 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘This is renovation, not restoration’||The new-look Jallianwala Bagh memorial that Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated to the nation on August 28 was a distortion of history of the site where British troops massacred Indians on April 13, 1919, historians said on Monday. Mr. Modi virtually inaugurated four new galleries and opened the renovated memorial a year-and-a-half after it was closed for the revamp. The well into which victims jumped when forces led by Reginald Dyer opened fire has been covered with a transparent barrier. The narrow entrance has been adorned with sculptures. A daily sound and light show explaining the events has been started. Not a garden Reacting to the development, historian and former Jawaharlal Nehru University Professor Chaman Lal said it was a “distortion of history”. He said the project had tried to “mystify and glamourise history”. “People visiting Jallianwala Bagh should go with a sense of pain and anguish. They have now tried to make it a space for enjoying, with a beautiful garden. It was not a beautiful garden,” Professor Lal said. Rather, Jallianwala Bagh was where Indians gathered as they had on that fateful day when Dyer and his forces entered and fired on a peaceful crowd. Instead of restoration, the government has renovated the place, adding new features, he said. ‘Absolutely gaudy’ Historian S. Irfan Habib said he was not opposed to additions like better toilets or a cafe for visitors, but the changes made had been “at the cost of history, cost of heritage”. “It is absolutely gaudy...Why should there be murals on the wall? Changes the whole idea of the place from where Dyer entered to kill. Adding glamour to the little corridor changes the whole visual history. History itself is being rewritten and renovated. This is the corporatisation of monuments,” he said. He said the well should not have been covered and the changes were unnecessary and cosmetic in nature. “It is a very sad trend,” he said. Kim A. Wagner, a London-based Professor of history and author of Amritsar 1919 – An Empire of Fear and the Making of a Massacre , said in a tweet on August 28 that the revamping of the site “means that the last traces of the event have effectively been erased”. The project was carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India and NBCC, and developed by Ahmedabad-based Vama Communications, which has in the past worked on the National Police Museum in Delhi and Mahatma Gandhi Museum in Rajkot.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/this-is-renovation-not-restoration/article36193835.ece
31 August 2021||NEW DELHi,||India can deal with changing Afghan situation: Rajnath||The events in Afghanistan are raising new questions in terms of security, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday, while asserting that the government is alert and capable of dealing with any situation arising out of the crisis. “Security of Indians is a cause of concern for the government. We also do not want that anti-India forces to take advantage of the evolving Afghan situation for cross-border terrorism,” Mr. Singh said, delivering the third Balramji Dass Tandon memorial lecture organised by Panjab University via videoconference. The Indian government is constantly monitoring the situation in Afghanistan, he added. No compromise The government will not compromise on issues related to national security, national self-respect and uplift of the nation under any circumstances, Mr. Singh said. “Our goal is to make India prosperous, strong and secure. Such an India that does not scare people with its power, but instils a sense of confidence even in small countries that India’s growing power is not a threat to them. It is also going to instil a sense of security for them,” he said. Stating that some new threats have also emerged regarding national security, due to the development of modern technology, Mr. Singh referred to the drone attack at the Jammu Air Force Station. “We have to continuously update and upgrade the national security system for new challenges,” the Minister said. Listing a series of defence reforms by the government to achieve self reliance and bring cohesion, Mr. Singh said, “We are working towards creating Theatre Commands in a new way. This is also going to be a revolutionary step in itself. The process of discussion on this is still going on.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-can-deal-with-changing-afghan-situation-rajnath/article36193850.ece
31 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||India supports Palestine peace process: Shringla||India will support “all efforts” to restart the peace process between Israel and Palestine, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla conveyed to the UN Security Council meeting on Monday which also witnessed tabling of an important resolution on Afghanistan. “Given our long-standing and firm commitment to the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine, within secure, recognised and mutually agreed borders, living side by side with Israel in peace and security, India will remain fully supportive of all efforts to restart the peace process,” Mr. Shringla said. India’s presidency of the UNSC will end on Tuesday after a month during which the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan dominated the agenda of the topmost UN organ. Later in the session, a resolution on Afghanistan drafted by the United Kingdom and France was taken up for discussion and possible voting. The draft resolution seeks protection of civilians and security guarantees for humanitarian access. The text reflects international concerns about the security situation in Afghanistan and its capital Kabul. The humanitarian access mentioned in the draft resolution is aimed at ensuring that people who are willing to leave Afghanistan will be allowed to do so under secure circumstances beyond August 31, the deadline for the U.S. troops to withdraw from the country. It is understood that the resolution will be used to enforce a window of evacuation for foreign nationals who continue to remain stuck in Kabul. Apart from India and the U.S., many other countries have been unable to evacuate their nationals or allied Afghan personnel. At least 180 Hindu and Sikh Afghans remain in Kabul amid indications that the Taliban have delayed granting permission to them to travel abroad. The resolution can also be used to force the Taliban to adhere to some of the basic international humanitarian norms. The Taliban have been demanding to take up the issue of representation on behalf of Afghanistan at the UN. But experts here believe it is likely that a discussion on the Taliban’s right to represent Afghanistan at the UN will get “pushed” till the group allows full evacuation of foreigners and others willing to leave Afghanistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-supports-palestine-peace-process-shringla/article36193852.ece
31 August 2021||CHENNAI,||102 Vande Bharat trains to be operational by 2024||The Railways plans to operate 102 Vande Bharat trains by March 2024. Days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the operation of 75 Vande Bharat trains, the Ministry of Railways has floated tenders for manufacturing 58 rakes, each comprising 16 coaches. Tenders have already been floated for making 44 rakes. Railway officials say 102 Vande Bharat trains would be commissioned by early 2024. The Train18, later named Vande Bharat Express, was rolled out by the Integral Coach Factory, Chennai. It was showcased as India’s first semi high-speed train with an operational efficiency of 160 kmph and a game-changer. On the occasion of the 75th Independence Day celebrations, Mr. Modi said 75 Vande Bharat trains would be operationalised to connect different parts of the country. In the fresh tenders, the Ministry of Railways insisted on the compliance of the Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order 2017, and said there was “sufficient local capacity and competition in supply of the tendered item in required quantity and therefore public procurement of this items is restricted to Class-I Local Suppliers only”. The new tender published on Saturday invited bids for design, development, manufacture and supply of equipment for three-phase propulsion and components for train sets as per Research Design & Standards Organisation specifications. While contractors should certify the percentage of local (fully indigenous) components and imported items, the tender conditions laid down that the eligibility for bidders from a country that shared land border with India to participate in the tender would be governed by the Public Procurement Orders of the Department of Expenditure. Though the Vande Bharat train was celebrated as one of the most successful products of the “Make in India” mission, it ran into a controversy over allegations of compromises on safety bringing production of more rakes to a grinding halt. There were also allegations that one company was favoured in the making of the first two rakes leading to the railway vigilance officials registering cases against several officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/102-vande-bharat-trains-to-be-operational-by-2024/article36193863.ece

The Chief Minister was speaking at the Krishnotsava 2021 programme here. He suggested that those engaged in liquor and meat trade may take up selling milk in order to revive the glory of Mathura, that was known for producing huge quantity of animal milk. Mr. Adityanath also prayed to Lord Krishna to eliminate the novel coronavirus infection. “Every effort will be made to develop Brij Bhumi and there will be no dearth of funds for this. We are looking at a blend of modern technology and the cultural and spiritual heritage for the development of the region,” he said. He also complimented Prime Minister Narendra Modi for giving a new direction to the country. He said places of faith neglected since long are being revived now. Cabinet Ministers Laxmi Narain Chaudhary and Shrikant Sharma were also present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/adityanath-imposes-ban-on-meat-liquor-trade-in-mathura/article36194184.ece
31 August 2021||Patna,||Marandi issue hangs fire in Jharkhand||Almost seven months after the Babulal Marandi-led Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) merged with the BJP in February this year, the Jharkhand Assembly Speaker Rabindra Nath Mahato has not yet taken any decision on granting status of Leader of the Opposition (LoP) to him under the anti-defection law pertaining to 10th Schedule of the Constitution. For the past six months, the Jharkhand Assembly has been without an LoP. Mr. Marandi who had been a member of the BJP, was the first Chief Minister of Jharkhand after its bifurcation from Bihar in November 2000. Later, he parted ways with the BJP to form the JVM(P). Earlier, after the merger, the BJP had declared Mr. Marandi as LoP and chief of the BJP legislature party. However, Speaker Mahato took suo motu cognisance of the revolt of two JVM(P) MLAs — Pradeep Yadav and Bandhu Tirkey — against the merger, and initiated proceedings against Mr. Marandi’s membership under the anti-defection law. Mr. Marandi later challenged the Speaker’s decision in the Ranchi High Court. Last week, on August 24, the Speaker heard the case virtually due to the COVID pandemic. Pleading his case, Mr. Marandi’s counsel, R.N. Sahay said the Speaker’s court had no power to hear the case as the Election Commission of India had also ruled in favour of Mr. Marandi. Mr. Sahay also pleaded that since the case was already pending in the High Court, it would not be appropriate for the Speaker’s court to hear the case. The Speaker should wait for the High Court’s judgment in this case, he said. Mr. Sahay also said the merger of the JVM(P) with the BJP was made after the expulsion of two party MLAs Pradeep Yadav and Bandhu Tirkey for anti-party activities. ‘Against the mandate’ Former Dhanwar MLA Raj Kumar Yadav, who is also one of the petitioners in the case, meanwhile, said Mr. Marandi had contested the 2019 Assembly election on JVM(P) ticket but later merged his party with BJP which was “against the mandate”. Senior BJP leader and chief whip of the party in the State Assembly Biranchi Narayan said “the party will wait for the Speaker’s decision and the High Court’s judgment regarding this. What else we can do?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/marandi-issue-hangs-fire-in-jharkhand/article36193830.ece
31 August 2021||Srinagar,||Pandits take out rath yatras on Janmasthami in Kashmir||Kashmiri Pandits celebrated Janmashtami, birthday of Lord Krishna, with religious fervour in Srinagar on Monday and took out ‘rath yatras’ for the first time in Handwara district of north Kashmir. Kashmiri Pandits, a majority of whom migrated from J&K in the 1990s in the face of raging militancy, converged on Lal Chowk here and took out a religious procession. Men and women were seen dancing and showering flowers. Pandits also participated in a procession in Handwara market of Kupwara. “I want to thank the majority community and the administration for making it a success. We were able to celebrate the occasion like in the past,” M.Y. Yogi, a Kashmiri Pandit, said in Lal Chowk. “We prayed for peace in J&K on the occasion.” Top regional leaders — National Conference’s Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah; Peoples Democratic Party’s Mehbooba Mufti; Apni Party;s Altaf Bukhari and Peoples Conference’s Sajad Lone — greeted the community on the occasion. “The festival reinforces the belief that a life of morality and righteousness can be achieved amidst all difficulties through devotion, selfless service, commitment and compassion. We should renew our commitment to Lord Krishna’s ideals on this occasion,” Lieutenant-Governor Manoj Sinha said in a message. Such religious processions of Kashmiri Pandits were organised in the past too, especially during the regimes of Mufti Muhammad Sayeed, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Omar Abdullah. However, all such processions were barred last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pandits-take-out-rath-yatras-on-janmasthami-in-kashmir/article36193841.ece
31 August 2021||Kolkata,||BJP MLA Tanmoy Ghosh returns to Trinamool Congress||Tanmoy Ghosh, BJP MLA from Bishnupur in Bankura, West Bengal, joined the Trinamool Congress on Monday. Mr. Ghosh had switched over to the BJP from the Trinamool in March. With this, the number of BJP MLAs has come down to 73. The party had won 77 seats in the election. Party MPs Jaganath Sarkar and Nisith Pramanik, who won the election, did not take oath as MLAs. Mr. Ghosh, who joined the Trinamool in the presence of senior leader and Education Minister Bratya Basu, said the BJP was trying to snatch away the rights of Bengalis and malign the culture of the State. His decision to return to the party was also in protest against the use of Central agencies as a tool of “political vendetta”. Mr. Basu said, “I will tell the BJP leadership that the attempts to control West Bengal and Bengalis from Delhi and Gujarat are not going well even among those in the party.” The Trinamool Congress won 213 seats in the election by securing about 48% of the votes. The BJP’s vote share was about 38%. In June, Mukul Roy, who won from Krishnagar Uttar on BJP ticket, rejoined the Trinamool . On Sunday, former MLA Sikha Mitra, also the wife of former Congress president Somendranath Mitra, returned to the ruling party in West Bengal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-mla-tanmoy-ghosh-returns-to-trinamool-congress/article36193860.ece

31 August 2021||New Delhi,||Articles 15 and 25 ‘sold off’, says Rahul||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday asked if the Union government had “sold off” Article 15 and 25 of the Constitution that prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth and allows freedom to practise and profess any religion respectively. Mr. Gandhi tweeted a video that showed alleged instances of Muslim men being attacked and asked to chant “Jai Sri Ram”. “Article 15 and 25 of the Constitution has also been sold?” stated Mr. Gandhi, who has been attacking the government for its monetisation policy with hashtag “IndiaonSale”. CPI(M)’s charge Separately, the CPI(M) in its journal, People’s Democracy, said “everyday violence against Muslims is showing a disturbing pattern” and recounted “instances” of attacks in August alone in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. A 52-year-old autorickshaw driver was said to be attacked by two men in Rajasthan’s Sikar for allegedly refusing to chant “Jai Sri Ram” and “Modi Zindabad”; a bangle seller in Indore was allegedly targeted for selling in a Hindu locality ahead of Raksha Bandhan; an e-rickshaw driver was allegedly attacked in Kanpur ignoring the pleas of his minor daughter; and finally, a beggar and his sons were assaulted in Ajmer, the party said. The editorial of People’s Democracy said, “More and more, the mobs are emboldened by the knowledge that they can get off scot-free or be treated leniently by the law enforcement authorities”. It alleged that the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan was being utilised by the BJP and the Hindutva forces “to whip up feelings against Muslims and spread Islamophobia”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/articles-15-25-sold-off-says-rahul/article36193856.ece
31 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Can’t curtail right to move freely or reside anywhere on flimsy grounds’||The Supreme Court has held that the power of the State to pass an externment order or a direction barring certain people entry to specified areas should be exercised only in “exceptional cases”. The rights to free movement and residence across India cannot be curtailed on flimsy grounds, a Bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and V. Ramasubramanian held in a judgment. “A person cannot be denied his fundamental right to reside anywhere in the country or to move freely throughout the country on flimsy grounds,“ Justice Banerjee observed in the recent judgment. The court said externment orders have their use in maintaining law and order. However, they cannot be employed as a vindictive or retaliatory measure. “The drastic action of externment should only be taken in exceptional cases, to maintain law and order in a locality and/or prevent breach of public tranquillity and peace,” the apex court noted. The judgment was based on an appeal filed by a journalist, Rahmat Khan, who was at the receiving end of an externment order passed by the Maharashtra police. He was banned from entering Amravati City or Amravati rural district for a year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cant-curtail-right-to-move-freely-or-reside-anywhere-on-flimsy-grounds/article36193853.ece
31 August 2021||August 31 2021 00:00 IST,||25% vaccinated health staff got infected: study||Currently, all the vaccines are designed to produce antibodies against the spike-protein and so high levels of antibodies against the nucleocapsid region were taken to be markers of a fresh coronavirus infection. A breakthrough infection is one where someone tests positive at least two weeks after their second dose. Shantanu Sengupta of the CSIR-IGIB and one of the scientists who led the study said that 25% was a “conservative estimate” as many of the infections were likely asymptomatic and only a subset of them who manifested symptoms were likely to get themselves tested. While the infections were mild it could contribute to healthcare workers unknowingly infecting patients, said Dr. Sengupta. For their analysis, the scientists relied on blood samples taken every week—upto 90—following vaccination and because this period coincided with India’s second wave, where most infections were due to the Delta variant, it was most likely that these breakthrough infections too were due to the Delta variant. “Two doses of the vaccine weren’t protective against infection but infection followed by vaccination—even a single dose—was significantly protective against fresh infections,” he added. Currently too, Delta and its associated lineages comprise nearly half the coronavirus infections and are believed to be driving the infection in Kerala and Maharashtra. Those healthcare workers who were previously infected had a reinfection rate of 2.5% over the same period. In line with emerging evidence from several countries such as the United States and Israel where in spite of half the population being vaccinated, breakthrough infections are being reported, the study underlines that India too may not be immune to the phenomenon. “The neutralization of Delta variant by antibodies to non-Delta spike protein is greatly reduced. This means that neither prior infection by non-Delta variants, nor existing vaccines, are individually sufficient for the path to herd immunity. This also implies that masking is an essential part of any rational COVID control strategy, being agnostic to immune escape,” the authors note in their study.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/25-vaccinated-health-staff-got-infected-study/article36194440.ece

Earlier this month, the agency seized a sea-facing bungalow in Chennai and 16 luxury cars, besides two kg gold, during the searches in connection with a fresh case registered by the Delhi police accusing Sukesh of cheating and extortion. The premises of Sukesh’s wife Leena Maria Paul, a small-time actor, were also searched. The police have alleged that Sukesh had been running the racket from Delhi’s Rohini jail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-records-witness-statement-of-actor/article36193837.ece

Much later, there was a golden encore from Sumit, especially in a season where javelin throwers have excelled with Neeraj Chopra having prospered at the preceding Olympics. Sumit erased his own world record with a throw of 68.55 m, securing gold in the men’s javelin F64 segment. The joys on the javelin front multiplied as veteran Devendra Jhanjharia claimed silver in the men’s F46 section. In the same event, Sundar Singh Gurjar trailed Devendra and got the bronze. Devendra, who previously won golds in the 2004 and 2016 Paralympic Games, etched his name as India’s greatest para-athlete, given his remarkable consistency across the years. In discus throw, Yogesh Kathuniya won silver in the F56 category with a throw that registered 44.38 m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/avani-sumit-lead-indias-gold-hunt-at-paralympics/article36194031.ece

Other countries have also put in last-minute requests to bring out people in that category. The Taliban will take full control of Kabul airport after the American withdrawal on Tuesday, Qatar's Al Jazeera television network cited an unidentified Taliban source as saying. Humanitarian crisis As the evacuations wind down, a “far greater humanitarian crisis” looms ahead for the nation of 39 million people, the UN refugee agency warned. Agency chief Filippo Grandi reiterated a call for borders to remain open and for more countries to share the “humanitarian responsibility” of accepting refugees with Iran and Pakistan, which already host 2.2 million Afghans. “More resettlement options are sorely needed. They are critically important, not only to save lives but also as a demonstration of good will,” added Mr. Grandi. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid has said the Taliban will announce a full Cabinet in the coming days, and that difficulties will subside quickly once the new administration is in place. President’s honour Mr. Biden attended a ceremony on Sunday at the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to honour members of the U.S. military killed in Thursday's suicide bombing. As the flag-draped transfer caskets carrying the remains emerged from a military plane, the President, who has vowed to avenge the Islamic State attack, shut his eyes and tilted his head back. None of the fallen service members was older than 31, and five were just 20, as old as the war in Afghanistan itself. Even as the US troop presence in Afghanistan drew to an end, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters that it was “a particularly dangerous time right now”. An AFP journalist in Kabul said there was a constant sound of planes overhead, with aircraft taking off and landing, as well as jets offering surveillance and protection. In recent years, the Islamic State's Afghanistan-Pakistan chapter has been responsible for some of the deadliest attacks in those countries.

31 August 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Punjab and Haryana CMs spar over farm agitation||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and his Haryana counterpart Manohar Lal on Monday exchanged sharp words on the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s farm laws and the recent baton charge in Haryana’s Karnal. At a press conference here, Mr. Lal accused Capt. Amarinder (retd) of instigating farmers. To a question on Capt. Amarinder’s statement asking him to apologise to farmers, Mr. Lal said, “In what authority he is asking me to resign or apologise? Who is he to ask me to apologise or resign? Rather, he should resign for instigating farmers. About 85% of those sitting on Delhi’s borders are from Punjab.” Mr. Lal said those agitating and taking law and order in their hands were not farmers. They were politically motivated people. “The Haryana farmers are happily working in their fields. Those from Punjab are actually sitting at Tikri and Singhu borders,” he said, adding that the Congress and the Communist party leaders were misleading innocent farmers and provoking them to create chaos in Karnal as well. The Punjab Chief Minister slammed his Haryana counterpart for defending the assault on peacefully protesting farmers by putting the onus of their agitation on Punjab, saying Mr. Lal’s remarks had completely exposed his government’s anti-farmer agenda. “The farmers who were protesting against the BJP meeting in Karnal when the police rained ‘lathis’ on them belonged to Haryana and not Punjab,” said Capt. Singh. Blaming the BJP squarely for the farmers’ wrath, Captain Amarinder said the crisis would not have assumed such grave proportions had the BJP, including the Haryana Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, heeded the farmers’ concerns and empathised with their pain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/punjab-and-haryana-cms-spar-over-farm-agitation/article36193844.ece
31 August 2021||August 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Private hospitals lift less than 10% of vaccines||The remaining 25% can be directly sold to private hospitals. In the previous policy, which was effective between May 1 until June 20, States and private hospitals could directly procure from 50% of the vaccine pool. However, between May 1 and August 17, private hospitals’ share in overall supply touched 25% only in Telangana (33%), Maharashtra (29%) and Delhi (29%). Doses supplied before May 1 were not considered for analysis as 100% of the doses were procured by the Central government and supplied to the States. Murali Neelakantan, principal lawyer at amicus, Mumbai, said mandatory upfront payment and uncertain delivery date were the reasons behind poor offtake from private players. “In the latest phase, private hospitals were asked to pay upfront for the doses, which was not the practice in the previous phases. Also, there is no fixed date on which the doses will arrive. Thus, they were not able to plan the administration process efficiently. This explains why the private offtake dropped,” he said. “Moreover, when the price was capped without any prior notice, the private hospitals, which had paid upfront for the vaccines, were not able to sell the doses at a price which they had planned. Meanwhile, the demand in urban areas had come down while the supply in government. hospitals had picked up. Thus, they are holding on to the stocks, looking for other profitable avenues to deliver them. This explains why the utilisation is relatively lower now,” he added.  The government has acknowledged the poor performance of private hospitals in both dose administration, and in picking up their share of vaccines. On July 14, at a high-level meeting, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan highlighted that private vaccination centres and States had not physically lifted the vaccines they paid for in some regions. Also, wherever they are lifted, the administration had been poor, he observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pvt-hospitals-lift-less-than-10-of-vaccines/article36193846.ece
31 August 2021||August 31 2021 00:00 IST,||25% vaccinated health staff got infected: study||Currently, all the vaccines are designed to produce antibodies against the spike-protein and so high levels of antibodies against the nucleocapsid region were taken to be markers of a fresh coronavirus infection. A breakthrough infection is one where someone tests positive at least two weeks after their second dose. Shantanu Sengupta of the CSIR-IGIB and one of the scientists who led the study said 25% was a “conservative estimate” as many of the infections were likely asymptomatic and only a subset of them who manifested symptoms were likely to get themselves tested. While the infections were mild it could contribute to healthcare workers unknowingly infecting patients, he said. For their analysis, the scientists relied on blood samples taken every week —up to 90 — following vaccination and because this period coincided with the second wave, where most infections were due to the Delta variant, it was most likely that these breakthrough infections too were due to the Delta variant. “Two doses of the vaccine weren’t protective against infection but infection followed by vaccination — even a single dose — was significantly protective against fresh infections,” he added. Currently too, Delta and its associated lineages comprise nearly half the coronavirus infections and are believed to be driving the infection in Kerala and Maharashtra. Those healthcare workers who were previously infected had a reinfection rate of 2.5% over the same period. In line with emerging evidence from several countries such as the United States and Israel where in spite of half the population being vaccinated, breakthrough infections are being reported, the study underlines that India too may not be immune to the phenomenon. “The neutralization of Delta variant by antibodies to non-Delta spike protein is greatly reduced. This means that neither prior infection by non-Delta variants, nor existing vaccines, are individually sufficient for the path to herd immunity. This also implies that masking is an essential part of any rational COVID control strategy, being agnostic to immune escape,” the authors note in their study.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/25-vaccinated-health-staff-got-infected-study/article36193847.ece

31 August 2021||August 31 2021 00:00 IST,||He controls all||The Brahmasutra, having established that the soul alone is both the doer and enjoyer, further clarifies that this ability of action and enjoyment is dependent on Ishwara, the Supreme Brahman. The Sutra 'Parat Tu Tat Srute,' draws attention to the Srutis that affirm that everything in creation is derived from the Supreme Lord and is subject to His control, pointed out Si Mani Dravid Sastrigal in a discourse. The Upanishads state that each soul enters samsara to experience the effects of past deeds, good and bad. It is a fact that when the soul takes birth, it is endowed with the sthula and sukshma sarira. It also possesses a consciousness which expresses itself as the states of thinking, desiring, striving, etc. It is able to be the knower, enjoyer and doer. Then it may be asked that if it is all controlled by the Lord, where is the question of individual freedom. Why then should the individual be affected by the merits and demerits of such acts? Commentators have thrown light on many interesting issues regarding the question of individual freedom vs. God's control. What the sutra points out is that it is only through the Lord's sanction and grace that the jiva is able to think, desire, act, and so on. But He remains passive and does not in any way deprive the jiva of the freedom to act, think, etc. It is for the individual soul to utilise this freedom for its own good and for salvation. The Srutis also show that God is the sole arbiter to give the fruits of the countless deeds, good, bad and neutral, of the countless jivas in an impartial manner. This Lord is the Highest Being, is of the essence of consciousness, the ever present witness of all the activities gross and subtle in the universe without any exception by residing in each and every aspect of it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/he-controls-all/article36193861.ece
31 August 2021||LUCKNOW,||Mayawati’s loss is Akhilesh’s gain in U.P.||Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday called on senior BSP MLA Sukhdev Rajbhar, who has been ailing for the past two years, at the latter’s residence here, in his latest move to woo the non-Yadav OBC communities in Uttar Pradesh. While Mr. Rajbhar earlier this month announced that he was retiring from active politics, he ensured his son Kamlakant Rajbhar joined the SP. In a recent open letter, Mr. Rajbhar lamented that the “Bahujan movement” and “social justice” movement had weakened. He said he had asked his son to follow the leadership of Mr. Yadav. The switch by Mr. Sukhdev not only gives a boost to the SP before the Assembly election scheduled next year but also adds to the series of defections from the BSP. A five-term MLA, Mr. Sukhdev served as a Minister in the SP-BSP government and a Cabinet Minister in 1997 before being appointed Speaker by Mayawati from 2007-12, when she was in power with a majority.  “His [Mr. Sukhdev’s] experience and blessings are very important for us all,” Mr. Yadav tweeted after the meeting. The Rajbhars are a community concentrated in parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh and outfits like the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party of Om Prakash Rajbhar have become vocal in the State politics demanding a share in power.  The BSP also suffered a loss in western Uttar Pradesh as Brahmin leader Yogesh Dwivedi quit on Sunday. He joined the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), which is an ally of the SP in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mayawatis-loss-is-akhileshs-gain-in-up/article36193854.ece

Guha died of post-Covid complications at a private hospital here after a massive cardiac arrest, family members said. The writer, whose works of fiction reflected his closeness to nature and forests of eastern India, had been hospitalised earlier this month after complaining of breathlessness and urinary infection, they said. He had contracted COVID-19 in April. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee condoled the demise of Guha, describing him as one of the foremost writers in Bengali literature whose death will leave a void. “Buddhadeb Guha will be remembered for Koeler Kachhe, Kojagar , Ektu Usnotar Jonyo , Madhukari , Jangalmahal , Choroibeti and other books. He is the creator of two popular fictional characters in Bengali literature Ribhu and Rijuda,” Banerjee said. Born on June 29, 1936 in Kolkata, Guha had spent his childhood in East Bengal (now Bangladesh).

The wife, 32, was working with a well-known airline as an air hostess. She was made to quit her job by her in-laws after she got married. She alleged that her mother-in-law harassed her and forced her to get Rs. 10 lakh and jewellery from her maternal home.

31 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State govt. to reconsider norms for opening ration shops||The Tamil Nadu government has decided to reconsider the norms for opening fair price shops. A seven-member committee has been formed. Headed by the Commissioner of Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection, the committee consists of the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, the Managing Director of the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation, the nominee of the Department of Finance, the Tiruchi Collector, and the Joint Commissioner of Land Administration. The secretary, Consumer Protection Council, Tamil Nadu, Tiruchi, is the non-official member. There are two special invitees: the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and the Managing Director of the Tamil Nadu Corporation for Development of Women. The committee has been given three months to submit its report, according to a Government Order issued last week. According to the policy note of the Food and Civil Supplies Department placed in the Assembly recently, the number of fair price shops is 35,296, most of which are being run by cooperative institutions. After the DMK assumed office on May 7, about 3.38 lakh cards had been issued till July 31. At present, the total number of cards stands at 2.13 crore, including 2.09 crore cards eligible for rice. Broadly, there are two reasons for the government’s decision. Urbanisation, horizontal expansion of towns, the increasing application of technology and the changes in the population density constitute the primary reason. Secondly, the norms do not allow more fair price shops to be opened, though the number of cards is going up with the population increase. The recent developments such as biometric authentication and card portability under One Nation One Ration Card also have a bearing on the system. A fair price shops handles an average of 1,500 cards. In several cases, the number goes up to 2,000; in a handful of cases, it is even 3,000. Likewise, the shops have been located in such a manner that the cardholders need not travel beyond 1.5 km. There are around 3,550 mobile shops to meet the requirements of people in far-flung and hilly areas, and these shops are invariably attached to full-time shops. As for the proposed reorganisation, an official says there are full-time shops having only 200 cards, whereas some part-time shops handle 500 cards. The coverage in the hilly and tribal areas requires revisiting the guidelines. Another official says the number of shops is sufficient to meet the growing demand, and only some shops are likely to be relocated. T. Sadagopan, a consumer activist, feels the government should make public its plan and seek the views of experts and consumer organisations. As the government relies on the ration card database for administering welfare schemes, people feel compelled to seek the cards, thus creating the need perpetually for opening shops. Unless there is any change in the government’s position, the demand for more shops will always exist.  The number of fair price shops is 35,296, most of which are being run by cooperative institutions||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-govt-to-reconsider-norms-for-opening-ration-shops/article36194145.ece

31 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||End to toll collection is no respite to OMR residents||While the removal of toll plazas may come as a relief to thousands of commuters residing around and travelling on Rajiv Gandhi Salai, popularly known as OMR, they may have to brace themselves for traffic congestion for years as Chennai Metro Rail work is expected to commence soon. After Larsen and Toubro was awarded the contract to build the stretch from Kellys to Taramani, initial work, such as placing of barricades, has begun in some locations. Beyond Taramani, the stretch runs further and ends at Siruseri SIPCOT. The stretch has been divided into two sections for the convenience of construction — Taramani to Sholinganallur and Sholinganallur to Siruseri. “We have already called for tenders, and three bidders have been shortlisted for the stretch from Taramani to Sholinganallur, and the work will be awarded in a few weeks after the financial bid opens,” an official said. When full-fledged construction starts, commuters will have a tough time travelling through the limited road space. The construction is likely to be finished in 5-6 years. Celebrations on Sunday South Chennai MP Thamizhachi Thangapandian distributed sweets to commuters on Sunday to celebrate the end of toll collection. However, the impending Metro Rail work and the resultant traffic congestion and the continuance of fee collection at Navalur remain a bitter pill for many residents. Sources said CMRL will draw up a traffic plan that will cause minimal disturbance to residents. “We know how they function. The chaos in north Chennai was epic. From their past record, we see that they don’t bother about road-users and only aim at finishing their work,” said Mani Krishnamurthi, a long-time resident of Thoraipakkam. “We have witnessed the widening of the road in the late 1990s, the construction of the MRTS train after that and then the six-laning of OMR. And we have passed through immense traffic jams. We have no other go but to brace ourselves for more traffic jams,” he added. Vaitheeswaran, a resident of Navalur, said that without creating link roads to ECR and Velachery-Tambaram Road, motorists on OMR will suffer badly. “One road at Thoraipakkam is being stopped at the Buckingham Canal, which will be of no use to residents who want to avoid traffic snarls,” he said. The total loss of revenue due to the stoppage of toll collection has been projected at Rs. 600 crore since the collection was for a period of 31 years from 2008. The six-lane main carriageway was opened to the public on October 29, 2008, and toll operation started on December 15, 2008. “This loss is to the government since according to the agreement, the company running the road cannot take any profit and would have to plough it back into the road. It is a decision taken by the government, which it would have to bear,” said a retired official of the Highways Department. Passes for residents living along OMR are likely to be discontinued and only those belonging to people near Navalur and Siruseri are to remain effective. The lanes at the Navalur plaza will be increased using the existing space.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/end-to-toll-collection-is-no-respite-to-omr-residents/article36194130.ece

Park tenements||While it was widely believed that IIT-Madras was engaged to assess the quality of construction at the newly built Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) tenements at Kesava Pillai (K.P) Park here, the board has clarified that the assessment was in fact being done by Centre for Urbanisation, Building and Environment (CUBE). CUBE is an organisation formed in collaboration between IIT-Madras and the Government of Tamil Nadu. It has already carried out consultation, quality assurance and related work for several important construction projects around the country, officials said. The team was constituted for assessing the quality, following concerns over the poor quality of the construction work. An official from TNSCB said the organisation has been given specific terms of reference to thoroughly check the quality of construction in all the newly-constructed blocks at K.P. Park. “This includes carrying our concrete core cutting and examining the samples in at least 100 places, checking the quality of plastering and the quality of construction materials used,” the official said. The team is expected to submit its report in three to four weeks time. Meanwhile, activists have appealed for transparency in the quality assessment and also a public hearing. G. Selva, secretary, Chennai Central district unit, Communist Party of India (Marxist), said that the order and terms of reference issued to the assessment team had not been made public. “Once the team submits its report, it should be made public,” he said. He added that the assessment of quality should also include a public hearing to listen to the grievances of those who have been allotted houses at K.P. Park.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cube-engaged-to-assess-quality-at-kp-park-tenements/article36194143.ece

The report was released on the sidelines of the first Tamil Nadu CSR Summit 2021, organised by Sattva Consulting, in partnership with the Madras Management Association and Dhwani Foundation. Mr. Rajan said the corporate world had skill sets like data-driven, performance-oriented, benchmarkable, accountable and documentable processes, which a government with a development agenda ought to have but does not. Value of CSR The real value that CSR can add to society is by helping systems and processes — data-driven, evaluation-driven and so on — reach the last mile, he said. The problem with governments is that big problems get recognised, but the smaller ones fall through the cracks. Here, CSR can play a big role, Mr. Rajan said. There have been many times when CSR has been a leading example, such as in water conservation efforts made by NGOs (supported by corporates). CSR can become a benchmark for the government to live up to, he said. Mr. Rajan said he had a negative view on CSR 20 years ago. Compared to 20 years ago, now there is a crucial role to be played by corporate entities, which also greatly benefits society, he said. Many of the greatest democracies are the ones that hold governments accountable — the balance of power in a democracy requires institutions and civil society, supported by corporates and CSR, Mr. Rajan added. Tamil Nadu received Rs. 4,094 crore from 2014 to 2020, and is the fourth highest CSR spender in India, since the CSR mandate was made into a law in 2014, according to the report. In the last two years of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020, the State received over Rs. 800 crore each from different corporates in the country. Companies headquartered in Tamil Nadu played a key role, with 72% CSR funds received coming from them, it added. Education was the most preferred segment, with healthcare and rural development coming in the second and third places. According to the report, Chennai received a major chunk of CSR outlays, at close to 25%, with Vellore and Coimbatore receiving over 6% and 5% respectively. Aspirational districts However, NITI Aayog-recognised aspirational districts Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar received less than 1% of the outlay across the last six years, it said. The three districts of Ariyalur, Tenkasi and Tirupattur received none at all, the report said. The Finance Minister said data showing meagre spending of CSR funds in aspirational districts should be a wake-up call for corporates to be more thoughtful, granular and detailed in their approach.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporates-can-address-grassroots-level-problems/article36194115.ece
31 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||New shrimp species identified in GoM region||Scientists at the National Bureau of Fish Genetic Resources have identified a new species of shrimp in the Gulf of Mannar region. The shrimp was found in the shallow waters by fishermen who alerted the scientists late last year. The scientists studied the new species and published their findings ‘A new alpheid shrimp, Alpheus mannarensis sp. nov. (Crustacea; Decapoda; Alpheidae) from Gulf of Mannar, Southern India’ in the peer-reviewed international journal Zootaxa.  “We conduct regular exploration in the unexplored regions from Himalayas till Lakshadweep and Andaman. During one such survey we found this organism,” NBDGR principal scientist T.T. Ajith Kumar said. The fishermen in the region had been urged to alert them if they found unusual species. “When they spot a new organism they take photos and send them to us,” he said. He was accompanied by his student on his diving expedition in the Gulf of Mannar. “This is a shallow sea organism. We collected the specimen and examined its morphological and molecular constitution. We then communicated our findings to the journal in January,” he said. According to him, over 30,000 species had been identified across the globe, but in India it was only 3,000 so far. The researchers collected two male organisms from waters at a depth of 15m in a rocky area. Their finding was corroborated by international experts, Mr. Kumar added. “So far this organism has not been documented. The fishermen may have caught the species but may not have understood its importance. It is thought that the biodiversity of the Gulf of Mannar region has diminished but NBFGR’s discovery has proved that it is not true. If we continue the search it is possible to discover more new species,” Mr. Kumar said. The bureau has been working on propagating ornamental fish, helping create livelihood for fisher folk in Agatti, Lakshadweep. ICAR-NBFGR director Kuldeep K. Lal said the new species and other similar types from Gulf of Mannar had the potential for propagation. They could be used for the livelihood of native population. “Ornamental shrimps have high value in the global market and might be important in domestic market as hobbyists are becoming interested,” he explained. Activity similar to Agatti can be developed in GoM region “where conservation and livelihood generation can be harmonised. This will need active involvement and partnership of Tamil Nadu. The potential of these indigenous ornamental species, which are native to Gulf of Mannar, can be harnessed with income for fisherfolks while conserving the native resources”, Mr. Lal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-shrimp-species-identified-in-gom-region/article36194250.ece
31 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Employed residents of mental health institute get Aadhaar||Residents of the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), who are presently employed, have started getting Aadhaar cards. A number of residents in IMH, who have improved with treatment in the last few years, were working outside the campus including at the office of the Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services, bakery run by the institute’s industrial therapy centre and as housekeeping and security staff. “Recently, we started the enrolment process to get Aadhaar cards for 28 residents, who have taken up regular jobs. Without Aadhaar cards, it was difficult to complete the KYC (know your customer) process in banks where their salaries are being deposited. As a result, their accounts were difficult to operate. This was one of the main reasons why we started the process for Aadhaar enrolment,” P. Poorna Chandrika, director of IMH, said. A few days ago, 10 of these residents received the Aadhaar cards. Disability Rights Alliance helped in expediting the process, she said, adding: “We aim to obtain Aadhaar cards for every resident at IMH. This is the first step and will be followed by obtaining the Unique Disability IDs issued by the government. This will provide the homeless mentally ill with an identity and help in rehabilitation efforts.” She pointed out that in some cases, families that were hesitant to take residents home were unwilling to give the Aadhaar details if they already had one. During a meeting with the Welfare of Differently Abled Persons department, the need to get Aadhaar for inmates of all homes was pointed out, she said. Following this, the department, in a communication, said officers for the welfare of the differently abled in districts were instructed to collect data on the Aadhaar number of residents of homes for the mentally ill in the light of halfway homes being set up. Special camps would be organised by the Unique Identification Authority of India and Welfare of Differently Abled Persons department to ensure that each resident was provided with an Aadhaar card in these homes. Dr. Poorna Chandrika added that the district mental health programme would coordinate the process of Aadhaar enrolment in all homes throughout the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/employed-residents-of-mental-health-institute-receive-their-aadhaar-cards/article36194149.ece
31 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||ASHAs in T.N. sweating it out with no fixed working hours, less pay||It is a long wait for better pay for hundreds of Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) in Tamil Nadu. Starting with registration and follow-up of antenatal women, keeping track of immunisation of children to COVID-19 work in the last one-and-a-half years, the number of jobs they do has been increasing but their long-pending pleas for regularisation and better pay remain ignored. Serving as one of the links with villagers in hilly and hard-to-reach areas, ASHAs have been demanding regularisation of jobs, fixed monthly pay of Rs. 18,000 and recognition for several years. Their monthly incentives range from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 3,000, with some of them not paid on time in many districts. Over the last one-and-a-half years, ASHAs were involved in COVID-19 work as well. The latest addition for ASHAs in a few districts were works under the State government’s flagship scheme — Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam, a cross-section of them said. They were deployed in hilly areas in Tamil Nadu, Vahidha Nizam, general secretary of Tamil Nadu ASHA Paniyalar Sangam (AITUC) said, adding that there were 2,700 to 3,000 ASHAs working in hill and rough terrains. “When the concept of ASHAs was introduced through the National Rural Health Mission, we opposed it as it took away the permanent nature of jobs. This meant that there will be no permanent workforce for rural healthcare and they introduced incentivisation. Ironically, ASHAs work 24 x 7 from monitoring pregnant women to ensuring institutional deliveries, postnatal care and child care. They take schemes of both the Central and State governments to the rural population, and should be a permanent workforce. What is pathetic is that they are not even recognised as a worker, and none of the governments are looking into this issue with seriousness,” she said. Monthly incentive An ASHA, who has been working since 2009, said a few years ago, the Central government announced a monthly minimum incentive of Rs. 2,000 for them but majority of them had not received the amount till date. Another ASHA in a southern district said they had not received incentives for June and July. Officials cited lack of funds as the reason. “We have no fixed working hours. If a pregnant woman goes into labour, we have to take her to the nearest government hospital and follow up. We get an incentive of Rs. 300 for antenatal registration, and another Rs. 300 if we motivate the pregnant woman to deliver in a government hospital. Again, an incentive of Rs. 300 is paid for 45-days postnatal follow-up and immunisation of the baby. But these incentives are not paid on time,” she said. ASHAs were involved in COVID-19 work including Influenza-Like Illness survey and contact tracing of persons who test positive for COVID-19. “Only ASHAs were not listed as beneficiaries of the State government’s incentive for those involved in COVID-19 work,” she said. Recently, ASHAs of Kolli Hills block, covering Solagaadu, Pavarkaadu, Senthangkulam, Mullukurichi, Thenurpatti in Namakkal and attached to the association, submitted a petition to the Collector appealing to the State government to consider their long-standing demands. They pointed out that ASHAs were working in the State for the last 15 years but had no permanent jobs, no fixed pay and were considered as “volunteers”. Noting that the incentives were pending for six months to one year in many districts, they demanded that the incentives be paid by the 10th of every month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ashas-in-tn-sweating-it-out-with-no-fixed-working-hours-less-pay/article36194540.ece

31 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK’s new tack is talking point among rank and file||The observations of senior AIADMK leaders O. Panneerselvam and K.A. Sengottaiyan in the Assembly in the last one week, sounding conciliatory towards the ruling DMK, have become the talking point among the rank and file of the AIADMK. Participating in a discussion on Chief Minister M.K. Stalin’s announcement of a memorial for M. Karunanidhi on the Marina, Mr. Panneerselvam said his father was a “great admirer” of the former Chief Minister. Mr. Sengottaiyan said his party would stand by the government on the two language formula and the repeal of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to undergraduate medical and dental courses. He also praised the Anna Centenary Library, which was constructed when Karunanidhi was the Chief Minister. ‘MGR’s line’ According to some sections of the Opposition party, the “aggressive opposition” to the DMK should remain the “staple” all the time for AIADMK members. This was the line when the party founder M.G. Ramachandran and his successor Jayalalithaa were at the helm. Any deviation is not acceptable to them. A few long-standing leaders have refused to comment. However, R.B. Udhayakumar, secretary of the Puratchi Thalaivi Peravai and former Revenue Minister, does not see any change in the party’s basic position. “There may be a new look in the approach towards certain matters, but there is absolutely no change in the party’s policy,” he says, adding that one has to factor in that the DMK has been in power for a little over 110 days. Party’s role His party has always played a “constructive role” on issues of importance to the State, like the Mekedatu dam project, and supported the government. At the same time, the party has not shown any hesitancy in protesting in the current session by staging walkouts on a host of matters, including the White Paper on the State’s finances, the move to have Jayalalithaa University at Villupuram merged with Annamalai University and the special resolution against the farm laws. “We are also highlighting the ruling party’s shortcomings,” he says. Explaining the remarks of Mr. Panneerselvam and Mr. Sengottaiyan, the former Minister says that while the former has recalled his father’s feelings towards Karunanidhi, the latter, even while in power, would not say anything that would offend the sentiments of others.  There may be a new look in the approach towards certain matters, but there is no change in the party’s policy R.B.

31 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Giving Thirumavalavan a ‘stylish’ makeover||Photographer and one of Kollywood’s well-known public relations professional, Gunaseelan, has become a bit of an unlikely celebrity among the cadre of the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) and admirers of its chief Thol. Thirumavalavan, after he convinced the busy leader for a photoshoot, designed to make him look ‘stylish’, dressing him up in suits. The photographs, recently made public as part of Mr. Thirumavalavan’s birthday celebrations, went viral on social media — the leader looked starkly different from his fiery self, often portrayed in party posters and wall paintings. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Gunaseelan, who admires the Chidambaram Member of Parliament as a political leader, said he had been trying to do a photoshoot for five years. “I have clicked his photographs at public events, but I always thought that he had a photogenic face and wanted to do a photoshoot where he looked stylish,” Gunaseelan said. After a good showing in the recent Assembly election, Mr. Thirumavalavan decided to take a small break in Bengaluru and returned rejuvenated. “He looked really fresh and his birthday was also approaching... so I thought this was the best time to do it. I approached him and explained what I had in mind. I showed him some photographs. I assured him that this would not become an embarrassment to him or the party. Thankfully, he believed that I would be able to deliver what I promised,” he said. Mr. Gunaseelan said he and his team stitched his clothes and arranged for the shoot in five days. On the day of shoot “We asked him to come to the studio after a good night’s sleep. We cut his hair and styled him. The idea was to make him wear a blue suit like Ambedkar and take pictures of him holding a book. We also made him wear a brown suit. At first, he listened to our instructions, and then became comfortable and posed on his own. We told him the shoot would take one-and-a-half hours, but we ended up clicking photos for five,” he said. What has been the response from the party cadre? “I keep getting calls from them. They say ‘thousand kisses’ to you for showing thalaivar [leader] like this. Some say that they want to meet me and ask for my address. It shows how devoted they are to him and the party,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/giving-thirumavalavan-a-stylish-makeover/article36194123.ece

31 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||BJP to protest against resolution on farm laws||The BJP will hold protests at the mandal level across Tamil Nadu against the special resolution adopted in the Assembly, seeking the repeal of the three Central farm laws, in the next 15 days, party State president K. Annamalai said on Monday. Speaking to reporters after paying tributes to late Congress leader G.K. Moopanar on his 20th death anniversary, Mr. Annamalai, flanked by Tamil Maanila Congress president G.K. Vasan, said the DMK had in fact spoken about the farm laws earlier in their manifesto. Taking a look back “If you look at the 2016 election manifesto of the DMK, they have said that they want the direct sale of farm produce by farmers, doing away with the brokers and getting good prices for farmers’ produce at the international level,” Mr. Annamalai said. Mr. Annamalai said Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had said in the Assembly that he was fulfilling the promise of repealing the farm legislation, as mentioned in the party’s Assembly election [2021] manifesto. “It seemed to me like his speech did not have conviction in it. He said they were implementing it only because it was mentioned in the manifesto. No one in Tamil Nadu will be affected by the farm laws,” Mr. Annamalai added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-to-protest-against-tn-resolution-on-farm-laws/article36194118.ece
31 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Arrested ‘gutka’ seller admits to being child sexual abuser||The city police made a major haul of child pornographic videos from a petty shopowner at T.P. Chathram here. The scrutiny of the mobile phone of Perumal, 48, who was initially booked for possessing ‘gutka’ sachets at his shop, revealed that he had more than 200 videos. On Saturday, a police team, led by T.P Chatram inspector E. Rajeswari, found a few sachets of ‘gutka’ and ‘mava’ at the shop and seized them. Perumal was about to be released on bail. While conducting the investigation, the inspector wanted to scrutinise his mobile phone, which he refused to hand over. The police forcibly took away his phone, scrutinised it and found the videos. Further scrutiny revealed that the perpetrator in some of these videos was Perumal. He was sexually assaulting the victims, who were minor girls, in the presence of two women. The police found later that the mothers of these children had consented to the exploitation. Illicit relationship Police sources said Perumal had been running a shop in the area for long. He entered into a relationship with a 30-year-old woman by giving out groceries. Incidentally, she is the mother of one of the children sexually abused. He also entered into a relationship with her younger sister. Both had daughters who were going to schools. In their presence, he sexually assaulted their children, the sources said. The victims were aged 4-11. The women took Rs. 2,000-Rs. 3,000 from him whenever he visited them. He videographed his sexual acts on his mobile phone. The accused admitted that he had sexually assaulted three other minor girls, who were living at another place. Deputy Commissioner of Police R. Karthikeyan told The Hindu , “It was indeed a shock to us when we scrutinised his mobile phone. We have arrested Perumal and the two women, who abetted his actions, under the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. All of them have been remanded in judicial custody. We have seized more than 200 videos of obscene content from his mobile phone. The phone has been sent to the Forensic Sciences Department to check whether the content was supplied or circulated to others. Further investigation is on to find out the other victims.” ( Childline operates a toll-free helpline 1098 for children in distress ).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/arrested-gutkha-seller-admits-to-being-a-child-sexual-abuser/article36194126.ece
31 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Department of Posts takes savings schemes to people||The Department of Posts has started a campaign to reach out to people on its savings schemes, particularly those for children. It has also proposed a tie-up with the State government to implement various welfare and direct benefit transfer schemes through its wide network of post offices. Post offices are holding special camps to encourage customers to open post office savings bank accounts. The department aims to facilitate single point contact and ensure fewer hassles for DBT beneficiaries through the proposal for tie-up. Officials of the Postal department said a ‘Maha Login’ campaign was organised every Thursday to help people deposit in various savings schemes. Last Thursday, nearly 53,150 accounts were opened for different postal savings schemes across the State, including Tiruchi and Coimbatore regions. Of this, about 8,000 accounts were opened in Chennai city region (CCR) on that day. The special campaigns would be held till September-end. Veena R. Srinivas, Postmaster General (Mails and Business Development) said the department is focussing more to create awareness of savings schemes for children — Sukanya Samriddhi account (SSA) — for girls and Public Provident Fund (Ponmagan Podhuvaippu Nidhi), a 15-year- scheme that can be opened for boys. Nearly 80,000 more accounts in these two schemes are expected to be added through the campaign in CCR alone. Officials also noted that the SSA and recurring deposits were among the popular post savings schemes. There are nearly 23.33 lakh SSA accounts with deposits worth Rs. 4,670.81 crore across the State. Tamil Nadu stands first in the country in attracting deposits under SSA. The higher interest rates offered by post office savings schemes compared to other financial institutions was one of the major reasons for more investors turning their attention towards post offices. Nearly 7.20 lakh savings banks accounts were added across the State between April and July this year. In this, around 1.77 lakh were opened in CCR alone, officials said. “We are also creating awareness on various facilities including ATMs, mobile and net banking. As of now, postal customers can perform only online postal transactions like balance enquiry, money deposits and amount transfer within post office SB accounts. Intrabanking operations like NEFT and RTGS are in the pipeline,” an official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dept-of-posts-begins-campaign-to-reach-out-on-its-savings-schemes/article36194147.ece
31 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vaccination centre to cover outpatients at RGGGH||Soon, a COVID-19 vaccination centre will start functioning near the Outpatient Department (OPD) registration counter of the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) as part of efforts to improve the pace of vaccination. The hospital receives at least 10,000 outpatients and aims at reaching out to eligible persons who are yet to be vaccinated. Patronage This move comes after a vaccination centre set up at the Geriatrics OPD a few days started receiving patronage from senior citizens who were unvaccinated. “We got a good response for the centre established at the Geriatrics OPD. At least 150 to 200 senior citizens attend the OPD a day, and we vaccinate around 25 of them per day. The advantage is that most of them come for follow-up. We vaccinated them after doctors examined and declared them fit for inoculation. Many were willing to get vaccinated but we could not cover all as some of them did not bring ID proof,” E. Theranirajan, dean of RGGGH, said. He added that senior citizens were one of the vulnerable groups when it comes to COVID-19. Many of them did not get vaccinated till now mainly due to logistical issues. Poor numbers At the Diabetology OPD, doctors found that nearly 30-40% of the 300-odd outpatients were not vaccinated. Similar was the situation at Nephrology OPD, he added. “So, we thought it was better to set up a vaccination centre near the OPD registration counter of the hospital. OPDs start functioning at 7.30 a.m. every day. The number of outpatients a day has increased to 10,000, and at least 5,000 attenders will assemble on a given day. We will deploy a health educator team comprising a doctor, nurse, volunteer and postgraduate student of Community Medicine near the counter. They will check on the vaccination status of persons aged above 18 years and mobilise them to the vaccination centre that will be set up in the adjacent area,” he said. Vaccination would be carried out as per existing standard operating procedures, he said. The vaccination centre that would be established soon would function from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. This would be in addition to the existing vaccination facilities that included the round-the-clock centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccination-centre-to-cover-outpatients-at-rgggh/article36194138.ece

Called e-Source, it will link stakeholders in the formal and informal economy. The Indo-German Centre for Sustainability (IGCS) is spearheading the initiative, which aims to connect buyers and sellers of used and waste electronic equipment. The institute’s researchers, who are working on a method to generate a $50 billion economy from e-waste, said the world is expected to double the e-waste it has generated from the current 56.3 million tonnes. In 2019 and 2020 India generated 38% more e-waste than in the earlier years and only 5% of it has been recycled responsibly, they added. The initiative aims to make waste electrical electronic equipment (WEEE), a key resource in the evolution of a circular economy, by establishing traceability and recovery of post-consumer e-waste in the market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/iit-madras-to-develop-online-platform-to-tackle-e-waste/article36194536.ece

31 August 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Bharathiar University Syndicate to discuss graduate constituency registration issue||Bharathiar University’s move inviting graduates to register and registered graduates to renew their membership to the graduate constituency, it appears, has become a bone of contention among different stakeholders. More than a fortnight ago, the university had issued advertisement inviting graduates from Coimbatore, the Nilgiris, Tiruppur and Erode to register by paying Rs. 25 and renew by paying Rs. 15. On registration, the graduates become eligible to vote for two members from their respective districts to the Bharathiar University Senate. And, from the Senate, the elected member gets an opportunity to become a Syndicate member. In calling for applications for registration and renewal, the university had made it an only online process, which a few sections said was against the university’s Acts and statutes. The registration, renewal process also found a mention in the recent Senate meeting, held on August 25. Sources familiar with the development said the problem started last year when the university issued a similar advertisement and the Association of Self Financing Arts, Science and Managements Colleges – Tamil Nadu submitted applications for enrolment of 8,876 graduates to the constituency. The association submitting the applications after the deadline and the university receiving them was objected to by the Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers’ Association. The association’s Ooty president and Senate member R. Sanil raised objection saying it would be illegal to accept applications after the last date. Thereafter the colleges’ association moved the court for a direction to the university to accept the applications. Even as the case was pending, the university, in a Syndicate meeting held in January this year, decided to reject the applications submitted last year and call for fresh applications. It also decided to make the registration and renewal process an only online process. Objecting to the move, the colleges’ association had again moved the court arguing that the university’s move to completely make the registration, renewal an online process was violative of the Acts and statutes and the Syndicate did not have the powers to violate what was in law. Colleges’ association president Ajeet Kumar Lal Mohan said the university should make the graduates’ registration an online-cum-offline process, which would be only fair. Likewise, if the university were to discourage bulk registration of candidates, it would have to explain why it chose to accept applications in bulk last year when a few other associations submitted them, he asked. Given the opposing positions that various associations and stakeholders had on the issue, the university was expected to take a call in the next Syndicate meeting, said sources familiar with the developments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bharathiar-university-syndicate-to-discuss-graduate-constituency-registration-issue/article36194273.ece
31 August 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Bad road irks Konavaikalpalayam residents||Residents in Podanur, Konavaikalpalayam, Kanjikonampalayam and Vellalore want the civiv body to immediately repair the GD Tank - Konavaikalpalayam Road that it had dug for laying underground sewerage pipelines. In the last couple of months the road condition had worsened making driving very difficult, complained S. Sreekala, a Podanur resident. Given the fact that it was a main thoroughfare leading to other parts of the city it was imperative that the civic body repaired it at once, more so because schools were scheduled for reopening on September 1. J. Daniel, a Vellalore resident and an activist, said the Corporation had taken up the underground sewerage work around two years ago, six months after rebuilding the road. After every stage of the work, the Corporation had not readied the road as it should have leaving loose stones on the road surface, Mr. Daniel said. The residents wanted the Corporation to repair the road at the earliest also because this was monsoon season and two other alternative roads were equally bad. The Corporation sources said the civic body had paid money for restoring the road to the State Highways Department. The Department had spread wet mix macadam, a blue metal mixture, on the road surface. It would start work once the surface was ready for asphalt, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bad-road-irks-konavaikalpalayam-residents/article36194171.ece
31 August 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||‘Extend planning permission, building license period’||Coimbatore Consumer Cause has written to the civic body to extend the planning permission and building license period because of the difficulties faced during the COVID-19 lockdown period. In a representation, the consumer organisation’s secretary K. Kathirmathiyon said until February 2019, the Corporation issued planning permission for three years. After the State government framed the Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019, the validity was five years. Notwithstanding the extension of the validity period by two years, those applicants who had applied in 2017 and 2018 faced difficulty because they could not renew those in 2020 or 2021 because of the restriction placed during the lockdown. And, the three-year validity had expired. The problem in renewing building license or planning permission at local bodies was more as the officials were engaged in fighting the pandemic.  The Corporation should therefore extend the validity of planning permission and building license as the Central and State governments had extended the validity of various licenses and permissions during the lockdown period, Mr. Kathirmathiyon said and cited the driving license, vehicle insurance validity as examples. The Coimbatore Corporation would therefore do well to extend the validity of planning permission and building license till September 2021 – that is all licenses and permissions with expiry date between March 2020 and September 2021 should be treated as having validity till September end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/extend-planning-permission-building-license-period/article36194160.ece

SUDAR director S.C. Natraj said the village was located in Hasanur panchayat and was one of the remote habitations in Talavadi hills where public transportation continued to be a major issue. Kuliyada, Osatti, Uppatti, Pudukadu, Sokithotti, Kalkoosi, Beemarathotti, Devarnatham, Attapadi, Seekatti, Keelmavallam, Meelmavallam and other habitations were located around Kottadai. The school in the village was started in 1961 as a primary school and was upgraded to a middle school in 1996. At present, 95 students were studying in the school. After completing Class VIII at the Kottadai school, students travelled 20 km to the Government Tribal Residential Higher Secondary School in Hasanur for Class IX. “They have to travel through Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve,” Mr. Natraj said. About 60 students from Kottadai travelled to Hasanur to attend the school. Since bus service was not available on time, they started at 6 a.m. from their house and return by 6 p.m. every day. “Students discontinuing studies are common here that leads to child marriages,” he said. Mr. Natraj said people were demanding upgrade of the school for the past 10 years and had contributed Rs. 1 lakh for the purpose in April, 2013. In the absence of adequate bus services, there was an urgent need to upgrade the school in the current academic year to prevent further dropouts, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/upgrade-kottadai-school-to-prevent-dropouts-child-marriages/article36194285.ece

Subramanian on Monday said the Centre had informed that it would provide 1.04 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Tamil Nadu for September. “Appreciating the achievement of the State, the Union government allotted additional doses for July and August to Tamil Nadu, and we received 52 lakh and 57 lakh doses respectively. For September, the Union government has informed us that it will provide the State 1,04,98,170 doses — 90,24,070 doses of Covishield and 14,74,100 doses of Covaxin, ” he told journalists at Hosur. Priority will be given to those who had completed the window between the two doses of Covaxin. ‘Awareness needed’ He said that among the target population, 8,21,294 people in Krishnagiri had received the jabs. He requested people’s representatives to create awareness among villagers of the importance of vaccination. The inoculation drive for teachers and their families, in view of the reopening of schools, is being carried out at a fast pace, and 95% teachers in the district have been vaccinated, he said. Special camps are being organised for vaccinating college students as well. Responding to a query on announcing the Hosur government hospital as a District Headquarters Hospital, the Minister said the hospital had all facilities on a par with a government headquarters hospital, and announcements on this regard would be made during the grants discussion in the Assembly. Mr. Subramanian inaugurated a medical oxygen generator plant installed with Ashok Leyland’s CSR funds at the Hosur government hospital, and assessed the progress of the ‘Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam’ scheme in Pathukotta village. In 50 blocks According to him, the scheme is being implemented in 50 blocks and 100-150 more would be included by the second week of September. He said all 385 blocks in the State would be brought under the scheme by month-end. Mr. Subramanian said 10,000 to 15,000 people were getting treated under the scheme in a day. He said that though a scheme was launched for vaccination at private hospitals with CSR funds, very few people were turning up for getting the jabs. Mr. Subramanian said 1.07 lakh doses, worth Rs. 8 crore, were arranged with CSR funds in the district, and no other district in the country had achieved this. He appreciated the Collector for this feat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/104-cr-doses-to-be-given-for-september/article36194121.ece

31 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Probe into fall of girder used for elevated corridor begins||Preliminary enquiry by a civil engineering expert revealed that no supervisory engineer was present at the site where a 120-tonne girder fell killing a worker on the New Natham Road here on Saturday. “Such a major work should be conducted only under the supervision of a technical expert. As of now, it looks like only two workers were engaged in the work (of lifting the girder to place rubber bearings),” said K. Baskar, former head, Civil Engineering Department, National Institute of Technology, Tiruchi. After getting first-hand information regarding the accident on Monday evening, Mr. Baskar said that two more technical experts, one from Thiruvanthapuram and another from New Delhi, would join him on Saturday when a full-fledged probe would begin. “We will submit our report in 10 days,” he added. He inspected the site along with National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Project Director (Madurai) K. P. S. K. Mathivanan, and representatives of the contractor. Mr. Baskar raised certain pertinent questions about the accident. He wondered how such a heavy girder (a set of three concrete beams) could fall down after the hydraulic jack failed. “How could all the three girders fall down?” he asked the engineers. When he raised certain technical questions about which portion of the girder broke first and sought to know it from some eyewitness, none of the engineers could give him a reply which showed that no one was present at the site during the time of accident. The engineers explained to him that a mechanical failure in the jack had forced the 35-metre-long girder to fall down from the pier cap. Out of the six rubber bearings to be placed under the girders, work on five had been successfully completed. However, Mr. Baskar pointed out that the spot on the pier cap where the cylindrical hydraulic jack was placed did not have adequate space to hold it. He refused to buy the theories put forth by the engineers. “We will go through the documents, construction procedures (as part of the probe),” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/probe-into-fall-of-girder-used-for-elevated-corridor-begins/article36194258.ece
31 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Criminal proceedings against Kudankulam protester quashed||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has observed that spontaneous crowding, slogan raising and outburst in the absence of any violation or any criminal act must not be visited with criminal liability. The court quashed the criminal proceedings initiated against a Tirunelveli man for protesting against the establishment of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant in 2013. Ariharan Kencian had sought quashing of the criminal proceedings initiated against him. Justice G. Ilangovan observed that it was established that the right to protest expressing grievance over a particular issue was well recognised. The only clarification was that it should not end in any illegal activity or crime. The judge pointed out that the Supreme Court in 2013 observed that endeavour should be made to withdraw criminal cases filed against the agitators so that peace and normalcy could be restored at Kudankulam. Further, the Supreme Court had observed that steps must be taken to educate the people of the necessity of the plant which was in the larger interest of the nation, particularly Tamil Nadu, the judge said. The case pertaining to the nuclear power plant was decided in 2013 but thereafter it appeared that the problem, which was created because of the running of the power plant, did not abate and also no effort was made by the State government to withdraw the cases, the judge said. As there was some sort of misconception with regard to the functioning of the plant, due to certain incidents that had taken place in various parts of the world, the protest by the people was a spontaneous one and not organised. The judge also took note of the fact that one final report submitted by the police stated that in one such protest that took place at 1 a.m. the police had identified protesters with the help of torch lights.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/criminal-proceedings-against-kudankulam-protester-quashed/article36194251.ece

Stalin, to take a slew of environmental protection steps as the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that average rainfall in Madurai district will gradually coming down. He wanted the Chief Minister to take efforts to increase the green cover in Madurai district and also to restore all waterbodies to their original capacities on a war footing.

31 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC dismisses plea of TNSTC bus conductor||Taking serious view of the fact that a TNSTC bus conductor misappropriated money by reissuing the tickets that were already sold in previous trips, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court dismissed a petition filed by the bus conductor seeking to be reinstated into service. The court was hearing the petition filed by U. Chelladurai of Madurai. He challenged a labour court order that confirmed the findings of the inquiry officer. He denied the allegations that he had reissued the already sold tickets. In 1989, the petitioner was on duty as conductor on the bus from Palamedu to Teppakulam, Madurai. The Checking Inspector during an inspection found out that the petitioner had reissued the tickets already sold to different passengers. The Checking Inspector gathered the reissued tickets and sought a statement from the conductor. But, the bus conductor refused to give a statement. It was found out that he had misappropriated a sum of Rs. 31. He was suspended and then dismissed from service in 1991. The petitioner approached the labour court. The labour court confirmed the findings of the inquiry officer and dismissed the petition. Justice S. S. Sundar observed the petitioner had not given proper explanation to the specific charges. The findings of the inquiry officer and the labour court were based on records. “The scope of judicial review is very limited”, the judge said. The court cannot interfere with the findings of the disciplinary authority or the labour court unless the findings are perverse. The amount of misappropriation may be meagre. But the misconduct should be considered serious, the judge said and dismissed the petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-dismisses-plea-of-tnstc-bus-conductor/article36194253.ece

Mr. Thiaga Rajan said, “In any society, we can never say when disasters will occur, but to tackle them, risk reduction has to be done at all levels of the government. Also, whenever a disaster strikes, there needs to be immediate response and action. When the 2015 Chennai floods happened, a CAG report said that the disaster management committee at the State-level should meet once in every three or six months to discuss the problems relating to disaster response. From 2012-15, the committee meetings never actually happened. Even regarding the fire accident that took place at Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple in Madurai in 2018, we have not got any clear reports. After the new government was formed in the State, the Chief Minister and the Chief Secretary are keen to improve disaster management strategies.” He added that the government would ensure that the disaster management committee meetings took place regularly. “Developed countries usually focus on disaster management and as a developed State in the nation, Tamil Nadu will focus on it,” he further said.

The inspectors had scrutinised the quality and cleanliness of the utensils being used for making food. The vessels being used for preparing food should have been fabricated with non-corrosive and non-toxic material and should be easy to clean and disinfect. The angavadi premises should be clean and have sufficient lighting and adequate ventilation, as per the FSSAI norms. “Since these 25 anganwadis met the stipulated standards of FSSAI, the anganwadis have bagged the Hygiene Rating Certificate,” Mr. Aravind informed during a meeting held on Saturday to review the performance of Department of Food Safety and Drug Control. The Collector said the restaurants, bakeries and snacks, banana and potato chips manufacturing units had been instructed not to use the cooking oil repeatedly. “Since heating the cooking oil multiple times would produce bad cholesterol which would cause serious arterial blocks.

31 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘NDA will press for inclusion of U.T. under Finance Commission’||Home Minister A. Namassivayam on Monday assured the Legislative Assembly that the ruling National Democratic Alliance in Puducherry would strive for inclusion of the Union Territory under the ambit of the Finance Commission to get more funds. Intervening during the discussion on the Budget, the Home Minister said the demand to include the Union Territory under the recommendations of the Finance Commission was decades old. “We are committed to the cause of getting Puducherry included under the Finance Commission recommendations. The government will take up with Centre the issue of including the Union Territory,” the Minister said. He was prompted to intervene when DMK legislator Anibal Kennedy while speaking on the Budget cited that the Chief Minister did not mention anything about the Finance Commission or the demand for legacy loan waiver by the Centre. Mr. Kennedy said the Chief Minister during the Assembly election campaign had spoken about the advantage of having the same alliance government in the Union Territory and the Centre. The DMK legislator said the Budget did not reflect any such advantage. To the comments, Mr. Namassivayam said the government was able to get sanction from the Centre for presenting a Budget with the biggest outlay for the current year. The Union Territory had sought nod for an outlay of Rs. 10,100 crore. The Centre gave sanction for presenting a Budget of Rs. 9,924 crore, he said. “The Budget size is the biggest ever. Last financial year, even the amount spent was only around Rs. 8,000 crore. This year, the Centre had only reduced about Rs. 174 crore and that too the amount reduced was on the loan account side,” the Minister said. Concurring, Minister for Public Works K. Lakshminarayanan said there would not be any difficulty in raising loan during the current financial year. The government would be re-paying around Rs. 1,600 crore as principal and interest for the loans taken. So this would help the government balance the borrowing room ratio with that of Gross State Domestic Product. The government would not have any constraints in making further borrowing this financial year, he added. Camps in constituencies Minister for Civil Supplies A. K. Sai J. Saravana Kumar said the government was willing to hold special camps in all the constituencies for registering new ration cards and correcting discrepancies. He was responding to AINRC legislator K.S.P. Ramesh’s comments during discussion on the Budget that people are finding it difficult to get new ration cards and make corrections in the existing cards. On Independent legislator Angalane’s statement that some employees in Civil Supplies Department were involved in wrongdoings, the Minister said “if there are specific complaints people are free to approach investigating agencies or himself for an inquiry. Without having any credible information, people should not paint the staff in a bad manner. The efficiency of the department is well known,” he added. Participating in the discussion, Independent legislator G. Nehru alias Kuppusamy said the government should take immediate steps to relocate the Bus Stand to avoid traffic congestion. He also wanted the government to take early steps to shift the Big Mark from inside the town. BJP legislator P.M.L Kalyanasundaram urged the government to improve the facilities at Ozuvarasandi at Lawspet. He also sought the government intervention to improve civic facilities in his Kalapet constituency.

The construction of the dam would destroy the farming sector in the Karaikal region. Urging the Centre to issue direction to Karnataka from going ahead with the project, the Chief Minister said he had written a letter to the Prime Minister and the Union Home Minister on July 14 seeking their intervention in the issue. Adequate relief Replying to a point of order on the damage to crops in the recent rains by Opposition leader R. Siva, the Chief Minister said adequate relief would be given by the government. To another point of order by the Opposition leader, the Chief Minister said the government would consider increasing the salary of voucher-paid staff in the Public Works Department from the existing Rs. 3,000. Mr. Siva said the amount given was pittance and much below the minimum wages rules. He said the government should increase the amount to at least Rs. 10,000 per month. Independent legislator from Karaikal P. R. Siva urged the Chief Minister to reconsider the decision to re-open schools from September 1. The government should wait for one more month to re-open schools, he said in his point of order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/resolution-on-mekedatu-passed/article36194544.ece

31 August 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||‘Rlys. indifferent towards Villupuram-Tiruchi main line section’||Rail passengers on Villupuram-Tiruchi main line section, particularly between Mayiladuthurai and Tiruchi, resent the indifferent attitude of Southern Railway towards the section. The sectio lost its prominence gradually after formation of the chord line rail route providing direct link to Tiruchi from Villupuram via. Virudachalam way back in 1930s itself. Improvements on the main line section between Villupuram-Tiruchi remained out of sight for long as the ‘advantages’ in operating services on the chord line had reportedly influenced them to take up such projects in that section first. Now, when the railways is gearing up to revive its services across the country, there is no sign of efforts or initiatives on the part of Southern Railway to commence passenger train services suspended between Mayiladuthurai and Tiruchi through Thanjavur. Instead, the authorities have succeeded in obtaining the permission of the Railway Board to operate daytime passenger service between Karaikal and Tiruchi, which, the train passenger association representatives claimed, is less remunerative section compared to the Mayiladuthurai-Tiruchi section. Further, withdrawal of stoppage at Papanasam station for Mysuru-Mayiladuthurai and Chendur express trains has irked the rail passengers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rap-for-rlys/article36194236.ece

The project to be implemented at a cost of Rs. 50 lakh was delayed due to COVID-19 and would soon be completed, official sources said. Scientific exposure The Science Park in Anna Nagar, Thennur, is the first of its kind in the city and attracts children and adults alike. Set up to provide scientific exposure to children, the park features around 20 pieces of scientific equipment along with life-size statues of animals. In line with the intention to teach children, an eco-pavilion featuring nature conservation methods is being set up. The eco-pavilion will feature models of rainwater harvesting, sewage treatment plants, micro-composting yards and bio-mechanisation, among others. A miniature city will be created with working models of the methods. Electricity will be utilised to power the methods and to illuminate street lights and other details in the project. A glass enclosure will be made for each of the models such that it could be kept at arm's length. A Chennai-based art director has been roped in to make the miniature city and New shrimp species identified in GoM regionwork is under way. Similar displays have also been made in Thanjavur and Salem cities. “The work from designing the boards, making houses, conservation methods and installing them takes about 10 days,” the art director said. The work at Anna Nagar Science Park is nearing completion and will be over within the week, he added. In order to attract children to the eco-pavilion, the features have been set up in an enclosure imitating the rock-cut sculptures in Mahabalipuram. “People will be drawn towards the eco-pavilion through the Mahabalipuram imitation and would learn about the conservation methods when they enter the enclosure,” a senior corporation official told The Hindu . “A room with a projector has also been set up for special screenings,” the official added. The eco-pavilion project has been funded by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board in order to promote anti-pollution methods to conserve natural resources.

31 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Fort Station Road bridge likely to be reopened to traffic in October||While preparation of the Detailed Project Report (DPR) for rebuilding the road overbridge (RoB) on Fort Station Road is on, Tiruchi Corporation has decided to complete repair works on the road by September so as to resume traffic from October. The civic body had originally planned to rebuild the ROB, built in 1876 near Fort Railway Station, utilising funds from the Smart City Mission, in association with Southern Railway. It changed its plan subsequently and decided to seek funds from the State government to execute the project. Later, the Corporation sent a communication to the State Highways to take control of Fort Station Road. When formal communications were on between the civic body and State Highways on the proposal, the eastern arm of the road suffered extensive damage due to rain, leading to suspension of traffic on it. It was expected that the State Highways (Project) would take over the road. Since the transfer proposal dragged on for several months, the Corporation, which was under pressure from road users since closure of the road from August last, began temporary restoration work a few months ago at a cost of about Rs. 1 crore. It simultaneously pursued the proposal on transfer. But the State Highways is learnt to have expressed its reservation on the proposal. The challenges in land acquisition for expanding the approach roads are said to be the main reason for declining the proposal. However, considering the importance of resuming traffic on the road, the Corporation has decided to complete the repair work by September. P.M.N. Mujibur Rahuman, Commissioner, Tiruchi Corporation, told The Hindu that there was need to reopen traffic on the road at the earliest. Strengthening of the affected portion of the road had reached an advanced stage. The work would be over by September 20 and the road would be reopened to traffic from October. Four-wheelers (light) and two-wheelers would only be allowed. Stating that it was a temporary arrangement, Mr. Rahuman said the permanent solution lay with the rebuilding of the RoB. The Detailed Project Report had been undertaken for the project and it would be readied within a few weeks. The project was expected to cost about Rs. 50 crore, including the main bridge, which would be built by Southern Railway. The Corporation would build the approach roads on the two sides. A clear picture would emerge in a month, the civic body chief added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fort-station-road-bridge-likely-to-be-reopened-to-traffic-in-october/article36194245.ece
31 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Free 2GB data scheme in limbo||College principals are waiting with bated breath to know if the State government would continue with the free 2GB data scheme initiated at the start of this year by the previous regime to facilitate online interface between teachers and students during the lockdown. The free data card scheme infused a modicum of vibrancy into the otherwise lacklustre online teaching-learning process. The scheme, which took effect on January 10, benefitted nearly 10 lakh students for a period of four months. Last month, the colleges furnished data pertaining to intermediate and final year UG students and final year PG students to the Directorate of Collegiate Education in compliance with an official directive purportedly for implementing the scheme. However, Electronics Corporation of Tamil Nadu, the implementing authority, has not indicated about the continuity of the scheme, a principal said. There is apprehension among college heads that delay in implementation of the scheme despite the start of the academic year has a bearing on the decision of the higher education department to conduct in-person classes from September, a senior professor said. Going by the Standard Operating Procedure, in-person classes must be conducted only for 50% of the students on a rotational basis on alternate days. The higher education department has not yet clarified whether or not those not attending the class must be engaged in online class. “It is difficult to engage 50% of the students in the classroom and the rest in online mode. Nevertheless, sustaining the free data scheme has become a necessity,” principal of a local government arts and science college said. The scheme lapsed in April. “It is another matter that even the 2GB free data is insufficient for day-long online teaching-learning. Ideally, 3GB free data a day would suit the purpose of online education in higher educational institutions. The government must at least continue with the free provision 2GB data a day in the interests of rural students,” said another principal of a leading government-aided arts and science college.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/free-2gb-data-scheme-in-limbo/article36194241.ece

31 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Govt. to seek ADB funding for Climate Change Adaptation Programme||The State government has planned to approach Asian Development Bank (ADB) for funding the second phase of the Climate Change Adaptation Programme in the Cauvery delta. The project currently under implementation in the delta aims to protect the coastal districts from cyclones, reduce flood risks made worse by climate change, improve distribution of water for irrigation and prevent sea water intrusion in the Vennar Sub Basin. It is being implemented with up to 70% loan assistance from ADB and 30% contribution from the State government. Construction of additional tail-end regulators, re-construction/rehabilitation of all existing tail-end regulators and improvement of drains by widening and desilting them upstream were taken up under the project. In the first phase of the project, various works were taken up in rivers and drains such as Harichandranathi, Adappar, Vellaiyar, Pandavaiyar, Valavanar drain, Vedaranyam canal, Uppanar drain and 13 various pumping schemes in parts of lower Vennar system in Tiruvarur and Nagappattinam districts. The project is under implementation from 2016 at a revised estimate of Rs. 1,110.17 crore. It would benefit an ayacut of 78,000 hectares. Of the seven packages taken up under the project, four covering Pandavaiyar, Valavanar drain, Vedaranyam canal, Uppanar drain and 13 various pumping schemes have been fully completed so far. Works on the remaining three packages covering Harichandranathi, Adappar and Vellaiyar are planned to be completed before March 31, 2022, as the project has been hampered by issues such as limited working season, Gaja, Nivar and Puravi cyclones, besides the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a Policy Note on Water Resources Department tabled in the Assembly recently. As a follow up, the State government has planned to take up phase II covering Vennar, Paminiyar, Koraiyar, Kaduvaiyar, Marakkakoraiyar, Manankondanar and six pumping schemes. The Preliminary Project Report for the works at an estimate of about Rs. 1,825 crore is proposed to be submitted to the Department of Economic Affairs of the Union government seeking further funding from ADB.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-to-seek-adb-funding-for-climate-change-adaptation-programme/article36194247.ece

31 August 2021||Udhagamandalam,TAMIL NADU||Two workers trapped at construction site rescued||Two workers at a construction site in Coonoor town, who got trapped when a portion of the surrounding slope collapsed on them, were rescued on Sunday. The two migrant workers were identified as Rahul (28) and Rashid (29). Local residents said that two earth movers were being used at the site, which they believe had caused the slope to weaken and had led to the incident. The two men were rushed to hospital. A case has also been registered by the police. Local residents and activists questioned the rationale behind allowing heavy equipment to be used in a populated part of the town, who added that there was a lack of transparency on how permissions are granted for the use of excavators. “There should be clarity in how these permissions are granted. The district administration should specify the grounds under which heavy equipment can be used in construction sites,” said S. Manogaran, a Coonoor-based activist and president of the Coonoor Consumer Protection Association. Officials from the district administration said that permission had been granted for the use of the earth mover by the authorities concerned after the owner of the land where the construction was happening had damaged a footpath that leads to the Coonoor General Hospital. Permission for use of the excavators was granted after inspection by Assistant Director of the Department of Geology and Mining. Local residents said that the cave-in had weakened the areas surrounding the construction site, including the hospital premises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-workers-trapped-at-construction-site-rescued/article36194168.ece

31 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||High school attendance improves, II PU sees dip||A week after high schools and PU colleges reopened for offline classes, the attendance across the State for II PU classes stood at 34%, while it was 54% for classes IX and X. While the attendance has improved in high schools compared to the first day, the attendance for II PU classes has dipped. The attendance for PU classes has been recorded for both offline and online classes, while for high schools, the attendance has been recorded for offline classes only. Class IX and X attendance on August 23 stood at 19.56% and 21.08% respectively, while the I PU attendance stood at 36%. Though there has been steady improvement in attendance since August 23 when high schools and PU colleges reopened, experts and teachers find it worrisome that such a large section of students are neither attending offline nor online classes. Test positivity rate Offline classes had resumed after a gap of five months as schools were closed due to the second wave of COVID-19 infections. Schools and PU colleges were allowed to remain open only in districts where the test positivity rate was less than 2%. Primary and Secondary Education Minister B.C. Nagesh said he had sought a report on why II PU attendance had declined over the past week.  According to data provided by the Department of Primary and Secondary Education, 43% of the total 15,568 schools had not yet resumed offline classes. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said majority of the government and budget private schools had reopened and were seeing rise in attendance. “Many of the bigger private schools, majority of which are Central board schools, have not reopened as parents are hesitant to send children to school. In fact, in budget private schools, we have been seeing an improvement over the past one week as parents are feeling more confident,” he said. V. Anbukumar, Commissioner for Public Instruction, said the attendance in offline classes was extremely high in rural schools and they had received tepid response only in schools in urban areas. Madhugiri educational district saw the highest percentage of students attending either online or offline classes with 84% and 89% students attending classes IX and X respectively. Least attendance The least attendance was reported in Bengaluru South and Bengaluru North. Bengaluru North reported attendance of 22% in class IX and 25% in class X. In Bengaluru South, 30% attendance was recorded in class IX and 31% in class X. For I PU, the attendance was highest in Gadag with 62% students attending both offline and online classes, while the least attendance was in Koppal, where only 5% attended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/high-school-attendance-improves-ii-pu-sees-dip/article36194090.ece
31 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Kengeri metro line opens to commuters||“A resident of Malleswaram, I used to travel to Mysuru Road station after changing trains at Majestic. After getting down there, I used to take an auto till college costing me around Rs. 150 to Rs. 200. With the opening of the metro line, my travel cost will substantially come down,” said Anusha, a student of Rajarajeshwari Dental College, as she took the Namma Metro on the newly opened stretch to Kengeri on Monday. A day after inaugurating the Purple Line extension up to Kengeri, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) started commercial operations on the 7.5-km stretch on Monday. At Kengeri station, passengers travelling on the first train were greeted with roses by the staff. Huge relief Opening of the line has come as a big relief for people living along the Mysuru Road stretch, which is among the most traffic choked roads in the city. The BMRCL had taken up metro work in the area in 2016. Ankit Kumar, a student of ACS College of Engineering, said: “I have been waiting for this line to open for more than a year. Once Challaghatta metro station becomes operational, thousands of students studying in colleges located beyond Kengeri stand to benefit.” Rame Gowda, retired government official and resident of RR Nagar, said, “I took a feeder service from RR Nagar bus depot and got down at RR Nagar Arch. It was very convenient. Thousands of residents will benefit from the service.” Prior to opening the extended stretch, BMRCL had estimated that the project will benefit 75,000 people from several layouts and residential complexes located close to the new metro stations. People commuting daily to Global Tech Village, Bengaluru University, R.V. College, and other educational institutions are likely to opt for the metro as their mode of transport in the coming days. Demand for FoB Regular users of suburban trains have demanded a foot-over-bridge (FoB) to link Jnanabharathi metro station with the railway halt station. Work on linking the Traffic and Transit Management Centre of BMTC with Kengeri metro station will be taken up in the coming days. BMRCL is building a FoB at the same location.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kengeri-metro-line-opens-to-commuters/article36194084.ece
31 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC allows felling of 10 trees for underpass work||The High Court of Karnataka on Monday permitted the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to fell the remaining 10 trees for work related to an underpass being constructed on Suranjandas Road as part of a signal-free corridor from Command Hospital to Hope Farm. A Division Bench comprising Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum permitted felling of the trees after noticing that the technical expert committee in its report had come to the conclusion that cutting of the trees is inevitable for completion of the project. The court had earlier stayed further cutting of trees on the claim of the petitioner that there was no need to cut any more trees and the permission granted for felling trees was not proper as the committee had not properly considered the issue. Also, the court had earlier asked the committee to redo the assessment on need of felling these trees. It is true that great loss is caused to the environment by removal of trees, but the court has to keep in mind the requirements of Bengaluru city to ease traffic congestion and to prevent motor vehicle accidents, the Bench observed, while directing the BBMP to complete the underpass works at the earliest and take up compensatory plantation as per provisions of the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976. While disposing of the PIL petition filed by one Swathi Damodaran, the Bench directed the BBMP to submit a compliance report on compensatory plantation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-allows-felling-of-10-trees-for-underpass-work/article36194080.ece
31 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Schools can function in shifts if they do not have adequate classrooms’||With the State government deciding to reopen classes VI to VIII from next Monday, Primary and Secondary Education Minister B.C. Nagesh spoke to The Hindu on the plan ahead and measures to take to improve attendance. There is improvement in attendance in high schools, but not II PU. What will be done to improve attendance? Department officials and teachers have told me that after any long vacation, it takes 15 days for attendance to stabilise as students would have gone to their hometowns. In this case, many parents are observing the measures taken by schools and colleges. We are certain that attendance will improve in the next few days. Will schools face shortage of infrastructure, particularly classrooms, if upper primary classes reopen? Although most schools will have adequate classrooms, we want to be extra careful and ensure there is physical distancing between students. Large schools with adequate classrooms can function easily. Schools which have shortage of classrooms will have to ask classes IX and X to come in the morning and classes VI to VIII in the afternoon. Why did the government decide not to reopen lower primary classes, despite demand from stakeholders? All stakeholders, including parents, students, teachers, and school managements, want primary schools to be reopened as these students have not attended physical classes for more than one-and-a-half years now. But with cases rising in Kerala, we will wait and watch and will decide after Ganesha Chaturthi. Has the government tested students attending offline classes? Samples of 6,472 high school and PU students were tested for COVID-19. While we are yet to obtain the results of all the students, so far, only 14 students tested positive. The Department of Health and Family Welfare did the survey and our department will analyse this data and take appropriate measures this week. Are all high schools and PU colleges following SOPs laid down by the department? Majority of the schools and PU colleges have followed all the details laid down in the SOPs. Only 10% of schools have not and our officers are asking them to comply with all the measures so that the safety of students is not compromised. It has come to our notice that some schools are not maintaining adequate distance in the classrooms as they do not have sufficient seating arrangements.  Majority of the schools and PU colleges have followed all the SOPs laid down by the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/schools-can-function-in-shifts-if-they-do-not-have-adequate-classrooms/article36194092.ece
31 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bengaluru Urban achieves 100% first dose coverage||Bengaluru Urban (excluding Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) has now become the first district in Karnataka to achieve 100% first dose vaccination. However, only about 28.2% of the 10,62,262 population in this district has been fully vaccinated. According to data from the Health and Family Welfare Department, last week, the BBMP crossed a milestone by administering a total of over one crore doses. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said the government’s target was to make Bengaluru the first city in India where the entire population is fully vaccinated. “We have directed the BBMP Commissioner and other officials to work towards achieving this target,” he said. Apart from Bengaluru Urban, Kodagu, Udupi, and BBMP have done the highest coverage in terms of first dose so far. While Kodagu has achieved 75.4%, Udupi and BBMP follow with 72.1% and 71.8% first dose coverage. Kalaburagi and Raichur have the lowest first dose coverage at 45.3% and 47.9%, respectively. Ballari and Yadgir follow with 51.3% and 52.2%, respectively. In terms of complete vaccination (both doses), Bengaluru Urban (28.2%), Kodagu (28.2%), and Ramanagaram (28%) top the list, while Haveri (11.5%), Kalaburagi (12.4%), and Raichur (12.6%) have achieved the lowest coverage. Mr. Sudhakar said special initiatives were being planned to intensify vaccination in Kalaburagi, Raichur, Ballari, and Yadgir. Officials have been directed to intensify vaccination in the border districts too. “People residing in villages that fall within 20 km of the Kerala border will be covered on priority,” Mr. Sudhakar said. “With Bengaluru being the epicentre of COVID-19 in Karnataka during both the first and second waves of infection, vaccinating the entire population in the city is the only way to prevent a third wave,” he said. More healthcare personnel will be deployed to carry out vaccination drives in the vicinity of slums. “We want to ensure that all slum-dwellers are covered at the earliest,” he said. The Minister appealed to people to provide the same mobile number while getting their first and second doses. “As people are providing different phone numbers, the number of first and second doses is not tallying and there is a huge difference. Either give the same number or alert staff of any change in it while taking the second dose,” he said. The vast difference between first and second doses is because of the prescribed 84-day gap between the two doses, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bengaluru-urban-achieves-100-first-dose-coverage/article36194101.ece
31 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘54.74% of textbooks supplied to schools’||The State government on Monday told the High Court of Karnataka that 54.74% of textbooks have been supplied to students of classes I to X till August 25 and remaining supply would be completed in another 20 days. In a status report submitted before a Division Bench comprising Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum, the government stated that printing of 70.82% of required textbooks had been completed as on August 25. The government also said that the time usually given for printing and supply of textbooks is around 140 days but it had been cut to 100 days this year as printing process was delayed due to COVID-19 lockdown. On availability of textbooks for I and II PU courses, the government said that only around 14.61 lakh of the total 47.83 lakh textbooks were required to be printed as a large portion of textbooks had already been printed and distributed for sale in the open market. The Bench was hearing a PIL petition filed by A.A. Sanjeev Narrain and two others last year seeking direction to ensure continuity of education to children through online mode.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/5474-of-textbooks-supplied-to-schools/article36194088.ece

After stabbing Anitha, 23, the accused, Venkatesh 27, with the help of her colleagues, took her to a hospital where doctors declared her dead. According to the police, both the deceased and the accused were employed in an FMCG firm and staying in accomodation provided by the company, along with other employees. Anitha and Venkatesh are from Andhra Pradesh and were working for the FMCG firm since two years. Inquiries revealed that Venkatesh had proposed marriage to Anitha, but she had refused as her parents did not approve of the relationship. Anitha reportedly told him that she had been married to her relative while she was a minor. On August 30, Venkatesh is believed to have tried to persuade Anitha to accept his proposal, but failed to convince her. This led to an argument during which he pulled out a knife and slashed Anitha’s neck. Later, with the help of his colleagues, he took the profusely bleeding Anitha to a hospital where she was declared dead. Kengeri police have taken the accused into custody and recovered the knife.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/woman-stabbed-to-death-by-colleague-in-bengaluru/article36194094.ece

31 August 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||KRS discovers lapses at tahsildar offices||Workers of the Karnataka Rashtra Samiti (KRS), on a Statewide campaign against corruption in government offices, have noticed many lapses at tahsildar offices, including officers demanding money to deliver services, and absence of basic amenities like drinking water and toilets. “Everywhere we heard complaints of corruption from the public. Some people are forced to wait for several months for a simple facility, which could be delivered within a few days,” said Ravi Krishna Reddy, State president of the KRS. The workers conducted the ‘bribe-free Karnataka’ campaign in Arkalgud and Holenarasipur on Monday. So far, they have covered 41 taluk offices in 22 districts. The campaign began on August 8 at Esuru in Shikaripur taluk, the village known for its role in the Quit India movement in 1942. “There are no signboards to inform the public about services available or the procedures they have to follow to get their work done,” said Mr. Reddy. His party workers go around the office and interact with the public. They make a list of things they noticed during their visit and submit a memorandum to the tahsildar based on their observation. “Forget the services, there are no chairs for the aged people to sit. In many offices, there is no drinking water facility. If there is one, it is not working. The toilets are always locked up in most of the offices. Where should the officials or the public go? These are minimum basic amenities expected in a public office,” he said. During the campaign at Arkalgud, two aged women approached the KRS workers stating that they had been waiting to get old-age pension sanctions for many months. Similarly, in Holenarasipur, a farmer said that he had been visiting the taluk office for the survey of his agricultural land for the last four years. The party will continue their campaign for the next 10 days covering the remaining districts. “We have kept the checklists of facilities available and those not available in each office. We will submit a report to the Chief Secretary and appeal to him to bring necessary changes,” said C.N. Deepak, general secretary of the KRS. Interestingly, many farmers, construction workers and shopkeepers contributed money to the KSR praising its campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/krs-discovers-lapses-at-tahsildar-offices/article36194504.ece
31 August 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Official seen accepting bribe during campaign||A government official at the taluk treasury office in Holenarasipur was seen allegedly accepting a bribe from a college principal when Karnataka Rashtra Samiti workers were conducting a bribe-free Karnataka campaign on Monday. The principal was spotted giving currency notes to an official in the office to clear the salary bill. When party workers wanted to know why he was taking the bribe, the official maintained that he did not ask for it, but the college principal gave it voluntarily. Finally, the official gave back the amount. Similarly, the principal also admitted it was his mistake to give a bribe and said he would not repeat it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/official-seen-accepting-bribe-during-campaign/article36194506.ece

31 August 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||‘No so-called secular parties like Muslim leadership to grow’||AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has said that no so-called secular parties, particularly the Congress, like Muslim leadership to grow in the country and they just want to utilise the Muslim electorate for election purposes. Addressing presspersons in Belagavi on Monday, Mr. Owaisi said that there was no prominent Muslim political leader in any of the so-called secular parties because nobody liked it to happen. “They don’t like Muslim political empowerment to happen,” he said. AIMIM is contesting in six wards in the Belagavi City Corporation elections. He said that the political reality of the country is that only those who have independent political leadership can get their work done and for that to happen, Muslim youths should come forward to become leaders. “So, our objective is that Muslim leadership should grow. You should not continue as mere voters. You should become a leader, participate in the electoral process and strengthen the democracy. When every other community has leaders, what is wrong in Muslims becoming leaders?” he asked. Mr. Owaisi said that he has empirical evidence to prove that during COVID-19, Muslims and the backward classes were the most affected. He also said that he did not want the community to continue to live in fear. “How long you can continue to be in fear. We don’t want the leaders to come, sympathise with us and take photographs during deaths and atrocities. What have you (political parties) done to prevent such incidents. So, it is time to develop political leadership,” he said. Regarding Congress questioning AIMIM contesting the elections and accusing it of being communal, he sought to know what was the Congress doing when its coalition partner Shiv Sena’s Chief Minister made a statement regarding being proud over the demolition of Babri Masjid. “Is it not communalism?” he asked. To a query, he said that there will be no coalition with the Janata Dal(S) as the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy cheated AIMIM by partnering with the Congress later. Regarding the ongoing Afghanistan crisis, he said that it was for the Prime Minister to speak on Taliban. The Prime Minister should also speak up on the soaring oil prices in the country, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-so-called-secular-parties-like-muslim-leadership-to-grow/article36194298.ece
31 August 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||‘Farm graduates can be self-reliant by setting up agriculture start-ups’||Despite being the oldest profession, agriculture is still not getting adequate returns and for many, it is yet to become viable, Chairman of Karnataka Vikas Grameena (KVG) Bank P. Gopikrishna has said. He was delivering the keynote address at the Academia-Industry Interface conclave on “Agri Start-ups - Way Ahead” organised by World Bank-funded Project NAHEP-IDP at University of Agricultural Sciences in Dharwad on Monday. “Famines in the 1960s and 1970s led to shortage of foodgrains and milk in India and forced import of foodgrains. Subsequently, impetus was given to farming in the successive Five Year Plans leading to Green Revolution. As much as 50% of the total 218 million hectares available for farming has already been brought under irrigation. But, unfortunately even after 75 years of Independence, farm returns continue to be low,” he said. Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plan towards doubling farm income by reducing input cost and increasing market price, Mr. Gopikrishna said that it is time that graduates of agricultural sciences become self-reliant by setting up agriculture -entrepreneurships. General Manager of NABARD R.M. Kummur sought to know why agricultural universities are yet to produce agriculture start-ups when IITs and IIITs could produce entrepreneurs. “Start-ups in agriculture do not mean just crop cultivation. There are a number of byproducts and related industries which can be established. Over 250 byproducts can be prepared with maize and over 100 byproducts from soya. With both these being major crops in the region, several start-ups can be set up,” he said. Mr. Kummur said that the problem of funds for start-ups could be addressed through CSR funding by incubation centres. Presiding over the programme, Vice-Chancellor of UAS-Dharwad Mahadev Chetti said that although the country had achieved production of 305 million tonnes of foodgrains, it lacked the requisite storage facilities and consequently, tonnes of foodgrains were getting lost every year. Prof. Chetti said that to meet infrastructure needs, the Union government has earmarked Rs. 100 crore for establishing 50,000 agriculture start-ups in the State. And, the State being a pioneer in framing agriculture start-up policy, has drawn up plans to set up at least 5,000 agriculture-related start-ups, he said. Senior officials of UAS-D and scientists were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/farm-graduates-can-be-self-reliant-by-setting-up-agriculture-start-ups/article36194297.ece
31 August 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Govt. urged to resolve issue of unauthorised houses||KPCC Working President Satish Jarkiholi has said that the State government should take a decision to legalise houses built on plots purchased on Rs. 200 bond paper, though it is a complex issue. Speaking to presspersons in Belagavi on Sunday, Mr. Jarkiholi said that the issue of legalising houses built on plots purchased on Rs. 200 bond paper is two decades old. “However, now because of the corporation elections, BJP leaders are raising it again. What were they doing all these days?” he asked. He said that it is a very complex issue and to solve it, the cooperation and approval of various departments are required. “As the BJP is in power in the State, I challenge the State government to resolve the issue and make an announcement legalising these houses,” he said. Taking a dig at the BJP, he said that changing the names of projects implemented by others is a habit of the BJP. “The BJP-led NDA government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has continued the schemes of the UPA government by changing their names,” he said. He said that there is nothing new in the assurances given in the BJP manifesto. All the old schemes have been included. The State government itself announced free funeral for victims of COVID-19, but it is in the manifesto for the corporation elections, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-urged-to-resolve-issue-of-unauthorised-houses/article36194295.ece

31 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Govt. to train 10,000 teachers for implementing NEP 2020||Minister for Higher Education C.N. Ashwath Narayan said here on Monday that the government will train 10,000 college teachers in the next one year for implementing National Education Policy 2020. Addressing a gathering at a programme to launch the implementation of the policy in Mangalore University in the academic year 2021-22, the Minister said that the government has aimed at completing the implementation of the policy in the next 10 years, though the Union government has set a target of 15 years. The Minister said that the effective implementation of the policy is crucial in reaching out the benefits of the policy to students. Dr. Narayan said that the State government is not implementing the policy in a hurry. The Union government deliberated upon the draft of the policy for over five years before finally launching it a year ago. About three lakh suggestions were examined before finalising the policy. A revised education policy has been launched in the country after 34 years. The Minister said that three factors — revising the curriculum, paedology (teaching method) and assessment — are key in implementing the policy effectively. Dr. Narayan said that after the policy is implemented over the years, colleges will come out of the affiliating system. The policy is student-friendly and student-centric. Commissioner, Department of Collegiate Education, P. Pradeep said that the new policy offered much flexibility to students. The department has launched awareness programmes on the policy. Colleges should also open help desks. Vice-Chancellor of the university P.S. Yadapadithaya said that the university wants to launch five post-graduate courses at its advanced science research centre coming up at Belapu in Udupi district from the academic year 2022-23. The university also wants to launch a centre for coastal development studies in Belapu in memory of late V.S. Acharya, a former Minister and legislator. It requires about Rs. 5 crore for the purpose. The Minister also launched a new constituent college of the university at Bannur in Moodbidri on the occasion. Moodbidri MLA Umanath A. Kotian, Kaup MLA Lalaji R Mendon, Vice-Chairman, Karnataka State Higher Education Council, B. Timme Gowda and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-to-train-10000-teachers-for-implementing-nep-2020/article36194477.ece

Angara said on Monday that the staff should work in tandem with elected representatives, ASHAs, anganwadi workers and volunteers to ensure that those in home quarantine strictly complied with quarantine norms. Reviewing the COVID-19 situation in Dakshina Kannada, Mr. Angara said that the COVID-19 test positivity rate is decreasing and this needs to be sustained by increasing the number of tests. All primary and secondary contacts of COVID-19 patients in rural and urban areas should be identified and those found positive should be sent to COVID care centres for treatment. The Minister said that officials should check with COVID-19 patients about Ayushman Bharat Arogya Karnataka health cards and help them get necessary assistance from the government. Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra said that the average test positivity rate of the district was at 2.27% and as many as 77,888 swabs were tested in the period between August 23 and 29. Increasing the tests and strict adherence to COVID-19 appropriate behaviour by people will help in effectively preventing the spread of the virus. Vaccine supplied to government health facilities each day should be used the same day, he added. Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyas Kamath, Mayor Premanand Shetty, District Health and Family Welfare Officer Kishor Kumar, Superintendent of Police Rishikesh Sonawane, City Corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar and Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Hariram Shankar participated in the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/conduct-15000-swab-tests-daily-angara-tells-officials/article36194480.ece

31 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Meeting next month on fee hike for engg. courses||Minister for Higher Education C.N. Ashwath Narayan said here on Monday that the government will hold a meeting in the second week of September to discuss the demand of private engineering college managements to hike fees. Replying to a question at a press conference in Mangalore University, the Minister said that fees of engineering courses have not been revised for the last three years. Private college managements are saying that the government is showing discriminatory attitude by allowing the fees of medical and dental courses to be revised every year. Hence, they also should be allowed to revise fees. Their demand will be discussed next month. To another question, the Minister said that the implementation of National Education Policy 2020 in the State will not undermine languages other than Kannada in higher education. Learning Kannada as a language has been made mandatory for the first two years. In addition, students will be given an option of selecting any other language as an open elective. Hence, other languages too will get their due importance. He said that it is not right on the part of some organisations or parties simply making a blanket statement that NEP has been saffronised. It is not proper to oppose the policy just for the sake of doing so. “There is nothing in the policy which is anti-student. Everything is student-centric and student-friendly,” he said. “Let the critics show any one point which is not in the interest of students,” he said. He said that those who have taken vaccination against COVID-19 can attend offline classes. Those who have not taken it yet can attend online classes till they get vaccinated. All teaching and non-teaching staff should go to colleges and universities only after getting themselves vaccinated. Dr. Narayan said that all universities should take necessary steps to make their campus safe for students by ensuring proper security. They should make use of technology, such as installation of CCTV cameras, to monitor security measures.  ‘Fees of engineering courses have not been revised for the last three years and private college managements are saying that the government is showing discriminatory attitude by allowing the fees of medical and dental courses to be revised every year’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/meeting-next-month-on-fee-hike-for-engg-courses/article36194478.ece

31 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Cong. and JD(S) to slug it out in MCC bypoll||With the collapse of their alliance in the recent mayoral polls still fresh in their memories, the Congress and the JD(S) find themselves in a battle against the BJP in the byelection to Ward 36 of the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) scheduled to be held on September 3. While JD(S) leaders, including S.R. Mahesh, MLA, accompanied by former Mayor Rukmini Made Gowda, sought votes for S. Leelavathi in the ward spread across Yaraganahalli, Congress leaders, including former Minister Tanveer Sait, former Mayor Vasu and former MLA M.K. Somashekar, too sought votes for their candidate Rajani Annaiah. The bypolls were necessitated due to the disqualification of Ms. Rukmini Made Gowda after her Congress rival in the 2018 MCC polls, Ms. Annaiah, filed a petition questioning her assets’ affidavit. The campaign appears to have become a prestige battle between the Congress and the JD(S), whose leaders are still blaming each other for the rift in the Mayoral polls on September 25. The BJP has not won the seat earlier, but the party has decided to field Shobha Ramesh, recognising her husband Ramesh’s contribution to organising the party in the ward for several years now. With former Minister G.T. Deve Gowda’s recent announcement to join the Congress along with his son, Harish Gowda, Ms. Annaiah is not only seeking Mr. Gowda’s blessings but is also carrying Mr. Harish Gowda’s photograph in her publicity material. Congress leaders reasoned that Mr. Harish Gowda and Ms. Annaiah’s husband, Annaiah, were from the cooperative field and hence his photograph figured in the pamphlets. JD(S) leaders resented the announcement of Ms. Annaiah as the Congress candidate for pursuing the petition against Ms. Gowda even after she was elected Mayor with the support of the Congress. Polling is scheduled from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. on September 3 when an estimated 10,883 voters are expected to exercise their franchise. The counting of votes will be taken up on September 6.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cong-and-jds-to-slug-it-out-in-mcc-bypoll/article36194498.ece

31 August 2021||Yadgir,KARNATAKA||Average green gram yield despite insufficient rain||Although rainfall was insufficient, farmers have managed to get an average yield of green gram, considered as a short-term cash crop, in Yadgir district and they have started selling the produce at the Agriculture Produce and Marketing Committee (APMC) Yard here. According to officials of APMC, they have received a total of 59,292 quintals of green gram from August 3 to 25. During the monsoon, green gram was sown in 19,723 hectares against a target of 22,500 hectares, set by the Agriculture Department for 2021. As per details of arrivals, the APMC received 20 quintals of green gram on August 3, followed by 52 quintals on August 4, 30 quintals on August 5, 165 quintals on August 6, 836 quintals on August 9, 2,195 quintals on August 10, 3,753 quintals on August 12, 2,972 quintals on August 13, 6,062 quintals on August 14, 6,423 quintals on August 16, 5,669 quintals on August 17, 3,909 quintals on August 18, 4,126 quintals on August 19, 4,495 August 21, 6,013 quintals on August 23, 6,018 quintals on August 24, and 4,395 quintals on August 25. Farmers who have already harvested green gram are preparing land for the second crop, including jowar and groundnut. Farmers are happy with the market price for green gram. “The price is ranging between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 7,000 based on the quality of produce,” Ajay Reddy, trader at APMC, has said. Meanwhile, the State government ordered setting up procurement centres to purchase green gram with minimum supportive price (MSP) of Rs. 7,275 per quintal. Procurement centres have been opened at Taluk Agricultural Produce Co-operative Marketing society (TAPCMS) in Yadgir, Shahapur, Surpur; Primary Agricultural Credit Society (PACS) in Hattikuni, Allipur, Saidapur, Yelheri, Chepetla, Kodekal and at Naikal Vyavasaya Seva Sahaya Niyamita (VSSN) in Bendebembali. The district administration has directed farmers to register and sell their produce immediately after registration. The last date for selling green gram at the yard is November 24. But, farmers are unhappy with the commencement of procurement centres. “The government delayed starting procurement centres. Small and marginal farmers have already sold their produce in the open market. The Union government could have taken this action much earlier,” State convener of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha Mallikarjun Satyampet told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/average-green-gram-yield-despite-insufficient-rain/article36194304.ece

31 August 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Girl bags global scholarship to study product by father||Her childhood ambition was to follow in her father's footsteps and become a doctor. When she grew up, her goal shifted to medical research. At 26, Rinta Susan Mathew from Ennakkad, near Chengannur, is one step closer to fulfilling her cherished dream, now that she has bagged a Rs. 1.75-crore scholarship from the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom. She is among a small number of students from across the globe selected for the President’s Doctoral Scholar (PDS) Award from the university. For pancreatitis The high point is that she will be doing her PhD in Gastroenterology on the protective effects of a dietary combination developed by her father, Mathew K. Sam, an Ayurveda doctor, for acute pancreatitis. The research, titled ‘The protective effects of sprotone during acute pancreatitis’, will be supervised by Jason Bruce. “I am happy to be selected as one of the 10 PDS scholars,” says Ms. Mathew. According to her, the product formulated by her father has been found to “overcome the nutritional deficiencies seen in diabetic patients.” “I was able to prove its anti-diabetic property during my master's at Loyola College, Chennai, under the guidance of S. Vincent. Further, an animal study and an observational human study were carried out,” says Ms. Mathew. She says her way to Manchester was opened when she sent an email to Dr. Bruce, expressing her interest in pursuing PhD under his guidance. “He seemed interested as my work was on a par with that of the studies at his lab. Numerous processes followed, including several rounds of interviews, before I was selected,” says Ms. Mathew. ‘Patented’ product One of the main reasons, she says, the project got selected is that the product developed by her father is “patented” and has all the scientific data, including cell lines, animal, and human studies. “Dr. Bruce's lab is perhaps the only one in the world studying the link between acute pancreatitis and diabetes, the reason why I have chosen the university,” she says. In a letter sent to her, Tasleem Hanif, PGR recruitment and admissions manager of university, has invited Ms. Mathew to attend exclusive events with the varsity’s president and vice chancellor in September.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/girl-bags-global-scholarship-to-study-product-by-father/article36194445.ece

Krishna Teja has said. Speaking after visiting the exhibition venues in Alappuzha on Monday, Mr. Teja said the department would initiate steps to conduct the Lokame Tharavadu art show on a regular basis. "It is a fabulous and fantastic show. I feel moved while going through each artwork. Lokame Tharavadu is foregrounding the artists of Kerala by featuring the works of 267 artists," Mr. Teja said. Lokame Tharavadu (the world is one family), a contemporary art exhibition, facilitates mental relaxation for the people who live in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, Muralee Thummarukudy, Chief of Disaster Risk Reduction at United Nations Environment Programme said. He was speaking after visiting the exhibition venues in Alappuzha on Sunday. “Opportunities for mental relaxation are essential for the people who live in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lokame Tharavadu gives us such an opportunity. The vast spaces in which the exhibition is held allow people to move freely and enjoy the works directly without COVID-19 worries,” Mr. Thummarukudy said. The show, being organised by the Kochi Biennale Foundation with the support of the State government, exhibits the works of 267 Malayali artists, including 56 women. “Art in various mediums such as paintings, sculptures, installations, videos are exhibited here. Lokame Tharavadu is a model for the world to show how we can create space for artists,” Mr. Thummarukudy said. Curated by Bose Krishnamachari, the core idea of the exhibition, the world is one family, is drawn from the verses of a Malayalam poem written by Vallathol Narayana Menon, which appeals to the universal spirit of humanity. The exhibition invokes the power of art to revive and resurrect the dejected human spirit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lokame-tharavadu-may-be-extended/article36194447.ece
31 August 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||A weighty responsibility on Soman’s shoulders||It’s a trauma Soman of Kanthallur, near Marayur, goes through everyday. For, the farmer has to keep guard of a huge sandalwood tree in front of the house, the worth of which has been estimated around Rs. 1 crore. His trouble started when smugglers stole two other sandalwood trees not as big as the abovesaid one from the plot. As per the rules governing the protection of royal trees, including sandalwood, on LA (land assignment) title deed land, it is the obligation of the title deed holder to protect it. Soman says he had spent many sleepless nights guarding the trees. But when it heavily rained one night, smugglers with soundless machines cut and removed them. When royal trees are stolen from LA title deed land, it is the Revenue Department that takes a police case against the title deed holder as the land is given to him for farming and the property belongs to the department. After Soman approached the Forest Department, the Marayur Sandalwood Division wrote a letter to the revenue authority for extracting the tree. On receiving permission of the revenue authority, the tree can be extracted by the Forest Department. 274-kg root Forest officials collected the remaining portion of the stolen sandalwood trees and shifted it to the sandal division a few days back. The roots alone weighed 274 kg. The sandalwood tree in front of the house of Soman is the largest one on private land in Marayur. Marayur Divisional Forest Officer B. Ranjith says a letter has been sent to the Devikulam Subcollector for permission to extract the tree. It will be removed to the sandalwood division on receiving the necessary orders, he said. “Sandalwood grown on private land are removed to the sandalwood division and put on auction. However, only naturally dead or fallen ones are taken by the forest division and farmers are paid the amount when the wood is auctioned. However, it is the farmers’ responsibility to preserve the tree. If it is lost, the title deed holder will be held accountable,” says a forest official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-weighty-responsibility-on-somans-shoulders/article36194453.ece

31 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||SWTD to take the plunge into tourist boat operation in Kochi||The Kerala State Water Transport Department (SWTD) will take the plunge into the lucrative tourist boat operations off Marine Drive, with an economically priced tour package, buoyed by the response for its recently launched tourist boat service on the Alappuzha-Kumarakom route. Guests from as far as Malappuram and Kozhikode are availing of the tourist service in Vega 2, the new vessel which moves at 25 kmph as compared to 12 kmph of ordinary ferries, a week after it was launched, said Shaji V. Nair, director of SWTD. “The tariff for the day-long return tour is Rs. 400 in non-AC space and Rs. 600 in AC cabin. It is priced half for a single trip. Lunch prepared by Kudumbashree is arranged for Rs. 100, including seafood and tapioca”. From Alappuzha, the vessel proceeds to Punnamada, Muhama, Kayipuram, Pathiramanal, and Kumarakom, linking two prime tourist destinations. Reservation can be made on 94000 50325. Kochi cruise The agency under the Transport Department has floated an e-ender to build a similar 120-seat vessel to be named Vega 3, to ferry tourists through the backwaters off Kochi. “As per our tentative schedule, tours lasting two and a half hours can be arranged from Marine Drive, linking pristine tourism locales such as Mattancherry, Fort Kochi, Willingdon Island, Vypeen, Bolghatty, and Kadamakudy. The tariff will be very competitive since private boat operators abound in Kochi,” Mr. Nair said. Here too, guests will be able to choose between the AC and non-AC cabin options. The SWTD’s Ernakulam Traffic Superintendent M. Sujith said the proposed catamaran (double hull) vessel will be able to cruise up to the sea that abuts Puthuvype, unlike most single-hull private tourist boats which cannot operate beyond Fort Kochi. “Up to four cruises, including a dinner cruise, can be arranged. The per person tariff could be as low as Rs. 200,” he said. The SWTD placed more orders for the Vega series boats, considering the successful operation of Vega 1 ferry that was launched over two years ago on the Vaikom-Ernakulam-Fort Kochi route. It provides connectivity from the city to Fort Kochi in less than 15 minutes, as compared to about an hour in buses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/swtd-to-take-the-plunge-into-tourist-boat-operation-in-kochi/article36194393.ece
31 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Chellanam project to begin soon||Irrigation Minister Roshy Augustine on Monday announced that the department would soon begin work on the Rs. 344-crore project to protect the Chellanam coast. He said the project would be implemented in such a way that the residents of Chellanam would not have to be evacuated or rehabilitated during the next rainy season. The tender procedures for the works will be launched on September 15 and completed by November. The first phase of the coastal protection project will cover 10 km towards the north of the Chellanam fishing harbour. The second phase will see the rest of the coast being taken care of. Ten hotspots along the State where sea erosion was severe would be taken care of in the first phase of the works announced by the government for the State’s coastal areas, said Mr. Augustine. He said the government had laid out a plan to spend Rs. 5,300 crore over the next five years to protect the Kerala coast. Industries Minister P. Rajeeve, who presided over the brief function to announce the project, said it was imperative that a permanent solution was found to the hardships suffered by Chellanam residents. He said beach nourishment efforts and establishment of sea protection structures would help turn the coastal village into a tourism destination. From among the 10 hotspots along the Kerala coast, Chellanam was given priority considering the seriousness of the problem there, he added. KIIFB funds The Irrigation Department, with funds received through Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), will set up tetrapods as part of shore protection measures, being taken up in consultation with the National Centre for Coastal Research, Chennai. Renovation of sea walls, which will be 5.5 metres high, will be taken up in the first phase of the project. Geotextile bags with sand, granite boulders, and tetrapods will be used for coastal protection. The works will also include creation of a beach using 2.35 million cubic metres of sand between the breakwaters in Kannamaly. The first phase of the project is expected to bring relief to residents in the most severely affected areas such as Companippadi, Vachakkal, and Chalakkadavu. Comprehensive plan Meanwhile, Charles Biju, president of Chellanam Twenty20, a group not affiliated to any political party, said the project took care of only a portion of the coastal stretch. The group has submitted a memorandum to the government appealing for comprehensive action to address the issue of sea erosion. Chellanam-Kochi Janakiya Vedhi, a group calling for action to protect the coast, has welcomed the announcement of the project but called for a comprehensive action plan to protect the entire coast from Chellanam to Fort Kochi. A statement from the group said Saudi and Manassery, near Fort Kochi, too faced serious sea erosion threat and taking care of those parts too should be part of the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/work-on-rs-344-crore-chellanam-shore-protection-project-to-begin-soon/article36194400.ece
31 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||NAAC score of 2.5 must to offer BVoc courses||The State government has stated that BVoc courses will not be permitted in colleges that do not have a score of 2.5 in the evaluation by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). The Department of Higher Education pointed out that relaxation of the parameters fixed for starting/continuing BVoc courses would affect the quality of higher education. Improving standards It will fail the intention of the government to improve the standards of higher education, said an order issued on Friday. The position related to the no objection certificate for BVoc courses was revealed after an aided college in Kottayam affiliated to the Mahatma Gandhi University approached the Kerala High Court requesting an exemption from the NAAC accreditation criteria for the current year in view of the ongoing pandemic situation. The government order said that the decision not to permit BVoc courses was aimed at motivating the higher educational institutions to enhance their academic standards. The order said that the government had sanctioned UGC-assisted BVoc courses in 12 colleges under Mahatma Gandhi University in August, 2019 on a condition that the colleges may ensure that a NAAC score of 2.5 is attained for the continuation of the course by 2020. It was also stated that the colleges that had received approval in the past may ensure that the score is achieved or renewed for the continuation of the course by 2020. Self-financing mode A report by the Kerala State Higher Education Council had observed that there was a tendency among colleges to run BVoc courses on self-financing mode after the initial enthusiasm created in view of the funding by the University Grants Commission (UGC) ended. The council had also recommended steps to improve the teaching-learning process for BVoc courses based on its inference that there was a need to step up the overall quality of such programmes. The government has made it clear that it will continue to provide no objection certificate for BVoc courses offered by the affiliated colleges under the self-financing mode.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/naac-score-of-25-must-to-offer-bvoc-courses-colleges-told/article36194397.ece
31 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||ICHR trying to create falsified memories: KHC||The Kerala History Congress (KHC) has blamed the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) for trying to create falsified memories in the minds of the people by removing the martyrs of the Malabar Rebellion from the Dictionary of Martyrs of India’s freedom struggle. Expressing concern and protest over the decision by the ICHR, representatives of the KHC allege that the move is a continuation of the efforts by right-wing forces to distort facts and promote their vested divisive interests. Wider context “The Malabar Rebellion of 1921 has to be placed in the wider context of international and national politics that influenced outbreaks in different regions in India. The alliance between the Khilafat movement and the Indian National Congress, coupled with the rise of communist ideas, was a disturbing development for the British that made them promote Hindu communal politics,” says V. Karthikeyan Nair, vice president, Kerala History Congress. “The undertones of such a political strategy of divide and rule were seen in the British characterisation of the 1921 Rebellion as anti-Hindu. The ICHR, through proposing the deletion of 387 names of people associated with the Malabar Rebellion, is following in the footsteps of this colonial strategy to duplicate communal politics. This is detrimental to the interests of secular historiography,” he adds. Sebastian Joseph, general secretary, Kerala History Congress, says the report of the ICHR committee is highly prejudiced and tantamount to creating falsified memories in the minds of people. “The present move aims at textualisation of critical historical findings, which all started with the demonumentalisation of history. Meddling with collective memories of the people, the move targets creation of collective memories based in communal lines. This will seriously affect secular, scientific history writing in the nation,” he says. The Kerala History Congress states that the mapping of the country’s Independence struggle would remain incomplete if the name of Malabar Rebellion leader Variamkunnath Kunhamed Haji is removed from the list of freedom fighters. Not communal The Malabar Rebellion cannot be seen as a communal riot, and the removal of the names cannot be justified, historian and former Vice Chancellor of the University of Calicut K.K.N. Kurup says. The ICHR, which omitted Jawaharlal Nehru and leaders of the Malabar Rebellion from the poster for the 75th Independence Day celebrations, stands for narrow political interests. No government has the right to rewrite history. He was speaking at a seminar on the rebellion organised by the Coordination Committee of Muslim Organisations, Thiruvananthapuram, on Monday.

31 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Left adrift and homeless by a raging sea||Azheekkal Mathews Joseph is in tears as he talks of his house, located hardly 150 metres from the seawall along the Bazaar coast in Chellnam panchayat, that cannot be rebuilt. A massive coconut tree that fell over the roof in strong winds and high waves about three months ago has forced him to seek shelter in a rented home in Kumbalanghi. The house is now unliveable, filled with sand and debris brought in by the waves. The walls of the house have irreparable cracks and the door and window frames are shaky. Mr. Joseph used about two metres of discarded electrical cable to prevent one of the door frames from collapsing. He says he wants to come back to the house where his memories are, but the fear of the sea keeps him away. He recalls how the house by the sea, with its 13 members, was a lively one. The family members are now dispersed, looking for both work and safety. Mr. Joseph is part of the growing number of environmental refugees from Chellanam panchayat, rendered homeless by a merciless sea. But, the sea is also what provides them sustenance in fishing and related activities. There are dozens of such families in the coastal village — living from day to day, fearing the waves, and praying for the elements to relent. P.J. George, a 58-year-old carpenter who lived along the Chellanam coast, talks of how calm the sea used to be. The memories are vague, he says, because the present troubles are disturbing. He has taken refuge in a rented house in Karimancherry with his family, where he struggles to meet daily expenses. The coastal segment in Bazaar, Velankanni, and Chalakkadavu in Chellanam is a picture of desolation. The sea is a perpetual threat. With most of the affected persons depending on fishing, the families are unable to shift to safer areas. People’s lives and property are in constant danger. But, life goes on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/left-adrift-and-homeless-by-a-raging-sea/article36194402.ece
31 August 2021||Kochi,KERALA||HC sets aside recovery of compensation from salary of police officer||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court has set aside a District Police Chief’s order directing the recovery of Rs. 30,000 from the salary of a police officer as ordered by the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) for not keeping a seized lorry in good condition. The Bench led by Chief Justice S. Manikumar passed the verdict in view of the exoneration of the police officer by the Inspector General of Police, South Zone, on the basis of an inquiry. SHRC directive The verdict came on a writ petition filed by Joby Thomas, former sub-inspector of the Kolathoor police station in Malappuram district. The owner of the seized tipper lorry alleged that despite the RDO ordering return of the vehicle, the police officer refused to release the vehicle. However, when the vehicle was released finally, its tyres, tubes, tools, among other things, were found missing. The owner approached the SHRC which directed that departmental action be taken against the officers who failed to keep the vehicle in safe custody and that Rs. 30,000 be recovered from the officer concerned. However, in the disciplinary proceedings initiated by the IGP of the South Zone, it was found that the allegation was not proved against the police officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-sets-aside-recovery-of-compensation-from-salary/article36194361.ece
31 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||The Periyar changes colour, yet again||The discolouration of the Periyar continues unabated. Two weeks after a long stretch of oil patch triggered fears among local residents, the river turned red near the regulator-cum-bridge at Pathalam on Monday. Officials of the Environment Surveillance Centre in Eloor collected samples from the spot, and the results are expected by Wednesday. The officials suspect that the change in colour could have occurred after the Irrigation Department opened the shutters of the bund. Repeated pleas “Despite repeated pleas, the department has not alerted us before opening the shutters. This could help in collecting samples without delay,” they said. The local residents, who alerted the Pollution Control Board (PCB) officials about the discolouration, said the pollution of the river had worsened as the lack of effective surveillance seemed to have given the industries a free run to dump effluents into the river. “This was the second incident after the oil spill on August 14,” they said. The local residents and environmentalists were instrumental in identifying an illegal discharge from a rubber processing unit in Edayar in connection with the incident. Illegal pipeline The unit reportedly made an unauthorised discharge through an illegal pipeline into the land close to the river, resulting in the flow of effluents into the river. The treatment facility in the rubber processing unit was not functioning as per the norms. Huge quantity of water was required for processing. The water used should be treated as per the norms prescribed by the board for subsequent reuse. The unit had discharged untreated water into the nearby land close to the river. PCB asked to explain The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on solid waste management has asked the State Pollution Control Board (PCB) to explain the increasing incidents of pollution in the Periyar river. Committee chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai took notice of the discolouration of the river near the regulator-cum-bridge at Pathalam on Monday. “The board has been told to submit a report on the incident and to find the source of pollution,” said Mr. Pillai. “Surveillance has to be stepped up along the river stretch in the region to avoid such incidents,” he added. On the staff shortage being experienced by the board at its Environmental Surveillance Centre, the chairman pointed out that he had brought the issue to the notice of the board authorities. Mr. Pillai said that the incidents of illegal discharge into the river had reduced after he had submitted a detailed report to the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in the case related to the pollution of the river. “It is unfortunate that such incidents are being repeated,” he said. Key suggestions The authorities are yet to implement the key suggestions made by the SLMC in the report that primarily include formation of an independent committee having powers to inspect any establishment on the banks of the river.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/the-periyar-changes-colour-yet-again/article36194410.ece
31 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Five more catamaran ferries by early 2022||The State Water Transport Department (SWTD) would introduce five more catamaran-type vessels by early 2022, as part of its endeavour to replace the existing fleet of single-hull steel ferries that operate from the Ernakulam boat jetty, said agency Director Shaji V. Nair. Two catamaran ferries, each capable of seating 100 passengers, were launched earlier this year. “Five more will follow suit, as part of the endeavour to ensure safe commuting, in the wake of the Fort Kochi boat accident that claimed the lives of 11 people in 2015,” he said. As per schedule, a catamaran ferry is expected to roll out from the yard at Aroor, where they are being built, every 50 days. The third such vessel, the electrical and plumbing works of which are underway, is getting ready for launch. Built as per Indian Register of Shipping (IRS) standards, each such ferry could carry upto 200 people, added Mr. Nair. Meanwhile, the West Kochi Passengers’ Association has expressed dismay at the SWTD ferries not calling at the Mattancherry boat jetty. “It is over five years since they stopped services to Mattancherry. Thus, commuters, including tourists and those who visit Baazar Road, have to walk all the way from Customs Jetty located in Fort Kochi. The inadequate number of bus services has worsened the situation,” said M.M. Ayoob, a member of the association.

All were residents of Purapuzha in Idukki district. “The youngsters belonged to two families at Purapuzha. They were on their way back from Bengaluru when their car rammed the lorry going in the opposite direction. The driver of the car probably dozed off. It is not clear who drove the car,” said the Muvattupuzha police. Though such road accidents usually attract IPC Section 304A (causing death by negligence), the police have registered it as a motor occurrence since the lorry driver was not found to be at fault.

Committee chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai took notice of the discolouration of the river near the regulator-cum-bridge at Pathalam on Monday. “The board has been told to submit a report on the incident and to find the source of pollution,” said Mr. Pillai. “Surveillance has to be stepped up along the river stretch in the region to avoid such incidents,” he added. On the staff shortage being experienced by the board at its Environmental Surveillance Centre, the chairman pointed out that he had brought the issue to the notice of the board authorities. Mr. Pillai said incidents of illegal discharge into the river had reduced after he had submitted a detailed report to the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in the case related to the pollution of the river. “It is unfortunate that such incidents are being repeated,” he said. Independent panel  The authorities are yet to implement the key suggestions made by the SLMC in the report that include formation of an independent committee having powers to inspect any establishment on the banks of the river.

One of the owners has already been arrested and a few documents have been seized. Different schemes In the preliminary investigation, it was found that the partners of the jewellery shop secured investments worth Rs. 60 crore from individuals. There were both cash investment and gold deposit schemes promising good returns every month or during the purchase of new gold ornaments. ‘Quick returns’ According to police officials from Kuttiyadi and Nadapuram stations, there were both low-income groups and affluent persons who enrolled under the schemes for quick returns. There were reportedly investors who deposited more than one kg of gold with the jewellery firm which had opened branches in different parts of the rural area. The investors approached the police after the main jewellery shop and its two branches were found closed for unknown reasons. When one of the branches at Kallachi was opened last week, there were many investors who reached there to claim their money and gold ornaments. However, the partners fled the spot, leaving staff members at the office. ‘Gold safe’ Cases have been registered at Kuttiyadi, Payyoli and Nadapuram police stations. The jewellery shops have been functioning for over four years along with receiving funds under various investment schemes.

The Jamat district committee said that it was deplorable to see those who supported the British and stayed away from the freedom struggle trying earnestly to erase the freedom fighters from the historical records. “The government move is an insult to those who laid down their lives for the country.” The Jamat said that the wagon tragedy of November 19, 1921, was a misinterpretation of a massacre that took place during the freedom struggle. “It was not a tragedy. It was a massacre of unconscionable nature committed by the British,” it said. The Jamat said that the Sangh Parivar move under the guise of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) would shake the foundation of the country’s glorious heritage. “The attempts to erase the Malabar Rebellion martyrs, including the victims of the wagon massacre, should not be viewed in isolation,” it said.

His resignation followed the appointments of new DCC presidents. Mr. Gopinathan, who was formerly MLA of Alathur and president of the Peringottukurissi grama panchayat, said he was fed up with the Congress for which he had dedicated his whole life. He said he resigned from the primary membership of the Congress and that he was no longer part of the party. He said the recent developments within the Congress had distressed him greatly. Although Mr. Gopinathan said he did not intend to join any other party, he was all praise for Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. He said it would take some time for him to cleanse his heart of the Congress. Mr. Gopinathan had raised a banner of revolt ahead of the Assembly elections in the State. The party leadership had placated him then by offering the DCC presidentship. However, he was disappointed when the Congress announced the list of its district chiefs two days ago. A.

31 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Hybrid immunity offers best cover: study||A combination of natural immunity to COVID-19 (from a previous infection) and vaccine-induced immunity or hybrid immunity offers the best protection against COVID-19, a cohort study done in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRD) in Kochi has reported. In fact, persons who were previously infected with COVID-19 and had a single dose of vaccine afterwards had 30 times higher antibody levels in their blood than those who had received two doses of vaccine but had not had a natural infection, says Padmanabha Shenoy, Kochi-based clinical immunologist and rheumatologist. Dr. Shenoy and his team has been following up a cohort of 1,500 patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases who have had COVID 19 or were vaccinated to assess their immune response.   Anti-body levels He derived his conclusions on hybrid immunity after studying the anti-spike antibody levels and neutralising antibody titres in the blood samples of 120 patients from this cohort. The pre-print, “Hybrid immunity versus vaccine-induced immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in Patients with Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases”, appears in Social Science Research Network, a repository for pre-prints. Single-dose COVID-19 vaccine in healthy individuals with past COVID-19 infection seems to provide better immunity than double doses in individuals not exposed to COVID-19. The study aimed to see if the same is true for patients with AIRD who are on immunosuppressants. Four groups of 30 patients each, similar in age, sex and disease, were studied. One group had taken a single dose of Covishield vaccine after being infected previously; the second group had past infection with COVID-19 but no vaccine; the third group had no previous infection but one dose of vaccine; and the fourth group had no previous infection but two vaccine doses. In the viral neutralisation assay, those with hybrid immunity (immunity from previous infection plus one vaccine dose) could neutralise the virus better than those who received two doses of vaccine or had prior infection. Implications Hybrid immunity was superior to the immunity developed following natural infection. It was also found that even a single dose of vaccine produces a high level of immunity for a previously COVID-infected person. “This study has implications for national vaccination policies. As a single dose of vaccine produces a high level of immunity in previously COVID-infected patients, two doses may not be necessary. This may save close to 3 crore vaccine doses,” Dr. Shenoy said. This high level of hybrid immunity (hybrid of natural infection with one dose of vaccine) is anticipated to last in the person’s body for a longer time, providing long lasting immunity, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hybrid-immunity-offers-best-protection-finds-study/article36194384.ece

Sporting several unique features, the new station caters to the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). It would be commissioned once the DGCA issues the approval, airport authorities said. “Our existing station was equipped to tackle emergencies, but there was an urgent need to expand the infrastructure.

In due course, the existing station would be withdrawn from service and demolished. Compatible with ARRF Category IX/X, the fire station has a total area of 1838 sq metres and cost the Airports Authority of India (AAI) Rs. 12.5 crore. A striking feature of the station is the watch tower that can be used as an alternate air traffic control (ATC). The tower has a height of 14.5 metres. The station also has an underground sump capable of storing one lakh litres and an overhead tank for 50,000 litres. The station has 12 parking slots for the fire tenders and rescue vehicles, six bays each on either side of a central building complex. The emergency response mechanisms include a public address system and fire alarm bell, and a hotline with the Air Traffic Control and the Fire and Rescue Station at Chacka, the nearest facility outside the airport.

The edited clip contained messages having political, social and religious undertones. Pointing out that the police have commenced an investigation into the offence, Dr. Khosa warned action will be adopted against those found to create and circulate the video.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/1700-more-fresh-cases/article36194584.ece

The groundwork for the road that would reduce the travel time from the city to Nedumangad considerably, was progressing fast, said Minister for Food and Civil Supplies G.R. Anil, who is also the local MLA, in a press release on Monday. Positive response He said the public hearing held online, as part of the social impact study, elicited generally positive response to the project, with a demand for timely completion of the project that could give a fillip to the tourism and commercial sector in Nedumangad and surrounding regions. Land acquisition Once the report, which was delayed due to COVID-19, was submitted this week, the land acquisition proceedings would begin, he said. A land acquisition tahsildar, specially appointed for the purpose, would over see this. The project is being implemented with funds sanctioned from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). Funds A total of Rs. 338.53 crore has been sanctioned for the project, with Rs. 279.31 crore for the road construction work and Rs. 59.22 crore for land acquisition. The Kerala Road Fund Board Project Management Unit will be the implementing agency of the project. Mr.Anil said that the project was a dream come true for the people in the region, but there had been attempts from some quarters to scuttle it. The public would see through such moves, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/study-on-vazhayila-pazhakutti-roadwork-to-be-submitted/article36194587.ece
31 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Assembly complex to go solar||The Assembly complex may soon have lighter power bills with the installation of solar panels under the Thiruvananthapuram city Corporation’s Smart City project. A 395-Kilowatt solar power plant will serve the main block, housing the Assembly hall, as well as the administrative block. Speaker M.B. Rajesh will inaugurate the solar power plant on Tuesday, in the presence of Corporation Mayor Arya Rajendran and others. As part of the project, solar panels are being installed at five government buildings in the city, at a cost of Rs. 3.2 crore. The installation of panels have also been completed at the Government College for Women at Thycaud, the Public Library at Palayam, and the Government Central High School at Attakulangara. The Kerala University Library in Palayam is also in the list, but the work will begin only after approval from the University Senate. According to project officials, the work can be completed within a week once it is approved. Total cost The total cost for the project across the five locations, including the Legislative Assembly, is Rs. 3.2 crore, with a total power generation capacity of 607 Kilowatt. Smart City officials say the savings in power costs annually from across the five buildings will come to around Rs. 50 lakh, with a considerable reduction in carbon footprint too. “We have installed a grid-tied solar power generation system here. So, the demand will be first met from the power generated from the solar panels. Only when it cannot meet the demand will power be drawn from the Kerala State Electricity Board connection. In the Assembly, the solar power system will be sufficient in normal times, but when the Assembly sessions are convened, the complex runs in full load capacity and hence only a percentage will be met from solar, and the rest from the conventional KSEB line,” say project officials. Before installation at the various locations, the team has looked at various criteria including the structural stability of the building and the possibility of trees in the vicinity blocking out the sunlight.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/assembly-complex-gets-solar-power-plant/article36194458.ece

Minister for Water Resources Roshy Augustine will inaugurate the project, named ‘Snehatheertham’, on Wednesday by providing water connection to the residence of a youngster with cerebral palsy at Vettucaud in Thiruvananthapuram. At present, the family has to travel a large distance to collect drinking water, according to the department. Another family in Vanchiyoor, which too shares a similar plight, also will be provided connection under the scheme immediately. Snehatheertham was funded by the Engineers’ Federation of Kerala Water Authority and the Rotary International, the department said. According to the Water Resources Minister's office, a preliminary survey has revealed that there are around 1,000 families across the State that could benefit from this initiative. At present, an applicant has to shell out between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 10,000 for obtaining a water connection. The project will provide some relief to the families that are already spending huge sums on the medical treatment of the children, Mr. Augustine says. The department is also considering waiving the water charges for the beneficiary families. Further, the department is also considering a water bill waiver for financially backward families with differently abled children who already have water connections, the Water Resources Minister adds. Connections in 6 months In implementing Snehatheertham, the beneficiaries in other districts will be identified and provided connections in six months, V.S. Krishnakumar, working president, Engineers’ Federation of Kerala Water Authority, says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/families-with-differently-abled-children-to-get-free-water/article36194368.ece

He said the expulsion was a pre-emptive move. Meanwhile, top group leaders engaged the KPCC leadership in a publicised tussle over DCC reorganisation for the second consecutive day. ‘A’ group leader Oommen Chandy blamed Mr. Sudhakaran for disclosing the contemporaneous notes the latter had taken during their closed-door discussions about party reorganisation. ‘I’ group leader Joseph Vazhakkan blamed the KPCC leadership for keeping senior leaders out of decision-making. The Congress also witnessed an assumed realignment of loyalties. Media outlets claimed Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan, K. Muraleedharan, P.T. Thomas, T. Siddique, and Sooranadu Rajasekharan had shed their respective group identities and aligned themselves with the KPCC leadership. With more organisational posts up for grabs at the district and State levels, the traditional ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups were fighting the KPCC leadership to insert their loyalties in key positions. The factions seemed aligned against “the emergent axis of power” ostensibly led by Mr. Venugopal, Mr. Sudhakaran and Leader of the Opposition V.D.

The units will be able to process tomatoes, sweet lime, and groundnut, the three major crops of the district. At a meeting here on Monday with Anantapur MP Talari Rangaiah, General Manager Industries Y.

31 August 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Classes VI to VIII to reopen from September 6 with 50% attendance||The State government on Monday decided to reopen classes for VI to VIII standards from September 6 in taluks that have a test positivity rate of below 2%. This comes close on the heels of reopening classes for IX to II PU on August 23. Classes will be held for students on alternate days with all COVID-19 norms in place and attendance should not cross 50%. Classes would be held five days a week while the remaining two days would have to be utilised by the school authorities to sanitise the classrooms and premises. A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of the Technical Advisory Committee on COVID-19 that was chaired by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai here. Announcing the decisions of the committee, Revenue Minister R. Ashok told presspersons that there was good response from students to the earlier decision to reopen IX to II PU in government institutions. However, attendance of students needed to improve in private schools, he added. Stating that the situation with respect to the pandemic was under control, he said there was zero test positivity rate in 2,912 gram panchayats. Of the 6,472 samples collected from among IX to II PU students, only 14 children had tested positive, he said, seeking to allay fears on safety of children attending schools. Interestingly, TAC in an earlier recommendation had suggested that the government should consider reopening schools for classes VI to VIII from September 13 onwards. This could be done after studying the impact of the current reopening of classes (for Class IX onwards), TAC had suggested. Meanwhile, the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association’s (PHANA’s) COVID-19 expert group that submitted its report on third wave preparation to the government on Monday said that evidence was clear that it would be “premature to open schools at this stage”. Recommending that school monitoring should be taken up for identification of new clusters, the report said, last summer, Israel opened schools but had to close them within a week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/classes-vi-to-viii-to-reopen-from-september-6-with-50-attendance/article36193888.ece

Rajasekhara Reddy’s wife Vijayamma with associates of her late husband in politics and bureaucrats who worked closely with him on September 2 has become a hot topic in politics. Ms. Vijayamma personally called up all the invitees, expected to be more than a hundred, for the meeting at Novotel - HICC to mark the twelfth death anniversary of Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. She reportedly conveyed to them that the meeting had nothing to do with politics as it was supposed to be a get together of her husband’s colleagues in party and government on a solemn occasion. But sources said the timing of the event gave rise to speculation that it could not have been without some political significance. For, the YSR Telangana Party was launched by her daughter Sharmila on July 8 which was the birth anniversary of Rajasekhara Reddy, and now, the death anniversary was also to be observed with different political colour. Sources added that many of the politicians who were in the government led by Reddy are now in TRS. So, it is possible that they might not turn up. The invitation was extended by Ms. Vijayamma personally over phone to all leaders, mainly in TRS and Congress. A close friend of Reddy, K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao, Minister P. Sabita Indra Reddy and TRS leaders like V. Sunita Laxma Reddy, K.R. Suresh Reddy and D. Srinivas, Congress Legislature Party leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, former Ministers T. Jeevan Reddy and Komatireddy Venkat Reddy and even a few leaders in film industry were among those invited. The meeting, it was said, might have been got up to strengthen YSR Telangana Party as it is still fledgling. The party had mainly focussed on unemployment in the State with Ms. Sharmila herself participating in protests at some villages. The party had also threatened to back nominations by hundreds of unemployed contestants in Huzurabad Assembly byelection. Ms. Sharmila claimed herself to be the true heir of YSR’s legacy though the Congress even now observes his birth and death anniversaries as he was in the party till the end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vijayamma-extends-dinner-invite-to-ysr-associates-on-sept-2/article36194348.ece

Most of the victims were swept away in flash floods due to heavy rain in Vikarabad, Yadadri Bhuvanagiri and Hanumakonda districts. Tragedy stuck two families in Vikarabad as a bride and the groom’s sister got washed away in a canal at Marpally mandal on Sunday night. They were travelling in a car. While the bodies of the bride, Pravalika, and her sister-in-law, Swetha Reddy, were recovered, the body of an eight-year-old boy, who was also in the car, was yet to be found. The family members alleged that the driver of the car, Raghavender Reddy, was inebriated. Pravalika and Nawaz Reddy got married on August 24. After completing the post-marriage celebrations at Pravalika’s home in Mominpet, the couple was returning to Nawaz’s home in Ravepally. As water was overflowing on to the road in Marpally, several vehicles had stopped at a distance. Vikarabad Deputy Superintendent of Police A. Sanjeev Rao said Raghavender ignored the family members’ plea to stop the car and not to go ahead.

31 August 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Haj committee in Kerala has no woman this time||It is once again an all-male affair at the Kerala State Haj Committee as no woman has found a place on the recently reconstituted committee. The government order appointing a 16-member committee was issued on August 11. Though women constitute more than half the number of Haj pilgrims from the State, it was only in 2018 that a woman was first nominated as a member of the committee. Indian National League leader and Kanhangad municipality vice chairperson L. Sulaikha had made it to the 2018-2021 committee. She was followed by S. Sajitha, a councillor of the Valanchery municipality, who had a seven-month stint as a panel member. The two women made it to the committee under the quota for civic representatives. ‘Reasons unknown’ “The Kerala government took the initiative of nominating a woman to the panel as it wanted women to move up in society even without the benefits of women’s quota,” said K.T. Jaleel, who handled the portfolio of Wakf and Haj Pilgrimage in the previous Left Democratic Front government. It was a major step towards women’s representation, he said, adding that the reasons for the non-inclusion of women on the present committee remained unknown. ‘More comfortable’ The women pilgrims, said Ms. Sulaikha, feel more at home interacting with women officials. They bank on women officials for their various needs as male committee members are largely disconnected with the facilities arranged for women, she said. “My tenure on the panel was smooth as all the panel members fully cooperated with me. They also encouraged me to get involved in all the activities of the panel,” said Ms. Sulaikha, who is district treasurer of the party. Responding to the developments, V. Abdurahiman, Minister for Wakf and Haj Pilgrimage, said he was unaware of the non-inclusion of women on the committee.

31 August 2021||KODURU (KRISHNA DT.),ANDHRA PRADESH||Police officers pay last respects to woman SI||Police personnel of East Godavari and Krishna districts paid their last respects to sub-inspector K. Bhavani (25), who died under suspicious circumstances, at her native village in Salempalem village in the district on Monday. Bhavani, attached to Sakhinetipalli police station in East Godavari district, allegedly committed suicide at Vizianagaram Police Training College on Sunday, while undergoing in-service training. East Godavari Superintendent of Police M. Ravindranath Babu said the SI worked well in Razole and Sakhinetipalli stations and the incident was very unfortunate. The department would look after the welfare of the bereaved family, he said. Krishna Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal said Bhavani came to the position with hard work and expressed condolences to her family members. Other police officers visited Salempalem village and consoled her family members. A pall of gloom descended on the village when the SI’s body was brought there from Vizianagaram on Monday. “Bhavani’s mother, Nageswaramma, brought up her children by doing agriculture work. The SI used to encourage the youth to study and rise to good positions,” said Ramakrishna, a resident. “The SI’s mother and grandparents depended on Bhavani. She was active in service activities for the last two years, and helped the villagers in providing treatment in hospitals and extending financial support to poor students,” said a woman Lakshmi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-officers-pay-last-respects-to-woman-si/article36194611.ece
31 August 2021||KOZHIKODE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Flight ticket rates soar as UAE resumes tourist visa||As the United Arab Emirates (UAE) resumed tourist visas for fully vaccinated travellers from Monday, the flight rates between Kerala and various Emirates cities have soared higher even as travel agents are waiting for the final standard operating procedures from civil aviation authorities. The one-way from Thiruvananthapuram to Dubai costs about Rs. 37,000 on September 5 in Etihad Airways. A direct flight from Kochi to Dubai in Emirates airline costs Rs. 29,000 and upward. The opening of the tourist visa is expected to benefit thousands of Indians, especially Keralities planning to visit their families in the UAE apart from raising job opportunities ahead of the rescheduled World Expo hosted by Dubai from October 1 to March 31, 2022. The tourist visa is granted for either 30 days or 90 days. Indian citizens with valid visa of the U.S. or U.K. are also eligible for visa on arrival. The UAE, which has been gradually easing rules on travel, has also made stipulations such as offering tourist visas only to World Health Organization-approved COVID-19 vaccines. As of now, only Covishield (Oxford/AstraZeneca formulation) administered in India has been approved by the WHO. Through a tweet, the National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority has said that “starting from 30th August, application for tourist visas will be open to people from all countries, provided they are fully vaccinated with one of the WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccines.” The Emirates News Agency said the decision also comes as part of the country's strategy to create a balance between public health and the activities of vital sectors, and in support of the national efforts to achieve sustainable recovery and economic growth. The decision also applies to citizens of all countries, including those arriving from previously banned countries. But arriving passengers on tourist visas must take a mandatory rapid PCR test at the airport. Also, the previous rules for the unvaccinated, including exempted categories, would remain in place. Further, travellers wishing to receive the benefits provided to individuals vaccinated in the UAE can register their vaccination using the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship portal or Alhosn, the official COVID-19 results app for the UAE.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/flight-ticket-rates-soar-as-uae-resumes-tourist-visa/article36193902.ece

Dhone DSP V. Srinivas Reddy said the ATM kiosks did not have a guard as there was no bank branch attached to it. The masked men reportedly came to the ATM at 3 a.m. and cut open both the machines with a gas cutter and took out the cash. The thieves damaged the CCTV and changed the direction so that it did not record anything. “We are in the process of identifying the accused with the help of nearby CCTV cameras,” Mr. Reddy added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rs-6561-lakh-stolen-from-two-atms-in-dhone/article36194512.ece
31 August 2021||MALAPPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||When Moplas recreated Malabar across the seas||For the British, the Andaman islands may have been the safest place to deport the Moplahs who rebelled against them in Malabar in 1921. But for the Moplah deportees, the far-flung islands had turned out to be a place to register the love of their native land. Those who survived the cellular jails and the uncongenial terrains of the islands called the place they settled in by the name of their village in Malabar. Surprisingly, Andaman has places such as Nilambur, Mannarghat, Wandoor, Calicut, Tirur, Manjeri, Malappuram and Pandikkad. And all those places were named by the Moplahs who were deported by the British from Malabar. As a mark of affiliation to and love of their motherland, they christened the places with the names of their native land. Only village names “This attitude has made them different from the other Indians deported by the British. Only the people of Malabar brought in their village names to the island,” said P. P. Mohammed, a forest technical staffer at Wimberlygunj, Andaman. His great-grandfather had been deported from Edathanattukara, near Mannarkkad. “He found a settlement at a place named Pandikkad,” said Mr. Mohammed, who was born and brought up in Andaman. Like Mr. Mohammed, many others in Andaman still carry their family names and place names. Kottakkal Ashraf is a police constable in Andaman. “We are still using the family name Kottakkal. Similarly, there are many others,” said Mr. Ashraf. When Calicut is closest to Port Blair, the capital town of Andaman, Nilambur remains the farthest. By road, Calicut is about 15 km from the town and Nilambur is about 90 km. However, by boat they are much closer. From Port Blair by road, it takes about 50 km to Mannarkkad, 35 km to Wandoor, 30 km to Tirur, 20 km to Manjeri, 50 km to Malappuram, and 45 km to Pandikkad. Buses heading for Calicut and Tirur are a regular sight at Port Blair. “I had one of the biggest surprises of my life when I saw a bus heading towards Tirur the moment I landed at Port Blair a few years ago,” said Abdussamad Pookkottur, Islamic scholar and orator from Pookkottur. “What we should appreciate is that the Moplahs did not use any religious symbol or Arabic name to christen the place they settled in. Rather they used the name of their native village. It’s a matter of patriotic pride that none can negate,” he said. Sahaduddin Saqafi, who has been the Imam of Masjidu Taqwa at Stewartgun for five years, said places such as Malappuram, Mannarkkad and Calicut had a predominant Malayali population. “However, tourist places such as Wandoor, Tirur, Nilambur, and Manjeri have a large number of non-Malayalis.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/when-moplas-recreated-malabar-across-the-seas/article36193895.ece
31 August 2021||Mysuru,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘COVID-19 mortality rare among children’||Out of the 166 persons who died of COVID-19 during the week between August 16 and 22 in Karnataka, only two were children aged 14 and 15 years. No child below the age of 10 died due to COVID-19 during the period. These were the findings of a study on mortality patterns in the southern States of Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, conducted by Jeevan Raksha, a public-private initiative involving Proxima, a management firm, and the Public Health Foundation of India. The 14-year-old girl from Bengaluru Urban was diabetic. She died within 24 hours of admission to a hospital, while the 15-year-old boy from Haveri district died less than 48 hours after hospitalisation, the study said. Tamil Nadu, Kerala While no COVID-19 deaths of persons below 20 years were reported from Tamil Nadu, two children — one under a year old and another two years-old — died of COVID-19 in Kerala during the study period. The study further said lockdowns and movement restrictions were neither affordable nor an effective tool. Therefore, the public need to “start cohabiting with COVID-19 and smartly protect lives and livelihood,” Jeevan Raksha said in a statement on Monday. Though the study did not have data on the number of COVID-19 infections among children during the period, Jeevan Raksha said the mortality data of the three States validated the views expressed by some epidemiologists that it was rare for children and teenagers to become critically ill and succumb to COVID-19. ‘Holistic growth’ “Children cannot be caged in houses any more. It will affect their holistic growth and impact their future professional and personal lives. Parents need to adapt to the current circumstances and support the school administrations to facilitate the normalisation process. Initially, there could be an inevitable influx of infections in a couple of schools. Parents need to manage these anxious phases fearlessly,” said Mysore Sanjeev, convener, Jeevan Raksha. Meanwhile, the study said a total of 1,249 people succumbed to COVID-19 in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka during the week from August 16 to 22. Kerala accounted for as many as 893 deaths (or 71%), while Tamil Nadu and Karnataka accounted for 190 and 166 deaths respectively. While 6% of the mortality was among persons in the age group between 21 and 40, 24% was in the 41 to 60 group. As much as 52% was from the 61 to 80 age group, and 15% in the age group of 81 to 90. While one in every five COVID-19 deaths in Kerala was of a person aged 80 and above, in Karnataka one in every four deaths was of a person aged 50 and below. “There were no COVID-19 deaths in the age group of 1 to 20 in Tamil Nadu. One in every five deaths in Tamil Nadu was of a person in the age group of 51 to 60,” Mr. Sanjeev said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/covid-19-mortality-rare-among-children/article36193886.ece

Sai Satya Saharsa who had lost his parents to COVID-19 in East Godavari district. Earlier this year, five members of Sai Satya’s family, including both his parents, succumbed to COVID-19 while undergoing treatment at Subhadra Hospital.

The incident came to light on Monday after the police stated that at least five persons involved in the attack were arrested. Ramavath Anitha (name changed), who was also named as an accused in the June 13 murder of Shankar Naik, a leader in the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), appeared before TV cameramen and narrated her ordeal. “The women of Naik’s family dragged me from my uncle’s house. They stripped me and smeared chilli powder in my eyes and other parts of my body. They paraded me naked in the streets and wanted to kill me at the village’s bodrai [centre],” she said, naming the attackers. The woman said she was in the village to attend her uncle’s funeral and the Naik family had exacted revenge. Anitha was reportedly released on bail last week and was staying at a relative’s place in Suryapet town. She said she had informed the police that she would be attending the funeral.

Five of them — Lunavath Bharati, Padma, Jyothi, Sunitha and Banoth Jyothi — were arrested and remanded in judicial custody.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/woman-stripped-beaten-with-sticks-in-telangana/article36193882.ece
31 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cong. hits a low in Kerala due to dissent||Dissension in the Congress over the District Congress Committee (DCC) reorganisation hit a new low on Monday, with party veteran A.V. Gopinath from Palakkad quitting the organisation amid intense speculation that more disgruntled leaders would follow suit. Mr. Gopinath’s departure capped a long line of disagreements between ‘A’ and ‘I’ group factions and the official Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) leadership over the selection of DCC presidents. Mr. Gopinath’s resignation has come as a propaganda win for the CPI(M), as he praised Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and hinted that he was not inimical to the Left Democratic Front (LDF). Social media post A social media post by Congress leader Anil Akkara, purportedly mocking Mr. Gopinath for his “overtures” to Mr. Vijayan, seemed to have catalysed the latter’s decision to quit. KPCC president K. Sudhakaran chided Mr. Akkara for the Facebook post and expressed optimism that Mr. Gopinath would reverse his decision. Mr. Sudhakaran appeared to walk a tight line between imposing party discipline and keeping the rank and file within the party fold. Notably, the KPCC expelled P.S. Prasanth from the party. The leader from Nedumangad had raised the flag of rebellion by “disparaging” All-India Congress Committee general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal in a letter to former party president Rahul Gandhi. A party insider said the KPCC had received information that Mr. Prasanth would defect to the LDF. The expulsion, he said, was a pre-emptive move. Meanwhile, top group leaders engaged the KPCC leadership in a publicised tussle over DCC reorganisation for the second consecutive day. ‘A’ group leader Oommen Chandy blamed Mr. Sudhakaran for disclosing the contemporaneous notes the lattter had taken during their closed door discussions about party reorganisation. ‘I’ group leader Joseph Vazhakkan blamed the KPCC leadership for keeping senior leaders out of decision-making. Realignment of loyalties The Congress also witnessed an assumed realignment of loyalties. Media outlets claimed Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan, K. Muraleedharan, P.T. Thomas, T. Siddique, and Sooranadu Rajasekharan had shed their respective group identities and aligned themselves with the KPCC leadership.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cong-hits-a-low-in-kerala-due-to-dissent/article36193900.ece

31 August 2021||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||TTD drops ‘Sampradaya Bhojanam’ plan at Tirumala||The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams on Monday withdrew the proposal of providing ‘Sampradaya Bhojanam’ (traditional food) to pilgrims at Tirumala. TTD Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy told the media that though the decision to provide traditional food using organic ingredients was taken with a good intention by officials, it unfortunately was wrongly carried into the public. The board was not a party to the decision as it was taken by the officials after the expiry of the term of the previous board of trustees, he clarified. The TTD chairman announced the immediate withdrawal of the initiative following reports on the social media that the TTD was planning to collect charges on the food which hitherto was provided free of cost to pilgrims. Mr. Subba Reddy said, “Anything provided to devotees at Tirumala should be in the form of prasadam and hence imposition of charges of any kind does not arise at all.” With an intention to promote the use of organic food substances among public, the TTD had recently conceived the idea of providing millets-based traditional food to pilgrims on a cost-to-cost basis. It was said that the concept would be introduced on a trial basis only at one of its canteens here. Sarva darshan Asked about the revival of sarva darshanam at the hill temple, he said that he had instructed the officials to explore the possibility. “Of late, there is a hike in the number of COVID-19 cases in the country. Though the TTD is determined to allow common pilgrims for darshan, it mainly depends on the assurances by the district and health authorities. The possibility of allowing at least a limited number of pilgrims is being looked into,” he said. Mr. Subba Reddy expressed happiness at the introduction of Navaneetha Seva at the temple on Sri Krishna Janmashtami. ‘Nitya Annaprasadam will continue’ After participating in the Gokulashtami celebrations at SV Gosamrakshanasala at Tirupati, Mr. Subba Reddy said ‘Nitya Annaprasadam’ for devotees will continue at Tirumala and called it an ‘ever lasting seva’. The TTD Chairman warned the perpetrators of the misinformation campaign that they would face legal action soon. Mr. Subba Reddy said all efforts were being made to gather butter from ‘desi’ cows and also cow-based organic products for the Navaneetha Seva and also the ‘Srivari Organic Naivedya Prasadam’ that commenced on May 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ttd-withdraws-sampradaya-bhojanam-plan-at-tirumala/article36193897.ece

Narayana has raised objection over the proposed Chittoor–Thatchur greenfield highway, which is part of the new Bengaluru-Chennai national highway. Technically the third highway to connect the two metropolitan cities, the new access-controlled highway will provide direct access to Ennore port situated north of Chennai. Addressing the media here on Monday, Mr. Narayana accused the government of cheating the farmers by not paying a fair compensation. “The new highway will affect farmers in 46 villages of seven mandals in Chittoor district. The Union government cannot unilaterally take away the lands or exert pressure on the farmers. Every affected farmer’s consent matters and we will not allow the officials if they try to forcibly take their signature”, he warned. He charged the state government with not working to get due compensation to the farmers, and instead threatening the latter of withdrawing welfare schemes if they did not cooperate. He cited instances of revenue officials reportedly descending on the villages to threaten the land owners. Referring to the Centre’s monetisation programme, Mr. Narayana hinted at the new highway also going into the hands of corporate entities on a platter, in the garb of maintenance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpi-objects-to-chittoor-thatchur-highway/article36194516.ece

This is the first such sub-station to come up in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. While its prominent feature is the ability to provide huge capacity of power using limited land, the second advantage is its mobility, i.e., it can be removed and transported to any other place and still be used as a sub-station. The entire setup is coming up at an outlay of Rs. 5.5 crore. Accompanied by senior officials and field engineers, Andhra Pradesh Southern Power Distribution Company Limited’s (APSPDCL) Chairman and Managing Director H.

31 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Telangana should not operate powerhouses unilaterally’||The State government has requested the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) to direct Telangana not to operate powerhouses of Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar without water release orders from the board. The government also wanted that the powerhouse at Pulichintala should not be operated by Telangana without indent by Andhra Pradesh for water requirement in the Krishna Delta System. Andhra Pradesh Engineer in Chief (EnC) C. Narayana Reddy wrote a letter on Monday to the KRMB in response to the views expressed by the Telangana government regarding the power generation at Left side Power House at NSRSP Srisailam Project. Mr. Reddy said the administrative control of the right bank main powerhouse and the entire Srisailam reservoir except the left bank main powerhouse vested with Andhra Pradesh. And the control of the left side pumped storage scheme vested with Telangana by virtue of geographical boundaries of the divided States, he added. The pumped storage scheme at the left bank was envisaged as the peak load generation station and after generation of power, the same quantity of water had to be pumped back to the reservoir. The releases through the right bank main powerhouse were to be made to the extent of the downstream requirement of drinking and irrigation, duly considering the storage in the Nagarjunasagar reservoir, he asserted. “The right bank main powerhouse thus acts as a firm power generation station. The power generation by the successor States from their respective power stations at Srisailam will have to be limited to their downstream drinking and irrigation requirements," Mr. Reddy said in the letter, adding, “If any excess power generation is made through the left pumped storage scheme over and above the downstream entitlements, then such excess releases so made shall be pumped back to the reservoir.” The release of water at Nagarjunasagar and Pulichintala was incidental to the extent of drinking and irrigation releases for the Krishna delta in Andhra Pradesh, he said. Generation of power at Nagarjunasagar dam powerhouse and Pulichintala dam powerhouse might be shared between both the States, he said, while adding that even though the powerhouses were geographically located in Telangana, downstream water requirements were under Krishna Delta System in Andhra Pradesh. As Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar were common reservoirs, Telangana should not operate powerhouses unilaterally, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ask-telangana-not-to-run-powerhouses-unilaterally/article36193901.ece
31 August 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Why Union Minister’s mention of Vizag as capital of A.P. created a flutter||The mention of Visakhapatnam as the ‘capital of Andhra Pradesh’ in an annexure to the reply by Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri to a question in the Lok Sabha the other day has been felt by many as the Central government’s acceptance of the concept of ‘three capitals’. The State’s proposed three capital plan was challenged in the Andhra Pradesh High Court by the farmers who contributed to the development of Amaravati by the erstwhile government, with the apprehension that if the capital is shifted to Visakhapatnam in the name of executive capital and, the High Court and allied institutions moved to the ‘judicial capital’ (Kurnool), they stand to lose heavily. What stoked their fears was a gazette notification issued by the government, in which it specified Kurnool as the headquarters of the offices of Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta. Besides, the government said it is looking for a suitable place in Kurnool for establishing the State Human Rights Commission. PIB’s clarification Against this backdrop, the Press Information Bureau of India (PIB) issued a clarification on Sunday evening that it (the mention of Vizag as the capital) is to be taken as a ‘reference city’. The PIB said Visakhapatnam was shown as the capital only in the sense of giving a reference city for the purpose of State levies and duties on the prices of petrol and diesel in a statement made by Mr. Puri in reply to a question posed by MPs Kumbakudi Sudhakaran and Pradyut Bordoloi on the amount of taxes, cess and excise duty collected by the Central government on the petroleum products from March 2020 till date, including the monthly details of collections State-wise, and variations thereof. The Lok Sabha Secretariat is being informed about the amendment to the Minister’s reply. Conclusions were apparently drawn by a section of the media and those vehemently opposing the shifting of the capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam in the name of ‘executive capital’, that the mention of the port city as the capital is a decisive step towards shifting the capital out of Amaravati. Farmers protesting for 20 months But the matter is far from over as the issue is pending adjudication by the High Court, which posted over 90 petitions for a final hearing from November 15 even as the protests by thousands of farmers who gave their lands for the development of Amaravati as a greenfield capital completed 20 months. Looking back where it all started, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had mooted the idea of ‘three capitals’ soon after coming to power by bagging 151 Assembly seats out of 175 in the 2019 general elections and it evoked a strong criticism from the farmers and opposition parties. In spite of that, the government passed the enabling pieces of legislation (AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions and AP Capital Region Development Authority Repeal Acts) in 2020 while the Centre disowned any role in the entire episode and even stated its position in an affidavit filed before the High Court. An expert committee led by retired IAS officer G. Nageswara Rao had earlier vouched for the ‘three capitals’ proposal and it was subsequently endorsed by a high-power committee formed by the government. Government stand Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy has time and again justified the idea of three capitals by saying that his government could not afford to complete the greenfield capital project launched with much hype by his predecessor N. Chandrababu Naidu, due to its shoestring budget, and the development of Visakhapatnam, with its superior infrastructure (mainly maritime and air connectivity) and cosmopolitan culture, as capital of global standards entailed far less financial burden.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/why-union-ministers-mention-of-vizag-as-capital-of-ap-created-a-flutter/article36194522.ece

31 August 2021||vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Stock IMFL brands at liquor outlets, State govt. urged||The International Spirits and Wines Association of India (ISWAI) has urged the State government to allow Indian-made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) brands available at liquor outlets in the State. In a statement on Monday, ISWAI Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Nita Kapoor said that allowing IMFL brands to be sold here would offer a wider choice to the people of Andhra Pradesh as well as for tourists. “A progressive tourism policy is the need of the hour. The alcobev industry plays a vital role in promoting the travel and tourism industry. The tourism policy with proposed new shops earmarked for tourist destinations that already have AP Tourism Hotels and Resorts, would bring in significant revenues to the State government and create economic opportunities,” Ms. Kapoor said. Spurious liquor threat “It is imperative to ensure availability of Indian-made foreign liquor brands for local consumers and tourists, offering them choice and a superior customer experience. This will play a significant role in promoting and developing the tourism ecosystem,” Ms. Kapoor said. Emphasising the need to allow choice of products to consumers, ISWAI secretary general Suresh Menon said that the State government should not discriminate between new local brands and the historically popular national brands, most of which are also produced locally within the State. This curtailment of consumer preferences will only promote illegal movement of products and encourage spurious and counterfeit liquor that will ultimately harm consumers, besides impacting State revenues, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/stock-imfl-brands-at-liquor-outlets-state-govt-urged/article36194052.ece
31 August 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||A.P. saves 3,430 million units of energy||Andhra Pradesh has saved 3,430 million units of energy, which can be translated into 0.295 million tonne of oil equivalent (MTOE) worth around Rs. 2,350 crore and achieved a reduction of 1.38 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emission under the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) cycle-2 which is a mandatory flagship programme of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE). The energy saving is 40% more than what was accomplished by the industries in the PAT cycle-1, according to a BEE communication to the Department of Energy. A press release by State Energy Conservation Mission (AP-SECM) CEO A. Chandra Sekhar Reddy said Alok Kumar, Secretary of the Ministry of Power, appreciated the proactive industries implementing the PAT scheme in the State. The BEE implements the PAT scheme which is a market-based compliance mechanism aimed at accelerating cost-effective energy efficiency measures in large, energy-intensive industries through certification of tradable energy savings. As part of the scheme, the energy-intensive industries in the State achieved an energy saving of 0.205 MTOE of PAT cycle-1 against the 0.295 MTOE in the cycle-2. Energy Saving Certificates Under the PAT scheme, Designated Consumers (DCs-industries) which achieve specific energy consumption above the targets will be given Energy Saving Certificates (ESCerts) by the BEE. The ESCerts can be traded on the exchanges and they are purchased by under-performing DCs to avoid penal actions under the Energy Conservation Act, 2001. The SECM is the State designated agency that monitors the implementation of PAT scheme. The energy efficiency measures under the PAT scheme help reduce power usage/other input energy consumption and lowering the per-unit production cost leading to higher profits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ap-saves-3430-million-units-of-energy/article36194412.ece

In a statement on Monday, Mr. Dwivedi said the TDP’s allegations were totally baseless. The sand mining contract was awarded to JP Power Ventures through tenders and laid down guidelines. The JP Ventures was given a licence for sand mining in open reaches only. The office of Principal Secretary (Mines and Geology) hasn’t given any such permissions to Sudhakar Infra. Neither there were recommendations from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) to give necessary permissions to Sudhakar Infra for dredging in river Godavari, he said, adding, that legal action would be taken against Mr. Pattabhiram for attempting to attack the morale of the mines and geology department officials and portray the State government in poor light.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dwivedi-condemns-tdp-leaders-charges/article36194528.ece

Addressing a press conference here on Monday, Mr. Ramakrishna said that the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MPs should raise their voice against the Central government plans, in the Parliament. “The Chief Minister, along with all political parties and peoples’ organisations, must mount pressure on the Centre. Ever since the Centre made the announcement on the VSP privatisation, the peoples’ organisations and political parties in the State have been opposing the move. Andhra Pradesh Assembly too has passed a resolution. The Centre, however, did not respond nor pay heed to the demand. The agitation has reached 200 days now,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/oppose-privatisation-of-vsp-cpi-tells-cm/article36194529.ece
31 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||YSRCP out to dupe people of North Andhra, alleges TDP||The YSR Congress Party government is out to cheat the people of North Andhra in the name of decentralised development, alleged Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leaders at the ‘Uttarandhra rakshana charcha vedika’, a debate on development of the region, organised at the party office here on Monday. In the name of making Visakhapatnam as the Executive capital of the State, the YSRCP government wants to sell lands in the district and mint money, they alleged. There was no development in the region ever since the YSRCP government came to power, the TDP leaders alleged, at the debate, organised on the direction of the party chief and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu. They claimed that whatever development, be it irrigation projects in Srikakulam and development works in Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts, was all initiated during the TDP rule. The YSR Congress Party government had stalled the projects taken up during the previous government, by driving away investors, they alleged. Senior party leader and former Union Minister P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju alleged that the YSRCP government was spreading a lot of ‘misinformation’ and ‘disinformation’ on development by referring to a huge hoarding, which he saw on his way to the meeting, which says that Visakhapatnam would be developed by 2041. Temple lands On the allegations of the ruling party that about 800 acres of land, belonging to the Simhachalam devasthanam, was missing from the records, Mr. Raju wondered whether the government has the survey numbers, pertaining to the missing land. The YSRCP government claimed that it has saved 500 acres of land in the Bhogapuram International Airport but it has done away with the Maintenance Repair Overhaul (MRO) and the Cargo Complex, which could put the region on the fast-track mode to development, he said. Party State president K. Atchannaidu said that the successive governments had neglected the region though it has rich natural resources, a long coastline and hard working people. He claimed that it was the TDP, which brought recognition to the region by bringing irrigation projects and establishing industries and thereby generating employment. He explained that the TDP was committed to Amaravati as capital of the State though it has lost the election. Former Ministers Kala Venkata Rao, Nimmakayala Chinarajappa, Ch. Ayyanna Patrudu and Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy said that the meeting was meant to create awareness among the people on the need to question the government on the injustice being done to the region. MLAs, MLCs and party leaders and activists from the three districts participated in the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-out-to-dupe-people-of-north-andhra-alleges-tdp/article36194557.ece
31 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Are TDP leaders clear about three capitals, asks Muttamsetti||Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao on Monday questioned the intentions of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leaders from the North Andhra districts on the development of the region, especially Visakhapatnam city. “It does not appear that the TDP leaders are interested in the development of North Andhra region, as they are opposing the move to make Visakhapatnam as the Executive Capital of the State. First, they should make themselves clear with the people of the region and the higher-ups in the party on what they really want,” he told the media here. Reiterating that Visakhapatnam has all the trappings to become the Executive Capital, the Minister said that the government’s move would ensure all-round development of the region, including employment generation. On one hand, the TDP leaders are creating stumbling blocks for the development and on the other, they are silent on the pressing issues such as privatisation of the VSP, funding for the Polavaram project and status of the railway zone in Visakhapatnam, said Mr. Srinivasa Rao, adding that the TDP had no moral right to comment about the development of North Andhra as they had done nothing on this front during their tenure. “Almost every leader visited the Uddanam area in Srikakulam district, but did nothing for the people suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) since decades. But, the YSRCP after coming to power has sanctioned one super-speciality hospital and the work is on,” he said. The government, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said, had sanctioned medical colleges for Anakapalle, Vizianagaram and Paderu and allotted Rs. 500 crore for each. The government schools had been developed under the Nadu-Nedu scheme, he said. Mr. Srinivasa Rao criticised TDP leader P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju for his comments on Simhachalam Devasthanam’s land. “Being the chairperson of the temple trust board, how can he (Mr. Gajapathi Raju) say that he has no knowledge about records pertaining to 800 acres of temple land has gone missing,” he said. VSP privatisation Responding to TDP’s criticism on the sale of 10% of the State government’s share in the Gangavaram Port Limited to the Adani group, he said, “In the last five years, the State government had earned only Rs. 80 crore from its share, not a single penny as dividend. So there is no point in retaining it.” Answering a query as to why the YSRCP MPs were not resigning on the VSP privatisation issue, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said, “It is better to be as MPs and fight for the cause. Resigning will not give us leverage as the BJP has absolute majority in the Parliament.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/are-tdp-leaders-clear-about-three-capitals-asks-muttamsetti/article36194624.ece

31 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||10 arrested, 76 ‘stolen’ two-wheelers recovered||The crime wing of the city police cracked a major vehicle theft case and arrested 10 accused and seized 76 two-wheelers, including a few high-end ones, here on Monday. The main accused were identified as Mohammed Ahamad (37) of Alipuram, Gosangi Anand (27), an automobile mechanic and resident of Poorna Market area, and Bantupalli Suresh (30) of Alipuram. The other remaining seven are from various areas of the city and are iron scrap dealers. The police took up the case on August 1, after one P. Murali Krishna, an employee of the HPCL, had lodged a complaint that his two-wheeler was stolen from Malkapuram area. “Based on the complaint and a few other previous complaints, which had the similar modus operandi, we formed a team and started to investigate the case,” said ACP (Crimes) Ch. Penta Rao. “Initially, we stumbled upon one motorbike that had the chassis and engine number erased and they were replaced by a new set of numbers that were embossed. This raised our suspicion and on investigation, it was revealed that though bike was of latest model, the registration book had a date of 1996,” said Mr. Penta Rao. “Upon further investigation, we could locate 76 motorbikes, which include 58 from Visakhapatnam and 18 from U Kothapalli of East Godavari. This also led us to arrest the 10 members, including the three main accused,” he said. Modus operandi The police said the main accused Mohammed Ahamad, had some contacts in U Kothapalli and using them he would approach people owning old motorbikes. He would propose and convince them that he would transform the old bikes with a new look and bring the bikes to Visakhapatnam after collecting an advance ranging from Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 30,000 and also the registration books and other documents pertaining to the vehicles, the police said. In Visakhapatnam, he would erase the engine and chassis numbers and sell them to the scrap merchants, with the help of Anand and Suresh, who did the dismantling and erasing job for him. “In Visakhapatnam, he would then commit theft of new bikes, erase the engine, registration and chassis numbers with the help of Suresh and emboss the numbers of the old bikes brought from U Kothapalli, in an effort to give some legitimacy to the stolen bikes and again sell them either to scrap merchants or to prospective customers,” said ADCP (Crimes) V. Suresh Babu. Taking the lead from one bike, it took about 20 days for the special team comprising M. Avataram, Inspector (crime) Harbour Police Station, D. Suri Babu, SI of Malkapuram (Crime), and B. Ramanayya, SI of Parawada PS, to track the gang and retrieve the two-wheelers. Police Commissioner Manish Kumar Sinha appreciated the efforts of the team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/10-arrested-76-stolen-two-wheelers-recovered/article36194623.ece

31 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM/ Eluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Chintamaneni Prabhakar detained on charge of manhandling police SI||The Visakhapatnam District Police stopped the convoy of TDP senior leader Chintamaneni Prabhakar on Sunday night and handed him over to their West Godavari counterparts after a brief inquiry. Mr. Prabhakar allegedly manhandled Ram Kumar, SI of Denduluru police station in West Godavari district when the later tried to prevent him from blocking an MLA’s vehicle on Sunday. Mr. Prabhakar was released after being served a notice. According to police, a suspicious movement of a convoy was noticed at Darakonda village in the limits of Visakhapatnam Rural district. The police stopped the convoy as it was coming from the interior parts of the Visakha Agency, a hot bed of ganja smuggling and Maoist activities. “It was only after questioning the people travelling in the convoy, we realised that the former TDP MLA was travelling in the convoy. We did not have any prior information of his visit to this area,” said DIG (Visakhapatnam Range) L.K.V. Ranga Rao. Visakhapatnam Superintendent of Police B. Krishna Rao said that a case under the Section 353 of the IPC (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty) was pending against Mr. Prabhakar in West Godavari district, due to which he was detained for some time before being handed over to a police team from West Godavari. It is learnt that Mr. Prabhakar had come to visit a temple in Darakonda area of G.K. Veedhi mandal and was returning when he was detained. Another version of the local TDP leader was that the former MLA had come on a personal trip to attend a marriage function. DIG (Eluru Range) K.V. Mohan Rao said that Mr. Prabhakar took part in a protest against the price hike of fuel and essential commodities. Later, the TDP leader, along with his followers, allegedly tried to block the Denduluru MLA Abbaiah Chowdary’s vehicle. “When Denduluru SI Ram Kumar, who was on duty, tried to prevent Mr. Prabhakar, the latter thrashed the SI. Mr. Prabhakar escaped when police tried to take him into custody,” Mr. Mohan Rao said on Monday. West Godavari Superintendent of Police (SP) Rahul Dev Sharma said Mr. Prabhakar allegedly pushed the SI and created law and order problems. “Despite repeated appeals to follow COVID-19 protocol, the former MLA behaved with high-handedness and allegedly manhandled the police officer,” Mr. Rahul Dev Sharma said. Eluru Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) O. Dileep Kiran said a police team from West Godavari went to Visakhapatnam and took Mr. Prabahakar into custody and the Denduluru police released him. Mr. Rahul Dev Sarma said that as many as 83 cases were pending against the former MLA in different police stations in West Godavari and its neighbouring districts. Meanwhile, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leaders alleged that the police had foisted a false case and were harassing the former MLA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chintamaneni-prabhakar-detained-on-charge-of-manhandling-police-si/article36194531.ece

31 August 2021||Bengaluru,TELANGANA||Report on third wave preparation||Recommending a multi-pronged preparation strategy for a possible third wave of COVID-19 in the State, the COVID-19 expert group of the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA) in Karnataka submitted its report to the government on Monday. The 34-page report suggested that vaccination advocacy, research-linked data documentation, and effective training of healthcare workers were the need of the hour. Emphasising the role of vaccines, the PHANA committee pointed out that private hospitals must follow the hub and spoke model to conduct vaccination drives across cities and towns. This model was followed during the first phase of the vaccination drive and the outcomes were effective. While specific hospitals were appointed as vaccination centres, nearby hospitals would undertake advocacy. All hospitals would address vaccine hesitancy with the same voice, the report stated. The committee has recommended aggressive implementation of home isolation and surveillance protocols. Every patient at home should be adopted by a COVID Care Centre or hospital care centre and be monitored by telemedicine, the report said. While guidance for clinicians on the therapeutic management of non-hospitalised adult patients should be given, junior doctors and nurse practitioners should be trained for home tele-monitoring. “We should now focus only on micro-containment zones so that the virus spread is curbed and normal activities can also continue,” the report stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/report-submitted-on-third-wave-preparation/article36194102.ece
31 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Rs. 5 lakh health cover with Aarogyasri, Ayushman merger||The merger of Telangana government’s Aarogyasri Health Scheme and Centre’s Ayushman Bharat Scheme has increased the maximum health protection to Rs. 5 lakh per year. Around 79 lakh families who are beneficiaries of Aarogyasri scheme are eligible for it. The upper limit under Aarogyasri scheme was Rs. 2 lakh per year to each of the 79 lakh families. “After merger of the two schemes, the upper limit of health protection to all the families’ increases to Rs. 5 lakh per annum,” said senior officials from the State Health Department. Until mid May-2021, only Aarogyasri health scheme was implemented in the State. Prior to May, the State government expressed reluctance over coverage of Ayushman Bharat. On May 18, it was announced that the State Health Department has signed a memorandum of understanding with the National Health Authority for the implementation of Ayushman Bharat (Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana) scheme in the State. There after, modalities for implementation of the two schemes was being worked out. Senior officials said that around 1,028 health ailments or diseases were covered under Aarogyasri Scheme, and 1,668 under Ayushman Bharat Scheme. “Over 1020 diseases and ailments are common between the two schemes. The remaining 646 diseases which are covered only under Ayushman Bharat can be availed at government hospitals. Treatment for the 646 diseases under the merged schemes at private hospitals is conditional. Talks will be held with the private hospital managements about it,” said the senior official. The list of the diseases covered under the two schemes is yet to be uploaded in a website. One of the common critical question asked by people about implementation of health schemes is why government pays for treatment at government hospitals - where any medical service is provided free of cost. The question rises again after merger of the two schemes. Senior officials in the Health Department reasoned that the government hospitals get money for treatment under the health schemes. Health care workers get some money under it too. “The health insurance benefit helps in development of the hospitals and could serve as a motivation,” another senior official said. The officials also said that as the Ayushman Bharat scheme is implemented in Telangana too, patients from other States will opt for treatment at hospitals here. “Everyone knows that patients from various States opted hospitals in Telangana for COVID treatment. Their numbers were high. Now, if beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat opt for treatment of other diseases, it will bring money to hospitals. It helps the patients and the hospitals,” said the official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rs-5-lakh-health-cover-with-aarogyasri-ayushman-merger/article36194340.ece

31 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Congress faults Bandi Sanjay’s remarks at Charminar||The Congress party has criticised Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar for his remarks made at Bhagyalaxmi temple-Charminar portraying as if they were part of another country and as if no one had ever visited it before. Senior vice president of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) G. Niranjan said here on Monday that Mr. Sanjay appeared to have no knowledge about the history of Charminar or Bhagyalaxmi temple. It was in 1990, the then AICC president Rajiv Gandhi had commenced his sadbhavana yatra in the Twin Cities from there. Further, he stated that the then Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad had participated in the sadbhavana yatra commemoration meeting there in 2015 and the then AICC president Rahul Gandhi in 2018. Indira 1983 visit He also mentioned that then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had campaigned for the party candidates in all the Assembly segments of the Old City in 1983 and later she had visited Charminar in 1984 too to console the people affected in communal clashes in the city. In 1998, the then AICC president Sonia Gandhi had visited Akkanna Madanna Mahankali temple and a mosque in the Old City hit by communal clashes. Mr. Niranjan sought to know how the BJP could achieve Akhand Bharath by creating disputes among different sections of people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sanjays-remarks-faulted/article36194338.ece
31 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Implement PMAY, Ayushman Bharat soon: Bandi Sanjay||State BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar demanded the TRS government to immediately start implementing the Prime Minister’s Awas Yojana (PMAY) for building houses to the poor and also ‘Ayushman Bharat’ as he alleged that it has now become clear that the State govt. has totally failed in constructing the promised two-bedroom houses for the poor and the COVID pandemic has hit common people hard with high medical bills in the absence of the ‘Arogyasri’. “People have been coming forward voluntarily on their own in last couple of days to pour out their tale of woes on how the government has left them in the lurch during COVID pandemic, how they have been cheated on the promise of two-bedroom houses and about no help for loss of livelihoods. We are going to give suggestions after this padayatra in good faith for the government to accept - or it should be ready to face people’s wrath,” he said, on Monday.  The BJP chief, on his third day of the ‘Praja Sangrama Yatra’ - questioned at a press conference why Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao does not interact with people except for hosting lunches before the bypolls. He alleged that hundreds of crores of bills to private hospitals under Arogyasri have been kept pending whereas the government hospitals lack proper manpower and infrastructure, leaving citizens in a bind. The Centre sanctioned Rs. 2,285 crore of the Rs. 3,500 crore for 1.40 lakh houses under PMAY within GHMC limits alone, but the State government had admitted to have built just 8,000 2-bedroom houses in urban areas where the quality is missing in construction. “If you had built more houses, we could have asked for more from the Centre as other States have done. Here the government does not even bother to provide beneficiaries’ list. Please accept the reality that you cannot build what you promised and cooperate in PMAY implementation for the sake of the poor,” he advised. The same attitude is reflected in not providing matching grants for projects taken up under the ‘Smart’ City as the Chief Minister does not want to give credit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he claimed. “Has Mr. Rao even once asked people to take the free vaccine being supplied by the Centre?,” he asked. Mr. Sanjay Kumar expressed his gratitude to people and party workers for their support to his programme and vowed to develop old city by bringing IT firms. “We are not against people living here but against illegal migrants,” he said. Refuting any kind of understanding with TRS, he said BJP never had a pact - while the Congress, Telugu Desam and the Communists had aligned with the former at one time or the other.

A few leaders of the party had suggested fielding only a local candidate in Huzurabad, he noted. He stated that Huzurabad would throw a surprising result in the triangular contest between Congress, TRS and BJP as the people had made up their mind to register their discontent against the State and Central governments for their anti-people decisions, laws and programmes. Stating that the party meeting had decided to continue the Dalita, Girijana Dandora meets till September 17, the TPCC working president said Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjuna Kharge would attend the last meeting likely to be held in Gajwel constituency being represented by Chief Minister K.

The file pertaining to the promotions had been sent to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao for his final clearance and the officials concerned are hopeful of receiving the orders late this evening. The development follows the fervent requests made by the employees who were apprehensive of missing out on the opportunity one more year. Promotions were last given to the employees two years ago and a section of employees staged protest in front of the Chief Secretary’s chambers in the Secretariat few days ago demanding that promotions be given to them before the conclusion of the panel year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/dpcs-clear-promotions-in-secretariat-departments/article36194345.ece

Most of the victims were swept in flash floods due to heavy rains in Vikarabad, Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri and Hanumakonda districts. Tragedy struck two families in Vikarabad as a newly-wed woman and her husband’s sister got washed away in a canal in Marpally mandal on Sunday night. They were travelling in a car. While the bride Pravalika and the sister-in-law Swetha Reddy’s bodies were recovered, an eight-year-old boy who was also in the car was yet to be found. The family members alleged that the car driver, Raghavender Reddy, was inebriated. Pravalika and Nawaz Reddy got married on August 24. After completing post-marriage celebrations at Pravalika’s home in Mominpet, the couple were returning to Nawaz’s home in Ravepally. Apart from the newly-wed couple, the groom’s sisters Radha, Swetha and her son Thrishanth were in the car. Driver’s fault? As water was overflowing on the road in Marpally, several vehicles stopped at a distance. Vikarabad DSP A. Sanjeev Rao said the family members urged Raghavender to stop the car and wait. “However, he drove the car on the road overflowing with water and the vehicle stopped mid-way. The car got washed into the canal and hit a tree. Glass of the window broke due to the impact,” said G. Venkat Sreenu, sub-inspector at Marpally police station. While Nawaz, Radha, and Raghavender escaped after struggling in water, Pravalika and Swetha got washed away. Both their bodies were recovered on Monday morning. Thrishanth was yet to be found. Mr Sanjeev Rao said the family’s allegations against the driver was yet to be scientifically established. However, a case has been registered against him. In another incident, in Shankarpalli of Vikarabad, a 70-year-old man died after the car in which he was travelling was swept away on Sunday night while crossing a bridge which was overflowing with water from a stream in spate.

31 August 2021||GURUGRAM,||Bandhwari landfill: ‘scrap contract with waste firm, act against MCG’||Citing a latest report by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) showing discharge of highly toxic and untreated leachate into the forest area behind Bandhwari landfill here, the environmentalists have demanded that the contract of Ecogreen, the company handling waste management in Gurugram and Faridabad, be suspended and action taken against the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram. In a letter to Chief Secretary Vijai Vardhan, and senior officials of the HSPCB and Forest Department, the environmentalists said the leachate testing report for the sample collected earlier this month confirmed the presence of certain toxins on a much higher side than the permissible limits. Untreated leachate “The report shows that highly toxic, untreated leachate is being discharged in the forest. Based on this report, Ecogreen’s contract should be suspended,” read the letter. Vaishali Rana, one of the environmentalists, said that for the past three years she had been reporting the utter failure of Ecogreen firm and the MCG to control and treat the leachate emanating out of the landfill. “I have reported this to the authorities at least on six occasions before that Ecogreen was found discharging leachate into the Aravalis. On August 12, HSPCB officials collected leachate samples from three places from the landfill (Leachate Treatment Plant) and also outside the landfill in the Aravalis. The leachate testing report was made available to me a couple of days ago by the HSPCB and it clearly speaks of the presence of certain toxins that are on a higher side,” said Ms. Rana in the letter jointly written with Vivek Kamboj and Col. (retd.) S.S. Oberoi, both environmentalists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/activists-seek-action-after-report-reveals-toxic-discharge-into-forest/article36194214.ece
31 August 2021||Mumbai,||ED working on directions of BJP: MVA leaders||A day after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) summoned Shiv Sena leader and Transport Minister in the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government Anil Parab on August 31, the agency reportedly conducted raids on the officials of the department. The allies slammed the action saying it has become clear that the ED was working on directions of the BJP. “The happenings in Maharashtra are nothing but political vendetta. The ED is probing individuals and raiding places as demanded by the BJP. This is nothing but political gameplan,” said Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Minister Nawab Malik. State NCP president Jayant Patil too said the ED is being used to trouble the MVA government. “The practice of troubling anti-BJP leaders is seen not only in Maharashtra but across the country. The leaders being targeted are capable to reply in same coin but this is nothing but an effort to defame the State government using Central agencies,” said Mr. Patil. The Shiv Sena has termed the ED notice as love letter. “For any political worker, the ED notice is no longer a death warrant, but love letter. Power is not permanent. They have their days of power in Delhi. Our days will also come,” said Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut. Mr. Parab has already said he does not know the matter regarding which he has been summonedby the ED. Unauthorised resort BJP leader Kirit Somaiya on Monday claimed that Mr. Parab has built an unauthorised resort by violating coastal zone regulations in Murud village in Dapoli tehsil of costal Ratnagiri district which should be immediately demolished. Mr. Somaiya alleged that one Bajrang Kharmate, deputy regional transport officer, acts as an agent of the Minister and deals with corruption in transfers in the RTO department. It is said Mr. Parab was under the ED lense after dismissed Mumbai police officer Sachin Waze tried to submit a letter to the NIA court claiming the Minister had asked him to extort crores of rupees. Mr. Parab has already denied all the allegations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ed-working-on-directions-of-bjp-mva-leaders/article36194222.ece

The authorities concerned are not only still keeping an eye on such areas but also ensuring COVID-appropriate behaviour in their vicinity. The number of containment zones in the city is decreasing rapidly with some districts such as the Central and North-East districts, having seemingly become free of them per se and others on the brink of ridding themselves of the tag. 20 new cases The city reported only one new COVID-19 death in 24 hours and the total number of deaths stood at 25,081, as per a bulletin released by the Delhi government on Monday.

Most affected While no containment zones exist in the North and Central districts any more, the South-East district with two and the East district with three containment zones were expected to be free of any such demarcation over the coming days, government sources said. In terms of active containment zones, which are classified on the basis of the difference between the number of containment zones and the number of decontained zones, the New Delhi district has the maximum number of such zones at 116 followed by 24 in in the West district and 25 in the South district. “The Delhi government is committed towards ensuring that COVID-19 cases do not rise in the city and is implementing best practices to plug the spread of the virus,” another health department official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/containment-zones-plummet-as-cases-continue-to-decrease/article36194212.ece

One such mohalla clinic has been set up through CSR at Shakur Basti and this is a sample project, the Minister said. “There have been politics related to mohalla clinics. Wherever we have wanted to open them, we have faced issues with land. Land is with the Central government and the DDA had promised in the High Court to give land for 500 mohalla clinics, but they have not given land for even one mohalla clinic,” Mr. Jain said. 100% transferable “We have created readymade mohalla clinic inside shipping container. It will be built in factories. It is 100% transferable and can be shifted in trucks from one place to another,” he said. He said that the current mohalla clinic is a sample done through CSR by a company and despite installing them on the Delhi government land, the municipal corporations that is governed by the BJP, still creates issues. “In many areas in Delhi, we don’t have enough space to build mohalla clinics. This new clinic takes only half the space of existing ones. Earlier, mohalla clinics’ area was 600 square feet, now it takes only 300 square feet,” Mr. Jain said. He said that the government is planning more such projects. Mohalla clinics is one of the flagship initiatives of the Kejriwal government to boost the primary healthcare system in Delhi.

31 August 2021||New Delhi,||‘U’khand has worst healthcare services’||The Aam Aadmi Party on Monday alleged that as per a CAG report, Uttarakhand has the worst healthcare services in Himalayan States and the condition of health services is so bad that patients “lose their lives” before they even reach the hospital. AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said that healthcare facilities are still inaccessible for many people. CAG report The AAP has announced that they will be contesting the Assembly election in Uttarakhand in 2022 and Mr. Bharadwaj promised that if an AAP government is formed in the State, then people will be able to get “good and free health services” like in Delhi.  “The recently published CAG report 2019-20 has revealed the extremely poor conditions of the health sector in Uttarakhand. Most of the people in Uttarakhand die before even reaching a hospital because the number of hospitals is very less,” Mr. Bharadwaj said. He further claimed that the State’s health budget was Rs. 188 crore in 2018-19 and it was reduced to just Rs. 97 crore in 2019-20 and “only 5.25 paise” is being spent on per person’s health in a year. “This CAG report further reveals that amongst all the Himalayan States, Uttarakhand has the worst health sector. The situation is so grim that many women die in the initial stages of their pregnancy. The availability of ambulances is also very poor such that ‘Dandi Kandis’ are used to take the patients to the hospitals and most of the times they die before reaching the hospitals,” the AAP leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ukhand-has-worst-healthcare-services/article36194217.ece

31 August 2021||Pune,||Temple reopening: defying norms, BJP holds agitation||Alleging that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government gave more importance to liquor bars than temples, Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Maharashtra staged protests on Monday demanding reopening of temples. Symbolically blowing conches in their shankhnaad agitation and defying COVID-19 regulations, hundreds of BJP workers and State leaders participated in protests in key temple areas of Pune, Mumbai, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Solapur districts. Alleging that the MVA government was deliberately hurting sentiments of the Hindu community, BJP MLA from Mumbai’s Ghatkopar, Ram Kadam, said that the government apparently gave permission for other religions for their festivities but was refusing to open temples. “Please bear in mind, we are not advocating crowding in front of temples. But the government can certainly devise a system based on the issuance of online passes for lakhs of devotees. When you can make rules for beer bars, then why does this government dither when it comes to reopening temples,” Mr. Kadam said. Earlier, a police shield had been stationed outside Siddhi Vinayak temple to prevent Mr. Kadam from holding a protest there. A partner in the coalition government, the Congress hit out at the contradictory stand taken by the BJP government at the Centre and the party’s Maharashtra unit over celebration of festivals and the reopening of temples amid the looming threat of a third wave of infections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/temple-reopening-defying-norms-bjp-holds-agitation/article36194224.ece
31 August 2021||Pune,||Farmer outfits warn govt., Oppn. to stop ‘silly politics’||The ‘political soap opera’ being played out between Union Minister Narayan Rane and Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was nothing but ‘a ploy’ on the part of the ruling and Opposition politicos to divert attention from vital issues affecting farmers, former MP and farmer leader Raju Shetti has alleged. Mr. Shetti, who heads the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS), chastised both the Central and the State governments while pointing out that farmers were protesting the import of genetically modified soybean and the crashing prices of tomatoes. The former MP said that he was planning a major protest on September 1 in Kolhapur to demand recompense for farmers whose croplands had been destroyed in the recent floods and the unseasonal rains last year. The SSS’ protest, named ‘Panchganga Parikrama’ would see Mr. Shetti and his activists attempting water immersion.He also hit out at the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices for recommending that the Centre increase the fair and remunerative price for sugar cane growers by a mere Rs. 50 a quintal. The Left-affiliated All-India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) also warned that it would stage massive protests in front of the residences of the leaders of both the ruling and Opposition parties if they continued to waste time on ‘non-issues’. “Maharashtra’s tomato growers have fallen on hard times once again. So much so, that even transporting the vegetable to the market is proving to be a loss-making trip for the average farmer, who is forced to sell his produce at Rs. 1 or Rs. 2 a kilo. At a time when farmers are in the throes of such a grave crisis, we warn both the MVA and the BJP leadership to stop playing silly politics on non-issues [alluding to the Rane-Thackeray spat],” Ajit Nawale of the AIKS said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/farmer-outfits-warn-govt-oppn-to-stop-silly-politics/article36194225.ece
31 August 2021||Washington,||U.S. probing if civilians were killed in strike||The United States is investigating whether civilians may have been killed in an air strike it launched to destroy a car laden with explosives in the Afghan capital Kabul, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said on Sunday. The statement came after CNN reported that nine members of a family, including six children, were killed in Sunday’s air strike in the crowded capital, where thousands of Afghans are still trying to flee the Taliban. AFP has not been able to confirm the report. Local media also reported that civilians were killed in the strike. “We are aware of reports of civilian casualties following our strike on a vehicle in Kabul today,” Captain Bill Urban, a CENTCOM spokesman, said in a statement. “We are still assessing the results of this strike, which we know disrupted an imminent ISIS-K threat to the airport,” he continued, using an acronym for the Afghan branch of the Islamic State group, which carried out a suicide attack at the airport on Thursday. “We know that there were substantial and powerful subsequent explosions resulting from the destruction of the vehicle, indicating a large amount of explosive material inside that may have caused additional casualties,” Capt. Urban continued. “It is unclear what may have happened, and we are investigating further. “We would be deeply saddened by any potential loss of innocent life,” he said. The U.S. air strike came after a suicide bomber from the Islamic State group on Thursday targeted U.S. troops stopping huge crowds of people from entering the airport as they try to flee the new Taliban regime. Scores of people died in the attack, including 13 U.S. service personnel. The car that was destroyed by the U.S. strike had been headed for Kabul’s airport, a Taliban spokesman had said earlier Sunday. About 1,14,000 people have been evacuated since August 15, when the Taliban swept back into power. The American withdrawal from Afghanistan is due to be completed by Tuesday. Unlawful action: Taliban Meanwhile, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the U.S. drone strike resulted in civilian casualties, and condemned the United States for failing to inform the Taliban before ordering the strike. Mujahid told China’s state television CGTN on Monday that seven people were killed in the drone attack, describing the U.S. action on foreign soil as unlawful. “If there was any potential threat in Afghanistan, it should have been reported to us, not an arbitrary attack that has resulted in civilian casualties,” Mujahid said in a written response to CGTN. Mujahid had issued a similar condemnation of a U.S. drone strike on Saturday that killed two Islamic State militants in the eastern province of Nangarhar. He said two women and a child were wounded in that attack. Pentagon officials said the suicide car bomber had been preparing to attack the airport in Kabul, where U.S. troops were in the final stages of a withdrawal from Afghanistan, on behalf of ISIS-K, a local affiliate of Islamic State that is an enemy of both the West and the Taliban.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-probing-if-civilians-were-killed-in-strike/article36193827.ece
31 August 2021||Seoul,||N. Korea may have restarted N-reactor: IAEA||Nuclear-armed North Korea appears to have restarted its plutonium-producing reprocessing reactor in a “deeply troubling” development, the UN atomic agency has said, a possible sign Pyongyang is expanding its banned weapons programme. The development on the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon — North Korea’s main nuclear complex — comes with nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington at a standstill. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un offered to dismantle part of the Yongbyon complex at a second summit with then U.S. President Donald Trump but not other sites, in exchange for sanctions relief, and his offer was rejected. North Korea is under multiple sets of international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes. “Since early July, there have been indications, including the discharge of cooling water, consistent with the operation of the reactor,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in its annual report. The Yongbyon reactor appeared to have been inactive from December 2018 until then, added the report dated Friday. IAEA inspectors were kicked out of North Korea in 2009, and the agency has since monitored it from outside. The possible operation of the reactor follows a recent indication that Pyongyang is also using a nearby radiochemical laboratory to separate plutonium from spent fuel previously removed from the reactor. The signs of the reactor and laboratory operations were “deeply troubling”, the IAEA said, adding the activities were a “clear violation” of UN resolutions. A senior U.S. State Department official said Washington was aware of the report and was closely coordinating with partner countries. “This report underscores the urgent need for dialogue and diplomacy so we can achieve the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,” the official said. “We continue to seek dialogue with the DPRK so we can address this reported activity and the full range of issues related to denuclearisation.”   The Biden administration has previously promised a “practical, calibrated approach”, including diplomatic efforts, to persuade the impoverished North to give up its banned weapons programmes. But Pyongyang has never shown any indication it would be willing to surrender its nuclear arsenal, and this month Mr. Kim’s sister and key adviser Kim Yo Jong demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the peninsula.

31 August 2021||Kabul,||US exit will stop IS attacks in Afghanistan: Taliban||The Taliban’s spokesman says the hardline Islamist group will crack down on Islamic State attacks and expects them to end once foreign forces leave the country. “We hope that those Afghans who are influenced by IS... will give up their operations on seeing the formation of an Islamic government in the absence of foreigners,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. “If they create a situation for war and continue with their operations, the Islamic government... we will deal with them,” he added. The evacuation of tens of thousands of foreigners and Afghans who feel at risk of reprisal or repression under the Taliban is due to end on Tuesday, along with the full withdrawal of US and NATO troops. Islamic State has been highly critical of the troop withdrawal deal struck between the Taliban and Washington last year, which saw the Taliban offer security guarantees. One IS commentary published after the fall of Kabul accused the Taliban of betraying jihadists with the U.S. withdrawal deal and vowed to continue its fight, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors militant communications. During the Taliban’s prison break spree this summer to free its fighters, many battle-hardened IS militants were also released — increasingly looking like a lethal error. ‘Technical problems’ Although both groups are hardline Sunni Islamist militants, they have differed on the minutiae of religion and strategy, while each claiming to be the true flag-bearers of jihad. In recent years, the IS Afghanistan-Pakistan chapter has been responsible for some of the deadliest attacks in those countries. They have massacred civilians at mosques, public squares, schools, and even hospitals. Mujahid reiterated that the new Taliban government will not be announced until after the last U.S. soldier has left. “It is important to announce the government but this requires a lot of patience. We are holding consultations to form the government responsibly,” Mujahid said. “We have some technical problems on this issue,” he added. Banks, government offices and other public institutions remain largely shut with employees prevented from entering offices since the takeover, which sent the Afghani sliding. The Taliban have promised to improve Afghanistan’s economy, but to do that the new regime will have to rely on foreign aid — and there is no guarantee it will get the funds it needs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-exit-will-stop-is-attacks-in-afghanistan-taliban/article36193825.ece
31 August 2021||Jerusalem,||Pushed by U.S., Israel’s Gantz holds talks with Abbas||Israel’s Defence Minister has met Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas for a rare high-level meeting, but a source close to Prime Minister Naftali Bennett insisted on Monday his government had no plans to reboot peace talks. Defence Minister Benny Gantz met Mr. Abbas in Ramallah late on Sunday for what were reportedly the first direct talks between an Israeli Cabinet member and the 86-year-old Palestinian leader in several years. The meeting, which Mr. Gantz’s office said focused on “security policy, civilian and economic issues”, came just hours after Mr. Bennett returned from Washington where he met U.S. President Joe Biden. Mr. Biden had said he would urge Mr. Bennett to find ways “to advance peace and security and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians”. According to a Defence Ministry statement, Mr. Gantz told Mr. Abbas that Israel “seeks to take measures that will strengthen the PA’s economy”. “They also discussed shaping the security and economic situations in the West Bank and in Gaza,” and agreed to “continue communicating further,” it added. A source close to Mr. Bennett said the meeting that he had approved focused on “issues between the defence establishment and the Palestinian Authority”. “There is no peace process with the Palestinians nor will there be,” under Mr. Bennett’s leadership, said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Gantz-Abbas meeting also included the head of the Israeli military branch responsible for civil affairs in the Palestinian territories, Ghasan Alyan, senior PA official Hussein Al Sheikh and Palestinian intelligence chief Majid Faraj. Mr. Gantz’s office said he and Mr. Abbas had held “a one-on-one meeting” after the broader talks. Mr. Al Sheikh confirmed the meeting on Twitter but the PA was not immediately available to comment on its substance. Hamas vs Abbas Mr. Bennett, 49, took office in June as head of an eclectic coalition, in which his hawkish party holds only a handful of seats. He is a long-standing opponent of Palestinian statehood and the former head of a council that lobbies for Jewish settlers in the West Bank, a territory occupied by Israel since 1967. Jewish settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law. Despite Mr. Bennett’s personal views, his government has sought to warm ties with the PA after relations had effectively collapsed under former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who was in power from 2009 until June this year. Mr. Netanyahu, also a pro-settlement right-winger long reviled by Palestinians, further alienated Mr. Abbas through his tight embrace of former U.S. president Donald Trump, who was accused of extreme pro-Israel bias. Palestinian division Mr. Bennett’s government has indicated a desire to boost the PA amid concern over a fresh conflict with Hamas Islamists who control Israeli-blockaded Gaza and are rivals of Mr. Abbas’s secular Fatah movement. An 11-day conflict in May between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza marked the worst hostilities in the area since 2014 and unrest has persisted despite an Egypt-brokered ceasefire. On Monday, an Israeli Border Police soldier shot during border clashes with Gaza nine days ago died of his wounds. Hamas, meanwhile, condemned the Abbas-Gantz meeting, charging that it “deepens Palestinian political division”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/urged-by-us-israels-gantz-holds-talks-with-abbas/article36193817.ece
31 August 2021||New Orleans,||Hurricane Ida pummels Louisiana||Powerful Hurricane Ida battered the southern U.S. State of Louisiana, leaving at least one dead and knocking out power for more than a million people, including the whole of New Orleans. Ida slammed into the Louisiana coast as a Category 4 storm on Sunday, 16 years to the day after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, but had weakened to a tropical storm early Monday. The storm knocked out power for all of New Orleans, with more than a million customers across Louisiana without power, according to outage tracker poweroutage.us. “We have now lost power, citywide! This is the time to continue to remain in your safe places. It isn’t a time to venture out!!,” New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell said on Twitter. Electricity provider Entergy said it was providing back-up power to New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board, which operates the pumping stations used to control flooding. The National Weather Service issued warnings of storm surges and flash floods for several areas, including the town of Jean Lafitte, just south of New Orleans. “Total devastation, catastrophic, our town levees have been overtopped,” Mayor Tim Kerner told ABC-affiliate WGNO. “We have anywhere between 75 to 200 people stranded in Barataria,” after a barge took out the swing bridge to the island. “The winds are still too strong, we can’t put boats in the water to get to them,” he told WGNO. “This is a very dangerous situation. I’ve never seen so much water in my life,” he said. Cynthia Lee Sheng, president of Jefferson Parish covering part of the Greater New Orleans area, said people were sheltering in their attics. “We really believe the calls coming in here to our emergency operations center, is that people are in attics in Lower Lafitte,” she told WGNO. She said the power was out but rescue teams, including the Louisiana National Guard, were ready to help once they can safely get to the area. Several residents of LaPlace, just upstream from New Orleans, posted appeals for help on social media, saying they were trapped by rising flood waters. President Joe Biden, who described Ida as “a life-threatening storm,” declared a major disaster for Louisiana, which gives it access to federal aid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hurricane-ida-pummels-louisiana/article36193821.ece
31 August 2021||Beijing,||Bejing bans written exams for six-year-olds||Beijing on Monday banned written exams for six-and seven-year-olds, as part of sweeping education reforms aimed at relieving pressure on pupils and parents in China’s hyper-competitive school system. China’s exam-oriented system previously required students to take exams from first grade onwards, culminating in the feared university entrance exam at age 18 known as the gaokao, where a single score can determine a child’s life trajectory. “Too frequent exams... which cause students to be overburdened and under huge exam pressure,” have been axed by the Ministry of Education, according to new guidelines released on Monday. The Ministry said the pressure on pupils from a young age “harms their mental and physical health.” Wider reforms The regulations also limit exams in other years of compulsory education to once a term, with mid-term and mock examinations allowed in junior high school. The measures are part of wider government reforms of China’s education sector, which include a crackdown on cram schools — seen by parents as a way to inflate their children’s educational fortunes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/bejing-bans-written-exams-for-six-year-olds/article36193819.ece

31 August 2021||August 31 2021 00:00 IST,||A monetisation move that doesn’t tick most boxes||The Government has launched a National Monetisation Pipeline, or NMP (https://bit.ly/3mLkw9M) to sell public assets or, more precisely, their revenue streams over the next four years. The pipeline mostly includes railway stations, freight corridors, airports, and renovated national highway segments (yielding toll revenue) amounting to Rs. 6-lakh crore, or 3% of GDP in 2020-21. As outlined in the Union Budget, the NMP aims to mobilise resources for financing infrastructure. The other two methods of raising resources are: setting up of a development finance institution (DFI) and raising the share of infrastructure investment in the central and State Budgets. Hard questions The proposed asset sale (monetisation) raises many questions. Conceptually, how is it different from disinvestment and privatisation (D-P) practised for the last three decades? Since D-P proceeds (revenues) have seriously missed the targets almost every year, how believable are the NMP targets? And how are they likely to perform differently? Is the NMP a desperate attempt to shore up public finances, after nearly two years of dismal output growth, stagnant tax-GDP ratio despite the steep rise in taxes on petroleum products? If so, is such a distress (fire) sale desirable to obtain a “fair value” for public assets? Would the market not factor in the dire state of the economy in beating down the prices, as in any distress sale? The NMP differentiates “asset monetisation” from “asset sale” by saying: “Asset Monetisation, as envisaged here, entails a limited period license/lease of an asset, owned by the government or a public authority, to a private sector entity for an upfront or periodic consideration” (NMP, volume 1, page 5). Asset monetisation as defined above is the same as the net present value (NPV) of the future stream of revenue with an implicit interest rate (whether it is a sale or lease of the asset). In a footnote, the NMP document further clarifies: “Sale, i.e. transfer of legal ownership of assets is only envisaged in cases such as disinvestment of stake, etc.”. Again there seems to be conceptual confusion. Sale of minority equity does not lead to a change in managerial control. Hence, the official attempt to differentiate its initiative from the earlier efforts seems feeble and incorrect. Historic missteps The NMP outlines mainly two modes of implementing the monetisation: public-private partnership (PPP) and “structured financing” to tap the stock market. PPP in infrastructure has been a financial disaster in India, as evident from what happened after the economic boom of 2003-08. Surely, India did create world-class airports in Mumbai and Delhi and speeded up highway road reconstruction. However, after the 2008 financial crisis, as the world economy and trade plummeted, and as India’s GDP growth rate slowed down sharply, hurting demand (and revenues for the indebted companies), many PPP projects failed to repay bank loans. Banks were left holding the non-performing assets (NPAs). Further, as the bulk of the lending was to politically connected corporate houses and firms (Bollygarchs as picturesquely described by James Crabtree in his book, The Billionaire Raj ), debt resolution came in the cross-hairs of the political and banking system. India is still reeling from the legacy of that period without any easy and credible solutions in sight. An Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) is being mooted as an alternative means of raising finance from the stock market. In principle, InvIT is much like a mutual fund, whose performance is largely linked to stock prices. It may be worthwhile to jog one’s memory to recall how the disinvestment process began in 1991 after the initiation of economic reforms. It was by “off-loading” bundles of shares of public sector enterprises (PSEs) to the financial institution UTI, which in turn sold the bundles in the booming secondary stock market to realise the best price. The euphoria was short-lived, however, as the market crashed in the wake of the Harshad Mehta scam, stalling and discrediting the disinvestment process for almost the entire decade. Hence, it may be worth learning the lessons from the historical missteps before getting enamoured with the idea all over again by the current stock market boom. As many have apprehended, the currently high stock prices seem like a bubble with heightened uncertainties in the global financial market. With the U.S. Fed committed to reducing its assets purchase programme (known as quantitative easing), the “hot money” inflow that has fuelled Indian stock prices may dry up throwing up nasty surprises. In 2020-21, the economy contracted by 8% due to the pandemic and lockdown, as in the annual report of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The current year is at best likely to regain the pre-pandemic GDP level. Aggregate saving and investment rates (that is, as ratios of GDP) have (expectedly) contracted. The stock market is however booming, dancing to short-term foreign capital inflows, with little connection with the real economy. Given its distressed state, the asset monetisation effort appears nothing short of a fire sale. Other solutions Thus, it seems unwise to anchor the acutely needed investment revival strategy on a discredited PPP model or on fickle Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) investment in a frothy stock market. Instead of assets monetisation, why not monetise debt, with committed borrowing from the market and the central bank? With the financial system flush with liquidity with no takers for bank credit, why not finance the proposed investment — as envisaged in the Budget — by government borrowing. The usual objections against such an idea are three: cost of borrowing, “crowding-out” of private investment, and the inflationary threat. The RBI’s annual report shows the weighted average cost of central government borrowings in 2020-21 was 5.8%. And the inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI-combined) was 6.2%. Thus, with a negative 0.4% real interest rate (real interest rate is nominal interest rate minus inflation rate), domestic borrowing in home currency is a steal. Chances of crowding-out private investments are remote with a liquidity overhang in the market. Inflation risk is also limited with little aggregate demand pressures (barring temporary bottlenecks due to localised lockdowns). The rising public debt to GDP ratio is often red-flagged as a potential risk to rating downgrade by bond rating agencies. If the debt is productively used to expand GDP (the denominator), such risks seem minimal. Moreover, rising external debt by fickle portfolio investors perhaps carries a greater risk to external instability. Foreign portfolio investment has skyrocketed by 6,800% in 2020-21, over the previous year, to $38 billion (as per RBI data released in May). This, perhaps, poses a greater financial hazard than the potential rise in debt monetisation in domestic currency used for productive purposes. In perspective To sum up, the NMP is an ambitious “retail” sale or lease of revenue yielding public capital projects — with the potential threats of allegations of corruption and cronyism derailing the process — to revive investment demand and to halt the economic decline. The main instruments proposed for implementing the NMP are public-private partnerships and a stock market-based investment trust (InvIT). Both have serious shortcomings, as experience demonstrates. The NMP document seems silent on how to overcome past mistakes. Hence, the NMP appears like a fire sale which may not help realise the best social value for public assets to kick-start investment demand. If reviving investment demand quickly is the real goal, debt monetisation seems a better option than asset monetisation. It is a “wholesale” business with lower operating and transaction costs, and at a currently negative interest rate. With excess liquidity in the financial markets, and low aggregate demand, the inflationary threat seems minimal. Such targeted borrowing, if quickly funnelled into infrastructure investment projects, could crowd-in (or bring in) private investment igniting a virtuous cycle of investment-led economic revival. R.

31 August 2021||August 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Still hanging fire on transparency||In a recent judgment, a Supreme Court Bench headed by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman fined eight political parties for being in contempt of the Court’s directions to inform citizens about the criminal antecedents of their candidates. In 2004, 24% of the Members of Parliament had criminal cases pending against them. This figure rose to an alarming 43% after the 2019 general elections. In a bid to address this “malignancy” of criminalisation which could be “fatal to democracy”, the apex court, in a series of judgments, had directed political parties to declare and widely publicise not just the criminal antecedents of candidates, but also inform the electorate why these candidates were found to be more suitable by the party than those without criminal backgrounds. Anticipating that parties would cite ‘winnability’ as the criterion, the Court clarified that the reasons for selection shall be with reference to the qualifications, achievements and merit of the candidate concerned. Despite these clear directives, parties have been defiant. Contempt for right to know This is not the first instance where political parties have shown total contempt for peoples’ right to information. Acting in exemplary unison, after the judgment in Union of India v. ADR (2002), wherein all candidates standing for elections were directed to file an affidavit declaring their educational, financial and criminal backgrounds, political parties amended the Representation of the People Act, 1951, to nullify the disclosure requirements. The Court struck down the amendments. In 2013, the full bench of the Central Information Commission (CIC) declared six national political parties ‘public authorities’ under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005. Parties were required to appoint Public Information Officers and submit themselves to provisions of the transparency law. So strong was the resolve of parties to not share information about their functioning with citizens that immediately a bill was introduced in Parliament to amend the RTI law to exclude political parties from the ambit of the legislation. It was only due to strong public opposition that the amendments were finally dropped. Nevertheless, following the policy of what can only be termed ‘uncivil disobedience’, without obtaining a stay on the Commission’s order from any Court, parties have steadfastly refused to comply with the directive. The electoral bond scheme The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which came to power on the plank of transparency and anti-corruption, has taken resistance against transparency to new frontiers. It introduced the electoral bond scheme in 2018, opening the floodgates of unlimited anonymous funding to political parties by Indian and foreign sources. The Indian political system has traditionally been hostile to the idea of transparency in electoral financing. Political parties have zealously opposed any examination of the linkages between their governments’ policies and decisions and the interests of their major donors. Electoral bonds have dealt a further blow to people’s right to know and consolidated the role of big money in electoral politics. Peoples’ ability to engage with political processes in a democratic manner and track donations by corporates to monitor and blow the whistle on quid pro quo have been seriously undermined. The design of the scheme is such that while citizens and opposition parties have no way of knowing who is donating bonds to which party, it is not difficult for the party in power to access the data. This asymmetry of information in favour of the party in power gives it an undue advantage. It is no surprise that the lion’s share of donations through bonds have been cornered by the BJP. While hearing the challenge to the instrument of electoral bonds, the Supreme Court in 2019 observed that the matter gives “rise to weighty issues which have a tremendous bearing on the sanctity of the electoral process in the country...” Unfortunately, the case has not received the urgent attention it requires and the petition has been languishing for nearly four years. Political parties are at the heart of our democracy. They form governments that make policies which have a profound impact on peoples’ lives. In the legislature, elected representatives make laws that govern us. People, therefore, have a right to know how political parties are functioning — who is funding them and what principles they are keeping in mind while taking policy decisions, supporting or opposing bills in the legislature, or while selecting candidates for various elections. The Court has repeatedly appealed to the conscience of lawmakers to take steps to ensure greater transparency of political parties and prohibit involvement of persons with criminal antecedents in polity. However, in the words of Justices Nariman and B.R. Gavai, “All these appeals have fallen on the deaf ears... The nation continues to wait... Cleansing the polluted stream of politics is obviously not one of the immediate pressing concerns of the legislative branch of government.” Courts must be more proactive It is clear that political parties and their representatives in the legislature have no interest in making themselves answerable to citizens. Keeping in mind the tremendous public interest at stake, perhaps the time has come for the judiciary to play a more proactive role. The Supreme Court needs to urgently hear the electoral bonds matter and the challenge to the refusal of political parties to comply with the CIC’s order. Finally, it needs to examine whether a post facto determination of the violation of its directions regarding publicising criminal antecedents of candidates and imposition of fine of a few lakh rupees is likely to deter parties which declare incomes worth hundreds of crores every year. The judiciary could consider putting in place a mechanism to monitor compliance with its directions prior to all State and general elections and debar candidates who violate its orders. The country can no longer afford courts being passive spectators of the debasement of democracy. Public interest demands that judicial intervention goes beyond appealing to the fictional conscience of our lawmakers.

31 August 2021||August 31 2021 00:00 IST,||India is indeed walking the green talk||Did you know that even at the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (December 2020), India was the only G20 nation compliant with the agreement? Or that the country has been ranked within the top 10 for two years consecutively in the Climate Change Performance Index, released by an independent international organisation that evaluates the performance of countries emitting 90%+ of global greenhouse gases (GHGs)? Or that the Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) scheme is the world’s largest zero-subsidy LED bulb programme for domestic consumers? A world comparison needed Despite these accomplishments, global pressures are intensifying on India to commit more towards the Conference of the Parties (COP26), scheduled for November 2021 in Glasgow. Early this year, the COP26 President, Alok Sharma, and the United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, visited India. In July, the U.S. called out to every significant economy for committing to a meaningful reduction by 2030. That brings us to the question. Is it fair to apply pressure on India to raise its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) committed in the Paris Agreement? We can attempt to answer the question by comparing the achievements of other countries vis-à-vis India’s performance, given that climate change is a global public good and there is a free-rider problem — not much incentive for countries to contribute their fair share since they can enjoy benefits even otherwise. Let us first gather the historical perspective. Examining World Bank data for CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita) over two decades since the Kyoto protocol informs that at the current rate, both China and the U.S. could emit five times more than India in 2030. The U.K.’s emission levels could be more than 1.5 times that of India. Brazil, with its dense forests, may end up at similar levels. On China and the U.S. Among recent efforts, last year, China, the world’s largest GHG emitter, joined the ‘race to zero’ and targets carbon neutrality by 2060. Interestingly, it hopes to peak CO2 emissions by 2030 for bending the emissions curve. The Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific analysis tracking governments’ actions, also expressed its concern stating, “Most worryingly, China remains committed to supporting the coal industry while the rest of the world experiences a decline, and is now home to half of the world’s coal capacity.” Recently, the U.S. rejoined the Paris Agreement and committed to reducing emissions by 50%-52% in 2030 and reaching net-zero emissions economy-wide by 2050. While they re-energise their fight on climate change, legislation may not be straightforward, given the Democrats’ strength in Congress. Such ambitions will also require much more near-term investment than even the U.S. President Joe Biden’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure package. France and Australia The French government, during the novel coronavirus pandemic, set green conditions for bailing out its aviation industry. However, the analysts say that no baseline for reducing emissions from domestic flights was fixed, and it is unclear what measures were adopted to promote rail for domestic travel. An Australian Prime Minister, in 2018, lost his chair on a proposal to address climate change through an emissions-reduction target. The complicated domestic politics prevented them from addressing the problem, despite the country being vulnerable, and stretches of the famous Great Barrier Reef having died in recent years. It was, at least, the third instance  in Australia when climate issues brought down its Prime Minister. It illustrates how difficult it is for governments to develop policies to mitigate climate change. Walking it like talking it In comparison, with all its challenges, India is on track (as reports/documents show) to meet and exceed the NDC commitment to achieve 40% electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based sources by 2030; this share is 38.18% (November 2020). Similarly, against the voluntary declaration for reducing the emission intensity of GDP by 20%-25% by 2020, India has reduced it by 24% between 2005-2016. More importantly, we achieved these targets with around 2% out of the U.S.$100 billion committed to developing nations in Copenhagen (2009), realised by 2015. As part of its mitigation efforts, India is implementing one of the most extensive renewable energy expansion programmes to achieve 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 and 450 GW by 2030. India has also coupled its post-pandemic revival with environmental protection. As part of the fiscal stimulus, the Government announced several green measures, including a $26.5-billion investment in biogas and cleaner fuels, $3.5 billion in incentives for producing efficient solar photovoltaic (PV) and advanced chemistry cell battery, and $780 million towards an afforestation programme. Some activists feel that India needs to demonstrate action at the global level. However, we need to appreciate that among many steps, India provided leadership for setting up the International Solar Alliance, a coalition of solar-resource-rich countries, and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, a partnership of governments, United Nations agencies, multilateral development banks, the private sector, and knowledge institutions. The developed nations could also intensify their pressure especially on jurisdictions not meeting the Paris Agreement goals. At this stage, India can always share independent international assessments, acknowledging that our climate action is among the few compatible with the well-below 2°C warming target. India’s contribution to global emissions is well below its equitable share of the worldwide carbon budget by any equity criterion. To sum up, India has indeed walked the talk. Other countries must deliver on their promises early and demonstrate tangible results ahead of COP26. In any case, we can always suo motu revise the NDC for the first stocktake (2023) while simultaneously protecting our interests. The responsibility of sustaining the entire planet does not rest on a few countries; everyone has to act. Sumant Narain is a civil servant.

31 August 2021||August 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Marital rape: an indignity to women||The High Court of Chhattisgarh recently decided a criminal revision petition challenging the charges framed against the applicant husband. Based on the allegations of his wife, charges were framed by a trial court under Section 376 (rape), Section 377 (carnal intercourse against the order of nature) and Section 498A (cruelty towards wife by husband or his relatives) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The High Court upheld charges under Sections 498A and 377 but discharged the husband under Section 376 on the ground that by virtue of Exception 2 to Section 375 (the definition of rape), sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife (provided she is over the age of 18) would not amount to the offence of rape. Since the High Court was bound by the law, which exempts husbands from being tried or punished for raping their wives by creating the legal fiction that all sex within marriage is consensual, no other conclusion was open to the Court. Notwithstanding this, the discrepancies and failings of Indian criminal law, highlighted by the judgment, deserve scrutiny. Inconsistent provisions First, the marital rape exception is inconsistent with other sexual offences, which make no such exemption for marriage. Thus, a husband may be tried for offences such as sexual harassment, molestation, voyeurism, and forcible disrobing in the same way as any other man. A husband separated from his wife (though not divorced) may even be tried for rape (Section 376B). A husband may be charged and tried for non-consensual penetrative sexual interactions other than penile-vaginal penetration with his wife under Section 377 (prior to the decision of the Supreme Court in Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India , 2018, consent or lack thereof was not relevant to Section 377, but it is now). As a result, penetrative intercourse that is penile-vaginal is protected from criminal prosecution when performed by a husband with his wife, even when done forcibly or without consent. If there is an underlying rationale to this extremely limited exemption, it is not immediately clear. Patriarchal beliefs Second, the marital rape exception is an insult to the constitutional goals of individual autonomy, dignity and of gender equality enshrined in fundamental rights such as Article 21 (the right to life) and Article 14 (the right to equality). In Joseph Shine v. Union of India (2018), the Supreme Court held that the offence of adultery was unconstitutional because it was founded on the principle that a woman is her husband’s property after marriage. The marital rape exception betrays a similar patriarchal belief: that upon marriage, a wife’s right to personal and sexual autonomy, bodily integrity and human dignity are surrendered. Her husband is her sexual master and his right to rape her is legally protected. A commonly cited rationale for preserving the marital rape exemption is that recognising marital rape as a criminal offence would ‘destroy the institution of marriage’. This was the government’s defence in Independent Thought v. Union of India (2017). Rejecting this claim, the Supreme Court astutely observed, “Marriage is not institutional but personal – nothing can destroy the ‘institution’ of marriage except a statute that makes marriage illegal and punishable.” If it is true, however, that criminalising marital rape will destroy the institution of marriage, what does that tell us about this so-called institution? If its very existence depends on husbands’ right to rape their wives, and on the legally sanctioned violation of wives’ sexual autonomy, is this institution worth saving? Does this kind of marriage deserve to be the cornerstone of our society? Surely, we can do better. Another argument frequently raised against the criminalisation of marital rape is that since marriage is a sexual relationship, determining the validity of marital rape allegations would be difficult. Even if we accept, arguendo , that marriage is necessarily a sexual relationship, this argument does not hold water. It is not marriage that creates a problem in adjudication, but the dangerously erroneous belief that consent may simply be assumed from a woman’s clothes, her sexual history, or indeed, her relationship status. While the current law seems to operate under this misconception, marriage does not signify perpetual sexual consent. Therefore, the determination of consent or lack thereof in the context of a sexual interaction within marriage would be the same as in any other context (especially in other ongoing sexual relationships): through physical evidence, through the prosecutrix’s testimony and through the defence of the accused. Underlining subordination It is shocking that Exception 2 to Section 375 of the IPC survives to this day. Antithetical to the liberal and progressive values of our Constitution, and violative of India’s international obligations under instruments such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the provision underlines women’s subordination to men, especially within marriage. In 2017, the Supreme Court, in Independent Thought , had read down the exception so that husbands who raped their minor wives could no longer hide behind it. It is high time adult women are afforded the same protection and dignity in marriage.

31 August 2021||August 31 2021 00:00 IST,||The vaccine’s last-mile problem||COVID-19 exposed and increased the vast inequalities of our world. Now, the effort to vaccinate humanity risks creating the latest front in global inequality. Against a backdrop of vaccine nationalism, debates over intellectual property or technology transfer, fair and equal access to COVID-19 vaccines is at risk. This will cost lives, stifle economies, and push our recovery further out of reach. That vaccines were developed and approved at record speed shows us what we can achieve by working together. Now we need that same spirit of partnerships to vaccinate the whole world. It is a monumental task, whose scale and urgency means we should do all we can to support it. We must urgently share technology and doses, but we must also focus on communities that are most left behind. Which brings me to my point. How do we ensure vaccines get into the arms of the most vulnerable, in hard-to-reach locations, fragile states and conflict zones? Even if doses are in place, paid for, and shipped, what does effective vaccine coverage mean in the mountains of Afghanistan or the Amazon, across the sprawling lands of the Central African Republic or the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or places with predominantly rural and nomadic populations? I raise these questions because running UNOPS — the UN’s infrastructure and procurement agency — has taught me that the last mile matters immensely. From bringing critical drugs to forest dwellers across Southeast Asia and delivering food, to delivering face masks and sanitisers by canoe in Brazil, we know that implementing projects in hard-to-reach areas requires ingenuity and resilience. And when we talk about vaccines with such delicate delivery requirements, the last mile is simply make or break. Logistical issues Cold chain delivery requirements, for example, currently pose a far greater challenge for developing countries. This is due to the combination of poor transport infrastructure, no reliable access to electricity to store the vaccines (even for those that do not require ultra-low temperature storage), and high daylight temperatures. The logistical challenge of getting the vaccines from warehouses to the entire human population is key to the success of this largest vaccine roll-out in our history. But this requires better health systems, supply chains and infrastructure, and strong logistics support. There are many pieces to this puzzle: from distributing the vaccines and managing the cold chain infrastructure needed, to hiring and training vaccinators, communicating clearly with the communities involved, and making sure that the medical waste from this massive vaccination exercise does not fill our lands and oceans and add to our climate emergency. All of these are even more testing in more challenging environments. Long-term benefits We have a moral — not to mention economic — obligation to get this right. But the good news is that this challenging exercise also gives us an opportunity to build more resilient health systems for a better future. If the infrastructure for vaccination clinics is created in a sustainable way, it can serve communities after the pandemic too. From solar water heaters to cold chain facilities and medical waste incinerators, the sustainable solutions offered now can benefit communities in the long-term. Last year, the pandemic revealed not just deadly inequalities, but also key fault lines in health systems, supply chains and logistics. A year on, we owe it to our world to build on the lessons learnt, both to tackle vaccine inequality and to build the foundations for more inclusive, resilient and sustainable health systems across the world. This can be the lasting legacy of the pandemic — a world with better global health infrastructure. We must remember that none of us are safe until all of us are safe. We must make sure we work together on this global final mile and cross the finish line together. If we fail, we cannot be sure how long this mile will last.

31 August 2021||August 31 2021 00:00 IST,||The virtue of consistency||On August 27, Friday, India set a new record for a single day’s vaccination — 10.7 million doses, up from 8.3 million vaccinations on the previous two days and over 6.3 million doses on August 23-24. However, on Saturday, the numbers dropped sharply to 7.9 million; 3.4 million doses were administered on August 29, but Sundays have always registered low numbers. A similar pattern was seen on June 21 — 8.7 million doses on a single day, which dropped to 5.8 million the next day and remained nearly stable at over six million for a week; the number of doses administered fell to three million-four million doses in the first half of July. The June 21 record appeared more to coincide with the day when the revised COVID-19 vaccination strategy came into effect, i.e., the Government procured 75% of the vaccines produced and supplied them to States for free. Though the record on August 27 does not coincide with any occasion, it does suggest that the intent was more to achieve a “momentous feat” of crossing the 10-million mark; the steep fall in vaccinations the very next day gives rise to scepticism. During the pandemic, the focus should not be on setting records but on consistently vaccinating a large number of people daily and ensuring that vaccines are available at all centres every day; uncertainty in vaccine availability does not help in increasing uptake especially among the poor. With vaccination being a safe and sure way to drastically cut the risk of hospitalisation due to severe COVID-19 disease and death, efforts should be to quickly and consistently vaccinate large numbers each day. For this, equitable and a regular supply of a large number of doses to all States is needed. One sure way to increase the number of daily doses is when the Government procures 100% of vaccines produced with no separate allocation to private hospitals. Precious time and doses were wasted between May and July 15 when private hospitals utilised only 7%-9% of vaccines produced against an allotment of 25%. The Government has belatedly revised the June 7 policy such that manufacturers will not set aside 25% of vaccines produced for private hospitals but instead supply as per demand and allot the remaining to the Government. If the rationale for allowing the manufacturers to sell vaccines to private hospitals at a higher price was to fund vaccine research, the small uptake by the private hospitals does not meet that objective. Hence, the Government should procure all the vaccines produced as this will help in better vaccine allotment to States, reduce vaccine inequity and increase uptake, and States can plan daily vaccination strategies in a more organised manner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-virtue-of-consistency/article36193799.ece
31 August 2021||August 31 2021 00:00 IST,||America’s Asia policy||President Joe Biden has found himself in the uncomfortable position of facing not only the expected criticism from Republicans for his country’s hasty, botched exit from Afghanistan but also brickbats from within the Democratic Party and among the broader American public. The killing of at least 13 U.S. troops and dozens of Afghan civilians in the bomb blasts last week underscored the apparent lack of planning behind the withdrawal despite prior knowledge of its approaching deadline. The chaotic, violent scenes at Kabul airport, undergirded by the deep irony of the Taliban’s unchallenged takeover of Kabul and other Afghan territories, have also no doubt stung U.S. policymakers, especially over comparisons to Saigon in 1975. How can Mr. Biden now hope to sell the big picture of Washington’s engagement in the South Asia region to his domestic political constituents in a way that limits the reputational damage to the White House? The first step will be, at long last, to shift the American policy paradigm on Afghanistan from a boilerplate approach toward institution-building to recognising the political complexities of governing a society where tribal and ethnic loyalties supersede western norms of rational decision-making by government. In part, this means not demonising or cutting ties with the Taliban before they have had an opportunity to settle into power and announce intentions for governing Afghanistan. There must also be a recognition of the role that third parties are going to play, for better or worse. That must include everything from the Pakistani ISI’s shadowy dealings through proxies such as the Haqqani Network, China’s relentless push for access to economic projects, and India’s civilisational and ‘soft power’ links. In the big picture, there is an unsettling question for Washington to answer, on whether in persisting with the Trump-era promise to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan, Mr. Biden will be able to reassure Asian allies and partners that the U.S. will not also play a diminished strategic role in the broader Asia region. To an extent, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris’s Singapore and Vietnam trip was aimed at assuaging such concerns and shoring up enthusiasm for the rules-based international order that has taken a beating. Yet, unless Washington follows up such summit meetings with ground-level engagement, for example through the Quad or deeper bilateral initiatives with friendly democracies including India, Asian powers will be hard pressed to assume anything other than Washington’s indifference toward their interests. The danger for the West of considerable blowback that could emerge thus are at least two-fold: first, Afghanistan’s cyclical transitions from western-occupied territory to abandoned nation and ultimately a breeding ground for global terror outfits is well-documented; and second, China will be only too glad to step into the breach should any new spaces be ceded in the pecking order of regional hegemony in Asia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/americas-asia-policy/article36193800.ece

The simple function was held at the mission building in a South Delhi colony, Ananda Niketan, but the Chief of Mission, Mr. K.M. Shehabuddin, in a statement on the occasion laid claim to the High Commission buildings in Chanakyapuri which he described as “hitherto belonging to defunct Pakistan”. He also claimed “Pakistan House”, the official residence of the Pakistan High Commissioner, on Tilak Marg as the rightful property of Bangla Desh. “These palatial buildings like similar missions in other capitals were built by the rulers of Pakistan with the foreign exchange earned by the jute and tea of Bangla Desh and as such none had greater right to them than the people of Bangladesh,” he added. Mr. Shehabuddin explained that in order to avoid embarrassment to the host Government (meaning the Government of India) the Bangla Desh flag was hoisted, not on these two buildings, but on a separate building. Mr. Shehabuddin hoped that India would soon recognise Bangla Desh and its legally constituted government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/banga-desh-diplomatic-mission-opens/article36193807.ece
31 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Bharti’s rights issue to help fuel growth’||Bharti Airtel’s plan to raise up to Rs. 21,000 crore through a rights issue will give the company the fuel to shift to a higher gear and tap large opportunities by accelerating investments in the roll-out of 5G services, fibre, and data centre business, Chairman Sunil Mittal said on Monday. Mr. Mittal said the industry has been urging the government to address some pressing issues “inhibiting” continued investments in the sector and added that the taxes on the industry remain high. “For every Rs. 100 of revenue, Rs. 35 go in various forms of levies. We hope that as we step up and do our part, the government will also favourably look at some of the genuine demands of the industry, enabling a multiplier effect and positive outcome,” Mr. Mittal said in an investor call on the company’s fundraising plans. Bharti “has the opportunity to be the tip of the spear for the new digital economy and take India into the next phase of growth”, he added. “This capital will help improve the leverage position for the company and simultaneously provide the fuel to accelerate investments across several parts of our portfolio to drive for competitive and profitable growth,” Mr. Mittal said. He estimated that the industry’s ARPUs (Average Revenue Per User) would reach Rs. 200 per user per month by the end of the current financial year and eventually move to Rs. 300. ‘Strengthen positioning’ Bharti’s fund raising is expected to strengthen its competitive positioning in the market and provide it the necessary ammunition for an aggressive 5G roll-out, analysts said. While the capital increase announcement was a “surprise”, it strengthens the company’s balance sheet and provides a good buffer to make accelerated investment in a scenario where India transitions to a two-player market, Credit Suisse said in a note. “We think, Airtel is well placed in either of the scenarios: a two private operators sector, or three private operators post industry repair,” Credit Suisse added. Bharti’s board on Sunday approved raising up to Rs. 21,000 crore by offering one share for every 14 equity shares held, at a price of Rs. 535 per share. The promoter and promoter group would collectively subscribe to the full extent of their aggregate rights entitlement and would also subscribe to any unsubscribed shares. Promoter holding stands at about 55.8%. BofA Securities said Bharti’s promoters’ readiness to subscribe to any unsubscribed portion sends “a strong signal”. Bharti shares rose 4.4% on the BSE to close at Rs. 620.35.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/bhartis-rights-issue-to-help-fuel-growth/article36193779.ece

In the last 18 months, there has been a sharp uptick in PC adoption and the trend of families buying multiple PCs has only been gaining momentum quarter on quarter, they said. The pandemic spurred the PC industry out of hibernation and the device has emerged as the ‘most dependable’ and versatile machine suitable for a ‘stay-at-home economy’ to carry out activities across learning, earning, entertaining and playing, industry officials said. “As a result, we are seeing a huge uptick in PC adoption since the pandemic began,” said Nitish Singal, head, Personal Systems (Consumer), HP India. “From one PC per family, the trend is moving to one PC per person. We expect to see growth in all segments of PCs... from education-focused devices... to gaming and high-end premium PCs,” he pointed out. Dell Technologies said PC markets had been witnessing a ‘remarkable’ transition from 2020. After the initial wave, “we saw a new-found dependence on PCs as families started purchasing individual devices for each member,” said Raj Kumar Rishi, VP & MD, Consumers and Small Businesses, Dell Technologies, India. The PC market in India grew 73.1% year-on-year to 3.1 million units in January-March, recording the highest ever first-quarter shipments in the country, according to IDC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/pandemic-spurred-pc-sector-out-of-hibernation-industry/article36193774.ece

For the first time several in months, hiring activity in India is at a pre-pandemic baseline (February 2020 level), the data showed. Job postings for tech software (IT) roles saw a 19% increase between July 2020 and July 2021 as an expected outcome of the pandemic-induced digitisation.

He added that while the relevance of tech jobs continued to be high, renewed demand for retail and food jobs indicated that the consumption economy would play an important role in driving job growth further. “Hygiene has become top priority for both employers and job seekers. What’s curious is the heightened interest for veterinary, therapy, personal care, and childcare jobs.” The easing of lockdown restrictions and the reopening of spaces sharpened the focus on hygiene and sanitisation and the demand for housekeepers, caretakers, and cleaners had grown by 60%, the report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/overall-hiring-returns-to-pre-pandemic-levels/article36193789.ece

31 August 2021||TOKYO,||Sumit spears gold with world record, Avani shoots into history||Debutant Sumit Antil smashed his own world record multiple times for the F64 class gold, while veteran Devendra Jhajharia’s F46 category silver cemented his status of being India’s greatest para-athlete as javelin throwers led the country’s track-and-field medal rush at the Paralympics on Monday. Another javelin thrower Sundar Singh Gurjar picked up bronze in Jhajharia’s event, while discus thrower Yogesh Kathuniya’s F56 silver ensured that India made its presence felt across the podium and through the day. The star of the day was 23-year-old Sumit as he went to the top of the podium with an astonishing throw of 68.55m in his fifth attempt, which was the best of the day by quite a distance and a new world record. “In training, I have thrown 71m, 72m, many times. I don’t know what happened in my competition. One thing is for sure: in future I will throw much better,” said Sumit after the stupendous performance. Bettering records Hailing from Sonepat in Haryana, Sumit bettered the previous world record of 62.88m, also set by him, five times on the day. His series read 66.95, 68.08, 65.27, 66.71, 68.55 and foul. Australian Michal Burian (66.29m) and Sri Lanka’s Dulan Kodithuwakku (65.61m) took silver and bronze respectively. The F64 category is for athletes with a leg amputation, who compete with prosthetics in a standing position. In March this year, Sumit had competed against Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra in the Indian GP Series 3 where he finished seventh with a 66.43m effort. He won a silver in the at the 2019 World Championships in Dubai. Earlier, Devendra clinched silver in the F46 category ahead of compatriot Sundar Singh Gurjar. The 40-year-old, who won gold in the 2004 and 2016 Games, pulled off a new personal best throw of 64.35m for silver. Devendra had bettered his own world record (63.97m) but Sri Lankan Dinesh Priyan Herath Mudiyanselage set a new mark of 67.79m to take the honours. “In sport and competition, these kind of things happen. There are always ups and downs. I did my best and bettered my personal best. But it so happened that it was his (Sri Lankan’s) day,” said Devendra. The 25-year-old Sundar, who lost his left hand in 2015 after a metal sheet fell on him, was third with a best effort of 64.01m. He made it to 2016 Rio Paralympics but was disqualified for reporting late at the call room before the event. The bronze on Monday was nothing short of redemption for him. The F46 classification is for athletes with arm deficiency, impaired muscle power or impaired passive range of movement in arms, with athletes competing in a standing position. The 24-year-old Yogesh sent the disc to a best distance of 44.38m in his sixth and last attempt to clinch the silver in the F56 event. Brazil’s Claudiney Batista dos Santos, the reigning World champion and world record holder, defended his title with a 45.59m. Cuba’s Leonardo Diaz Aldana (43.36m) took bronze. Another Indian, Sandeep Chaudhary, finished fourth. In F56 classification, athletes have full arm and trunk muscle power. Pelvic stability is provided by some to full ability to press the knees together. “Due to lockdown every stadium was closed. I couldn’t have a coach and I am still training without a coach. It was a great moment that I could win silver medal without a coach,” said Yogesh. Shooter Avani Lekhara scripted history on Monday as she became the first Indian woman to win a gold medal at the Paralympics, firing her way to the top of the podium in the R-2 women’s 10m Air Rifle Standing SH1 event here. The 19-year-old from Jaipur, who sustained spinal cord injuries in a car accident in 2012, finished with a world record-equalling total of 249.6, which is also a new Paralympic record. On top of the world “I can’t describe this feeling, I’m feeling like I’m on top of the world. It’s unexplainable,” an elated Avani said. Avani edged out 2016 Rio Games gold-medallist Cuiping Zhangh of China, who clinched the silver medal with a total of 248.9., World No.1 and reigning World champion Iryna Shchetnik of Ukraine took bronze with an effort of 227.5. Appearing in her maiden Paralympics, Avani, ranked fifth in the world, consistently shot 10s in both the competition stages. She was set to obliterate the world record but two 9.9s towards the end cost her the mark. In the qualification round, Avani had finished seventh with a total 621.7. A student of law, Avani made her debut for India in 2017 World Cup in Al Ain, UAE. She will also be competing in the mixed 10m Air Rifle Prone SH1, the women’s 50m Rifle 3 Positions SH1 and the mixed 50m Rifle Prone event. In the SH1 Rifle category, shooters are able to hold a gun with arms. The athletes have an impairment in their legs, for example amputations or paraplegia. They compete either in a seated ot standing positions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sumit-spears-gold-with-world-record-avani-shoots-into-history/article36193908.ece
31 August 2021||Paris,||Messi makes much-awaited PSG debut||Lionel Messi came on as a substitute to make his Paris Saint-Germain debut on Sunday but Kylian Mbappe stole the show by scoring both goals in a 2-0 win against Reims in Ligue 1. Messi, wearing the number 30 jersey, came off the bench in the 66th minute to replace Neymar at the Stade Auguste-Delaune, where fans in the sell-out 21,000 crowd had earlier chanted his name as he emerged to warm up. The six-time Ballon d’Or winner will have to wait for his first goal with his new club, and his first start, which could come when PSG hosts Clermont in its next match on September 11. Pochettino’s take “I’m very happy that he made his debut. It was very important for him,” PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino told broadcaster Amazon Prime after Messi’s low-key first appearance in a PSG shirt. “He is still far away from his best form but he has been training well and he will be fit in the next two weeks, after the international break and, yes, we are waiting for the best from him.” The week leading up to this game had been dominated not by Messi but by talk of Mbappe’s future, with Real Madrid reportedly having two offers for the France World Cup-winning striker rejected. The latest of these offers was understood to be worth €180 million, an astronomical amount for a player whose contract expires at the end of the season and who will be free to negotiate a deal with a new club in January without PSG being able to get a transfer fee. That amount is also equal to what PSG paid Monaco in 2017 to sign Mbappe, who was clearly eager to go out on a high if this was to be his final appearance for the club. With the transfer deadline looming on Tuesday, the 22-year-old did not appear remotely distracted by the talk of a move as he headed in a glorious Angel Di Maria cross in the 15th minute to put the away side in front. Mbappe then scored his second of the night, and third of the season, just after the hour mark, finishing off an inviting low cross to the back post by Achraf Hakimi. Neymar started, making his first appearance of the season, while Di Maria also played in an all-star attack. It is the only team in Ligue 1 with the maximum 12 points after four games.  The result: Reims 0 lost to PSG 2 (Mbappe 15, 63).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/messi-makes-much-awaited-psg-debut/article36194071.ece
31 August 2021||Bengaluru,||Stuart Binny calls time on his cricketing career||Stuart Binny, who holds the best bowling figures for an Indian in ODIs, announced his retirement from all forms of the game on Monday. “I would like to inform you that I have decided to retire from first class and intentional cricket. It has given me tremendous joy and pride to have represented my country at the highest international level,” Binny, 37, said in a statement. The all-rounder featured in six Tests, 14 ODIs and 3 T20Is. Binny’s standout performance came in 2014 when he returned a record-breaking six for four in the second ODI against Bangladesh. Debut Test He shone with the bat on Test debut, against England at Nottingham in 2014, scoring a crucial 78 in the second innings to help India salvage a draw. His last Test came at his home ground M. Chinnaswamy Stadium here in November 2015, in a washed-out game against South Africa. He was part of the India squad for the 2015 ICC ODI World Cup, but didn’t get a game. Binny, the son of former India all-rounder Roger Binny, also enjoyed a fruitful 18-year domestic career. He played 95 First Class, 100 List-A and 150 T20 matches — a bulk of it for a strong Karnataka side. Binny was a part of the Karnataka team which racked up trophies between 2013 and 2015. A powerful and uninhibited stroke-maker, Binny often rescued Karnataka with big knocks in the middle-order. With 148 First Class wickets, Binny was a more-than-useful seamer. Binny also captained Karnataka when regular skipper Vinay Kumar was unavailable. In 2019, Binny signed to play for Nagaland after being ignored by Karnataka selectors. The spotlight Binny entered the spotlight with good performances in the unsanctioned Indian Cricket League (ICL). After two seasons in the ICL (2007-2009), he accepted BCCI’s amnesty offer and returned to the official fold. Binny began his IPL career with Mumbai Indians in 2010. He represented Rajasthan Royals from 2011 to 2015 and 2018-19. He was signed by RCB in 2016 for Rs. 2 crore. RCB released him after the 2017 season. In 2012, he married popular sports anchor Mayanti Langar. A level-2 NCA coach, Binny has expressed an interest in moving to full-time coaching. He thanked the BCCI, Karnataka State, his IPL teams, coaches, selectors, captains, teammates, media, friends and family for their support.

31 August 2021||MUMBAI,||Renowned coach Vasoo Paranjape passes away||Vasudev, alias Vasoo, Paranjape — a former First Class cricketer who mentored numerous greats of the game — passed away at his home here on Friday afternoon after a prolonged illness. Paranjape was 82. Paranjape’s career as a cricketer was restricted to 29 appearance for Mumbai from 1956 to 1970. But it was his great cricketing acumen, ability to mentor cricketers and an uncanny knack to motivate young and veterans alike that elevated him into the stature of one of the greatest guides of the game in Indian cricket. It was apt that his son Jatin — a former India batter and a national selector — titled a book on his father that he co-authored with Anand Vasu as ‘The Cricket Drona — for the love of Vasoo Paranjape’ last year. From Sunil Gavaskar to Rohit Sharma, from Dilip Vengsarkar to Rahul Dravid, from Sachin Tendulkar to Ramesh Powar and from Anil Kumble to W.V. Raman, scores of international cricketers benefited from Paranjape’s timely advice at different junctures in their career. While Gavaskar, who was given the nickname ‘Sunny’ by Paranjape, referred to him in the book as the “conscience keeper” of every cricketer that turned up on the Mumbai maidans. Rohit has narrated how Paranjape was instrumental in Rohit being selected in the Mumbai U-17 squad for the first time. Kumble’s letter to Paranjape as a teenager has also been reproduced in the book. He was the coach of India Under-19 for the inaugural Youth World Cup in 1988, with the squad including the likes of M. Senthilnathan, Pravin Amre, Nayan Mongia, Narendra Hirwani, Venkatapathy Raju and Subroto Banerjee. Besides being a mentor, Paranjape was a cricket romantic and would be ready to be involved in a discussion with cricketers and connoisseurs alike until his health deteriorated over the last few years. Paranjape is survived by wife Lalita, daughter Radhika Shah, son Jatin and their extended families.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/vasoo-paranjape-passes-away/article36194065.ece

The last time he was a member of the squad was against Pakistan in 2019, though he didn’t play any game. “It will be tough against Finland, but our team is capable of a couple of upsets even though playing indoors has its own challenges. Everyone is eager to prove a point,” he said. Fast surface “I love the bounce and fast indoor surfaces and should be comfortable playing there,” he said. “And, it should be interesting to see what kind of speed Finland team has prepared for us,” he said. “But, honestly, I don’t feel any kind of pressure despite not having played a Davis Cup game since 2018 for the simple reason that I have been really training hard,” he said. “The pandemic had messed up my foreign tournament schedule. The Finland match should be useful in getting visas for some other tournaments as well,” he said. Huge honour He has no no idea whether he will be playing singles or doubles, but feels just being in the India squad is a huge honour. “Whatever my role — just serving drinks or cheering the squad — I will be more than happy,” Myneni said.

Raider Pardeep eclipsed the previous record, set in Season 6, when Haryana Steelers acquired the services of Monu Goyat for Rs. 1.51 crore. This was Pardeep’s maiden appearance in a PKL auction, having previously enjoyed a long stint with Patna Pirates. Siddharth Desai, who won the emerging player award in Season 6, was signed by Telugu Titans for Rs. 1.3 crore. It was UP Yoddha which won a tough bidding war for Desai, before Telugu Titans swooped in with the Final Bid Match (FBM) option to retain his services. All-rounder Rohit Gulia was signed by Haryana Steelers for Rs. 83 lakh, making him the costliest player to emerge from the Future Kabaddi Heroes scouting programme. Rahul Chaudhari, who had a forgettable Season 7 with Tamil Thalaivas, was signed by Puneri Paltan for Rs. 40 lakh.  Chaudhari, nicknamed ‘The Showman’ for his flamboyant raids, will be disappointed at the price as he had earned Rs. 94 lakh at Tamil Thalaivas.

But, the Tamil Nadu Athletics Association (TNAA) has not yet got clearance from the State Government despite having sought permission in the first week of August. TNAA secretary C. Latha told The Hindu on Monday, the association was awaiting Government clearance so that it could begin preparations. No spectators “Around 500 athletes will be coming to Chennai. There will be no spectators. We will follow all COVID-19 guidelines. All we want is a concrete answer from the State Government,” said Latha. “Chief Minister M.K. Stalin is very supportive of sports. But stadiums have not been reopened despite schools, beaches and theatres being given the nod. All I am asking is the Government tell us whether we can conduct the Nationals or not. Earlier the response, more the time we’ll have to plan and execute,” said Latha. She argued that when States such as Telangana and Karnataka are hosting events, why not Tamil Nadu. “Telangana is hosting the Open Nationals at Warangal from September 15 to 19 and Karnataka will conduct the State championships sometime next month” she said. Meanwhile, authoritative sources told The Hindu that the State Government was apprised of the matter and stadiums would reopen for events sooner rather than later.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tnaa-awaits-govt-nod-for-u-23-natl/article36194105.ece

Class apart In a field sparkling with international players, Sheikh was a class apart as he did not take more than four chances in clearing any of the eight boards.

31 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Schools reopening: staggered lunch breaks among new rules||To ensure COVID-appropriate measures are followed, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has issued a Standard Operating Procedure for reopening of schools and colleges from September 1. Schools for Classes IX-XII have been permitted to resume. The guidelines include allowing only 50% of students per classroom, thermal screening, staggered entry and exit timings, and staggered lunch breaks. The schools are also mandated to have a quarantine facility on campus to deal with any emergencies. Emotional support The teachers have been asked to provide counselling and emotional support to students. “Teachers are expected to understand the current academic level of their students, establish a deep connection, initiate learning process, bridge the learning gaps to strengthen and recapitulate the foundational subject specific competency of the previous class,” the guidelines stated. The government had said no student would be forced to attend physical classes and the consent of parents is mandatory. The classes would continue in blended mode and students, teachers and non-teaching staff living in containment zones will not be allowed to come to schools and colleges. “Schools and colleges should prepare a timetable as per occupancy limit of classrooms following COVID norms. A maximum 50% students per classroom may be called depending upon capacity. The seating arrangement should be done in such a way that seats are occupied in an alternate manner,” the guidelines said. It added that lunch breaks may also be staggered and preferably be held in open areas. Students should also be advised to not share lunch, books and stationery items, the guidelines added. Schools have also been instructed to thoroughly and regularly sanitise all buildings, and vehicles used for transportation. The management has also been told to ensure proper handwashing arrangements and discourage visits from guests. Apart from the opening of schools, the DDMA said that all other activities allowed and prohibited as per its earlier orders will remain in force till September 16.

31 August 2021||Guwahati,||Two die, 3.63 lakh people hit as Assam flood situation worsens||The flood situation in Assam worsened on Monday, leaving two persons dead and more than 3.63 lakh people in 21 districts affected. According to an update by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), a person each died in Barpeta and Morigaon districts. They drowned after being washed away. Lakhimpur in northeastern Assam was the worst affected district, accounting for 1,30,001 out of a total of 3,63,135 people temporary displaced. The data showed 1,24,776 of the affected people were females and 70,544 children. Crop on 30,333.36 hectares of land and 2,56,144 domesticated animals have also been affected, ASDMA officials said. According to the State Forest Department, two one-horned rhino habitats — the Kaziranga National Park and the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary — have been partially submerged. “About 70% of the park has been inundated and 125 of the 223 anti-poaching camps have been submerged, but the water level has been receding in the last few hours,” Kaziranga Director P. Sivakumar said. On Sunday, the police ordered the rerouting of the goods carriage due to the flooding of Kaziranga and the resultant migration of animals from the park southward to the hills of Karbi Anglong district across the National Highway 715. This was done after Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma reacted to speeding vehicles killing three hog deer that were dashing across the highway to the relative safety of the hills. The Kaziranga floods have so far killed three hog deer. Detour via Bogibeel Heavy commercial vehicles to and from Dibrugarh and Tinsukia districts further east have accordingly been diverted via NH 15 on the northern bank of the Brahmaputra. This would entail a detour via the Bogibeel Bridge near Dibrugarh and Kaliabhomora Bridge near Tezpur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/two-die-363-lakh-people-hit-as-assam-flood-situation-worsens/article36194192.ece
31 August 2021||New Delhi,||Court says probe into riots case appears callous, unproductive||A Delhi court has remarked that investigation into a north-east Delhi riots case, where houses were vandalised and put on fire by a mob in Gokalpuri here, “appears to be highly callous, inefficient and unproductive”. Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav made the remarks while ordering framing of charges against one Rohit, who was allegedly part of the mob that undertook rioting, vandalising and arson in the locality. The case stems from an FIR registered on February 26, 2020 regarding a riotous mob consisting of about 400-500 persons, armed with ‘dandas’ and iron rods blocking the main Gokalpuri Road and thereafter setting on fire some shops and vehicles in the area of Ganga Vihar and A, B, C and D Blocks of Gokalpuri on February 24, 2020. Later, in March 2020, written complaints were received from one Anwar Ali, and his father Ashiq Ali regarding vandalising, looting and putting on fire their houses by the riotous mob on February 24, 2020. One more complaint was received from one Irshad, in which he complained of a riotous mob that vandalised and looted various articles from his house in Gokalpuri and then setting it on fire. All the complaints were clubbed with the first FIR. Rohit, in his defence, argued that he has been falsely implicated by the investigating agency, being resident of the same locality. He also pointed out that there is an “unexplained delay” of about two days in registering FIR, as the alleged incident took place on February 24, 2020. Rohit also argued that he has not been specifically named by any of the complainants in their initial written complaints. He stated that out of the alleged riotous mob of 400-500 persons, only he has been chargesheeted. The court, however, said that it has “ocular evidence” in the form of supplementary statements of complainant Irshad as well as statements of independent public witnesses who have given a categorical account of the incident and role played by Rohit. Police witnesses Additionally, the court said that the presence of the accused at the spot has also been confirmed by police witnesses, who was posted as “beat officers” in the area at the relevant time. “Their statements cannot be brushed aside or discarded at this stage, merely because there has been some delay in recording of their statements or the complainant(s) have not specifically named them in their initial written complaints,” the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/court-says-probe-into-riots-case-appears-callous-unproductive/article36194197.ece
31 August 2021||New Delhi,||Fix timeline for payment of lawyers’ bills, orders HC||The Delhi High Court has stressed that laying down a timeline for payment of bills is extremely crucial for the continued and efficient services of lawyers representing Delhi government. “The entire process of clearing of lawyers’ bills needs to be improved. Timelines are required to be fixed, failing which, the government ought to pay interest on the bills of lawyers,” Justice Prathiba M. Singh said. Officials summoned The High Court directed the Additional Chief Secretary, who is now in-charge of clearing the lawyers’ bills, to appear before it on the next date of hearing to appraise of the steps that needs to be taken. “Further, a senior official from NIC (National Informatics Centre) who is handling or supervising the preparation of the Single Window System shall also appear on the next date,” the court ordered. Sanjay Kumar Aggarwal, Principal Secretary of Department of Law, Delhi government told the court that since clearing the bills of lawyers involves coordination between various departments, the Additional Chief Secretary has now been given the responsibility of coordination. Mr. Aggarwal further submitted that the services of the National Informatics Centre are being availed of by the Delhi government to create a Single Window System for clearance of the lawyers’ bills. Operational hurdles He said that there are two steps which are involved: first, manpower has to be deputed for the software to be prepared on the basis of the inputs given by the various departments and second, the software has to be made operational. He said that the first step of the process could take at least two months and after that, three to four months would be required for making the software operational. “The timelines given by the GNCTD are not satisfactory. In general there is no doubt that insofar as the lawyers’ bills are concerned, they take several months and sometimes years to process the same,” the High Court remarked while listing the case for hearing on September 14.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/fix-timeline-for-payment-of-lawyers-bills-orders-hc/article36194198.ece
31 August 2021||JAIPUR,||Rajasthan schools set to reopen from Sept. 1||The schools in Rajasthan are set to reopen from September 1 for IX to XII classes, with the government issuing a standard operating procedure (SOP), allowing 50% capacity of students and putting restrictions on holding of assembly prayers, sports activities and distribution of cooked mid-day meals. The universities, colleges and coaching institutes will also reopen the same day. A Group of Ministers had recently recommended restarting of academic activities in the State. The SOP requires the teaching and non-teaching staff as well as the drivers of buses, cabs and auto-rickshaws ferrying the students to and from schools to get at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Online education will continue only for the students of I to VIII classes till further orders. The educational institutions were closed during the second wave of pandemic earlier this year when the lockdown was once again brought into force. The heads of institutions have now been asked to ensure compliance with the COVID-19 containment protocol, regular sanitisation of the school premises and keep additional masks in stock for students. Schools in two shifts The principals of both the government and private schools have made arrangements for seating of students to prevent overcrowding and running the institutions in two shifts. According to the SOP, teachers and students will bring food and drinking water from home and eat lunch in their respective classrooms without mingling with others. Sarwat Bano, Principal, Mahatma Gandhi Government School, Adarsh Nagar, Jaipur, said on Monday that the members of the school development and management committee had been apprised of the measures for safety of students at a meeting held last week. “We are well-equipped with foot-operated sanitiser dispenser stands and extra masks for students,” she said. The Podar World School in the State Capital has come up with a ‘Suraksha Chakravyuh’ with five-layer protection, in which all students will be given breaks in interval for yoga and meditation sessions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rajasthan-schools-set-to-reopen-from-sept-1/article36194190.ece
31 August 2021||New Delhi,||Muted Janmashtami celebrations at temples||The police and district officials in south-west Delhi’s Dwarka had to close an ISKCON temple on Monday evening due to overcrowding on the occasion of Janmashtami. “There was a rush of devotees after the evening puja at the ISKCON temple due to which it was closed. However, the priests were allowed to continue the special programmes of Janmashtami without visitors,” a police officer said. The Sub-Divisional Magistrate was not immediately available for comments. Temples in the city were reopened in mid-June under a phased unlock process, but visitors are not allowed as per a Delhi Disaster Management Authority order. Most temples in the city scaled down Janmashtami celebrations. Many religious places, including tKalkaji temple, Chhatarpur temple and Birla Mandir, scaled down programmes and decorations, focusing only on the rituals that mark the birth of Lord Krishna. Decoration and lighting at the Kalkaji temple are not very different from pre-pandemic times, but Surendra Nath, the chief priest of the temple, said the lack of devotees completely alters the spirit of the festival. “We urge the government to allow temples to open to the public, especially when everything else in the city has reopened,” he said. The rituals at the temple that used to host thousands of visitors will only be attended by the priests. Chhatarpur temple, which used to witness a footfall of as many as two lakh people during the festival, celebrated Janmashtami in the presence of a handful of individuals, including the temple trustees and priests. Livestreaming rituals To ensure that the devotees do not miss out on the celebrations, the Birla Mandir decided to livestream the rituals that began at noon on Monday and will continue till 2 a.m. on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/iskcon-temple-closed-following-crowding/article36194206.ece

31 August 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Odisha monsoon session likely to be a stormy affair||The monsoon session of Odisha Assembly commencing from September 1 is likely to be stormy with two senior Ministers in the Naveen Patnaik Government embroiled in different controversies. While Odisha Law Minister Pratap Kumar Jena would be probed in case of murder of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader in Cuttack district, the State Cooperation Minister Ranendra Pratap Swain is drawing a lot of flaks following allegations of financial mismanagement and irregularities in Cuttack Central Cooperative Bank. Birendra Pratap Swain, Minister’s brother, is the president of the Cuttack Central Cooperative Bank. Fresh probe ordered Last week, Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC), Salipur, ordered a fresh probe against Mr. Jena after hearing a petition regarding dropping of Minister’s name in the chargesheet. Kulamani Baral, former chairperson of Mahanga block of Cuttack and BJP leader, and his associate Dibyasingh Baral were hacked to death while they were returning to their village in January this year. Ramakant Baral, son of deceased Kulamani Baral, had filed case in Mahanga Police Station against 13 persons including the Minister, alleging their involvement in the murder. He had moved the court alleging that the investigating officer had not examined material witnesses and wrongly recorded the statement of witness under section 161 of CrPC in order to shield the Minister. The BJP had already staged demonstrations against Mr. Jena, demanding his sacking. Similarly, farmers across different districts have been protesting against siphoning off funds in Cuttack Central Cooperative Bank. They alleged that Mr. Swain’s continuance as Cooperation Minister became untenable in wake of his brother’s alleged involvement in financial irregularities in the bank.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/odisha-monsoon-session-likely-to-be-a-stormy-affair/article36194188.ece

31 August 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi to implent new plan to combat climate change by year end, say officials||Delhi will start implementing a new 10-year action plan by this year end to combat climate change, according to officials. The Centre had prepared the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in 2009 and asked the states to prepare their own specific plans. However, Delhi submitted its plan to combat climate change in 2019, becoming the last state to do so. “The plan remained mostly on paper and could not be implemented properly. It expired in 2020. Now, we are due for a new plan,” a senior official of the environment department said. The previous plan focused on six areas, including energy, transport, green cover and urban development, and projected a significant decrease in cold days and nights and increase in heavy rainfall events in Delhi. For the new plan, a German agency is likely to be engaged as a knowledge partner. The environment department has requested the Union Environment Ministry to release Rs. 20 lakh for the preparation of the plan. All extreme weather events of the last 10 years are being analysed to prepare a comprehensive plan which will focus on air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy, transport issues, air conditioning, heat islands, agriculture patterns, etc., the official said.

31 August 2021||August 31 2021 00:00 IST,||2021’s bride wants more||Two weeks ago, stylist Rhea Kapoor tied the knot dressed in an ivory Anamika Khanna chanderi sari with a vintage pearl veil from Birdhichand Ghanshyamdas. For the intimate ceremony held in her living room, she paired the muted outfit with a pronounced winged eyeliner and jewellery from her mother’s collection, balancing her bohemian and traditional sides. It got me curious about how, after the long wait, post-pandemic brides are getting ready for their big day. Are they keeping it low-key? Or are they injecting some fun into the gloom and going large? When I ask Khanna, who is readying for her digital showcase at the ongoing India Couture Week (ICW), she shares that there is an interesting bridal dichotomy. “A section of brides have simplified everything for themselves and their families, and have accepted the fact that the world has changed. For instance, Rhea wanted to go with ivory mulmul and I respect that,” she says. “But then there’s a category that is not affected and still wants to be the dream bride,” says Khanna, As I look at the creations displayedat ICW, I find that many of the designers — coming out of multiple lockdowns and facing a new festive season — are courting the latter, letting their creative freak flag fly high. Couturier Manish Malhotra tried to capture that sentiment in his opening show. “Brides are understandably emotional, but they also want to have fun. I’ve tried to convey these emotions in my bridal edit ‘Nooraniyat’, featuring actor Kriti Sanon [in an ornate lehenga with statement-making zardozi embroidery],” says Malhotra, who also made sure he checked the inclusivity boxes by including plus-size models and casting former super model Noyonika Chatterjee to bring in ‘age-less’ style. (At his store, plus sizing is addressed through customisation of each outfit.) The designer has been dressing a panoply of brides in Jaipur, Mumbai and Delhi, and calls the 2021 woman the ‘opulent bride’. “Today’s bride wants to go all out; she’s living that moment even if it is with just 50 people. And she wants a mix of tradition and modernity: like pretty veils and a bit of glitz for the sangeet and reception.”  Customisation for the win  Interestingly, preferences are leaning towards a heightened level of customisation. The brides are also bringing stylists on board for trousseau shopping. “Will this lehenga skirt look good on me? Do I need a gown with a longer floor-sweeping trail? I see the post-pandemic bride getting very specific about her bespoke requirements,” says designer Shane Peacock, remarking on how “most brides who approach us have a stylist with them, who helps them make that personalised choice”. While last season, the duo Falguni and Shane had an array of stylists depicting the backstage drama in their couture digital showcase, this season, they’ve let their ‘more is more’ aesthetic take centrestage. “Besides our signature FSP silvers, golds and pinks, we’ve brightened the gloomy mood a bit by inculcating pop hues like bubblegum, pinkish red, and turquoise,” he adds. Revengespending is definitely on the rise. While designers haven’t revealed any numbers in India, according to news reports, many of their international stores and pop-ups have been fully booked of late. Monica Shah, co-founder of brand Jade by Monica and Karishma, revealed to Mint Lounge that when they launched in Los Angeles in April, the opening weekend alone had “about 40 bridal appointments”, while Anita Dongre shared that appointments at her New York store have been full since March. And now, with destination weddings picking up again, people are shopping with a vengeance. Designers Pankaj & Nidhi — who made their couture foray last season with an edited take on evening glamour — is focussing on wearability and weightlessness, with the travelling brides in mind. “We have an extra lehenga panel coming into play, which can be turned out faster for a last-minute couture request,” says Pankaj. “In terms of texturisation, we’ve scaled our core narrative to another level and made the textures more defined [metallicising their signature appliqué work, for example].” Individuality is also big now. According to Gaurav Gupta, the pandemic has catalysed individualistic dressing and “the bride now wants to make an even bigger statement — be it in terms of colour, shape, form or embroidery. While she picks a lightweight lehenga for her engagement, she’ll opt for a larger-than-life, sculpted gown for her sangeet- cocktail. Everything has become more glamorous, more dramatic, but with a sustainable heart”. The designer, who’s always initiated a cultural dialogue with each outing, exploring all sides of love, has titled his latest collection ‘Universal Love’. The showcase featured gay models, lesbian couples, plus-size models and even battled ageism by focussing on mature love.
