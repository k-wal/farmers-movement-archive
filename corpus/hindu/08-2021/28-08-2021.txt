28 August 2021||New Delhi,||Baghel hangs on, but no clarity after talks||No clear announcement on the leadership question in Chhattisgarh was forthcoming at the end of a nearly four-hour discussion Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel had with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday, but the Baghel camp appears confident that he has survived for now. Congress general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal and the party’s State in-charge, P.L. Punia, were present at the meeting. Mr. Baghel told presspersons after the meeting that on his invitation, Mr. Gandhi had agreed to visit Chhattisgarh to see the progress made by his government on various fronts. Rotating term He ducked questions on the reported assurance Mr. Gandhi had given to State Health Minister T.S. Singh Deo that the Chief Minister’s term will be shared between Mr. Baghel and him. The incumbent claimed that this issue was clarified three days ago by Mr. Punia after meeting Mr. Gandhi on Tuesday. “Our State in-charge P.L. Punia has clarified the position on this issue. Once he has spoken, what else can I say,” Mr. Baghel said. Mr. Punia had said a change of leadership in the State was not discussed. Mr. Baghel said that during the meeting, political and administrative issues of the State were discussed. “At the end of the meeting, I requested Mr. Gandhi to visit the State to see our work and he gladly accepted the invitation. He will be coming next week,” Mr. Baghel said. Asked if he would continue as the Chief Minister, Mr. Baghel said he had invited Mr. Gandhi in his position as the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh. The imperative of realpolitik is weighing in favour of Mr. Baghel who, sources said, has managed to impress upon the Gandhi siblings that continuing with him is key to the party’s survival in the State. Sources said Ms. Vadra could not attend Tuesday’s meeting as she was not in Delhi, and Mr. Baghel was asked to return to the capital for another round in her presence. While Mr. Gandhi is bound by his reported promise to Mr. Deo, Ms. Vadra, senior leaders say, wants Mr. Baghel to continue. As Mr. Baghel is the party’s leading face of the Other Backward Classes community, she feels a change in leadership just ahead of the election in Uttar Pradesh, where each party is pursuing the backward vote, will send the wrong message. Within the State too, where OBCs make up the biggest group, the BJP is looking for a credible backward face ahead of the 2023 election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/baghel-hangs-on-but-no-clarity-after-talks/article36147201.ece
28 August 2021||YADGIR,||18, including 11 students, injured as pick-up vehicle hits car||In a road accident, at least 18 persons, including 11 students, were injured near Budur village in Gurmitkal taluk of Yadgir district on Friday. According to the police, the 18 persons were travelling in a goods pick-up vehicle when it collided with a car and overturned a few feet from the spot of collision. All 18 persons in the pick-up vehicle were injured. Of the injured, five, including four students, suffered major injuries. Thus, they were referred to Raichur for medical treatment. “The driver of the pick-up vehicle was driving in a rash and negligent manner when he hit the car which was coming to Gurmitkal from Yadgir.

28 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre to ease path for monetisation||Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will soon chair a meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) to nudge financial regulators to relax and harmonise investment norms for instruments such as Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) to be used to monetise public assets such as highways, gas pipelines and railway tracks. The meeting of the council entrusted with enhancing coordination among financial sector regulators — RBI, SEBI, IRDA and PFRDA — assumes significance after the government unveiled the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), listing assets across sectors that are to be monetised for an estimated Rs. 5.96 lakh crore over four years. With the economy still not out of the woods from the COVID-19 pandemic, and Ms. Sitharaman urging industry to look beyond banks and tap the markets for their financing needs, steps to ease access and encourage investments in the corporate bond market are also expected to be discussed by the FSDC. “An FSDC meeting has been planned for some time, and it will be convened very soon,” a top Finance Ministry official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-to-ease-path-for-monetisation/article36147203.ece
28 August 2021||Mumbai,||State local body polls only after OBC quota is restored||An all-party meeting on Friday unanimously agreed not to hold elections till the reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in local civic bodies in Maharashtra is restored. “All parties are unanimous on the demand that political reservation for OBCs must be restored in local civic bodies. It is a general consensus to not hold polls until the reservation is restored. We have received suggestions on what can be done, and based on that a final all-party meeting will be held next Friday,” said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. The Supreme Court had scrapped the political reservation for OBCs observing that the total reservation was crossing the 50% mark. Since then, political parties and OBC organisations in the State have been demanding its restoration. By-polls have also been postponed following demands from Ministers in the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress. Review petitions filed by the State government have been dismissed by the apex court. “Reservation in 20 districts of the State has not been affected. There will be some modifications in the rest of the districts. Our next meeting is scheduled for Friday and we are all in agreement that the reservation must continue,” said Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole. Senior Minister and OBC leader Chhagan Bhujbal said that the government was trying to acquire empirical data on OBCs. “Going above 50% mark would also mean presenting the case in front of the court. We have to decide on that. If we remain inside the limit, then reservation will continue but OBC seats in some places may come down,” he said. Former chief minister and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Devendra Fadnavis said the government had set up backward class commission which should focus on collecting empirical data. “Quantification can be done on the basis of samples, for which census is not required,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/maharashtra-local-body-polls-only-after-obc-quota-is-restored/article36147643.ece
28 August 2021||MANGALURU,||Support for university status for College of Fisheries||The demand by fishermen to upgrade the College of Fisheries, Mangaluru, as a fisheries sciences university received a shot in the arm with the council of the Mangaluru City Corporation passing a resolution on Friday seeking university status for it. An agenda moved by the member of the council Bharat Kumar S. in the monthly meeting of the council received unanimous support. The council, which supported the demand, agreed to request the government for grant of university status to the college. The agenda tabled in the council mentioned that the college established in Yekkur in 1969 was the first of its kind in South East Asia. Initially, the college was affiliated to the University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS), Bengaluru. It was brought under the Bidar-based Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University (KVAFS) in 2005. Both the universities have not given due importance and priority to the college. Hence, there is a need to grant university status for the college. Skill training The agenda said that fisheries is a major profession in the coastal belt. The sector required continuous guidance and technical support. If a university is set up, it can impart skill training to fishermen and it will help boost their economy. Having a fisheries university will also be a pride for Mangaluru. The formation of the university will help impart various skills to fishermen, get reservation facility in admission to various courses and guide fishermen to uplift themselves socially and economically. Meanwhile, on November 11, 2020, chairman of Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation and president of Mangaluru Trawl Boat Fishermen’s Association Nitin Kumar and other stakeholders wrote to then Minister for Fisheries, Ports and Inland Transport Kota Srinivas Poojary to prevail upon the government to declare the over-a-half century-old College of Fisheries as a fisheries university. They urged the government to declare the formation of the university on World Fishermen’s Day on November 21 itself. In a renewed appeal this July, the fishermen urged the government to grant university status to the college. They had also launched a signature campaign.  An agenda tabled by a member of the council Bharat Kumar S. in the monthly meeting received unanimous support from the House Initially, the college was affiliated to UAS Bengaluru and was brought under the Bidar-based Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University in 2005||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/support-for-university-status-for-college-of-fisheries/article36147682.ece
28 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||DCC chiefs: emphasis on merit over groups||The All India Congress Committee (AICC) is reportedly on the cusp of naming the new District Congress Committee (DCC) presidents in Kerala. It hopes to single out Congress workers who could broaden the party’s appeal in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections in 2024. Another stated goal of the AICC is to release the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) from the vice of group politics by giving more weight to merit in the selection. The consultations that preceded the finalising of the DCC president list had revealed a low key but intense battle for organisational control. Vetting process The vetting process saw the traditional ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups fighting to preserve their relevance in the face of an emergent axis of power allegedly led by AICC organising secretary K.C. Venugopal, KPCC president K.Sudhakaran and Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan. A Congress insider said the AICC felt that group loyalties had recurrently taken precedence over merit in the KPCC. Aggressive group politics had proved detrimental to the party electorally. The DCC presidents’ list pending approval of the AICC was an attempt to accommodate caste, communal, regional and group interests to some measure under the KPCC's ‘expansive tent,’ he said. Different versions of the final list have appeared in some sections of the media. However, the KPCC has not endorsed any. It has left the task to the AICC. The final list will have the imprimatur of Congress president Sonia Gandhi. The AICC's announcement could usher in some degree of unity in the conventionally fractious party. However, the peace could be fragile. Sharp differences over the nomination of DCC presidents remained. Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala, who heads the ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups respectively, have complained that the KPCC had kept them out of the nomination process. Anonymous posters Anonymous posters had appeared against Mr. Satheesan, Shashi Tharoor, Mr. Sudhakaran and Mr. Venugopal in various parts of the State for ‘ignoring senior leaders.’ Ending group politics might be an illusory goal for the KPCC, given the growing fissures in the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dcc-chiefs-emphasis-on-merit-over-groups/article36147565.ece
28 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||Deepar Beel breathes easy after eco-sensitive tag||On August 25, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change notified the eco-sensitive zone of Deepar Beel Wildlife Sanctuary on the southwestern edge of Guwahati. Romila Boro, a sexagenarian resident of Chakardeo, the sanctuary’s “guardian village”, hopes the notification will bail the constricted wetlands out. But she is sad that the “good news” came eight years too late. It was in 2014 that her husband Koliya Boro was run over by a train while trying to stop it to prevent hitting an approaching herd of elephants. He was one of the earliest conservationists of the area. “The zonation should help, but Deepar Beel’s water has become toxic and lost many of its aquatic plants that elephants would feed on. The wetlands can breathe easier only if the railway track is diverted,” said Chakardeo’s dairy farmer and green guard Pramod Kalita. Deepar Beel is one of the largest freshwater lakes in Assam and the State’s only Ramsar Site, besides being an Important Bird Area. The wetlands have for decades been threatened by a railway track — set to be doubled and electrified — on its southern rim, a garbage dump and encroachment for human habitation and commercial units. The wetlands expand up to 30 sq. km in summer and reduces to about 10 sq. km in winter. The wildlife sanctuary measures 4.1 sq. km within this wetland. The notification specified an area “to an extent varying from 294 metres to 16.32 km” as the eco-sensitive zone with the total area being 148.9767 sq. km.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/deepar-beel-breathes-easy-after-eco-sensitive-zone-notification/article36147199.ece
28 August 2021||CHENNAI,||Poor laying of roads: action initiated against officials||The Tamil Nadu government has identified poor laying of road infrastructure in nine of the 25 sites surveyed and has placed officials concerned under suspension. Tenders for those projects have been cancelled and departmental action has been initiated against officials, Minister for Highways E.V. Velu announced in the Assembly on Friday. Mr. Velu was responding to concerns raised by VCK legislator S.S. Balaji (Thiruporur), who said the quality of some roads was quite poor, and had sought action. Mr. Velu said the Highways Department had identified 25 sites for surveying on the advice of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, and in nine of them, it was found that the road infrastructure was poorly laid. The Chief Minister alerted him as early as 6 a.m. after watching a news report about people protesting against a poorly laid road in Sivaganga district, he said. Roads were poorly laid in Tiruvannamalai and Tiruchi too and officials concerned have been placed under suspension and departmental action has been initiated against them, Mr. Velu added. During another debate, Mr. Velu said the erstwhile DMK regime [2006-11] implemented phase I of the Chennai Outer Ring Road project at an estimated cost of Rs. 1,081 crore and phase II, by the subsequent AIADMK government, at an estimated cost of Rs. 1,075 crore. Though both phase I and II were almost of the same length (29 km and 30 km), under the agreement signed by the DMK government, the government had to pay only Rs. 63.13 crore once in six months to the contractor for phase I, but under the agreement signed by the AIADMK government for phase II, the sum payable to the contractor was Rs. 119.97 crore once in six months, he pointed out. Rs. 1,886-crore loss The difference has resulted in a “loss of about Rs. 1,886 crore to the State exchequer,” Mr. Velu contended and added that the DMK government was always careful about spending funds collected from the people as taxes. Countering the charge, Leader of the Opposition Edappadi K. Palaniswami said the difference was because the State government spent about Rs. 300 crore in phase I, but for phase II, the AIADMK government paid only about Rs. 196 crore. Unconvinced, Mr. Velu said a difference of only about Rs. 100 crore in investment should not have resulted in a loss of about Rs. 1,886 crore to the State exchequer in the long run.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/poor-laying-of-roads-action-initiated-against-officials/article36147350.ece
28 August 2021||CHENNAI,||Police can conduct further probe in Kodanad case||The Madras High Court on Friday ruled that personnel attached to Shulurmattam police station in the Nilgiris district could conduct further investigation into the 2017 Kodanad estate heist-cum-murder case. Justice M. Nirmal Kumar dismissed a petition filed by prosecution witness ‘Anubhav’ Ravi alias N. Ravi of the AIADMK’s Amma Makkal Peravai in Coimbatore against the conduct of further investigation. The judge said the police were fully empowered to conduct further investigation under Section 173(8) of the Cr.P.C., even after the filing of a charge sheet and commencement of trial. Quoting from a Supreme Court ruling, the judge said though further investigation might delay the trial, the ultimate object was to arrive at the truth. “In this case, the murder took place in Kodanad Estate and it has been followed by a series of suspicious deaths. Whatever materials are collected, it is ultimately for the court concerned to decide the acceptability or otherwise of the same.,” Justice Kumar wrote. Present petitioner was neither a de facto complainant nor a victim or an accused. He was only a witness in this case and he could not have any say in the manner of investigation or trial in the case. He agreed with Advocate-General R. Shunmugasundaram that the law did not mandate obtaining permission of the trial court before conducting further investigation. It was sufficient if the police intimated the court about its decision to conduct further investigation. In the Kodanad case, such information had been provided, the judge concluded. Kodanad Estate was owned jointly by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and her close aide V.K. Sasikala. The heist took place when Edappadi K. Palaniswami was the CM. In the course of the burglary, the accused hacked a watchman, Om Bahadur, to death.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/police-can-conduct-further-probe-in-kodanad-case/article36147373.ece
28 August 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Sidhu says there’s no point in becoming a showpiece||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday sought freedom to take decisions, saying he had conveyed it to the ‘high command’ that if he is able to live up to people’s expectations, he could secure the party’s prosperity in the next 20 years and if he is not allowed to take decisions, then he shall smash it out as well. Mr. Sidhu, who was addressing a gathering in Amritsar, said, “I have always worked towards changing the life of people, and even today I a m working towards developing a Punjab model. I have told the high command that if I am able to live up to the expectations and hope of people surrounding the model, I assure you that I will not let Congress go and it will prosper for the next 20 years, but if you won’t let me take decisions, then I’ll [‘ itt naal itt bi kharkaonga ’] smash it out... there’s no point in becoming a ‘ darshni horse’ [showpiece]...” Advisers’ statements Mr. Sidhu’s remark comes against the backdrop of him being asked by the party’s senior leadership to sack his advisers who made controversial statements surrounding Pakistan and Kashmir. One of them, Malwinder Singh Mali, on Friday announced that he was quitting the post. In a post on his Facebook page, he said, “I humbly submit that I withdraw my consent given for tendering suggestions to Navjot Singh Sidhu.” Amid the ongoing power tussle between Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and Mr. Sidhu, the former had taken strong exception to the remarks of the latter’s advisers on sensitive national issues of Kashmir and Pakistan. He had urged Mr. Sidhu to rein in the advisers — Pyare Lal Garg and Mr. Mali — stating that their ill-conceived comments were potentially dangerous to the peace and stability of the State and the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-point-in-becoming-a-showpiece-says-sidhu/article36147410.ece

28 August 2021||CHENNAI,||State lays out plans for Sri Lankan Tamils||Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Friday announced schemes, costing Rs. 317.4 crore, for Sri Lankan Tamils living in camps in the State. In a suo motu statement in the Assembly, he said that as their houses were in a bad shape, the State would build 7,469 houses at a cost of Rs. 231.54 crore. In the first phase, 3,520 houses, costing Rs. 108.81 crore, would be built this year. Basic amenities, including electricity, toilets and drinking water supply, would be provided at a cost of Rs. 30 crore. The government is expected to launch a scheme to improve the living standards of the Sri Lankan Tamils with an allocation of Rs. 5 crore. A total of 3,04,269 Tamils have come to the State as refugees since 1983, and 58,822 have been living in 108 camps in 29 districts. A total of 34,087 persons are living outside the camps. The Chief Minister said the government would fully meet the higher educational and hostel expenses of 50 engineering students living in camps based on their marks. It would also meet the educational and hostel fees of the first five students of agriculture and agriculture engineering courses and all postgraduate students. The government would allot Rs. 1 crore every year for the purpose. Mr. Stalin said that every year around 750 students from the camps joined arts and science colleges and diploma courses, and the scholarship given to them was inadequate. He said the scholarship for polytechnic students would go up from Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 10,000, the scholarship for undergraduate students of arts and science colleges would be increased from Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 12,000 and the scholarship for undergraduate students of professional courses from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 20,000. The government would allot Rs. 1.25 crore to meet the expenditure. The Chief Minister also announced an employment skill development programme for 5,000 youths in the camps at a cost of Rs. 10 crore. Under another initiative, Rs. 25,000 each would be given to 300 self-help groups (SHGs) in the camps to improve their livelihood and launch small and medium industries. Moreover, 321 SHGs selected last year would get Rs. 75,000, besides the Rs. 50,000 already allotted. Mr. Stalin said the monthly dole to the head of the family in camps would be increased to Rs. 1,500 from Rs. 1,000. For other seniors, it would be increased to Rs. 1,000 from Rs. 750, and for the children it would go up to Rs. 500 from Rs. 400. The scheme would cost the government an additional Rs. 21.49 crore. The Chief Minister said that as the kerosene allocation to the families in the camps was inadequate and they were not in a position to get gas connections under the Prime Minister Ujjwala Yojana, the State would give each family free LPG connections and stoves. It would cost the government Rs. 7 crore and the families would get Rs. 400 in subsidy for five cylinders. The government would allot Rs. 3.80 crore every year for the purpose.

28 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi to open schools for Classes IX-XII from Sept. 1||Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Friday said the government has taken a decision to open all schools for students of Classes IX-XII, universities and coaching centres from September 1. Students will need written permission from their parents to return to educational institutions. Attendance will not be compulsory as classes will continue in the “blended” mode — online and offline classes. The decision was taken by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority after a joint committee submitted a report suggesting reopening of schools for all classes in three phases. Mr. Sisodia, however, said no decision has been taken regarding reopening of schools for students below Class IX. “There has been massive loss of learning in the last 1.5 years. Online education cannot replace physical education,” said Mr. Sisodia. Schools have been directed to draw up timetables to ensure no overcrowding in classes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delhi-to-open-schools-for-classes-ix-xii-from-sept-1/article36147415.ece

After taking photographs and visiting the temple, the students went down to the pond at the foothills around 6 p.m., where they were stopped by the five-member group. On learning that the students belonged to different religions, the group questioned them about the purpose of their visit to the hill. After a complaint by a girl student, the police registered a case against the five-member group under Section 341 (wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code.

28 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||5 killed, trucks set ablaze by suspected extremists in Assam||Five persons were killed and seven trucks were set on fire by suspected extremists at Umrangso in Dima Hasao district in central Assam late on Thursday. The district police said a group of men stopped the trucks between 8.30 p.m. and 9 p.m. and fired several volleys at them from automatic rifles. Six trucks were loaded with cement bags and one was carrying coal. “The group fired at them for a few minutes. The five killed are drivers and handymen of the trucks,” Superintendent of Police, Dima Hasao, Jayant Singh said. Three others were injured, while seven drivers and helpers managed to escape, the police said. Members of the Dimasa National Liberation Front (DNLA) are suspected to be behind the attack, the first such attack since May 14 when two were killed in a grenade blast in Digboi in eastern Assam. Refusal to pay ‘tax’ The DNLA is believed to have targeted these trucks linked to a cement factory that had refused to pay “tax” to the outfit. Formed in April 2019 to seek an independent nation for the Dimasa community, the DNLA became active towards the end of 2020. It came on the radar of the security forces on January 12 following the arrest of a member in Dima Hasao’s Maibang. On January 27, the outfit killed Amit Nunisa, a social activist and former leader of the disbanded Dima Halam Daogah, and on March 2, a member of the DNLA was caught with a Chinese grenade near a strategic railway station in Karbi Anglong district. Killing of Black Dimasa The DNLA received its first setback on March 28 when its leader, Black Dimasa, was killed in an encounter. On May 23, security forces gunned down six of its members in the adjoining Karbi Anglong district. The trigger for an intensified operation leading to the May 23 encounter was the May 19 killing of a priest named Sanjay Ronghang by the DNLA. Intelligence officials say the DNLA is being propped up by the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland as a front to carry out extortion in Assam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/5-killed-trucks-set-ablaze-by-suspected-extremists-in-assam/article36146942.ece
28 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Afghan situation uncertain, says India||There was no clarity on ‘any entity’ forming a government in Afghanistan, official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Arindam Bagchi said here on Friday. Addressing a press conference, he observed that India was waiting to see how inclusive would be the next government in Kabul. The situation on the ground was “uncertain”, he noted. “Currently, there is no clarity on any entity forming a government in Kabul. There has been a lot of stories going around about who will be represented in the government and whether the government will be inclusive, which is another question, and whether other elements of the Afghan polity will be represented in that,” he stated. Explaining that India was aware of the dialogue currently under way on government formation in Kabul, he said that the issue of recognition of the Taliban amounted to “jumping the gun” in view of the “fluid situation”. “We are monitoring the situation and are in touch with partner countries,” he stressed. Airlift failure Mr. Bagchi’s statement came a day after India failed to airlift at least 160 Hindu and Sikh Afghans because of the chaotic conditions in the Afghan capital, where the Taliban has declared that it will not allow any further evacuation of Afghan nationals. Officials here said India had not “paused” evacuation and would carry out airlifts at the right moment. The evacuees were at a safe place in Kabul and not harmed by the blasts that took place at the airport. India would continue to raise the issue of terrorism in the United Nations. It was “observing” the situation. Its current concern revolved around the safety and security of those in Afghanistan. Explaining India’s visa policy towards Afghans seeking refuge, Mr. Bagchi pointed out that the “e-emergency” visa was now open for the Afghans who have been supportive of bilateral relationship between India and Afghanistan. “They are currently coming here under the six-month visa regime and we will take it from here. It’s an evolving situation and making long-term plan is not the best of ideas, considering the last few days,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-clarity-on-govt-formation-in-kabul/article36146955.ece
28 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Experts sound alert for festive season||The coming festive season could be dangerous and lead to a surge in COVID-19 cases if people are not cautious, doctors and experts from across the country have warned. They said social gatherings could turn into superspreader events if communities failed to follow protocols. The cautionary note comes close on the heels of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Director General Balram Bhargava’s recent advice that vaccination is a disease-modifying and not disease-preventing option. He advocated continued adherence to COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. No room for laxity Nitin Nagarkar, Director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Raipur, said people needed to remember that cases had gone down earlier this year only to shoot up in April, when the country saw a massive second wave. “In February, the country was reporting around 8,000 cases, but as soon as individuals and communities became complacent, the cases surged alarmingly. People should remain cautious and follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour, at all times. People should keep wearing a mask and avoid crowding even while celebrating festivities,” he noted. Sarman Singh, Director, AIIMS, Bhopal, said that having to be careful did not mean that one should not celebrate festivals. “Technology has empowered us to remain emotionally and socially connected through the virtual medium,” he said. “Vaccine provides over 95% protection against severe disease and hospitalisation, which means post-vaccination, most cases of COVID-19 would be mild or asymptomatic, but that in no way means we forget to follow COVID-19 appropriate rules,” said Saurabh Varshney, Director, AIIMS Deogarh. “We as a community have to work collectively to contain the spread of the infection while celebrating festivals.” Personal safeguards “If we want to go back to normal in the near future, we need to impose self-restrictions, and the most important is to avoid socialising during festivals. If we can limit our social gatherings for a few months till the time a large proportion of our population gets inoculated, we can create a deterrent against spread of infection to a large extent,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/experts-sound-alert-for-festive-season/article36146971.ece
28 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||SKM calls for bandh on Sept. 25||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a platform of protesting farm unions, has called for a nationwide strike, or Bharat bandh, on September 25, a year after Parliament passed the three contentious agricultural reform laws. This comes at the end of a two-day convention at the Singhu border, aimed at proving the national character of the protests and developing a blueprint for future action. The three laws, which aim to facilitate contract farming, provide more choice in agricultural marketing and remove restrictions on essential commodities, were passed by Parliament last September. Protesting farm unions then issued a strike call on September 25, 2020, just two days before the President signed the three Bills into law. In January 2021, the Supreme Court suspended the implementation of the laws. Widespread support “Last year, the bandh call came in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, but there was still a widespread response. We hope that the strike call will be more successful this year,” said convention convener Ashish Mittal at a press conference on Friday. He pointed out that the convention included 3,000 delegates from 22 States, spurning the myth that the protest is restricted to a few North Indian States. Apart from about 300 farmer and agricultural workers unions, there were delegates from 18 trade unions, nine women’s organisations and 17 student and youth organisations. The farmers are also demanding a legal guarantee that they will get a minimum support price for their crops, and changes to electricity and stubble burning laws as well. Mass rally planned The SKM will host a mass rally in Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar on September 5, and expects over one lakh participants. “The historic mahapanchayat will take decisions with regard to the coming U.P. elections,” said All India Kisan Sabha leader Atul Kumar Anjan. “There is anger in rural India with regard to the farm laws, the price of diesel and petrol, inflation and hunger, and the lockdowns which caused widespread unemployment,” he stated and called for an expansion of the rural jobs programme MGNREGA to combat rural distress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/skm-calls-for-bandh-on-sept-25/article36146947.ece
28 August 2021||New Delhi,||Congress infighting may prolong||At a time when the Congress is doing firefighting in Chhattisgarh and Punjab over the leadership issue, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot’s health issues could temporarily put off a solution in the third Congress-ruled State that has witnessed similar tension. On Friday, Mr. Gehlot underwent angioplasty (procedure to open blocked coronary arteries) and this could delay the proposed expansion/reshuffle of his Council of Ministers to accommodate supporters of his arch rival, Sachin Pilot, before the start of the Assembly session on September 9. Earlier, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in charge of Rajasthan, Ajay Maken, had indicated that the process of Cabinet expansion would be over by August 15. However, last week, he changed his stance, saying Cabinet expansion in Rajasthan was a “work in progress” and did not want to be bound by any fixed timeline. Patience running thin Though the Pilot camp has maintained silence so far, their patience is running thin as the party’s top leadership has not been able to ‘deliver’ on its promise of accommodating all factions for several weeks now. Simultaneous trouble for all the Congress-ruled States is indicative of the ‘loosening’ grip of the Gandhis over party affairs. Though party chief Sonia Gandhi asserted her authority in appointing Navjot Singh Sidhu as the Punjab unit chief, ignoring the opposition from Chief Minister Amarinder Singh as well as parliamentarians, bitter factionalism continues to play out publicly in the State. While the Chief Minister’s camp bitterly attacked Mr. Sidhu’s adviser for his controversial remarks on Kashmir and Pakistan, Mr. Sidhu is said to have complained of “lack of freedom in decision-making”. AICC in charge of Punjab Harish Rawat said, “I can't question him on the basis of media speculation... I will see the context of the statement. He is party chief, who other than him can take decisions?” He would meet former party chief Rahul Gandhi on Saturday, Mr. Rawat added. Chhattisgarh spat And in Chhattisgarh, where Health Minister T.S. Singh Deo has openly reminded the party high command’s promise of rotating the chief ministership, incumbent Bhupesh Baghel is publicly parading Ministers and MLAs who are supporting him in the power tussle. And such a display of strength took place despite the central leadership making it clear that there was no need for Chhattisgarh MLAs to come to Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-infighting-may-prolong/article36146962.ece
28 August 2021||CHANDIGARH,||No point in becoming a showpiece, says Sidhu||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday sought freedom to take decisions, saying he had conveyed it to the ‘high command’ that if he is able to live up to people’s expectations, he could secure the party’s prosperity in the next 20 years and if he is not allowed to take decisions, then he shall smash it out as well. Mr. Sidhu, who was addressing a gathering in Amritsar, said, “I have always worked towards changing the life of people, and even today I a m working towards developing a Punjab model. I have told the high command that if I am able to live up to the expectations and hope of people surrounding the model, I assure you that I will not let Congress go and it will prosper for the next 20 years, but if you won’t let me take decisions, then I’ll [‘ itt naal itt bi kharkaonga ’] smash it out... there’s no point in becoming a darshni horse’ [showpiece]...” Advisers’ statements Mr. Sidhu’s remark comes against the backdrop of him being asked by the party’s senior leadership to sack his advisers who made controversial statements surrounding Pakistan and Kashmir. One of them, Malwinder Singh Mali, on Friday announced that he was quitting the post. In a post on his Facebook page, he said, “I humbly submit that I withdraw my consent given for tendering suggestions to Navjot Singh Sidhu.” Amid the ongoing power tussle between Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and Mr. Sidhu, the former had taken strong exception to the remarks of the latter’s advisers on sensitive national issues of Kashmir and Pakistan. He had urged Mr. Sidhu to rein in the advisers — Pyare Lal Garg and Mr. Mali — stating that their ill-conceived comments were potentially dangerous to the peace and stability of the State and the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sidhu-says-theres-no-point-in-becoming-a-showpiece/article36146964.ece
28 August 2021||Chennai,||Indian astrophysicists spot rare merger of three jumbo black holes||A rare merging of three supermassive black holes has been spotted by a team of astrophysicists from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), working with Professor Francoise Combes from the Paris Observatory. This is only the third time such an event has been observed and the findings were published as a letter in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics in June. The team were observing the merging of two galaxies — NGC7733 and NGC7734 — in the earth’s celestial neighbourhood when they detected unusual emissions from the centre of the latter and a curious movement of a large bright clump within it, having a different velocity than that of NGC7733. Inferring that this was a separate galaxy, the scientists named it NGC7733N. All three merging black holes were part of galaxies in the Toucan constellation. They are quite far away given that the earth’s nearest galactic neighbour — the Andromeda galaxy — is 2.5 million light years away. Yet the paper describes these as nearby galaxies. “In astronomy everything is relative. When we study the solar system, we say Mercury is closer and Jupiter is far… Compared to our nearest neighbour Andromeda galaxy, the galaxies NGC7733, 7734 and 7733 N are quite far away, but compared to the size of universe, they are nearby galaxies,” explains Jyoti Yadav, a Ph.D. student at the IIA and the first author of the paper. In an email to The Hindu , Mousumi Das, also from the IIA and another author of the paper along with Sudhanshu Barway, says the team were studying the active galactic nuclei in the two massive barred spiral galaxies NGC7733 and NGC7734 and that the detection of the third was surprising. “It was a bit like buy two and get one free,” says Dr. Das. “The PI of the project confirmed our suspicions using spectroscopic data from a European telescope called MUSE in Chile.” The group observed these galaxies with a near infrared telescope in South Africa. “Then, later on, because they appeared interesting, we also observed them with the UVIT [onboard the first Indian space observatory ASTROSAT],” says Dr. Das. “We also found optical data in the MUSE archive. So, we did not have to do the optical spectroscopy.” Final parsec In a press release, the team explains that if two galaxies collide, their black holes will also come closer by transferring the kinetic energy to the surrounding gas. The distance between the black holes decreases with time until the separation is around one parsec (3.26 light-years). The two black holes, however, are then unable to lose any further kinetic energy to get even closer and merge. This is known as the final parsec problem. But the presence of a third black hole can solve this problem. “The two can come closer when another black hole or a star passes by and takes away some of their combined angular momentum,” explains Dr. Das. Thus, the dual merging black holes merge with each other in the presence of a third. Many Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), or supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy, pairs have been detected in the past, but triple AGN are extremely rare, and only a handful have been detected before using X-ray observations. “Multiple accreting black holes [AGN] may be more common in our universe and especially common in galaxy groups. So the growth of black holes may be driven by such mergers in groups,” says Dr. Das. The study used data from the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on board the first Indian space observatory ASTROSAT, the European integral field optical telescope called MUSE mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile and infrared images from the optical telescope (IRSF) in South Africa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indian-astrophysicists-spot-rare-merger-of-three-jumbo-black-holes/article36147154.ece
28 August 2021||Mumbai,||Bhima Koregaon accused languishing in jail for 3 years||Friday marks three years since trade unionist and human rights advocate Sudha Bharadwaj, columnist and activist Vernon Gonsalves, cartoonist and activist Arun Ferreira and poet and activist Varavara Rao were arrested by the Pune police some seven months after a mob attacked Dalits and Bahujans on January 1, 2018. Initially all the accused were incarcerated at the Yerwada Central jail. However after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the probe, Ms Bharadwaj was transferred to Byculla prison along with co-accused Shoma Sen and Jyoti Jagtap. Mr Gonsalves, Mr Ferreira and Mr Rao were shifted to Taloja Central Jail. The case dates back to January 1, 2018 when a public meeting called Elgar Parishad was held on December 31 at Shanivarwada in Pune, 30 kilometres from Bhima Koregoan. The violence occurred after the annual commemoration by Dalit and Bahujan communities of the 1918 battle against the Peshwa. Soon thereafter a mob attacked people returning from the memorial, resulting in a law and order situation. Eight days after the attack, another FIR was registered on January 8, 2018 by Mr Bhide’s disciple Tushar Damgurde under several sections of the Indian Penal Code against Mr Dhawale, Jignesh Mevani, Mr Rao and two others. On June 6, 2018, after conducting unauthorised and unlawful raids and seizures — Mr Dhawale from Mumbai, Mr. Wilson from Delhi, Mr. Gadling, Mr. Raut and Ms. Sen from Nagpur — were arrested by Pune police. Second round of arrests were made on August 28, 2018 when Mr. Roa, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves and Sudha Bharadwaj on the basis of allegedly incriminating documents found in electronic devices seized from the first batch of arrested activists. On October 26, 2018, regular bail applications filed by them were rejected by the Pune sessions court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bhima-koregaon-accused-languishing-in-jail-for-3-years/article36146934.ece
28 August 2021||Guwahati,||Neither friend nor foe in all-party govt. in Nagaland||There are no rivals in the Nagaland Assembly. There seem to be no friends either. On August 16, the People’s Democratic Alliance government metamorphosed into the Nagaland United Government, or NUG. This followed the induction of the opposition Naga People’s Front (NPF) into the government headed by the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP). The Bharatiya Janata Party, the minor partner of the NDPP in the pre-NUG government, was reportedly unhappy with the NPF coming on board. The BJP used to be an ally of the NPF before choosing the NPFF as its pre-poll partner ahead of the 2018 Nagaland polls. Most of the NDPP leaders, including Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio, have come from the NPF. The BJP’s central leadership was quick to call Mr. Rio and the party’s Nagaland unit president Temjen Imna Along to New Delhi. “Under the surface, each party is suspecting the other of a bigger plan keeping the 2023 Assembly polls in mind,” an MLA said, seeking anonymity. The BJP is said to be wary of Mr. Rio trying to keep it out of the equation by forging a regional alliance. There is also the suspicion that the NDPP pre-empted a possible move by the BJP to mend fences with the NPF and reduce the chances of Mr. Rio of becoming the Chief Minister again. The NPF, on the other hand, is believed to have kept its options open to be in power after the 2023 polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/neither-friend-nor-foe-in-all-party-govt-in-nagaland/article36146940.ece
28 August 2021||New Delhi,||‘Can’t allow inspection of documents in INX media case’||As investigation in the INX media case is still on, the accused — Congress leader P. Chidambaram and his son Karti — cannot be allowed inspection of the seized documents as it may result in tampering of evidence, the CBI told the Delhi High Court on Friday. Justice Mukta Gupta, who was hearing CBI's challenge to a trial court order allowing inspection of documents kept in 'Malkhana' (room keeping case properties) by the accused and their counsel, said that the issue of inspection has been settled by the Supreme Court in favour of the accused. “For most of the things, onus has been shifted to the accused. Law also has to progress. Every investigating agency seizes 1,000 documents. They rely on 500 and keep 500. It is not your property. They may have exculpatory material for the accused,” said the judge who expressed her inclination to dismiss the petition. The court reserved its order on CBI's petition and allowed the agency as well as the accused to file their written submissions. CBI counsel Anupam S. Sharma submitted that “secrecy is important” in the case. “Then you say that trial will stop till you complete the investigation... you tell me how much time your further investigation will take and then it will be decided which document is to be given,” the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cant-allow-inspection-of-documents-in-inx-media-case/article36146960.ece
28 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Ministries agree to allow 7 Himalayan hydel projects||Six months after a devastating flood of rock, ice and debris gushed down the Rishiganga river in Uttarakhand and killed at least 200 and severely damaged two hydropower projects, three Union Ministries, which initially had dissenting views on the future of hydroelectric power projects, have come to a consensus. According to an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court this month, as part of an ongoing case on the feasibility of hydroelectric projects in the aftermath of the 2013 Uttarakhand floods, seven projects have been allowed to complete construction primarily on the grounds that they were over “50% complete.” They include the 512 MW Tapovan project that was severely damaged. No other new projects would be allowed in the upper reaches of the Ganga and those sanctioned would have to abide by environment regulations that prescribe a minimum flow in the river at all times. In 2016, the Union Water Ministry, then led by Uma Bharti, had contested the establishment of these projects and taken a position opposed to the Environment and Jal Shakti Ministries. However, in 2019, documents show, the Ministry had changed its views to accommodate seven projects. The affidavit this month is the first formal document that reveals all three Ministries to be on the same page. The seven projects are the Tehri Stage 2, Tapovan Vishnugadh, Vishnugadh Pipalkoti, Singoli Bhatwari, Phata Bhuyang, Madhyamaheshwar and Kaliganga 2. Activists say the government’s pushing ahead with the projects revealed that the floods of February had failed to jolt the government into realising that hydropower development in the Himalayas was “illogical”. “There were two projects, Singoli Bhatwari and Phata Bhuyang, which were specifically linked to the Kedarnath tragedy. Both have been allowed. The Vishnugadh project damaged in the February floods too has been allowed to progress even though 200 plus people died due to the criminal negligence of there not being a disaster warning system. The affidavit has the government admitting that the floods have damaged the tunnels and topography of the projects. All of this has changed. These projects got their environmental clearance based on very different conditions. So how are they being allowed on the same environmental clearance? ” questioned Mallika Bhanot, a critic of hydropower development in the Himalayas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ministries-reach-a-consensus-on-hydropower-projects-in-himalayas/article36146973.ece

Commenting on the publication, Dhriti Banerjee, Director, Zoological Survey of India, said that the discovery and description of a species is a long-drawn process and can take years, from the collection of a specimen to identifying and matching the specimen with other records in repositories, and finally publishing the details in a journal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-adds-557-new-species-to-faunal-wealth/article36147152.ece
28 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Oppn. raises internal security concerns||Opposition leaders raised queries about the internal security concerns for India, the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) during the briefing on Thursday by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on the developments in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover. According to the MPs present at the meeting, which lasted for more than three hours, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge raised concerns over the fallout of the Taliban takeover on the security situation in India, especially the likelihood of rising terror attacks. He stressed that the political process with regard to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir should be restarted by restoring its statehood. Congress leader Anand Sharma said the government of India had been marginalised over the events in Afghanistan. Several MPs used the phrase “grand isolation” to describe India’s situation among stakeholders in that country. Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda also raised issues related to internal security and recalled the situation in Afghanistan during his term in office (1996-1997) when the Mujahideen government and the Taliban were engaged in a civil war in Afghanistan. Trinamool member Saugata Roy questioned the recent statements by Ministers on the CAA in the context of Afghanistan. He said that while the government was undertaking the exercise of an all-party meeting on Afghanistan to put up a united front by India on foreign policy issues, some Ministers were using “divisive language” by constantly pushing the case for CAA. Security agencies in India have been warning of increasing terror activities by Pakistan-sponsored outfits the Jaish-e-Mohammad and the Lashkar-e-Taiba emboldened by the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/oppn-raises-internal-security-concerns/article36146957.ece

28 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||‘Grant citizenship to Arunachal Chakmas’||The Chakma National Council of India (CNCI) has asked the Centre to comply with two Supreme Court orders prescribing citizenship to the Chakma and Hajong people settled in Arunachal Pradesh six decades ago. The CNCI and its affiliates such as the All India Chakma Students’ Union and the Rashtriya Chakma Tribal Sangh have also expressed solidarity with the Chakmas and Hajongs of Arunachal Pradesh in rejecting the alleged plan to relocate them elsewhere in the country. Arunachal CM Pema Khandu had in his Independence Day speech said the Chakmas and Hajongs, who number more than 60,000, would be relocated outside the State. The Government of India had settled the Buddhist Chakmas and Hindu Hajongs in Arunachal Pradesh from 1964-1969 after they were displaced by a dam in the erstwhile East Pakistan. Some were victims of religious persecution. “Any plan or proposal to resolve the Chakma-Hajong issue by displacing them or relocating them to some other State or States as being proposed by the Arunachal Pradesh government shall be disastrous and inhuman,” the CDCI and its affiliates said in a statement. “The Chakmas and Hajongs were legally settled there in consultation with the erstwhile NEFA administration and lands were allotted in consultation with local tribes,” it said. The CDCI reminded the government of SC orders in 1996 and 2015 saying Chakmas and Hajongs be granted Indian citizenship with Arunachal Pradesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/grant-citizenship-to-arunachal-chakmas/article36147738.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Policy-making is an evolving process: experts||MIT World Peace University’s School of Public Policy and The Hindu Education Plus hosted a webinar on Thursday on Understanding Public Policy and its Career Prospects. The session was moderated by R. Sujatha, Deputy Editor, Reporting with The Hindu . Elaborating on public policy, Narendra Jadhav, Rajya Sabha member, economist, educationist and author, said, “It is a government chosen course of action with three key dimensions — definition of problems, goals the government would like to achieve, and what policies must be employed to achieve those goals. In any democracy, policymakers are legitimately elected people’s representatives — the PM, Council of Ministers, and their advisers. There are also non-elected officials such as the bureaucracy like the IAS, IPS, IRS, and others who are meant to implement policies announced by the government.” Global connect Mr. Jadhav added that reforms were not an event, but a process and a continuous one at that. “So, when situations are evolving fast, policymakers must evolve with the times; else the polices they have adopted will become obsolete.” Mahesh Zagade, a former IAS officer, emphasised that “no policy can be successful unless it is formulated keeping the future, changing environments, developments and so on, in mind. Adequate information on existing scenarios must be kept in mind while formulating policies for the future and they must have a global connect.” Ravindranath Patil, Senior Director-MIT World Peace University and Advisor, KPMG, emphasised the need for interdisciplinary learning to be a policy maker and the need to reconcile industry aspirations with government vision. “To develop policies, one must have a threshold knowledge of particular sector and an overall knowledge of other related sectors and skills. Managerial skills are important to compile ideas from different stakeholders and draft a policy that can stand the test of time.,” he said. “Aspirants must be able to elicit the right information from different stakeholders. Being equipped with technical skills, data analysis and dashboarding are just as important,” he added. The session concluded with the speakers fielding questions from the audience.

While Mr. Gandhi is bound by his reported promise to Mr. Deo, Ms. Vadra, senior leaders say, wants Mr. Baghel to continue. As Mr. Baghel is the party’s leading OBC face, she feels a change in leadership just ahead of the election in Uttar Pradesh, where each party is pursuing the backward vote, will send the wrong message. Within the State too, where OBCs make up the biggest vote bank, the BJP itself is looking for a credible backward face ahead of the next election in 2023. In a show of strength 55 of 70 Congress legislators who support Mr. Baghel flew down to Delhi. After spending the entire day lobbying for Mr. Baghel, the supporting MLAs moved to the party headquarters at 24 Akbar Road. They were seen congratulating at the conclusion of Mr. Baghel meeting with the Gandhi siblings. Sources said that Mr. Baghel has unequivocally conveyed to his supporters that he has survived for now. The entire contingent of 55 MLAs and Mr Baghel return to Raipur in a chartered flight on Saturday afternoon. On Thursday night, 26 MLAs supporting him arrived in a chartered airplane to the capital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/baghel-hangs-on-but-no-clarity-after-talks/article36146950.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Government to ease path for monetisation||The NITI Aayog, which has steered the NMP, has emphasised the importance of expanding the investor base and scale of monetisation instruments such as InvITs and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), and flagged concerns about regulators taking varying stances on such investments. Measures announced in the Union Budget to enable InvITs and REITs to borrow money from FPIs and issue debt securities are also expected to be reviewed by the FSDC, along with the efficacy of changes implemented by individual regulators. Stock market watchdog SEBI, for instance, has recently reduced the minimum investment amount for InvITs and REITs to Rs. 10,000-Rs. 15,000 to enable retail investors to participate. The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) as well as the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) have permitted investments of up to 5% of their corpus in InvITs, albeit with onerous conditions. Investors’ participation “The long-term nature of infrastructure projects requires active participation from investors looking at a similar return profile from their investments. However, the existing investment guidelines for insurance and pension funds limit the exposure of such funds to InvIT/ REIT assets,” the NITI Aayog has flagged in its guidebook for the NMP. For insurers, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has allowed an exposure to InvITs and REITs up to 3% of their own funds size or 5% of the units issued by a single trust, whichever is lower. Mutual funds, regulated by SEBI, can invest up to 10% of their assets in a single InvIT/ REIT. “These need to be streamlined to ensure consistency,” the Aayog noted, besides highlighting inconsistencies across categories on the level of exposures. “For example: IRDA regulations do not permit investment of insurance funds in unlisted InvITs. Hence, a staggered approach for streamlining of investment guidelines and limits is envisaged to keep pace with the growth in the InvIT market starting with the allocation of insurance and pension funds towards unlisted InvITs,” it said. Credit rating The IRDA and the PFRDA also mandate a high credit rating for InvITs to be eligible for their long-term investments, and the credit enhancement mechanisms for boosting the usually lower ratings of infrastructure projects may also figure in the FSDC’s deliberations. A Credit Enhancement Guarantee Corporation, announced in the Union Budget of 2019, is not yet operational, while a partial credit guarantee enhancement scheme from the Reserve Bank of India has some limitations in its present form. Restrictions pertaining to investments in the overall corporate bond market are also likely to be flagged at the FSDC, with SEBI recently mooting an urgent rethink from the RBI, the IRDA and the PFRDA on norms constricting debt market exposures, in order to enable a quicker economic recovery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/government-to-clear-bumps-for-monetisation/article36146951.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Deepar Beel breathes easy after notification||The wetlands have for decades been threatened by a railway track — set to be doubled and electrified — on its southern rim, a garbage dump and encroachment for human habitation and commercial units. The wetlands expand up to 30 sq. km in summer and reduces to about 10 sq. km in winter. The wildlife sanctuary measures 4.1 sq. km within this wetland. The notification specified an area “to an extent varying from 294 metres to 16.32 km” as the eco-sensitive zone with the total area being 148.9767 sq. km. “No new commercial hotels and resorts shall be permitted within 1 km of the boundary of the protected area or up to the extent of the eco-sensitive zone, whichever is nearer, except for small temporary structures for eco-tourism activities,” the notification said. Among activities prohibited in the eco-sensitive zone are hydroelectric projects, brick kilns, commercial use of firewood and discharge of untreated effluents in natural water bodies or land areas. Deepar Beel has long been used as a sponge for Guwahati’s sewage via a couple of streams. The wetlands have also suffered from seepage of toxins from a garbage dump at Boragaon adjoining it. “ About 150 species of birds have been recorded in the sanctuary, out of which two are critically endangered, one endangered, five vulnerable and four near-threatened,” the notification said. “Elephants regularly visit the wetlands from adjoining Rani and Garhbhanda Reserve Forest and the wetlands are an integral part of the elephant habitat. Besides these, 12 species of reptiles, 50 species of fish, six species of amphibians along with 155 species of aquatic macro-biota have been recorded in the sanctuary,” it said. But being adjacent to “fast-developing Guwahati”, the sanctuary is “facing immense biotic pressure by way of human settlements and even-increasing development activities”, the notification said. “City waste as well as industrial effluents causing serious problem to the ecological and environmental values of the rich wetlands that create a threat to all life forms and ecosystems in the Deepar Beel,” it added, also noting the railway track along the wetlands’ southern boundary with concern. Wildlife specialist Bibhab Talukdar said if the implementation of the rules is weak, it does not really matter if the eco-sensitive zone extends 10 km or 10 metres beyond a protected area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/deepar-beel-breathes-easy-after-notification/article36146952.ece

Tarigami, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and spokesperson of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, has urged the Supreme Court to “expeditiously” begin hearing petitions challenging the Centre’s abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the State of Jammu and Kashmir into Union Territories (UTs), saying the government was taking “irreversible actions” that may render the pending case “infructuous”. Several petitions, including one by Mr. Tarigami, have been waiting in the Supreme Court for nearly two years. The petitions were referred to a five-judge Bench in August 2019 by the then Chief Justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi. The petitions challenged a Presidential Order of August 5 that blunted Article 370. “Immediately after that, a strict security lockdown was imposed in Jammu and Kashmir that lasted over a year, along with a communication blackout and months-long Internet shutdown,” Mr. Tarigami, represented by advocate P.V. Dinesh, submitted. Mr. Tarigami said the “irreversible actions” of the Centre included the constitution of a delimitation commission to mark boundaries for constituencies before an Assembly election could be held, the amendment to the J&K Development Act and closing down institutions like the J&K State Women’s Commission and the State Human Rights Commission. “It is submitted that if the matters are not heard urgently, grave injustice will be caused to the applicant,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/begin-hearing-pleas-on-article-370-abrogation/article36146954.ece
28 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Pay fees for COVID orphans, SC tells States||The Supreme Court has ordered the State governments to bear the private school fees of children who have lost both or one parent during the pandemic for the current academic year in case the schools refused to waive it. “The catastrophe caused by the cataclysmic COVID-19 has devastated many lives, especially children at a tender age who have lost their parents. More than a lakh children have lost either or both parents during this pandemic. It is heart-wrenching to note that the survival of so many children is at stake… The State has a duty and obligation to facilitate education for children,” a Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao observed in a 27-page order published late on Friday. The order recorded that States have identified and registered 2,600 COVID-impacted children eligible to get education benefits under the PM-Cares For Children scheme. The court said it was open for States to request the Centre to bear the fees and other education expenses for the current academic year. “For children who have lost either parent or both parents after March 2020, the State governments shall confer with private schools to waive the fee for the current academic year. In case, the private institutions are unwilling to effectuate such waiver, the State governments shall shoulder the burden of the fee. In respect of those children amongst the 2,600 registered under the PM-Cares For Children Scheme, it is open to the State governments to request the Government of India to bear the fees for the current academic year,” the court directed. Under the PM-Cares for Children scheme, beneficiaries would be given admission in the nearest Kendriya Vidyalaya or in a private school as a day scholar. On admission of the child in a private school, fees as per the Right to Education norms would be given from the fund.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pay-fees-for-covid-orphans-sc-tells-states/article36146972.ece
28 August 2021||LUCKNOW,||Former IPS officer held in suicide case||Uttar Pradesh cadre IPS officer Amitabh Thakur, who was in March forced to retire prematurely from service, was arrested on Friday in connection with an abetment to suicide case of a woman who succumbed to her burn injuries a few days after she and her male friend set themselves ablaze near the Supreme Court. Her male associate died last week while she succumbed to her burns on Tuesday. The woman, who had accused Bahujan Samaj Party MP Atul Rai of rape in 2019, had accused Mr. Thakur, who was then posted as Inspector General of Police-Civil Defence in Lucknow, of trying to influence the case and spreading a false narrative against her and her friend, who was also her witness, through social media. In a Facebook live post done before they set themselves on fire on August 16, the woman and her friend also alleged that Mr. Thakur had tried to falsely project that her friend had connections with a criminal. Mr. Thakur had recently declared that he would stand against Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath from wherever he decides to contest in the 2022 Assembly polls. The woman from East U.P. had in May 2019 accused Mr. Rai of raping her in Varanasi. A month later, after winning the Lok Sabha election, Mr. Rai surrendered and has been in jail since. Last November, the MP’s brother filed a forgery case against the woman.

Ms. Mayawati belongs to the Jatav sub-caste, the largest Dalit community in Uttar Pradesh. On Friday, Ms. Mayawati, who turned 65 in January, asserted that when she appointed a successor, that person would belong to the Dalit community. But for now, she said, she was fit enough to run the party. “My health is fine, I don’t need to appoint a successor as of now. If it does not remain fine, I will surely announce my successor. Abhi mein fit hoon [I am fit],” she stated. She did not contract COVID-19, she stressed. Ms. Mayawati reiterated that she was following the path of her mentor, Kanshiram, who had appointed her as his successor only when he was not in the best of health. Ever since her nephew Aakash Anand entered politics in 2019, many have speculated that he could end up being her successor. However, Ms. Mayawati has been silent about this. The person succeeding her would be someone who who has supported her and the BSP in all difficult times with honesty and with “body, soul and wealth”, she observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-need-for-a-successor-now-says-mayawati/article36146959.ece

28 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Package tender’ discontinued||The Tamil Nadu government announced that it would discontinue the ‘package tender’ system in the Public Works Department. It had caused the exchequer an additional expenditure of Rs. 50,000 a km and did not favour local small-time contractors, Minister for PWD and Highways E.V. Velu said in the Assembly on Friday. The government would restructure the tender system. The rule for contractors to renew their registration would be revised once in three years as against once a year, he said. The registration of contractors and renewal of registration would be undertaken at the level of Regional Chief Engineers. During a debate, Mr. Velu said the ‘package tender’ system resulted in “unknown” individuals from outside the State being awarded projects. Local contractors could not get projects since they were not made eligible for the tender. Leader of the Opposition Edappadi K. Palaniswami said that only those who were found eligible for the tender process were allowed during the AIADMK government. Mr. Velu contended that locals, who were more concerned about implementation of projects in their areas, could not get a chance to take part in the tender. “Compared with the regular tender process, the ‘package tender’ process resulted in an additional expenditure of Rs. 50,000 a km,” Mr. Velu said. Moreover, local small-time contractors could not take part in the tender, and this resulted in unemployment among youth. Information Minister M.P. Saminathan pointed out that the ‘package tender’ system was introduced by the AIADMK government between 2001 and 2006, and it was discontinued by the subsequent DMK government under M. Karunanidhi. “The AIADMK re-introduced the system in 2011,” he said. Mr. Palaniswami responded that there was no legislation to regulate the system to be adopted in the award of tenders. Mr. Velu went on to point out that if the total estimate of a project was Rs. 800 crore or Rs. 1,000 crore, local contractors could not take part in the tender as they had taken tenders so far with lesser estimates.  Compared with the regular tender process, the ‘package tender’ process resulted in an additional expenditure of Rs. 50,000 a km E.V.

28 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||More powers to PWD soon to check m-sand||The Public Works Department is set to be provided with more powers to inspect and curb sales of substandard quality m-sand in the market. A government order to this effect is expected to be issued soon, based on the announcements made by Public Works Minister E.V. Velu in the Legislative Assembly on Friday. The Minister said that steps would be taken to check the quality of the m-sand manufactured and sold by private players and control sales of poor quality m-sand. According to the PWD policy note tabled in the Assembly, the technical assessment committee of the department approved the quality of m-sand or crushed stone sand, which is used as an alternative to river sand in construction work. Nearly 358 manufacturing units had been certified for m-sand quality based on the tests and regulations of the required machinery. Sources in the PWD said the department was expected to be given more powers to inspect and take steps against manufacture of poor quality m-sand. The engineers of quality control wing would inspect the sites, test the samples for its quality. PWD may be provided the authority to seal the units and arrest the owners for selling poor quality material once the government order was in place. This would help control unauthorised m-sand manufacturing units in the State and bring them under the ambit of quality certification, sources said. On an average, there was a demand for 25,000 loads of m-sand daily across the State. An additional region in Coimbatore would be created for PWD by reconstituting Chennai and Madurai regions. Circuit houses Moreover, circuit houses/inspection bungalows would be built in the six new districts, including Chengalpattu and Tirupattur, at a cost of Rs. 42.30 crore, the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/more-powers-to-pwd-soon-to-check-m-sand/article36147367.ece
28 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AAI plans MRO facility at Chennai airport||Work on creating a maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility for aircraft at Chennai airport is likely to begin soon. Officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said they were in talks with the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO) to kick-start the process. Having such a facility would be significant. “We have earmarked nearly 55 acres of land near the secondary runway. An MRO facility with hangars and other infrastructure will be developed in the near future. When this is done, the perimeter of the airport will be redrawn to accommodate this as well. This is a preliminary discussion and we will see how soon the facility can be established in Chennai,” an official said. TIDCO sources said a firm came forward to do set up the MRO facility, but the proposal had to be shelved because of land issues. “But now, we will acquire and get the land for the firm that is chosen for this work. We are in talks with AAI because to move forward we need to get their acceptance and clearance from the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security as well. It is not clear how long it may take to develop this facility now, but we want to make a start quickly and set things forward as this will help in job creation and give a boost to the industry,” a source said. Early this year, Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told Rajya Sabha that AAI had a “liberal maintenance, repair and overhaul policy with significantly reduced and liberalised land rentals. No revenue share will be charged from MROs by AAI under the new contracts.” Apart from Chennai, AAI plans to allot land for MRO facilities in Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Bhopal, Kolkata, Juhu, Delhi and Tirupati.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aai-plans-mro-facility-at-chennai-airport/article36147331.ece
28 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Police can conduct further investigation in Kodanad heist-cum-murder, rules HC||The Madras High Court on Friday ruled that the Shulurmattam police in Nilgiris district could go ahead and conduct further investigation into the 2017 Kodanad Estate heist-cum-murder case. Justice M. Nirmal Kumar dismissed a petition filed by prosecution witness ‘Anubhav’ Ravi alias N. Ravi of AIADMK's Amma Makkal Peravai in Coimbatore against conducting further investigation. The Judge held that the police was fully empowered to conduct further investigation under Section 173(8) of Code of Criminal Procedure even after filing of the charge sheet and commencement of trial. He pointed out that the legal provision began with a non obstante clause that nothing in that provision would preclude the investigating agency from conducting further investigation when it obtained fresh evidence. Therefore, when the investigating officer comes across new evidence in a case, even after the filing of a charge sheet, he/she could go ahead and conduct further investigation. Such power to conduct further investigation at any stage of a criminal case cannot be “doubted, objected or found fault with,” the Judge held. Quoting from a Supreme Court ruling, the Judge said though further investigation might delay the trial, the ultimate object was to arrive at the truth. “A fair trial is imperative in dispensation of justice and there is a difference between right to speedy trial and fair trial. A duty is cast upon the court to see that there is proper, fair, impartial and an effective investigation,” the Judge wrote. He went on to state that filing of charge sheet or pendency of trial could by no means be a prohibition to conduct further investigation. The object of criminal trial was to discover the truth and plausible evidence must be brought on record whatever stage the case might be in. “In this case, the murder had taken place in Kodanad Estate and it has been followed by a series of suspicious deaths. Whatever materials are collected, it is ultimately for the court concerned to decide the acceptability or otherwise of the same. It is always better to have a fair and impartial trial to arrive at an impartial and just decision,” Justice Kumar wrote. He also pointed out that the present petitioner was neither a de facto complainant nor a victim or an accused. He was only a witness in this case and he could not have any say in the manner of investigation or trial of the case. No prejudice would be caused to the petitioner due to the decision taken by the police to conduct further investigation, the Judge added. He agreed with Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram that the law did not mandate obtaining permission of the trial court before conducting further investigation. It was sufficient if the police intimated the court about its decision to conduct further investigation. In the Kodanad case, such information had been provided and the court had also recorded it, the Judge concluded. The Kodanad Estate was owned jointly by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and her close aide V.K. Sasikala. The heist in the estate had taken place when Edappadi K. Palaniswami was the Chief Minister. In the course of the burglary, the accused had hacked watchman Om Bahadur to death. Another watchman had sustained grievous injuries. Days later, the prime accused C. Kanagaraj, former driver of Jayalalithaa, died in a road accident. Another accused, K.V. Sayan, had a narrow escape in a similar road accident. A CCTV operator at the estate too died by suicide, adding to the mystery. The police had decided to conduct further investigation in the case after the DMK assumed power in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-can-conduct-further-investigation-in-kodanad-heist-cum-murder-rules-hc/article36147400.ece

28 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Four toll plazas on OMR to be shut||The collection of toll for vehicles on Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) through four toll plazas in Perungudi on Rajiv Gandhi Salai, Thoraipakkam, Kalaignar Salai and Medavakkam Salai will be discontinued from August 30, Minister for Highways E.V. Velu announced in the Assembly on Friday. The government’s decision was being taken in view of the commencing of Metro Rail project work on the stretch, he said. Residents happy Various residential associations along Rajiv Gandhi Salai have welcomed the announcement on removal of the toll plazas at Perungudi, Thoraipakkam, Perumbakkam and on ECR link road from August 3. FOMRRA’s Harsha Koda said the removal of the toll plazas, and construction of flyovers and Metro Rail had been long standing demands of the residents. Francis of Thoraipakkam Anand Nagar Association said the removal of toll plazas on the Thoraipakkam-Pallavaram Radial Road would help prevent cab drivers from taking interior roads in residential localities. “People need not think of spending money to use the road inside city limits,” he said. Removal of the toll plazas would mean loss of jobs for nearly 30 persons involved in toll collection and issuance of passes. Collection of toll led to an annual income of Rs. 50 crore in 2018, of which Rs. 29 crore went towards maintenance and salaries and Rs. 20 crore was for repayment of loans, said official sources. Collection of toll on the 20 km stretch began in 2008 since a loan of Rs. 380 crore had to be repaid to various banks. In 2015, the government provided a soft loan of Rs. 160 crore to help the Tamil Nadu Road Development Company tide over financial losses. About Rs. 60 crore of this soft loan was pending. Due to the loss of revenue, the company that manages the road would require Rs. 20 crore a year to continue to maintain it, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/four-toll-plazas-on-omr-to-be-shut/article36147314.ece
28 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Act against non-service PGs who skipped postings in T.N., deans told||The Directorate of Medical Education (DME) has instructed deans of government medical colleges in the State to take action against non-service postgraduates (Higher Speciality), who completed the courses in 2020 and 2021, but violated bond conditions and to recover the bond amount under the Revenue Recovery Act after first issuing a show-cause notice to those who have not opted for postings offered to them in their speciality departments in medical colleges and hospitals. “As per the prospectus, non-service PGs should serve in Tamil Nadu for two years. If they fail to do so, they will have to pay Rs. 50 lakh as per a bond executed at the time of admission. A number of students from other States, on completion of the course, leave Tamil Nadu without taking up or joining postings. So, we have told deans to intimate to such candidates to join duty and work for two years or pay the fee for violating the bond,” R. Narayana Babu, Director of Medical Education, said.  The Hindu, in a report “Candidates of super-speciality courses skip counselling” published on August 8, reported how a number of candidates from other States, who had completed DM/MCh from government medical colleges in T.N. in 2020, did not attend the counselling held for posting in July-end. In its circular of August 25, the DME has enlisted the names of 112 non-service PGs — 78 who completed in 2020 and 34 who completed in 2021 — who have submitted as not opted/not willing. The directorate said that online counselling to issue postings for non-service PGs who had completed in 2020 and 2021 was held on July 30. During the counselling, vacancies were available in their speciality departments in government medical colleges but many did not opt and submitted not willing/not opted in the proforma. As per the bond condition of 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, all PGs have to complete two years of compulsory bond service. But many have failed to take up postings available in their speciality departments in government medical colleges as per their seniority. This showed that they were reluctant and unwilling to work in Tamil Nadu Medical Service to fulfil their bond service, the DME said. The directorate requested deans to obtain an undertaking from these candidates through their head of department that they had not opted for postings although vacancies were available in their speciality departments of medical colleges. As per the bond, they are liable to pay the bond amount of Rs. 50 lakh if they failed to take up their appointment or else the amount had to be recovered through Revenue Recovery Act. “Candidates who leave without completing their bond service return after two or three years saying that they were not given appointments,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/act-against-non-service-pgs-who-skipped-postings-in-tn-deans-told/article36147327.ece
28 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||IIT ex-faculty member writes to Pradhan||The head of the Humanities and Social Sciences Department at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, should step down to ensure fair investigation on his complaint of caste-based discrimination, a former faculty of the institute, has said. Vipin P. Veetil, 36, who was an assistant professor of Economics, resigned on July 1, citing discrimination on the basis of caste. In a five-page letter to Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on the ongoing investigation based on his complaint, he said the institute had formed a three-member committee to investigate the issue that he had reported to the grievance committee. However, head of the department Jyotirmaya Tripathy, who he accused, “is liaising between the investigating committee and the faculty members of the department,” he said in his letter. Mr. Veetil said he wrote on August 5 and 16 to the institution pointing out that “due process” demanded that Mr. Tripathy step down as head of the department until the investigation was completed so that he did not tamper with the evidence. But the institute director had not responded. Mr. Tripathy was coordinating the investigation, and this sent a wrong signal to faculty members who were interviewed by the committee. These members depend on their head of the department for promotions, research grants and access to resources, he said. Mr. Veetil said the Minister should instruct the institute to “dethrone” Mr. Tripathy temporarily and he should “be considered for positions of power only after the ongoing investigation of the internal grievance committee and that of the National Commission for Other Backward Classes is complete”. He said V.R. Muraleedharan, “one of the accused”, was the Senate nominee on the IIT-Madras Board of Governors. His presence on the board would adversely affect the investigation, he said. ‘Deeper rot’ Mr. Veetil rued that the administration had not asked Mr. Tripathy to step down even before the investigation began. Such acts were not oversight but superficial manifestation of a far deeper rot “of subjugation of truth, justice and scholarship by caste,” he said. For such subjugation to be removed, affirmative action must be taken at the highest level of administration, including the board of governors and head of departments, he said. A positive step would be for the next director of the Institute to be from the SCs, STs or OBCs, he suggested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/iit-ex-faculty-member-writes-to-pradhan/article36147369.ece
28 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Timely help leads to volunteering by CAs||When Sripriya Kumar sought a hospital bed for a fellow chartered accountant during the second wave of COVID-19, she received help from a senior bureaucrat. As a gesture of gratitude, she told the bureaucrat that she would like to help the government in some way. She was directed to speak to another bureaucrat, Darez Ahamed, who invited her to look at how the government managed bed allocation. And that is how her tryst began with the government’s unified command centre for COVID-19 management. People can call 104, the government helpline for all medical-related assistance, which is managed by the unified command centre. During the second wave, the number, which in normal times would address people’s health-related questions, was used to help them access hospital beds. The tour of the unified command centre left Ms. Kumar wondering if she could assist people in seamlessly locating beds. She put out an appeal in her social media groups for chartered accountants. “We started with three volunteers, and soon the number rose to 130 CAs. The maximum number of people who supported us on any given day was 102,” she recalls. When she started out, 1,000 hospitals were enlisted with the government. Today, 2,200 hospitals have been enlisted, she adds. The details of beds were initially given in an excel sheet with the help of government officials; then, a system was put in place. Around 10 a.m. every day, the volunteers would start calling hospitals that had not updated their bed position. They often found the hospitals either did not know how to update or forgot to do so. When she started out, 700 of the 1,000 hospitals would not have updated their bed position. Now that number has fallen to 120-150, she says.  The platform is open to chartered accountants nationwide. The only criterion is that they should speak Tamil as the personnel manning the hospitals are conversant only with Tamil. On August 14, the volunteers completed 104 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/timely-help-leads-to-volunteering-by-cas/article36147363.ece
28 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||MIOT hospital gets a new biplane cathlab||A biplane cathlab commissioned at MIOT International has reduced treatment time and improves patient outcome, say doctors. The machine comes with cone beam CT, 3D echo and software intelligence and halved the amount of radiation a patient is exposed to besides the amount of contrast dye administered. K. Jaishankar, director of cardiology, said while in the past patients requiring angiography were given as much as 60-70 ml of contrast dye to identify blood vessels, the machine’s precision reduced it to just 20-25 ml. The machine also protects the kidneys from being exposed to contrast, he said. “Many times patients come to us with a heart attack and we do not know their kidney function. This is where the machine helps,” he said. The real-time images help identify the size of the lumen, check for tear in a blood vessel post-stenting and identify the critical blocks requiring stenting, Dr. Jaishankar said. Interventional neurologist Shankar Balakrishnan said the machine helped to treat brain aneurysms. The software tools, the 3D images it provided gave greater confidence to work. The machine reduced the treatment time from two hours to just 30 minutes in stroke patients, he said. “This machine helps with a short clinical exam and gives excellent CT scan images in 5.2 seconds and helps us decide on the treatment,” he said. Vascular and interventional radiologist Karthikeyan Damodaran said the machine provided chemotherapy precisely. In a patient with liver cancer, chemo therapy could be directed to the blood vessels that supplied to the tumour, unlike the conventional method that required multiple angiograpms and injecting too much of contrast dye, thus exposing the patient to more radiation, he said. Hospital managing director Prithvi Mohandas said the new machine brought more convenience to the doctors and increased safety of the patients at no cost to the latter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/miot-hospital-gets-a-new-biplane-cathlab/article36147335.ece

Opening a special camp for vaccination of teachers and non-teaching workers and their families, organised by the Greater Chennai Corporation here, he said officials were asked to ensure that all teaching and non-teaching staff members were vaccinated by September 1 when schools would reopen for Classes IX-XII. He said teachers and non-teaching workers and their families could get their first and second doses through such special camps organised across the State in collaboration with the School Education Department. Minister for School Education Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi was also present. Record vaccination Mr. Subramanian said the State administered 5,72,898 doses on Thursday, the highest so far on a day. He lauded the Greater Chennai Corporation for vaccinating 1,35,865 people on Thursday through a mega drive in all 200 wards. On pregnant women He said Tamil Nadu ranked first in the number of pregnant women vaccinated, with 3,51,179 pregnant women inoculated so far. The State was focussing on lactating mothers and the differently abled, destitute and mentally ill people. Pudukkottai district achieved 100% vaccination of the differently abled.

28 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CWMA has no jurisdiction over Mekedatu, says Duraimurugan||Expressing shock over reports that the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) had decided to discuss Karnataka’s proposal to construct the Mekedatu dam, Water Resources Minister Duraimurugan told the Assembly that it had no jurisdiction to discuss the matter and the issue was sub judice . “We have filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the construction of a dam at Mekedatu. We have also filed a contempt petition with the Central Water Commission against the detailed project report. When everything is in the Supreme Court, it is sub judice to discuss the issue in the CWMA. It is the stand of Tamil Nadu that it cannot be discussed,” he said, responding to the members of the House. He said Tamil Nadu had already reiterated its stand and Union Water Resources Secretary himself would go to the authority to express Tamil Nadu’s stand. He was confident that Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, the son of S.R. Bommai, who was close to Kalaignar (former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi) and whose petition in the Supreme Court had put an end to the unilateral dismissal of State governments, would not deviate from justice. “He might have expressed his view because of the political circumstances. But we will oppose and argue our case in the appropriate forum,” he said. Recalling the meeting of an all-party delegation with the Prime Minister and the Jal Shakti Minister, he said the Minister had made it clear that his Ministry would accept the DPR only if Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry granted permission. “The dam cannot be constructed on Cauvery if the DPR is not accepted, and that is the stand of the Jal Sakthi Minister. He also sent a message that he would come here next week. But suddenly we have received news about the meeting of the Cauvery Management Authority,” he said. Mr. Duraimurugan said he fully agreed with AIADMK member K.A. Sengottaiyan that no one could defeat Tamil Nadu if everyone stood together on the issue as they did against the imposition of Hindi while supporting the two-language policy. He said the Cauvery water dispute had a long history and Tamil Nadu had got relief only when the tribunal was constituted by the late Prime Minister, V.P. Singh. “Tamil Nadu could not get justice even from the tribunal and Kalaignar wanted us to file a petition in the Supreme Court. Only then we got the 205 TMC,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cwma-has-no-jurisdiction-over-mekedatu-minister/article36147347.ece
28 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Trio runs out of luck while stealing gold at airport||The police have busted a gang which used to hide gold bars in garbage bins removed from aircraft at the airport and deliver them to smugglers waiting outside. The police took up investigation on a complaint from A. Saravanan, 30, of Chrompet, who was an employee of a catering contractor. Saravanan reportedly told the police that while he was riding his bike at 4 a.m. on August 23, a gang waylaid and robbed him of two-and-a-half sovereigns of gold jewellery, cash and mobile phone. On scrutiny of CCTV footage from the place of crime, the police nabbed Saravanan’s colleagues Mohammed Nazir, 25, and Prabu Ram, 27, both of Pallikaranai. They were contract staff who cleared garbage from the aircraft. During investigation, police realised that Saravanan and his friends staged a robbery to hoodwink the person supposed to receive the consignment and steal 9 kg gold belonging to Imran Khan. The three used to carry gold from the aircraft outside the airport avoiding Customs officers in the airport. Saravanan brought 9 kg gold belonging to Imran Khan from the airport. Later, the three pretended as if the gold had been stolen. Police investigation revealed the modus operandi of the gang. Since the three worked at the airport, they had relatively free access. The smugglers would hide gold bars in the seats before the departure of a flight from overseas destinations. On the pretext of collecting garbage from the aircraft, Saravanan, Mohammed Nazir and Prabhu Ram would collect the contraband, and hide them in garbage bins, avoiding detection by authorities. The police are searching for others involved in the smuggling racket. Nine kg gold and a cellphone were seized from the accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/trio-runs-out-of-luck-while-stealing-gold-at-airport/article36147324.ece
28 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Glut of flowers triggers price crash||A portion of the flower consignment received at the Koyambedu wholesale market on Friday remained unsold as supply was more than the demand. With not many takers, a few traders dumped heaps of marigold at the market. Wholesale merchants said arrival of flowers, particularly marigolds and roses, from Hosur and Rayakottai belt were twice the normal quantum. This led to fall in prices at the wholesale market. Nearly 25% to 30% of the stock remained unsold. Yellow marigold, which sold Rs. 120 a kg last week, could fetch only Rs. 50 to Rs. 70 a kg on Friday. As there were not many customers despite drop in prices, a few traders dumped wilted marigold in the market. S. Mukkaiya, president, Chennai Koyambedu Wholesale Flower Merchants Association, said the demand was relatively low as it was not festive season or auspicious day to hold functions like weddings. However, the market received at least 50 truck loads of marigold and roses on Friday instead of the usual 25 to 30 truckloads. Roses were available for Rs. 80 to Rs. 100 a kg on Friday as against Rs. 140 a kg a few days ago. Similarly, traders sold varieties of jasmine for a price ranging between Rs. 180 and Rs. 200 a kg. “We expect the demand to go from next week as festivals are around the corner,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/glut-of-flowers-triggers-price-crash/article36147322.ece

28 August 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Plea to establish hostel for students from hill areas||Former MLA from Bhavanisagar Assembly constituency P.L. Sundaram has urged the district administration to establish a hostel at the Government Arts and Science College in Sathyamangalam for the benefit of students from hill areas. In a letter to Collector H. Krishnanunni, Mr. Sundaram said many from the hill areas of Talavadi and Kadambur were pursuing their studies at the college while admission for the current academic year was also in progress. “The main objective of starting the college was to benefit students from hill areas. But, in the absence of hostel facilities, the students face difficulty in pursuing their studies as they cannot travel to the hills every day and are unable to spend money for private hostel accommodation also,” the letter said. Since a hostel for boys was not available, many students were unwilling to join the college in the current academic year. A hostel for students belonging to Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes should be established at Sathyamangalam , the letter said. “Until then, college students should be accommodated in the hostel meant for school boys,” the letter urged. At present, the Department of Backward Classes was establishing a hostel for girl students at Punjai Puliyampatti that was 20 km away from the college in Sathyamangalam. “Students are forced to spend Rs. 30 for bus fare every day which is not possible for them,” the letter said. Mr. Sundaram said adequate land was available near the college and steps should be taken to construct a hostel for girls there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-establish-hostel-for-students-from-hill-areas/article36147480.ece

28 August 2021||KALPETTA,TAMIL NADU||Illegal trekking poses threat to Edakkal||Edakkal caves on the Ambukuthi hills in Wayanad, a treasure trove for archaeologists, historians, and researchers, is facing threats from illegal trekking, illegal constructions, mining, and urbanisation. The State government banned trekking on the hills on October 1, 2009, after it was found that the activity was affecting the Neolithic petroglyphs (rock engravings) on the walls of Edakkal caves. However, a group of resort owners in Malavayal, Ponmudikkotta, and Govindamoola, near the hills, have recently resumed trekking for adventure tourists, P.K. Sathar, member, Sulthan Bathery block panchayat said. Construction stopped The licences of nine resorts were suspended and construction works for three resorts were stopped by the former director board of the Nenmeni grama panchayat. Tents too set up But some resorts started functioning without the civic body’s permission after the government recently opened tourism destinations in the district, he said. They also set up tents on the hill top for tourists. Around 5.5 acres of land near the caves is protected and construction is banned on the 300-m radius of the premises. Though the State government had made the declaration seven years ago, the land is yet to be handed over to the Archaeology Department after survey. A workshop held at Sulthan Bathery on conserving Edakkal petroglyphs in 2013, as part of securing World Heritage Monument status of the Unesco for the monument, had discussed threats to the rock carvings, including unrestricted construction and mining in the area, and scientific measures to conserve the caves. Though the suggestions of the workshop participants were handed over to the government, no action has been taken yet.  The State Archaeology Department had appointed an officer to monitor activities at the monument in 2009, but the post has remained vacant for the past 12 years. Panel formed The government had constituted a multidisciplinary expert committee in September 2020 to assess the condition of the archaeological site and come up with a report on steps required for its conservation. The committee is yet to be convened. Historian M.R. Raghava Warrier, the panel chairman, told The Hindu that the panel was yet to be convened owing to the COVID-19 outbreak.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/illegal-trekking-poses-threat-to-edakkal/article36147165.ece

28 August 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Suspended Inspector accused of extortion arrested||Suspended Inspector of Police S. Vasanthi of Nagamalai Pudukkottai under Madurai rural district police who was booked for extortion of Rs. 10 lakh from a tailor was nabbed late on Thursday evening by a special police team. She was nabbed in Kotagiri in The Nilgiris district where she was found hiding in a lodge. The police also arrested another accused in the case Pandiaraj. All the accused in the case have now been secured. The other accused in the case are Palpandi, Ukkirapandi and Karthik. Earlier, the police recovered Rs. 2.26 lakh from Palpandi, Ukkirapandi and Karthik. The police brought the accused to Madurai and were taken to Government Rajaji Hospital for a medical examination. They were then produced before the Madurai District Court and remanded in judicial custody till September 9. The anticipatory bail petition filed by Vasanthi is pending before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court. The tailor K. Asrath had lodged a complaint with the police alleging that a bag containing Rs. 10 lakh was snatched from him by the accused. The complainant said he had raised a loan of Rs. 10 lakh to set up a tailoring unit. He was waiting in a lodge to raise more money. Under these circumstances, he said that the accused offered to help him and left the lodge with the promise of raising money. But, it was said that when they returned, the police had arrived on the spot. Vasanthi was handed over the bag by some accused. She then told them that she would be taking them with her for an inquiry. But, she dropped Asrath midway, according to the complaint filed by Asrath. When he went to the police station, the Inspector told him that the bag contained no money in it, but only some newspapers. The allegations levelled against the Inspector were denied by her in the petition filed seeking anticipatory bail. She said that she had visited the spot based on secret information regarding the exchange of fake currency notes. She took the people for an inquiry. But, then she released them after finding no incriminating materials. She said that she was falsely implicated in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/suspended-inspector-accused-of-extortion-arrested/article36147456.ece
28 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Differently abled seek hike in assistance||Demanding the government to increase their monthly assistance to Rs. 3,000 and above, members of Tamil Nadu Association for the Rights of All Types of Differently Abled and Caregivers (TARATDAC) staged a protest in front of the Collectorate here on Friday. T. Nagarajan, district president of the association, said, “The DMK, in its election manifesto, promised to increase the monthly assistance provided to the physically challenged persons from Rs. 1,000 to Rs.1,500. We are disappointed that it has not been fulfilled yet. Some governments like Telangana and Puducherry are providing assistance to the tune of Rs. 3000 and Rs. 5000 per month. We want the government to increase the amount, particularly for those with severe disabilities.” They also insisted on easing the process of obtaining disability IDs. Though it is an online application process, it requires the differently-abled to go in person to obtain the signature from the VAO or Tahsildar and then get a disability certificate from a doctor. “Previously, doctors were brought to the collectorate on a particular day and certificates were collectively given for 50-100 people. Bringing back that practice will help us a lot,” he added. The association also wanted the special grievance meeting for the differently-abled that was conducted once in every two months, to be resumed in the Collectorate. They sought free house pattas, citing that their lives were severely affected due to the pandemic which even normal people found difficult to handle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/differently-abled-seek-hike-in-assistance/article36147675.ece
28 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC acquits woman in infant murder case||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has acquitted a woman, who was accused of killing her one-and-a-half-year-old daughter in 2002. The court set aside the life sentence imposed on her by the trial court in 2004. In 2020, the Supreme Court remanded the matter to the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court. The High Court dismissed the appeal in 2014 in default as the counsel representing her was not present. The Supreme Court observed an appeal against an order of conviction could not be dismissed in default, but must be taken up and decided on merits even if the appellant-in-person or the counsel representing him/her, was not present. Sakunthala of Tiruchi preferred the appeal against the Tiruchi Sessions Court judgment convicting her of the offence under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC. She had been accused of throwing her child into a well following a quarrel with her husband. A Division Bench of Justices V. Bharathidasan and J. Nisha Banu observed the prosecution had miserably failed to prove any incriminating circumstance against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and made its case based on mere suspicion, without any strong evidence. The case of the prosecution was that the woman and her husband frequently quarrelled. She had left home following a quarrel over money for the treatment of their child. The body of the child was later found floating in a well. The husband alleged his wife threw their daughter into the well. The woman denied the allegations levelled against her, saying she learnt of her daughter’s death only after the police picked her up for an inquiry. The judges took into account the post-mortem report that revealed there was no water in the stomach, lungs and in the intestine and no froth was coming out of the mouth of the child. During cross examination, a government doctor said if the body was thrown into the water after death, water would not enter the stomach, lungs and intestine. In the present case, it could not be concluded that the death was due to drowning. The child might have been thrown into the well after death. The court observed that the very charge against the accused was that she threw the child into the well and caused the death was not proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution. The court observed that the prosecution had stated that due to a quarrel between the couple, the appellant had thrown the child into the well. This was trivial and the motive set up by the prosecution is not sufficient to sustain the charge, the judges said. It allowed the criminal appeal. The conviction and sentence imposed on the woman by the trial court were set aside. The court acquitted her of all charges and observed that the fine amount shall be refunded and the bail bonds executed by her shall stand cancelled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-acquits-woman-in-infant-murder-case/article36147403.ece
28 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Another couple granted bail in illegal child adoption case||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has granted bail to another couple accused in the Madurai illegal child adoption case. Similar to the other couple accused in the case, they had believed that they had legally adopted the child. The key accused in the case is Idhayam Trust Director G.R. Sivakumar and his accomplice Madarsha. They had sold at least two infants to two different couples stating that they would be completing legal formalities later. The accused in the case have been arrested and remanded in judicial custody. Sivakumar was nabbed by the police when he was on the way to Kerala. Justice B. Pugalendhi granted bail to the couple, days after the court had also granted bail to the other couple accused in the case. The fact that the couple were childless and applied for adoption through various modes were taken into account by the court. Following an enquiry it was revealed that a woman who was unable to maintain her children handed them over to the home run by Idhayam Trust. Sivakumar claimed that one infant died of COVID-19 and he instead sold the infant. He said the infant was infected with COVID-19 and he would take the child for treatment. He then told the woman that the infant died and the final rites were performed as per COVID-19 protocol. Suspecting the activities of Sivakumar, the woman lodged a complaint. Sivakumar sold the child to the couple and said that all legal formalities would be completed. He told them that there was a delay in completing formalities as courts were not functioning due to the pandemic situation. Believing him they signed the documents and took the infant with them, the couple said. The court was told that the investigation in the case was yet to be completed. The court granted bail to the couple with conditions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/another-couple-granted-bail-in-illegal-child-adoption-case/article36147438.ece
28 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Zero Shadow Day observed||Did you know that twice in a year, your shadows disappear for a brief moment, when the sun’s rays fall directly over your head? This phenomenon is called the ‘Zero Shadow Day’ and when it was observed at exactly 12:19 p.m. on Friday in the city, science enthusiasts got excited looking at shadowless poles and objects. People generally believe that the sun passes directly over our heads, every day, during local noon which is the time of the day when the elevation of the Sun is highest. This is not true. It passes either a bit north or south of the zenith which is the point straight above our head. This is because of the earth’s tilt at an angle of 23.5 degree, with respect to its orbiting around the Sun. But, twice in a year, at regions between the latitudes of +23.5 and -2.35, the sun does pass directly over the heads, causing the shadows to disappear which is observed as the Zero Shadow Day. Scientific Officer from the Tamil Nadu Science and Technology Centre, Chennai Lenin Tamilkovan who was present at The American College to demonstrate the event said, “The Zero Shadow Day is observed at different dates in different places that lie between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. It happens once during Uttarayan (northward motion of the Sun from winter to summer solstice) and once during Dakshinayan (southward motion of the sun from summer to winter solstice) at places starting from Nagpur to Kanniyakumari, in India. It will be observed in the southern districts of Virudhunagar, Theni, Tenkasi, Thoothukudi and Kanniyakumar in the upcoming days.” The Tamil Nadu Science Forum, Madurai, had also made arrangements for the public to witness the event in 10 different places in the city. It was informed that making continuous observations of this phenomenon can help us have a better understanding of the earth’s seasonal changes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/zero-shadow-day-observed/article36147463.ece

28 August 2021||PERAMBALUR,TAMIL NADU||‘Need to change system of hiring sanitary workers’||The National Commission for Safai Karamcharis has recommended to the Tamil Nadu government to change the contract system of employment of sanitary workers, according to its chairperson M.Venkatesan. Speaking to reporters here after holding a review meeting and an inspection of the working conditions of sanitary workers in Perambalur on Friday, Mr.Venkatesan said many of the workers had raised demands such as regularisation of services and increase in wages. Steps would be taken to fulfil their demands, he said. He said that wages should be promptly paid to sanitary workers and medical screening should be conducted for them once every three months. The lives of sanitary workers, who discharge their duties unmindful of the risks involved, should be insured and the premium should be paid by the contractors. Alternatively, companies can be persuaded to come forward to utilise their Corporate Social Responsibility funds for paying the premium of the life insurance of sanitary workers. Sanitary workers should not be forced to work more than eight hours a day and officials concerned should ensure this, he said and added that it is illegal to force them to work extra hours or without weekly offs. Steps should be taken to construct houses for sanitary workers and fulfil their other requirements. Sanitary workers can lodge complaints with the district Superintendent of Police if they face any sexual or casteist abuse, Mr.Venkatesan said.  Earlier, accompanied by P.Sri Venkada Priya, Mr.Venkatesan visited the Madarasa Salai area where a large number of sanitary workers reside and enquired about basic amenities in the locality. He also chaired a review meeting with officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/need-to-change-system-of-hiring-sanitary-workers/article36147442.ece
28 August 2021||PERAMBALUR,TAMIL NADU||Mysterious animal attack on goat, kids||Attack on a couple of calves and a goat tied inside an enclosure in an open site at Esanai on Wednesday night triggered concern about suspected movement of a leopard. While the goat and one calf were found dead inside the enclosure, another calf which was seriously injured was shifted for treatment. Forest Department officials inspected the spot on Thursday. The animals were reared by R. Shanmugam, a farmer. He had used to tie the calves and the goats in an enclosure with a bamboo fence situated a few distance away from his house. Officials said Shanmugam found the goat and one of the calves dead and another calf grievously wounded on Thursday morning when he went to the enclosure. The attack on the domestic animals seemed ferocious as the intestines of two animals had come out. The incident triggered concern of a suspected movement of a leopard. Officials went to the village on Thursday morning to get a first hand account of the incident. An official said that a dog used for hunting could have attacked the domestic animals basing his observation from the pug marks found near the enclosure. He ruled out the possibility of a leopard. Usually, a leopard or other carnivore bites the neck to kill its prey. However, in this case the goat and the calves were attacked from behind. The stomach portion of the domestic animals were completely bitten. Further, the animal that had killed the goat and the calf had entered through one of the holes in the bamboo fence, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mysterious-attack-on-goat-and-calves/article36147443.ece
28 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘Official machinery returning to normalcy’||Chief Minister N. Rangasamy on Friday said the administrative machinery was coming to normalcy after five years of a power struggle between the previous Congress government and the Raj Nivas. “Problems in administrative matters are getting cleared. The NDA in the Union Territory is confident of implementing all schemes to make the region developed with the support of the Prime Minister and the Lt. Governor,” he said, winding up the motion of thanks to the Lt. Governor’s address in the Assembly. Thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for appointing Tamilisai Soundararajan as the Lt. Governor, he said she was “very supportive of the government’s initiatives”. For the first time, there was a personal touch to the preparation of the Lt. Governor’s address. “She had requested me to forward the copy of the speech once it was prepared by the government. After I sent the copy, she personally incorporated Tirukkural verses at 15 places in the address. With the support of the Prime Minister and the Lt. Governor, we are sure of implementing all the programmes,” he said. Opposition leader R. Siva said though the party welcomed the decision of the Lt. Governor to address the House in Tamil, the speech lacked the vision for the next five years. The Prime Minister and the Home Minister made several promises to the people of the Union Territory during the election campaign. The address did not find any mention of the demand for Statehood, commitment to holding local body polls or any specific programmes to revive the cooperative sector, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/official-machinery-returning-to-normalcy/article36147768.ece
28 August 2021||Puducherry,TAMIL NADU||Vaccination coverage approaching 70%: L-G||Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Friday said vaccination coverage against COVID-19 was approaching 70% of the population and 41 villages in the Union Territory had been fully vaccinated. Flagging off six digital vans to propagate the vaccination message under the auspices of the Bureau of Outreach and Communication under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting as part of the year-long 75th Independence anniversary celebrations, Ms. Soundararajan said the administration had been able to vaccinate an estimated 7.5 lakh people out of a total eligible population of about 10 lakh in the Union Territory. The progress on the vaccination front was still a remarkable achievement in spite of missing the target of 100% coverage by August 15. Vaccine hesitancy and apprehensions among sections of the population were still impeding the effort. This was why though against a target of reaching at least 10,000 people every day, only around 4,000 to 5,000 could be vaccinated, she said. Various programmes had been launched to raise vaccination coverage among different segments of the population, the Lt. Governor said. These included special intensive vaccination camps, street corner camps, outreach sessions at industry sites and colleges, and door-to-door administering for the infirm. The late evening vaccination programme targeted at working couples was a first in the country, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccination-coverage-approaching-70-l-g/article36147764.ece
28 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Opposition slams NDA govt.’s maiden Budget||Opposition leaders attacked the NDA government’s maiden Budget presented by Chief Minister N. Rangasamy. Former Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy described the Budget as “unremarkable and disappointing” and amounting to a betrayal of the people. He said that while the Chief Minister had presented a Budget with an outlay of Rs. 9,924 crore for 2021-22, there were no details on the ways to achieve internal revenue mobilisation or how the waiver of farm loans would be implemented. “In short, farmers have been ignored in this Budget. There was no announcement on the industrial or infrastructure front. Also conspicuous by its absence was any Budgetary allocation for pandemic management,” he said. Leader of the Opposition R. Siva said the Budget fell far short of expectations, especially given the hyped promises of development by the Prime Minister and other BJP leaders ahead of the election. The Budget had no proposal for rehabilitating sinking PSUs or securing Central assistance for their revival. The government failed to announce an industrial policy or plan to attract new enterprises in a scenario where unemployment was rising, he said. L-G hails Budget Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan hailed the Budget. She said it placed special emphasis on various schemes in the health sector, including a new hospital for infectious diseases and augmentation of health infrastructure. Another notable scheme was to distribute essential commodities like pulses, cereals and oil through fair price shops, for which Rs. 197 crore had been earmarked, as well as a corpus fund to revive the shops. “It is a good budget and the Chief Minister adopted a comprehensive approach to address the needs of all sections of the people,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/opposition-slams-nda-govts-maiden-budget/article36147766.ece

28 August 2021||Theni,TAMIL NADU||Wild boar menace leaves farmers distressed||Wild boar menace dominated the monthly farmers' grievance meet held in Theni on Friday. Complaining that no tangible steps had been taken to end the menace, farmers from various locations in Theni district claimed that the wild boars destroyed their crops and sought the Collector's intervention. Speaking at the meeting which was held on the virtual platform, the farmers said that despite taking a number of preventive measures, their crops had been destroyed by the wild boars. “The forest and agriculture department officials should examine ways to sort out the issue,” they pleaded. Presiding over the meeting, Collector K. V. Muralidharan said that the officials would positively examine the issue and help the farmers in containing the wild boar menace. He instructed the officials to respond to all the grievances within a fortnight so that the district administration could take action on them. Apart from encroachment issues on water channels, the farmers also raised issues of pest attacks on coconut and sugarcane crops. Timely intervention was essential and the disease had to be prevented as otherwise the crops may whither or yield may fall, they pointed out. Rainfall in district Against the normal annual rainfall of 829.80 mm, the district had so far received 683.56 mm rainfall, which was 299.56 mm in excess till August. However, for August alone, against 100.68 mm, so far, the district had received 50.56 mm only.

He assured all assistance to farmers including adequate stocks of fertilisers for the rest of the season. The officials appealed to the farmers to get insurance policy for their crops. They said, for the kariff season, eight crops including corn, groundnut, cotton were covered under insurance.

28 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Sisters rehabilitate mentally ill women||Two sisters from Kovandakurichi in Lalgudi block in Tiruchi district manage a home for 44 marginalised, mentally ill women in their village. The women who suffered from similar illnesses and were stigmatised seek to provide a better future for women like them. When one asks for the ‘Home Again’ project run by Jacklin and Amali in Kovandakurichi, a village near Pullambadi in Lalgudi, they are directed to a dead end with a blind right turn. The house located immediately after the turn is where the two sisters began working towards providing permanent homes for people marginalised due to mental illnesses. ‘One cannot see the house from the main road, but as soon as you take the turn, a leap of faith, you will see a new life,’ I. Jacklin Sagayarani said, describing her work. Along with her sister P. Amali Margaret, the duo brought ‘Home Again,’ a project to care for people in remission from mental illnesses to the village. After patients undergo treatment at The Banyan , a non-governmental organisation based in Chennai that cares for the mentally ill, where the two were treated, they are rehabilitated to normal life in these homes. ‘Many are not allowed back into their houses due to stigma, fear and other factors. For them, the project serves as a permanent residence. They can live here all their lives, go to work and take care of themselves,’ Ms. Jacklin said. Jacklin, who suffered from bipolar disorder, had wandered to Chennai and was taken by authorities to The Banyan , where she underwent treatment for seven years. Her sister, Amali and the rest of their family had presumed that she may have died. Amali was later diagnosed with depression and travelled to The Banyan for treatment, where she was reunited with her sister. A trained nurse by profession, Jacklin was taught to care for patients with psychological illnesses after recovery, while Amali became an expert in home management and administrative work. When they returned to their village, they sought the help of the NGO to help other women like them. ‘They would knock on our doors when nobody was watching and ask if we could help them. Many stigmatized us but those who needed help found their way to us,’ Ms. Jacklin said. What began as a single home with five residents in November 2016 has mushroomed into nine homes with 44 residents. Each house is managed by two women, called personal assistants who are residents of the same village. A psychiatrist regularly monitors the health of the residents, while Jacklin administers them with their regular dose of medicines. The women plan to help the residents with acquiring Aadhaar cards, ration cards and other necessities soon. Inspired by their resilience and to create awareness of mental health, The Banyan is releasing a children’s book titled ‘Jacklin and Amali’ narrating the duo’s story. ‘We want children to learn about mental illnesses. Unless one pursues psychology or social work, they are unaware of it. We want the book to destigmatize it and create awareness,’ Sagaya Mary, a representative of The Banyan , said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sisters-rehabilitate-mentally-ill-women/article36147453.ece
28 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Musiri residents expect development||Residents of Musiri town are relieved over the announcement of the government to upgrade the local body as a municipality. As a municipality, the local body will be able to secure more funds from the government for improving public amenities. Development will, no doubt, take place. The new municipality could take shape with a larger area subsuming the adjoining panchayats of M. Pudupatti and Mettupatti and have a higher number of wards. Sufficient funds could be utilised for implementing a major project for drinking water supply. However, it remains to be seen if the intended development is brought about in right earnest, former AIADMK Minister N.R. Sivapathi, who had represented the constituency from 2011 to 2016, said. While there are concerns that the tax rates will increase, the trading community takes heart from the possibility of rise in land value . Since there is not much cultivable land around Musiri, urban expansion could be a smooth sail, they explain. There is also hope among the people that sanitation will improve in the town which has no facility for treating sewage water from households. Wastewater The waste water is being let into Mettu Vaickal, which was once a distributary canal from the Cauvery utilised for irrigation purpose. The draining of waste into the water body has been the cause for breeding of mosquitoes. ‘In terms of sanitation, the transformation of Musiri into municipality will not mean much for those constructing individual toilets. But, adequate funding could be sourced from the government for establishing community toilets,’ said Marachi Subburaman, the founder of Society for Community Organisation and People's Education (SCOPE), an organisation focussing on betterment of water, sanitation and hygiene in the local body said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/musiri-residents-expect-development/article36147445.ece

28 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Colleges in ‘wait and watch’ mode to offer teacher education programme||Colleges of education in the region that had been helplessly watching the declining patronage for the traditional B.Ed. programmes are in a ‘wait and watch’ mode in the wake of the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) deciding to put on hold its approval for launch of four-year integrated B.Sc. B.Ed. and B.A.B.Ed. programmes. The demand for the programme began to slide since 2015-16 from when NCTE had doubled the duration of B.Ed. to two years, according to a functionary of a college of education in Tiruchi. The advantage in the four-year Integrated Teacher Education Programme (ITEP) is that the students will be able to save a year. In the central districts, the ITEP is being offered by Central University of Tamil Nadu at Tiruvarur, and SASTRA Deemed to be University and Periyar Maniammai Institute of Science and Technology in Thanjavur district. Since the NCTE has specified that the ITEP can be offered only by ‘composite institutions,’ government-aided arts and science colleges of long standing are interested in offering the programme, but are not certain if the Department of Higher Education in the State will permit flexibility. For, the teacher-education courses are being granted affiliation separately by the Tamil Nadu Teacher Education University. ‘There are indeed challenges in implementing the ITEP. That explains why the implementation has been suspended for a year. In fact, the implementation could take a longer time since the system has to be made flexible enough,’ C. Thangamuthu, former Chairman, Southern Regional Committee of National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) said. Prof. Thangamuthu who had served in the capacity in NCTE for two terms said implementation of ITEP in a vibrant environment of arts and science colleges was indeed essential to build competency of teachers. The way out for the existing colleges of education was to merge themselves with arts and science colleges, he said. “There have been instances of colleges of education applying to the NCTE to offer the four-year ITEP. But, a clarity has not yet emerged on their eligibility to offer the programmes. Nor has there been any inspection by NCTE committees in these institutions. This had prompted the NCTE to postpone implementation of ITEP by a year to 2022-23,” S. Senthilnathan, Professor, Department of Educational Technology, Tiruchi, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/colleges-in-wait-and-watch-mode-to-offer-teacher-education-programme/article36147440.ece

28 August 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Register names with VAOs, farmers urged||Farmers, who have cultivated ‘kar’ paddy and planned to sell the harvested paddy in the government’s Direct Purchase Centre (DPCs), should register their names with the Village Administrative Officer (VAO) concerned immediately, District Collector V. Vishnu has said. This system has been introduced to weed out the brokers who would buy the paddy from farmers at a lower price and sell it in the DPCs at the minimum support price announced by the government. In a statement, Mr. Vishnu said ‘kar’ paddy cultivation had been taken up across the district this year as the dams had sufficient water and harvesting of the paddy was about to start within a week. Hence, the district administration had opened DPCs through the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation for buying the harvested paddy from farmers. Farmers, who intend to sell paddy in the DPCs, should register their names with the VAO concerned. The farmers should produce copy of patta/chitta or document of the land while registering their names with address, area of paddy cultivation, survey number of the land and mobile phone number. If the farmer had taken the land on lease, the grower should submit copy of the lease agreement and those who had cultivated paddy on temple or mutt land should submit the receipt given by the temple or mutt Administrative Officer concerned. “Since the farmers, who have registered their names with the VAOs alone will be allowed to sell their paddy in the DPCs, they should register immediately their names with their VAOs. The farmers, while bringing the paddy to the DPCs, should contact only the officers posted in the DPCs and need not seek the help of brokers, against whom action will be taken by the police,” Mr. Vishnu warned. The Collector urged the farmers to contact Regional Manager at 94436 95551 or Quality Control Manager at 93456 35678 to register complaints, if any.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/register-names-with-vaos-farmers-urged/article36147796.ece

Vishnu has promised to desilt the channel which is choked with construction debris and encroachments. The North Kodaimelazhagiyan channel, the first channel of the Tamirabharani irrigation system, feeds over 1,000 acres of land in Papanasam, Vickramasingapuram, Sivanthipuram, Kodarankulam, Vagaikulam and Mannarkovil. Mr. Vishnu inspected the farms in the tail-end regions of this channel after farmers complained that they were yet to get water that was released from Papanasam dam 80 days ago. Paddy raised on over 100 acres in Vagaikulam and Mannarkovil, which get water through the North Kodaimelazhagiyan channel via Seerpathakulam, Gnanapattarkulam, Puthukkulam and Sumaithangikulam were withering due to lack of water. When Mr. Vishnu inspected the channel on Thursday, the farmers told the Collector that the 18 km-long North Kodaimelazhagiyan channel had been choked due to dumping of construction debris and garbage. Though 55 cusecs was released in the channel, the water was yet to reach the tail-end regions. “Fields that produced two crops every year, were now struggling to even cultivate one season due to the choked irrigation facilities. So, officials concerned should desilt the channel at the earliest and farmers who had suffered crop loss should be given due compensation,” said the farmers. Mr. Vishnu, who was accompanied by Cheranmahadevi Sub-Collector Siva Krishnamurthy and Joint Director of Agriculture Gajendra Pandian, assured the farmers that due action would be taken to desilt the channel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/north-kodaimelazhagiyan-channel-gets-choked-and-paddy-begins-to-wither/article36147795.ece

28 August 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Parties asked to stay away from MES||Kannada organisations have urged all parties not to venture into post-poll alliances with the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti in the Belagavi City Corporation elections. “We are asking the BJP, Congress and other parties to stay away from the MES,” Ashok Chandaragi, convenor of the Action committee of Kannada organisations in Belagavi on Friday. “There is no need to either seek their support or support them either in the election of councillors or in the election of the Mayor and Deputy Mayor. If any party tries that, we will complain against them to the State government and protest against the leaders who entered into such alliances,” he said. Mr. Chandaragi and other members of Kannada organisations like Moinuddin Makandar and Deepak Guadaganatti, told journalists that they would strongly oppose any such political alliances. “It is likely that either a national or a regional party will come to power in the BCC. But if the results are not conclusive and no party gets a majority, there is a possibility that some may try to form alliances with the MES,” he said. “For the first time since the formation of the BCC, the elections are being held on the basis of party affiliations. It is very likely that all parties will try to occupy the Mayor’s chair. They may even try to buy out Independents or engineer defections. Some leaders may try to come to power by winning over some MES councillors to their side. We are appealing to all parties not to do so. If they do, then we will organise a serious agitation,” he said. “MES leaders have been betraying the Marathi-speaking common population. While the party leaders have made money by playing politics, the common man who has believed in their lies, remains where he was,” Mr. Gudaganatti alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/parties-asked-to-stay-away-from-mes/article36147510.ece

28 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Courts can function whether or not there is another wave of COVID-19: CJ||Chief Justice of the High Court of Karnataka Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka on Friday assured the citizens of the State that courts, due to tech-driven initiatives, were capable of functioning whether there would be a third wave of COVID-19 or not. Mr. Oka, who led the State’s judiciary to become first in the country to use virtual mode to hear cases on a regular basis when courts were shut due to the nationwide lockdown imposed in March 2020, was addressing judges and advocates during a farewell given to him on his elevation as judge of the Supreme Court. ‘Blessing in disguise’ Stating that COVID-19, in a sense, had become a blessing in disguise as the High Court was forced to make use of technology to ensure services and functioning of the courts, he saluted members of the court’s registry for working 24X7 during the pandemic. He hoped that his target of ensuring zero pendecy of cases older than five years in the State, which could not be achieved due to situation created by the pandemic, would be achieved by the end of 2022 with the cooperation of advocates. Describing Mr. Oka as “Kayakayogi” like Basavanna, Karnataka State Bar Council chairperson Srinivasa Babu L. said the Chief Justice helped both the litigants and advocates during the pandemic by ensuring that functioning of courts was not stopped completely by evolving a standard operating procedure with the consensus of all stakeholders. His gesture of welcoming COVID-19-recovered court staff by offering a rose was a memorable moment for all, he added. Satish Chandra Sharma, the senior-most judge of the High Court, said Mr. Oka had brought “revolutionary” changes in the court’s administrative process. Apart from introducing several technology-driven initiatives, including hybrid system of hearing (both physical and videoconference mode), which became the mode for the Supreme Court and other High Courts, Mr. Oka issued several directions on judicial side to protect the interests of migrants and to ensure food security during March 2020 before any other High Courts took up these issues cropped up due to the pandemic. Sixty-one-year-old Mr. Oka, who hails from Bombay High Court, had rendered judgments on protecting environment of Bengaluru city, including on preservation of trees, restoration of lakes, and management of the city’s municipal sold waste.He was also tough with the advocates by initiating contempt of court proceedings against officer-bearers of several bar associations for abstaining from court proceedings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/courts-can-function-whether-or-not-there-is-another-wave-of-covid-19-cj/article36147279.ece
28 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Roads deteriorate into mud and slush after rains||Daily life has become a nightmare for the residents of Varthur as most of the roads dug up for civic works by different utilities have deteriorated into muddy puddles and slush after the recent spate of rains. The quality of life has taken a nosedive as not only are the roads not motorable, but residents whose houses abut them are finding it difficult to even step outside for errands. Muniyappa, who lives in the neighbourhood, described the state of the roads as a health hazard. “You can’t walk more than 20 metres without falling. Many residents have fallen and injured themselves,” he said. The condition of the roads is so bad that water tankers — which most of the residents depend on for their daily needs — are also unable to use them. This has resulted in people coping with water shortage. “Several water tankers have got stuck in the mud and are now not ready to come to our houses. They park their tankers several hundred feet away,” said Madhuri, a Varthur resident. Residents say that the quality of roads has deteriorated over the past two months, with no respite despite several appeals being made to civic agencies to restore them. According to Jagadish Reddy of Varthur Rising, the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) had dug up most of these roads to lay underground drainage and water lines. “While that has been completed in most areas, restoration work was not taken up properly. They left after doing a mud compact, which has given way in the rains,” he said. The condition of many roads in neighbouring Whitefield, where the BWSSB work is currently under way on Borewell Road, Nallurahalli Main Road, and Kundalahalli Road, is no different. Telecom service providers, too, have dug up several stretches of Whitefield Main Road. “The mud is simply left on the road, and when it rains commuting becomes a nightmare,” said Zibi Jamal of Whitefield Rising. Citizens groups pointed out that multiple agencies such as the BWSSB, BESCOM, and several telecom service providers have taken up work on various roads simultaneously, pushing entire areas into chaos. Chief Civic Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said the State government had already allocated Rs. 1,000 crore to take up restoration of roads dug up by utilities and work would be taken up soon. “The tenders are being finalised and all roads will be restored in the next four months,” he said, adding he has instructed zonal officials to take up emergency work to restore the roads for now.

28 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Border districts see sharp rise in cases||The districts bordering Kerala — Dakshina Kannada (and the adjoining Udupi), Kodagu, Mysuru, and Chamarajanagar — have seen an alarming spike in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the past one month. Together, these districts have recorded 43.9% of the total caseload (47,100) and 36.2% of the total deaths (811) reported in the State from July 27 to August 27. Bengaluru Urban, which had become Karnataka’s epicentre of COVID-19 with the spiralling of cases and fatalities during the second wave, contributed to 23.4% (11,034) of the total caseload and 16.8% (137) of the total deaths reported during this period. 160 deaths in DK Dakshina Kannada, which has recorded over one lakh (1,09,200) total COVID-19 cases so far, witnessed 160 deaths in the past one month alone. Bengaluru Urban, which has recorded 12,36,615 cases so far (over 12 times more cases than Dakshina Kannada), witnessed 137 deaths during this period. On several days during this period, the number of daily cases reported in Dakshina Kannada outnumbered that in Bengaluru Urban. Experts say this is a worrying trend as these districts border Kerala, which has been witnessing an unprecedented surge in cases. The State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) that discussed the Kerala situation at its meeting on Thursday has recommended that district authorities should continue to maintain strict vigil at the borders. Among students The TAC noted that students from Kerala, who are coming to Karnataka with COVID-19 negative reports, are turning out to be positive during the repeat test on the seventh day. Health officials informed the TAC that 620 such incidents have been reported in Dakshina Kannada and 141 in Udupi. “Many of the primary contacts of these positive cases are also testing positive and the students (who are positive) are not ready to get isolated at COVID Care Centres. The colleges are also not agreeing to this,” an official informed the TAC. Following this, the TAC recommended that the principals of educational institutions (in case of students), heads of offices (in case of employees), and their contacts who receive these persons from Kerala should strictly ensure that all students/employees compulsorily bring negative RT-PCR certificate that is not older than 72 hours, irrespective of their COVID-19 vaccination status (one or two doses). “The validity of such certificates should be for one week,” the TAC recommended. C.N. Manjunath, director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, said it was important for even fully vaccinated people to come with a negative certificate or be quarantined for seven days and tested again on the seventh day. “The test positivity rate in Kerala is alarmingly high and should be contained there itself. Any State with such a high positivity rate has to be isolated till the TPR comes down to below 5%. Otherwise, the risk of transmission to other States is always high,” he said. Asymptomatic carriers “Even if people are fully vaccinated, there is every possibility that many of them will be asymptomatic carriers, thereby spreading the infection. They can become silent super-spreaders, and so we need to do everything possible to check this,” he said. V. Ravi, member of the TAC and nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, said it was important for officials to maintain a test ratio of 1:20 — test 20 primary and household contacts of every positive case — in these districts. “This is the only way to keep the TPR below 5%. The second wave also began with a few clusters reported from Dakshina Kannada and Mangaluru. We should not let this happen again,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/border-districts-see-sharp-rise-in-cases/article36147256.ece
28 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Women, others call out Home Minister for victim blaming||Women activists and writers have come down heavily on Home Minister Araga Jnanendra for questioning why the Mysuru college student who was gang-raped had chosen to visit a desolate spot at the Chamundi foothills. Such statements questioning the victim’s movements are not a one-off and are a reflection of the mindset of society, they said. In the past, too, similar statements have been made, trying to shift the blame to women. For instance, former Home Minister G. Parameshwara had blamed “Western ways of thinking and dressing” when several women were molested on Brigade Road on New Year’s Eve of 2017. In a case very similar to the gangrape case in Mysuru, a student who was sexually assaulted on the Jnanabharathi campus in the city in 2012 was also blamed. Activists also pointed out that attempting to curtail the movement of women at night, “for their own safety”, was the wrong approach — one that shifts the blame on to victims. Jasmeen Patheja, founder-director of Blank Noise, a movement demanding safe spaces for women, said such statements only reflected a skewed mindset. “We know that violence against women can take place at any time, night or day, and across all spaces — streets, homes, public transport, workplace, campus — irrespective of whether they are in school uniform, sari, or jeans,” she said. Actor and Congress leader Ramya wrote on social media, “As women, we are constantly blamed for every crime a man commits... We often hear this — it is your fault, you shouldn’t have done that ... because we are conditioned to think that men will be men and therefore we must compromise, we must change, we must be careful, we must put up ...” Several police officers too concede that the Home Minister’s statement was ill-advised. Former State police chief S.T. Ramesh said that irrespective of the place, situation or time of day, the government was obliged to provide protection to all its citizens and questioning them on their actions had no place in this day and age. On the criticism over the lack of police patrolling in the area where the girl was gang-raped in Mysuru, he said, “Patrolling alone won’t prevent such matters. Such heinous offences can be prevented when there is the deterrent of law in the area, an intangible entity that can be established through meticulous policing every day.” Feminist scholar and writer H. S. Shrimati said such sexual violence emerged out of the pressing need, especially in youngsters, to prove male supremacy within the patriarchal system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/women-others-call-out-home-minister-for-victim-blaming/article36147268.ece
28 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||NEP: Colleges can collaborate and offer multidisciplinary education||The State government’s decision to implement the National Education Policy (NEP) starting this academic year (2021–22) has many colleges worried especially because students will have the option of selecting subjects from different streams. However, Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan on Friday said independent colleges that offer only one stream — Arts, Science or Commerce — could collaborate with neighbouring colleges. This way, they would not be at a disadvantage and could offer multidisciplinary options to their students. At an interaction with the media, Dr. Narayan said colleges could collaborate so that students could pick subjects across different streams. Under the new system which will be implemented from this year, students have the freedom to choose any three subjects — two subjects from each discipline (such as Arts, Science, and Commerce) and one elective subject from the same discipline or any other discipline. For instance, if a student wishes to pursue B.Sc., he/she can opt for chemistry and biology as the core subjects and pick history as the elective subject from the Humanities stream. ‘Cluster of colleges’ This is a sea change from the earlier more rigid system where students had no choice but to opt for a fixed combination of three subjects from a particular stream. P. Pradeep, Commissioner, Department of Technical and Collegiate Education, said in the future, the government was planning to introduce a “cluster of colleges”. Students could study in colleges under this cluster and opt for any of the elective courses. The new format also allows multiple entry and exit points for students. At the end of the first year, students get a certificate. A diploma is awarded at the end of the second year, while a degree is awarded at the end of the third year. Candidates will be awarded an honours degree at the end of the fourth year. Higher Education officials clarified that the government was implementing the NEP only for undergraduate courses this academic year. “The NEP will be implemented in postgraduate courses at a later stage,” said an official, but did not give a time frame or confirm if it would be adopted across PG courses in the following academic year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nep-colleges-can-collaborate-and-offer-multidisciplinary-education/article36147284.ece

Nagarathna, judge of the High Court of Karnataka, here on Friday while underlining the role of her family members who ensured that she excelled in her profession as an advocate and as a judge.In her message towomen advocates while replying to a farewell given to her on her elevation as a judge of the Supreme Court, she said women advocates can achieve their dream if they have access to right opportunity. “I therefore urge you to search out for these opportunities armed with faith inyourself and stride ahead to achieve all that you want to do and also to give back to society.” ‘Not burdened’ Stating that her family members, including her in-laws, husband, two daughters, and the domestic help ensured that she was not burdened with domestic chores, Ms. Nagarathna added that it had not been easy for her to be the daughter of late E.S. Venkataramaiah (a former Chief Justice of India) as she was always tested in the light of his personality and judged accordingly. Born on October 30, 1962, Ms. Nagarathna was elevated to the High Court in February 2008 as a first woman judge from the Bar. She is the first woman judge elevated to the Supreme Court from the High Court of Karnataka and will be in line to become the country’s first woman Chief Justice of India in 2027. As the chairperson of the Karnataka Judicial Academy, she, for the first time, introduced training module for trial judges about laws on gender, children, and environment. As a member of the High Court’s building committee she had ensured installation of sanitary pad vending machine near washrooms on the High Court premises for use of women advocates, litigants, and staff. Her recent judgment declaring that illegitimate children, irrespective of the personal laws applicable to their parents, are eligible for compassionate appointments in government service is among the important judgments she has rendered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/look-for-opportunities-armed-with-faith-in-yourself/article36147282.ece

He pointed out that a task force was set up in March 2020 for this purpose. “We never expected to be the first State to roll out the NEP, but we are.

After receiving a tip-off, NCB sleuths intercepted the parcels at the Electronics City post office on Thursday. After a thorough search, they discovered that each parcel had 500 grams of MDMA crystals. “The MDMA crystals were found to be cleverly concealed along two sides of a carton box in grey-coloured duct tapes. The cartons also contained packets with a sandwich grill, a flexible mirror, a manicure and pedicure set, two table tennis bats, and two pouches of chocolates,” said a statement from the NCB. NCB sleuths mounted an effort to apprehend the person who came to collect the parcels. After prolonged surveillance, they arrested a woman, identified as Yogita, a resident of Bengaluru. She was caught when she arrived at thepost office on Thursday evening to collect the parcel. According to officials, she lives with a foreign national from an African country. She ordered the contraband from Germany and it was meant to be supplied to various parties and individuals in the city, the NCB statement said. The woman has allegedly been involved in drug trafficking for three years now and sells narcotics to customers, not just in Bengaluru but also in other South Indian cities as well, where she has a client base. There has been a rise in instances of people ordering party drugs and other banned substances from Europe via the Darknet. “The inflow of MDMA crystals in courier and speed post parcels booked through the Darknet has gained momentum, especially during the time of COVID-19 restrictions. MDMA is mainly sourced from European countries. MDMA crystals are rampantly used in rave parties and are used commonly by youngsters,”the NCB added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ncb-intercepts-parcel-recovers-1-kg-of-mdma/article36147247.ece

28 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Transport officials release Rolls Royce after ‘owner’ pays penalty of Rs. 5,500||The Transport Department released the Rolls Royce car that it had impounded on August 23, after the ‘owner’ paid Rs. 5,500 as penalty. Transport Commissioner N. Shivakumar told The Hindu that the luxury car was still registered in the name of actor Amitabh Bachchan. Sources said that the penality was paid in the name of Mr. Bachchan. According to Mr. Shivakumar, the vehicle’s documents, sourced from the Andheri RTO in Mumbai, were found to be valid. He maintained that there was no tax due. “The only lapse found was that the vehicle did not have insurance cover. Mr. Bachchan is still the legal owner. We were told that it arrived in the city in July through Chennai,” he said. However, contrary to the claims made by the Commissioner, some officials in the department alleged that after the vehicle was impounded, a report was sent to higher-ups from the RTO office of Yelahanka stating that the car had been plying in the State since February 2019 without payment of tax, coming up to Rs. 32.13 lakh. Mr. Shivakumar, however, dismissed these allegations, saying that according to the information he has received, the vehicle arrived in the city in July this year. “As per the legal position, tax cannot be raised against the vehicle. Only if the vehicle has been plying in Karnataka for more than 11 months does the question of collecting tax arise. As per the documents available, the owner has registered the vehicle in Mumbai and the tax applicable was paid there,” the Commissioner said. The vehicle was released after the RTO office received a penalty of Rs. 5,500 in the name of Mr. Bachchan. The amount was paid on August 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/transport-officials-release-rolls-royce-after-owner-pays-penalty-of-rs-5500/article36147250.ece

28 August 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Kimmane slams Home Minister||Former Minister Kimmane Ratnakar has said recent comments by Home Minister Araga Jnanendra on the rape case reported in Mysuru harmed the dignity of Tirthahalli, the constituency the Minister represented. Mr. Ratnakar, speaking to presspersons in Hosanagar on Friday, said the Minister initially passed an irresponsible statement on Congress. Later, he wanted to know why the girl was at the spot at that hour. “I wish he understands the responsibility of his position and speaks keeping six crore people in mind”, he said. Referring to Mr. Jnanendra’s statement on the girl visiting the place after dark, Mr. Kimmane Ratnakar said, “A jewellery shop was robbed in broad daylight. Do you expect the businessmen to close the shop even in the daytime? Do we need the police to suggest women stay at home?” he asked. ‘Should resign’ In Hassan, Janata Dal (Secular) State president H.K. Kumaraswamy said it was the responsibility of the police to ensure the safety of all people. “Mr. Araga Jnanendra has done good work as an MLA. But, he is finding it difficult to handle the important Home Ministry. He had expressed such a feeling within a couple of days after assuming his office. He should resign”, Mr. Kumaraswamy said. If the police were aware that the place, where the incident happened, was unsafe for women, they should have taken proper action much earlier. They had failed in their duty, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kimmane-slams-home-minister/article36147712.ece

28 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Corpn. decides not to impose penalty on faulty water meters||Mangaluru City Corporation council resolved in its meeting on Friday that no penalty will be imposed on water consumers henceforth for not repairing or changing their faulty water meters. Instead, those consumers who have not repaired or changed their faulty meters should be issued water bills on the basis of average quantity of water consumed during the period of the first and the subsequent water bills issued. It is as per the 1981 bylaws of the corporation pertaining to water supply. And, the civic body will no longer continue with the practice of imposing penalty which came into being on the basis of a resolution passed by the council on August 27, 1992. The council decided to do away with the system of imposing penalty as there is no legal basis for it. This was on vogue for the past about three decades. In addition, such consumers by objecting had also been requesting the civic body not to impose the penalty. Speaking at the meeting, Leader of Opposition A.C. Vinayraj said that neither the water supply bylaws of the corporation nor the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act 1976 permitted imposing penalty. Mayor Premananda Shetty said that there is no question of imposing penalty henceforth. He was not sure why the council had passed such a resolution (imposing penalty) about three decades ago. Water tariff Opposition Congress councillors demanded that the civic body should slash the water tariff revised for domestic consumers from April 1, 2019. It continues to be a burden on consumers, they said. The then administrator of the corporation had revised the minimum tariff from Rs. 65 for consumption up to 24,000 litres (or 24 kilo litres) to Rs. 56 for consumption up to 8,000 litres (or 8 kilo litres). Hence, the maximum quantity of water which can be used within the range of minimum tariff fixed had been reduced from 24,000 to 8,000 litres. The tariff revised to the next three levels of slabs or categories were: Rs. 9 per each kilo litre for above 8 kilo litres and up to 15 kilo litres category; Rs. 11 per each kilo litre for above the 15 kilo litres and up to 25 kilo litres category and Rs. 13 per each kilo litre for above the 25 kilo litres category. As per the revision, the six earlier slabs or categories had been revised to four slabs or categories. Responding to it, Corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar told the council that the government has in a letter on May 5, 2021 clarified that tariff cannot be slashed. Mr. Vinayraj said that the BJP councillors and MLAs could have led a delegation to the government to convince it of the need to slash water tariff during the last four months. Replying to it, the Mayor said that the government will be requested again to re-consider its stand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/corpn-decides-not-to-impose-penalty-on-faulty-water-meters/article36147691.ece
28 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Over Rs. 1,000 crore MLA area funds remain unused: Kageri||Expressing concern over the more than Rs. 1,000 crore MLA Area Development Funds remaining unutilised across the State, Speaker Vishweshar Hegde Kageri said here on Friday that he is making efforts to ensure that the funds are utilised at the earliest for welfare projects. Talking to reporters, Mr. Kageri said that Rs. 2 crore is given to an MLA every year for taking up projects in his constituency. Earlier, the Deputy Commissioner was overseeing implementation of these projects and since last year, Assistant Commissioners have been made in-charge. “But I still see funds remaining unutilised,” he said and added that Rs. 23 crore remained unutilised in Dakshina Kannada. Mr. Kageri said that he has been working on utilisation of MLA Area Development Funds since the last two years. “I am concerned about the money sanctioned by the State government remaining unutilised,” he said. There are many reasons for delay in utilisation of the amount. In some cases, there is a delay in giving the work estimate and in others, delay is caused due to administrative actions of the implementing agencies. In the projects that are completed, there has been technical glitches in uploading information delaying third party inspection and release of money to the contractor concerned. Session Mr. Kageri said that he has written to all Ministers and MLAs to attend the 10-day legislature session that starts on September 13.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/over-rs-1000-crore-mla-area-funds-remain-unused-kageri/article36147693.ece

Some councillors told the monthly meeting of the council that the corporation has widened roads in many places in the city. But the widened portions are being used for parking vehicles. People have been complaining that there is no space to walk. In some places, street vendors have occupied the roads. The Mayor said that there should be coordination for addressing traffic issues. Mr. Shetty did not agree with a suggestion by a councillor that the civic body should collect fee from MESCOM for installing poles and transformers on land under the control of the corporation. When some members pointed out that the menace of vendors occupying footpaths and roadsides continued even now, the Mayor instructed the revenue officials to resume the eviction drive on Monday. A visibly upset Mayor asked the officials what made them stop the eviction drive. The Mayor also directed an official of Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. (MSCL) not to go ahead with the construction of multi-level car parking facility near Balam Bhat Hall without the approval of the corporation. Councillors raised objections to MSCL going ahead with the project by keeping the elected council in the dark.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/meet-on-traffic-issues-next-week/article36147687.ece

28 August 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Jewellery heist case cracked, six nabbed||The police teams investigating the dacoity case in Mysuru in which a jewellery shop was looted and a bystander shot dead on Monday, have arrested six of the eight persons involved in the crime. Director General and Inspector General of Police Praveen Sood told media persons here on Friday that multiple teams worked on various leads and spread their dragnet which took them across 8 States and they were able to take 6 persons into custody while two more were on the run. The incident which sent shock waves in the languid city had raised serious questions of law and order situation but the police said they worked on various tip-offs and clues to crack the case. “It is a straight forward case of dacoity committed to loot the valuables and entailed the involvement of one person from Mysuru besides another accomplice from Kolar’’, said Mr. Sood. One of the accused has a background in jewellery business and had undergone imprisonment in a cheating case while another accused had similar background. “It was planned locally but six persons involved were from other States and this proved to be very challenging to the police in cracking the case’’, said Mr. Praveen Sood. The dacoits had tried to hoodwink the police and slipped away to different States so as to evade detection or raise suspicion. Though Mr.Sood did not divulge the nature of the clues and tip-offs, he said some of the accused were taken into custody “just 1 hour ago’’. The gang members had slipped out of Karnataka and while one was nabbed in Jammu and Kashmir, another person was nabbed in Kolkata while others were picked up from their hideouts in Rajasthan and Mumbai. The names of the accused were not divulged and Mr. Sood said they were all in transit and once they reach the city additional information will be secured from them. Mr.S ood said there are certain limitations due to the prevailing High Court orders on cases under investigations and he could not divulge additional information. The six under the police custody will be brought to the city after following the due procedures in the court besides obtaining transit warrants. The gang members had barged into Amruth Gold and Silver Palace at Vidyaranyapuram and had partially closed it after gagging the owner Dharmendra who was alone at that time. But Dharmendra’s relative Sharath Chandra Jain who was nearby saw the shop partially closed and rolled up the shutter. The gangsters panicked and opened fire using a pistol. The bullet missed the mark and instead hit a bystander identified later as Chandru of Dadadalli and he died on the spot. Meanwhile, Home Minister Araga Jnanendra announced Rs. 5 lakh to the police teams which investigated and cracked the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/jewellery-heist-case-cracked-six-nabbed/article36147716.ece
28 August 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Protests continue in Mysuru||Protests against the gang-rape in Mysuru and demand for resignation of Home Minister Araga Jnanendra continued in the city on Friday. Members of the Youth Congress tried to gherao Mr. Jnanendra during his visit to the city but their attempts were foiled by the police who resorted to caning. Meanwhile, KPCC spokesperson H.A. Venkatesh criticised the recent statements of Mr. Jnanendra on the issue as insensitive. Mr. Venkatesh said the Minister’s insensitive comments blaming the victim for being in a desolate place were reprehensible and has besmirched the reputation of Mysuru as a tourist and an educational centre which was also safe with low crime rate. The Congress spokesperson said the law and order in the State under the BJP has completely collapsed as Mysuru was witnessing a slew of crimes including murders and dacoity. Meanwhile, a fact finding committee of the Congress headed by its leader V.S.Ugrappa questioned the authorities as to why there was no security or patrolling in desolate places close to the city. The KPCC team did not want to politicise the heinous crime but the BJP had failed to safeguard the people. “Though the BJP leaders propagate Rama Rajya, what was witnessed in Mysuru was demonic and tantamounted to existence of Ravana Rajya,” said Mr. Ugrappa. Activists of Kannada Vedike and members of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) held separate demonstrations and expressed dismay over what they termed as collapse of law and order in Mysuru. Similarly, Human Rights Awareness Committee members too staged a demonstration and sought the immediate arrest of the culprits and their prosecution so as to secure justice to the rape victim. The Kannada Vedike activists said the police department has to be revamped and sought the resignation of the Home Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/protests-continue-in-mysuru/article36147719.ece

Permission will be given only for the sale of essential goods from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. Milk booths can function till 8 p.m. besides parcel services in hotels. Earlier, amidst the demand from traders for revoking weekend lockdown curbs in Mysuru, Mr. Somashekar had told reporters in Suttut “I’m going to Bengaluru on Friday evening to meet the Chief Minister who has returned from New Delhi. I will urge him to consider lifting the curbs as the pandemic is under control in the two districts.” The Minister said the test positivity rate (TPR) in both the districts was less than one per cent and therefore he would request the Chief Minister to consider withdrawing the curbs. Mysuru on Thursday reported 98 cases and three deaths. The active cases stand at 1,048.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/weekend-lockdown-to-continue/article36147717.ece
28 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Big jump in cases puts border districts on alert||After Kerala logged over 35,000 cases on Wednesday, concerns of cross-border spread grew in the border districts including Kodagu, a key transit route for travellers to enter the State. The high-risk districts continue to be on alert. The huge leap in cases and soaring TPR in Kerala have forced the districts to step up checks at the border checkposts for containing the spread. The border checkposts in Chamarajnagar and Mysuru are also on alert over unrelenting active transmission of infections in Kerala. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai has told health officials in border districts to do whatever it takes to prevent cross-border transmission. Authorities in Kodagu have decided to subject all travellers entering the State through the district for a mandatory COVID-19 test even though they were carrying RT-PCR negative reports. The travellers have to undergo Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) at the check-posts. “Only if the results are negative do they get entry into the State,” said Kodagu DHO Mohan. Dr. Mohan told The Hindu that RATs were done randomly all these days but the RATs will now be done to all travellers from Saturday and additional swab collectors are being deployed at Makutta checkpost. “We have more vehicle movement at Makutta and therefore more staff are being roped in for the task,” he said, adding that RAT kits are available for stepping tests at the checkposts. Kodagu is a high-risk district over everyday movement of people for trade and business reasons. Students also travel daily for college education. Workers are brought to Kodagu for coffee plantations. Precautions All precautions are in place at Bavali check post in Mysuru district. “If required, we have a Lab on Wheels facility which can be shifted to Bavali for stepping up the tests,” said K.H. Prasad, DHO, Mysuru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/big-jump-in-cases-puts-border-districts-on-alert/article36147714.ece
28 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Simha condemns ‘self-glorification’||Mysuru MP Pratap Simha has called upon Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai to put an end to the culture of ‘self-glorification’ by IAS and IPS officers through their various social media handles. He has written a three-page letter to the Chief Minister on the issue and called for a ‘comprehensive set of guidelines’ for projecting the various public welfare schemes undertaken by the government of Karnataka. This, the MP has said, will ‘shut out the higher bureaucracy from wrongfully appropriating credit through social media platforms by wading into a completely forbidden domain for self-glorification’. This is for the second time in recent days that Mr. Simha has raised the issue. He had earlier described the contents on social media handles of IAS and IPS officers as ‘pretensions’. Some fan pages and social media platforms were being used to peddle false narratives which, he said, potentially lead to online harassment. “Such a practice of garnering false publicity needs to be discouraged. The government should evolve a robust mechanism to keep a tab on the activities of some publicity-hungry IAS and IPS officers so that the misuse of social media platforms for promoting the personal agenda of bureaucrats could be prevented,” said Mr. Simha. He claims that a majority of citizens ‘concur’ with his views.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/simha-condemns-self-glorification/article36147720.ece
28 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Man, who fought COVID-19 twice and spent 104 days in the hospital, dies||Despite defeating COVID-19 twice after 104 days of hospital stay in Mysuru, Murugesh, who was recently discharged after finally testing negative for the infection but was still facing health complications, died on Wednesday night. Murugesh, a carpenter and resident of Ittigegud, was under oxygen support at home after his discharge but was suffering from complications due to severe damage to his lungs by the virus. Despite continuous oxygen support and medication, he did not survive, his family said. The lengthy fight against the virus and the successful recovery from an acute condition had become a sort of a case study for doctors, who had described it as one of the rarest cases of recovery after aggressive intensive care for 93 days and suffering from severe COVID-19 complications. Due to severe lung infection, Murugesh’s CT severity score showed 25/25 that stunned doctors. His case was said to be one of the longest hospital stays for a COVID-19 patient in the State or perhaps in South India. Hefty loans The victim’s relative Devaraj said Murugesh breathed his last following multi-organ failure. Doctors had started treating him at home but he did not respond to treatment. The sole earning member in his family, Murugesh leaves behind his wife and two young children. The family has borrowed hefty loans for his treatment. About Rs. 25 lakh was spent on his treatment, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/man-who-fought-covid-19-twice-and-spent-104-days-in-the-hospital-dies/article36147721.ece

District Health Officer Ravi said staff had come across some doubtful RT-PCR negative reports and denied entry to such travellers. RT-PCR negative report not older than 72 hours is a must to enter the State from Kerala. Travellers pass through Moolehole border check-post in Gundlupet taluk.

28 August 2021||Mysuru/Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Surveillance stepped up at districts bordering Kerala||After Kerala logged over 35,000 COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, concerns grew about cross-border spread in the border districts, including Kodagu, Dakshina Kannada, Chamarajanagar, and Mysuru, with heightened surveillance taken up at the border checkposts. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai has told health officials in the border districts to do “whatever it takes” to prevent cross-border transmission. Authorities in Kodagu have decided to subject all travellers entering the State through the district to mandatory COVID-19 test, even if they were carrying RT-PCR negative reports. They have to undergo Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) at the checkposts. “Only if the results are negative can they gain entry into the State,” said Kodagu District Health Officer (DHO) Mohan. Tests were done randomly earlier. Kodagu is a high-risk district because of the everyday movement of people for trade and business reasons. Students also travel daily for college. Workers are brought to Kodagu for coffee plantations. All precautions are in place at the Bavali check post in Mysuru district. “If required, we have a lab-on-wheels facility which can be shifted to Bavali for stepping up the tests,” said K.H. Prasad, DHO, Mysuru. At Chamarajanagar, all the check posts are active with stringent checks. In Dakshina Kannada, the district administration is keeping a close eye on the health of paramedical, engineering and other students from Kerala who are staying in hostels or commuting regularly. They are trying hard to screen people entering Dakshina Kannada at Talapady and 16 other border check posts, and ensuring that they carry the RT-PCR negative certificates. Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra said there were a good numberof people from Kerala entering with RT-PCR negative certificates, being quarantined, and then testing positive for COVID-19 after a week of quarantine. As many as 620 students from about 30 institutions tested positive in the last one month. The personnel at the 17 border check posts have been trained at detecting fake RT-PCR certificates, which are gradually increasing, he added. Meanwhile, protests are being held on and off by residents of Kasaragod district on the Kerala side of Talapady, asking Karnataka to allow free movement of people who have taken two doses of COVID-19 vaccine. The Kerala High Court recently asked the Karnataka Chief Secretary and the Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner to continue allowing those with medical emergencies and students without insisting on RT-PCR negative certificates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/surveillance-stepped-up-at-districts-bordering-kerala/article36147252.ece

Recently, a group of cardamom workers from Tamil Nadu attempted to forcefully enter plantations through the Kumily check-post, creating a law and order issue. The workers failed to carry COVID-19 certificates, said Ms. George. The Collector and a team of officials visited the check-post and gave directions regarding verification of certificates. Kumily Circle Inspector Jobin Antony said that the police would allow entry of those workers who have either taken both the doses of vaccine or possess negative result of RT-PCR test taken less than 72 hours before.

28 August 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||Forums oppose Aralam tourism||Various associations working for the uplift of tribal communities have voiced their strong protest against the proposal to establish tourism projects in the 3,750 acres of the Aralam farm. M. Geethanandan, convenor, Adivasi Gothra Mahasabha, said that any move to divert the land for other purposes would invite strong resistance. He said that 7,500 acres was acquired for rehabilitation of tribespeople at Aralam. However, 3,500 acres out of this was set aside as farmland to generate revenue for the welfare of the tribespeople. But they had not benefited and the farm was incurring losses. Now, based on a report submitted by the Kerala Agriculture University, which has been approved by the government, there was a plan to divert the land for farm tourism. Besides, there was a plan to introduce modern technology and other methods to develop farming there. This was to help corporates, he alleged. “This will be strongly resisted. The tribal community and the associations here demand that these land should be distributed to the tribals,” he said. Land allocation Mr. Geethanandan said there had been a great social change in the life of the people who were rehabilitated. However, there were many who had not received land here and were still waiting for its allocation. “From the beginning, we have been demanding that the land should be given to the tribals, as several applications for the land are still pending,” he said. Sreeraman Koyyon, president, Adivasi Dalit Munneta Samithi, said around 3,000 families had received land in the farm but it was unfit for agriculture. Many had abandoned the land and gone back to their old colonies, he said. Rights over farm He said that after 2007, there were 11,000 new tribal families in Kannur district which had submitted applications for land. Besides, the tribespeople in Wayanad too had rights over the Aralam farm. However, without considering these facts, the land was being diverted for other purposes to benefit people with vested interests, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tribal-groups-protest-against-tourism-projects-at-aralam/article36147581.ece
28 August 2021||Kannur,KERALA||Tribal student falls from tree trying to chase Net, injured||A tribal student at the Panniyode tribal colony in the Kannavam forest, Kannur, sustained injuries after he fell from a tree on Thursday while trying to get a better signal on his mobile phone to check Plus One allotment online. The 16-year-old student Anandu Babu, was admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital, Kannur. According to doctors, he sustained three fractures in the vertebra and both feet. The boy would require four weeks of rest and his condition was normal, said Medical Superintendent K. Sudeep. Plight of students His mother P.R. Usha told The Hindu that Anandu, along with his sister, went out to download the study material sent by teachers on the mobile and also to check the status of Plus One allotment. “There is only one mobile for the three siblings and they regularly climb up a tree in the forest near our house for getting internet connection. This has been the ordeal ever since the pandemic forced the closure of schools,” she said. On Thursday afternoon, Anandu fell down when the branch of the tree he was standing on, broke under his weight. “The accident would not have occurred if our appeal for a proper internet connection in the area had been addressed,” said Ms.Usha. “All the children in nearby schools face a similar situation ,” she said. Government criticised Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said the plight of Anandu belied the government’s claim that it had narrowed the digital divide in education. He said the predicament of students at the Kannavum colony was just the tip of the iceberg. Mr. Satheesan said a large section of students remained outside the periphery of online education. The government’s claim to the contrary was mere bluster. The UDF had flagged the issue several times in the Assembly to no avail, he said. Meanwhile, the State Human Rights Commission registered a case and ordered an inquiry into the incident. Judicial member Baiju Nath directed Kannur Collector T.V. Subhash to conduct an inquiry and submit a report within 15 days.  Our appeal for a proper internet connection in the area has not been addressed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tribal-student-falls-from-tree-trying-to-chase-net-injured/article36147618.ece
28 August 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||Cycle tracks nearing completion in Kannur||Soon, the people in Kannur Corporation will be able to have a hassle-free ride on their bicycle in the Army cantonment and adjoining areas, as the work for the first cycle tracks in the district is in the stages of completion. The cycle tracks are being constructed under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation at a cost of Rs. 2.01 crore. With the completion of the tracks, people will be able to enjoy a cycle ride on a 2-km stretch beginning from Prabhat Junction to Sangeetha theatre. According to corporation officials, since there were several schools in the area, they had chosen the place for constructing the tracks in the Cantonment area. Besides, it would also benefit people who visited the beach nearby. One of the tracks is between Sangeetha theatre in the corporation area and the Payyambalam Government Girls Higher Secondary School. The distance of the track is 418 metre with a width of 2.20 metre. The other track from Payyambalam Ursuline School to Prabhat Junction is in the final stages of construction. But due to the takeover of land by the Cantonment Board opposite St. Michael’s Anglo-Indian Higher Secondary School, the work to complete the track was pending here, said an official. Though the track was earlier planned to be extended to the new bus stand, due to space constraints it was cut short to Prabhat Junction. The distance here is 2 km and it is 2.20-metre wide. An amount of Rs. 1.62 crore has been allotted for the project. Kannur Mayor T.O. Mohanan said that the cycling track would encourage more people to take up cycling. This would also help in reducing the air pollution. However, the Kannur Cycle Club expressed disappointment over the way the tracks have been designed and constructed. Kannur Cycle Club president Ratheesan said the tracks were not cyclist-friendly. It will not serve the purpose and will be encroached on by pedestrians as it happened in Kozhikode. Without a guard rail, the track constructed above the road level would pose a danger to cyclists, he said. “Children riding cycles may fall on to the road. This shows lack of planning,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cycle-tracks-in-final-stages-of-construction-in-kannur/article36147579.ece
28 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Emissions make life hard for Eloor, Kadungalloor residents||Life has become miserable for residents of Eloor and Kadungalloor following unchecked pollution caused by industrial emissions. Despite repeated pleas, the authorities have not been able to resolve the issue. The residents along with elected representatives have stepped up protests demanding action against the polluting industries. “In Kadungalloor, the pungent smell and emissions have turned severe in Wards 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21. People are really worried, as the situation becomes worse during night hours,” said panchayat president Suresh Muttathil. “Officials of the State Pollution Control Board told us that the pollution was caused by emissions from 11 units in the industrial area located within the panchayat’s jurisdiction. These include rubber and meat waste processing units,” he added. The residents and elected members of Eloor and Kadungallor held protests in front of the Environment Surveillance Centre of the PCB at Eloor demanding immediate action to check industrial emissions and pungent odour experienced in many wards. Board officials pointed out that the emissions came from units involved in the processing of rubber, bonemeal, and chicken waste. Biofilter units The board had asked the units to set up biofilter units to control the foul smell. However, preliminary investigations revealed that the biofilter units might not be working properly. The usage of additional quantities of raw materials had also enhanced the severity of the current situation. A meeting will be held at the Kadungalloor panchayat hall on September 1 to discuss the issue, they said. The board is likely to seek the services of the CSIR-National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (NIIST) to estimate the source of industrial emissions reported in the affected areas. A proposal has also been made to utilise the expertise of start-ups in tracking the exact source of emissions by installing necessary tools at the units concerned. River pollution The Eloor municipality and Kadungalloor panchayat authorities had also expressed concerns over the increasing incidents of dumping untreated effluents from industrial units into the Periyar. They feared that drinking water supply systems would be hit following the release of effluents into the river.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/emissions-make-life-hard-for-eloor-kadungalloor-residents/article36147598.ece

The Environment Surveillance Centre at Eloor is yet to have an assistant environment engineer, whose services could be used exclusively for monitoring the river and the industrial area. Senior board officials in Ernakulam said the request for such a post at the Eloor centre had been pending for long. The board is depending on persons employed on contract basis for collecting samples in the wake of illegal discharge of effluents into the river. They lack state-of-the-art equipment to ensure proper sampling. The surveillance camera installed at the regulator-cum-bridge at Pathalam has not been functioning, and no steps have been taken to repair it. Residents and environmentalists have been complaining that the board has not been able to collect samples without delay after an incident of effluent discharge into the river. Efforts to locate the source of pollution and violators have been hit owing to the lack of manpower at the central lab of the board. Nearly 60 permanent posts have been lying vacant, according to senior officials.

Though the court, noted Justice Devan Ramachandran, was not aware of the truth of the statements in the newspapers, the fact that the family comprised a middle-aged woman and two minor children persuaded the court to seek a report on the matter. The court, which directed the registry to place the file along with the copy of the newspaper report before the Chief Justice to decide whether the case could be treated as a suo motu matter, has called for a detailed report from the Kollam district police chief. The judge directed the police to provide protection to the family without causing any harassment or prejudice to any other person, including those against whom complaints have been made.

A resident of the tsunami rehabilitation flat complex at Eravipuram, Manju had to travel from Kollam to Ernakulam and back with her teenage son and daughter, fearing attack from anti-socials. "We have made all the necessary arrangements for the family to stay safely at Gandhibhavan. Since the family includes a 15-year-old boy, it is not possible to shift them to a women's shelter, and they can stay together at Gandhibhavan. We will provide all the facilities for the children to continue their education," said Kerala State Women's Commission (KSWC) member Shahida Kamal who visited them on Friday. Threats and abuses According to the family, they have been facing threats and abuses from anti-socials after Manju had an argument with them. They retaliated by circulating a video mocking Manju's 17-year-old daughter, following which the family filed a case at the Eravipuram police station. Reportedly, the family has been living in constant fear ever since, as a couple of persons involved in the case started harassing them. They allege that miscreants kept knocking on her door and switched off the power connection to the house. Scared to stay at home, the 38-year-old had to flee and spend the night in the railway compartment. "We have asked the police for a report and the commission will also provide legal support for the family. Farook College, Kozhikode, has offered to take care of the girl's education. They want to relocate to a new place, and right now, we have ensured a safe place to stay," said Ms. Kamal. The family’s statement was taken in the presence of Gandhibhavan secretary Punalur Somarajan and Assistant Police Commissioner A. Pradeep Kumar. The Kerala State Human Rights Commission had registered a suo motu case in the incident and directed the district administration to take necessary steps. Police deny lapse Meanwhile, the Eravipuram police said there has been no lapse on their part. "Three persons were arrested and remanded following her complaint. She has also filed complaints against certain other women from the flat complex. So far, the police have taken all the necessary steps," said a police official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/harassed-single-mother-family-get-safe-haven/article36147573.ece

Mohamed Riyas by inaugurating the laboratory at the Government Vocational Higher Secondary School, Cheruvannur, in the city. The laboratories are being set up under the aegis of Haritha Keralam Mission and the Department of Education at schools in their already existing chemistry labs, using funds provided by local MLAs. “Having a water testing lab in every local body, we are saved from travelling to labs at high-end institutions, to get water from our wells and rivers tested,” the Minister said on the occasion. The 12 labs have been set up in Beypore, Kozhikode South, Kunnamangalam and Koyilandy constituencies in Kozhikode district. The new labs are at Seva Mandir Post Basic Higher Secondary School, Ramanattukara; Government Ganapath Higher Secondary School, Feroke; C.M. Higher Secondary School, Kadalundi; GHSS, Cheruvannur; GVHSS, Azhchavattam; GHSS, Kuttichira; GHSS, Medical College Campus; GHSS, Kunnamangalam; GHSS, Iringallur; GVHSS, Payyoli, and GVHSS, Koyilandy. They are part of a State-wide initiative to make water safe for the public. In the long run, there will be one such lab in every local body. More labs will soon be set up at two schools in Thiruvambady constituency, five in Balussery, 10 in Perambra, and five in Nadapuram. “As contamination is the root cause of waterborne diseases, purity and safety of water should be ensured to prevent them. Hence, these public laboratories have been set up where basic water testing could be done at a very low rate. We also plan to get students involved in the project in order to groom them into ambassadors of water safety,” said P. Prakashan, District Coordinator of Haritha Keralam Mission, said. The labs can be used to test the colour, smell, Ph value, conductivity, salt content, quantity of dissolved solids, amount of nitrate, ammonia, and coliform bacteria in water. Mayor Beena Philip presided over the event. Former MLA of Beypore, V.K.C. Mammad Koya, who had contributed to the initiative from his local development fund, was the guest of honour.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/water-testing-labs-opened-at-schools-in-kozhikode/article36147574.ece
28 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Power fences to be fixed to ward off wild animals in Kozhikode||As a temporary solution to wild animal menace, the Forest Department has decided to repair all damaged power fences along forest borders in Kozhikode district. Considering the rise in complaints from settler farmers, more vulnerable areas will be identified to erect power fences. Fences will be first set up in the Thiruvambady Assembly constituency. Threat from wild animals, including elephants and boars, has been rampant for several years thanks to the proximity of farm lands to forest borders. Though there are trenches in some areas, a majority of farmers are still vulnerable. Meanwhile, farmers’ organisations said damaged power fences had not been repaired for years owing to fund shortage. Despite taking up the matter with the authorities, there had been no favourable response till recently, they complained. Moreover, the Forest Department has not favoured a proposal of settler farmers to plant a thorny variety of wild palms along forest borders to prevent the entry of wild animals. Farmers alleged that the department had cold-shouldered their offer to help complete the planting process. On Friday, a section of farmers staged a protest in front of the Thamarassery Forest Office.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/power-fences-to-be-repaired-to-ward-off-wild-animals/article36147588.ece

The incident came to light when local investors who had made advance payment as part of a special gold scheme approached the police claiming that the shop owners had gone back on their promise. According to the complainants, there were even large-scale investors who had invested gold for financial returns. Even small-scale investors had exchanged gold with the shop for monthly or annual returns, they said. The Nadapuram police said they had already recovered some documents pertaining to the scheme. However, the shop owners are yet to respond and report at the police station. Some investors said the partners had multiple branches in the city, and that they had also been mobilising money and gold offering attractive returns. A police official said the details of those who had joined the scheme were not available. At the same time, the ornaments collected for the scheme were reportedly safe. Learning about the suspected fraud, several investors on Thursday gheraoed the jewellery outlet staff. Attempts by the police to contact the owners did not succeed, as their phones were switched off. In a similar incident in the past, nearly 200 investors were allegedly duped by a Hyderabad-based company. The company had mobilised Rs. 300 crore from various parts of the country. The kingpin was arrested after a Crime Branch probe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/probe-on-into-alleged-investment-fraud/article36147587.ece

The test positivity rate again rose from 18.03% to 19.22% on Friday. The State’s active case pool is poised to cross two lakh and now stands at 1,95,254. The number of patients reported to have recovered on the day was 18,573. 179 deaths The official cumulative COVID-19 case fatality now stands at 20,313 with the State adding 179 deaths, most of which occurred in the past few days, to the official list on Friday. Current ICU occupancy of COVID patients in both public and private hospitals has been rising since the past two days. On Friday, if 39 people were newly admitted to ICUs, 65 were newly put on ventilator support. ICU occupancy was 2,170 on Friday and those requiring ventilator support jumped from 757 to 822 on the day. The government is keeping a sharp eye on hospitalisations as the daily cases are surging. However, though the total hospitalisation figure has not risen significantly (because of a good recovery rate), the number of new patients reaching hospitals has been soaring since the past two days. The number of patients newly admitted to hospitals rose significantly for the second day from 2,890 on Thursday to 3,101 on Friday. Total hospitalisation figures rose slightly from 27,425 on Thursday to 28,545 on Friday.

28 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Follow norms strictly, State told||The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has reiterated that Kerala define containment zones as per GOI guidelines with a focus on high transmission clusters. It has also sought that contact tracing efforts be further scaled up to ensure that 20-25 contacts per positive cases are identified and quarantined. Rajesh Bhushan, Union Health Secretary, in a letter to V.P. Joy, Chief Secretary, on Friday said these measures were necessary, considering the sharp rise in daily cases, deaths, and test positivity rates after Onam festivities in Kerala, and the likelihood of this continuing for the next few days. Though the State undertook several measures to contain the transmission of COVID-19, the desired results were yet to materialise, Mr. Bhushan said. Kerala was now contributing to more than half the active cases reported in the country and all 14 districts in the State were identified as districts of concern due to high test positivity rates and high case per million reported in these past four weeks. Thrissur, Ernakulam and Kozhikode reported more than 4,000 cases over million population in the week ending August 25, he pointed out. He said that the current positivity rate, which was very high, mandated a further increase in testing and targetted testing needed to be enhanced in containment zones. Mr. Bhushan also asked Kerala to enhance genomic surveillance in areas of high and sustained disease transmission and that samples of all cases of vaccine breakthrough infections and re-infections be sent for genomic sequencing. Clinico-epidemiological assessment of all such cases needed to be done promptly and the results shared with the National Centre for Disease Control. Most importantly, Mr. Bhushan asked Kerala to draw up a specific strategy to complete the second dose vaccination of beneficiaries. He pointedly said any laxity in ensuring strict adherence to the five-fold strategy of test-track-treat-vaccinate-ensure COVID-appropriate behaviour could lead to a further surge in transmission, not just in Kerala, but in neighbouring States also.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/follow-norms-strictly-state-told/article36147790.ece
28 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Sero survey to be held in all districts in September||Kerala will do a seroprevalence study across all districts to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the community, which will give an indication of the proportion of the population which has had prior, silent exposure to the virus. The study will be taken up in the first or second week of September, as soon as the district-level training and logistics issues are finalised, senior health officials said. The seroprevalence study (measuring SARS-CoV-2 antibody level in blood samples) will help assess the level of herd immunity in the population, derived either through natural infection or through vaccination, and give insights into the dynamics of the pandemic. Objectives It will help the State identify populations or geographic locales where the virus penetration is low and evolve future strategies for disease prevention and control. The fourth round of national-level sero survey done by the ICMR had reported that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies had been detected in just 42.7% of the population in the State. However, as this was a survey to get national-level estimates, the survey had been done in just three districts (Ernakulam, Palakkad and Thrissur) with around 400 plus samples each. The ICMR had directed that the States do their own surveys to get a regional estimation of seroprevalence. Study protocol The seroprevalence study planned by the State proposes to study the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the general population above 18 years (total of 4,470 samples) as well as in specific population groups such as antenatal women (2,575), children aged 5-17 years (1,520), tribal population (1,710), coastal folk (1,800), urban slum communities (1,800). The total sample size thus comes to 13,875.  The State will use for its survey the same antibody testing kits which were used by the ICMR for its sero survey. All blood samples will be tested for antibodies using Chemiluminescent immunoassay technology using two kits: SARS-CoV-2 IgG S1 RBD antibodies (Siemens assay) and SARS-CoV-2 IgG Nucleocapsid antibodies (Abbott assay). Two kits have become necessary as the population has been administered two vaccines- Covishield, which targets the virus’s spike protein to generate an immune response, and Covaxin, which is a whole inactivated virus vaccine that produces antibodies against both S and N proteins. The Additional Director (PH) and the Director, State Public Health Laboratory, Thiruvananthapuram, will supervise the sero survey activity. The district surveillance officers and the sero survey nodal officers will implement the activity with the laboratories in their respective district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sero-survey-to-be-held-in-all-districts-in-september/article36147607.ece

This marked the first time the district breached the 2,000-mark in daily caseload since June 12 when 2,234 cases were recorded. While 1,258 people recovered from the illness during the last 24 hours, the active case count stood at 12,067. A test positivity rate of 13.9% has also been recorded in the district. Among the new set of cases, 2,150 have been attributed to local transmission of the infection, while the source of infection was unknown among the rest. Six health care workers were among those diagnosed with the disease. The increasing COVID-19 caseload also appeared to push the fatality rate in the district. Following several days when the number of deaths remained in the single-digit, as many as 12 recent deaths were attributed to the disease on Friday. As many as 3,511 people have succumbed to the disease thus far. The case fatality ratio neared one in the district. A total of 28,298 people were currently in quarantine in various parts of the district. These included 2,538 people who were ordered to self-isolate themselves during the last 24 hours.

28 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Film chamber to tighten norms on titles||The Kerala Film Chamber of Commerce has decided to tighten norms regarding film titles and publicity materials following recent controversies over titles and posters of certain upcoming movies. The chamber has also rejected the registration application submitted by the producer of the film Eesho , directed by Nadirsha, citing the producer's non-renewal of his registration with the chamber. After publicity materials of Eesho were released online recently, there was a severe backlash from some religious groups. The Kerala High Court had rejected a petition from the Christian Association for Social Action against certification of the movie. However, the chamber now seems to be wary of controversies and opposition from religious groups. Norms flouted Speaking to The Hindu , film chamber secretary Anil Thomas said the existing norms stipulate that the title has to be registered with the chamber before the commencement of the film’s shooting, though it is now being flouted. "In the case of Eesho , we did not even go into the norms, as the producer has not renewed his registration. They can certainly re-apply, but there is only a remote chance of it being cleared," said Mr. Thomas. However, the film's producer, Arun Narayanan, said he has not yet received any official communication regarding the rejection. "I got a letter from them on August 8, seeking an explanation for not registering the title before shooting. I replied immediately that the film did not have a title all through the shooting, which was completed on April 14. We went ahead with the working title 'Production No.1'. It was only in May that we decided the title. As for my registration, I need to wait for more clarity from them," said Mr. Narayanan. Mr. Thomas said the Centre had given powers to all film chambers for clearance of publicity materials. The Kerala chamber has now decided to reject all applications submitted after the shooting or after the launch of publicity campaign. “In recent times, we have rejected titles like 'C/O Maharaja's College' and ‘Gagulthayile Kozhipporu’ due to these reasons. We also do not allow titles that are too similar to existing ones. In case of posters, we now ensure that there are no images of smoking or drinking or those of actors riding motorcycles without helmets,” said Mr. Thomas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/film-chamber-to-tighten-norms-on-titles/article36147613.ece

Tested positive In a letter to the Secretary, Kerala Assembly, on Friday, association president B. Reji and general secretary Anwar Sultan M.S. said that several of the staff and their family members had tested positive. Although KLSA had brought the matter to the notice of the authorities, effective measures were not taken, they alleged. KLSA has urged the Assembly authorities to put off all activities including the meetings of the Assembly committees for the next two weeks and initiate urgent COVID-19 management measures. The Secretary, Kerala Assembly, refuted the claim that a large number of the Assembly staff had tested positive following the second session.

The State government issued orders this month instructing district collectors to roll out the campaign in their respective jurisdictions. For its smooth implementation, ‘Jal Shakti Kendras’ will be established at all the district headquarters. The government has also appointed the Secretary, Water Resources, as the nodal officer of the campaign. Helmed by the National Water Mission (NWM), the national-level campaign themed on ‘Catch the rain where it falls, when it falls’ envisages the creation of suitable rainwater harvesting structures—with active public participation—for urban and rural regions. Water harvesting Mapping and cataloguing of all existing waterbodies/water harvesting structures—wells and ponds included—using National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA) data and GIS technology forms a key component of Jal Shakti Abhiyan. NWM has also prepared the guidelines for the inventory of water bodies and creation of GIS-based water conservation plans at the district-level. Converging schemes “Rather than being a specific scheme, the campaign would require districts to converge existing water-related schemes and water harvesting programmes. Creation of the district-level database on water bodies is a priority,” Pranabjyoti Nath, Secretary (Water Resources), and nodal officer of the campaign in Kerala, said. Other important targets of the campaign include maintenance and revival of rainwater harvesting structures. In the long run, this wealth of data, which will be uploaded online, is expected to aid the future planning of district-level water conservation plans. NWM is providing an incentive-based financial grant up to Rs. 2 lakh to each district. Initially, Rs. 1 lakh will be disbursed as grant and the rest of the amount will be released on the basis of performance and quality of work in each district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/waterbodies-to-be-documented/article36147584.ece
28 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Pinarayi disputes Oppn. charge||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday disputed the Opposition’s charge that Kerala’s COVID-19 management model had failed. Not one person has died due to a lack of supplementary oxygen or medical attention in Kerala. Hospitals did not fill up with infected persons. Bodies of the COVID dead did not float around unattended in the rivers and lagoons. Pyres did not burn for weeks on end in Kerala, he said. At least three back-to-back zero surveillance surveys had revealed that Kerala was the least infected State in the country. The pandemic death rate in the State was the lowest in the country (0.5%). Kerala's vaccine wastage was zero. The State has not undercounted COVID-19 deaths. Kerala's testing rate was the highest in the country. “Which other model should Kerala chose?” he asked. The Chief Minister made his counter argument in an article published in a Communist Party of India (Marxist) magazine on the occasion of the second Left Democratic Front (LDF) government completing 100 days in power. Onus on Centre An estimated 53% of the State's population had not contracted COVID-19 due to strict adherence to pandemic regulations. Hence, the State could outpace the pandemic by ramping up vaccination of the vulnerable population. The onus was on the Centre to ensure an uninterrupted vaccine supply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pinarayi-disputes-oppn-charge/article36147611.ece
28 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Heavy rainfall likely in State over weekend||Parts of Kerala can expect heavy rainfall over the weekend, the IMD has warned. It attributed the sudden increase in rainfall activity to an offshore trough at mean sea level running from the Karnataka coast to the Kerala coast and the likely formation of a low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal by Saturday. Idukki, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, and Kannur are on orange alert on Saturday given the likelihood of extremely heavy rainfall. All other districts are on yellow alert for isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall. Orange alert for extremely heavy rainfall has been issued for Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Idukki, Palakkad, Malappuram, Wayanad, and Kottayam on Sunday. All other districts except Thiruvananthapuram are on yellow alert for isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall. Isolated heavy rainfall is likely in the State on Monday also, the IMD said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/heavy-rainfall-likely-in-state-over-weekend/article36147617.ece
28 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Staff forums object to draft power regulations||Employees’ organisations in the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) have demanded the Kerala State Electricity Regulatory Commission (KSERC) to withdraw the conditions in the draft ‘KSERC (Terms and Conditions for Determination of Tariff) Regulations, 2021’ that are detrimental to the State’s power sector. In a joint statement, the KSEB Officers’ Association and the KSEB Workers’ Association alleged that the draft regulations obliquely support the privatisation policies followed by the Central government in the power sector. Conditions in the draft regulations unduly favour high-end power consumers and recommend reduction even in the necessary expenditures of the KSEB, the unions said. The draft proposes to allow open access consumers to purchase surplus electricity from the KSEB at the low power exchange rates. It also seeks to waive cross subsidy surcharge and wheeling charges. Such measures, the unions alleged, would ultimately impact the power tariffs of the ordinary consumer and lead to tariff hikes. Further, the draft regulations also favour different tariff structures for different distribution licensees, a stand which would enable private players to 'cherry-pick' high-end consumers, they alleged.  Financial stability The financial stability of the KSEB was paramount in ensuring the comprehensive development of the State’s power sector. Any regulation for tariff determination should reflect the peculiarities of electricity consumption patterns in the State, the unions said. The draft regulations published by the commission also contradicted the unanimous stand taken by the Kerala Assembly against the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2021, the unions said, adding that they would organise strong agitations against the proposals with the support of the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/proposals-in-draft-electricity-regulations-draw-flak/article36147570.ece

While the contract agreement for the four-laning of the NH-66 bypass Kazhakuttom-Mukkola stretch did not contain provision for the bridge, its feasibility was being studied on account of the demands raised by the local community. A detailed project report was also been prepared for the same. This was revealed by Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari in a letter written to Shashi Tharoor, MP, in reply to two representations made recently. Among the various demands the Thiruvananthapuram MP had made, he requested the Union Minister to construct a service bridge at Thiruvallam. The provision for the proposed work will now be included in the contract that is being prepared for the ongoing construction of the elevated highway from Kazhakuttom to Technopark junction. Mr. Gadkari, however, remained non-committal towards the demand raised by political parties to waive off the user fee for local residents. The Union Minister said the user fee notification provided for a monthly pass of Rs. 285 for local non-commercial vehicles of those within 20 km of the toll plaza. Meanwhile, the protest against toll collection intensified at the toll plaza after Youth Congress workers gheraoed the NHAI project director P. Pradeep at his office near Vallakkadavu. Mr. Pradeep said that the collection of user fees would continue at Thiruvallam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/service-road-bridge-to-be-built-at-thiruvallam/article36147785.ece

Dramatic scenes occurred at a special meeting convened on the request of 23 Opposition councillors for a discussion on the master plan. The Opposition wants the master plan to be dropped. They alleged that many religious institutions and houses would be affected by the new master plan. They said the Corporation was trying to protect the interests of the land mafia. As soon as the meeting started, Mayor M.K. Varghese announced that he was dissolving the meeting as there were technical objections to discussing the master plan. Parallel meeting Opposition councillors led by Rajan K. Pallan ran to the well and questioned the move. They gheraoed the Mayor, shouted slogans, and stopped him from leaving the council hall, prompting the LDF councillors to intervene. Heated arguments followed between the two sides. The ruling and Opposition councillors clashed with each other. They ignored COVID-19 protocol, including physical distancing. Senior leaders soon intervened to avoid untoward situations. In between, Mr. Pallan convened a parallel council meeting in the council hall and declared that the master plan was being dismissed. The Leader of the Opposition called the Mayor, who rejected the demand of 30 councillors for voting on the master plan, an autocrat. Day-night protest As soon as the Mayor reached his chamber, BJP councillors sat in front of his chamber. Later, they were removed by the police. The Congress councillors started a day-night protest in the council. The Corporation council had witnessed untoward situations even before on the master plan. While the ruling councillors argued that there is no need for further discussions on the master plan as it had been approved by the government in February, 2021, the Opposition alleged corruption in the name of the master plan. BJP against plan In the 55-member council, the ruling LDF has 25 members while the Congress has 24. With the six BJP councillors too opposing the master plan, the ruling front has become a minority in the master plan issue. Hence, the Congress demanded a vote on the issue, which was refused by the Mayor. Meanwhile, the District Congress Committee expressed its solidarity with the councillors who have been protesting inside the council.  The Opposition alleges that several religious institutions and houses will be affected by the plan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pandemonium-in-thrissur-corpn-over-master-plan/article36147672.ece
28 August 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Opposition to move High Court||The Opposition in the Thrissur Corporation will move the High Court against the master plan brought out by the Left Democratic Front (LDF)-led council. “The master plan has been imposed on the Corporation by the LDF government. This is an encroachment on the powers of the local body,” said Opposition leader Rajan K. Pallan. Corrupt deals worth crores of rupees were involved in the master plan. “We will continue our fight, demanding a Vigilance investigation into corrupt deals,” Mr. Pallan said. “The Mayor dissolved the emergency council meeting without allowing a discussion or vote on the master plan. The Opposition will give notice for a special meeting again,” he said. Only 25 members of the 55-member council support the master plan. The government can approve a master plan only if it has the council’s approval, he said. “How can a master plan, which was approved by the State government in 2021, have the signature of Ajitha Vijayan, who was Mayor in 2019? Criminal action should be taken against the former Mayor,” Mr. Pallan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/opposition-to-move-high-court/article36147761.ece

It is learnt that a villager named Kondappa (58), a Dalit, died on Friday. His relatives then took his body to a plot of land identified as a cremation ground in the village. However, on arriving there, other villagers allegedly barred them from performing the last rites. The relatives then carried Kondappa’s body to the Tahsildar’s office in Lepakshi and sat on a dharna with the body demanding immediate identification of the land as a cremation ground and that they be allowed to perform cremations there. When contacted, Tahsildar Katam Babu said that he was on a training session in Anantapur and returned to Konduru by evening and ensured that the body was cremated there on that land. Police arrested the villagers who tried to stop the Dalits from entering the cremation ground and the issue was resolved, Mr. Babu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dalits-barred-from-performing-last-rites/article36147742.ece

Parvathi, who is currently posted at Dharmavaram as Divisional Panchayat Officer. In her judgment communicated on Thursday, the Judge opined that “in the light of the law laid down by the apex court, what needs to be seen is the possibility of the applicant to flee from justice; the possibility of the accused’s likelihood to repeat similar or other offences. In this case, Parvathi is not posted in Banaganapalle, where the crime is alleged to have taken place, and as the petitioner is working in a different location, she cannot tamper with the evidence.” “The court deemed it appropriate to grant pre-arrest bail to petitioner B. Parvathi,” the order said. The accused was granted bail on executing a self-bond for Rs. 20,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pre-arrest-bail-for-panchayat-officer-granted/article36147748.ece
28 August 2021||Belagavi,ANDHRA PRADESH||4 held on charge of raping minor Dalit girl in Belagavi||The police have registered a case against five persons on the charge of raping a minor Dalit girl in a village in Belagavi district. The police have named Ramesh Maruti Kodli, Siddappa Ramappa Jokanakatti, Ramappa Vithal Tasali, Vithal Satheppa Kodli and Parasappa Rayappa Jattennanavar as accused. They are all from the same village. The case was filed under the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and Prevention of Atrocities (Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) Act. The offence is said to have happened more than a month ago. But the girl’s parents did not approach the police as they were said to have been threatened by the accused, the family told an officer of the Department of Women and Child Welfare. However, the First Information Report states that the cause of delay was discussion about the incident at home and the need to approach the Women’s Helpline for help. According to one of the officers handling the case, two days ago, relatives of the 15-year-old girl approached members of the District Child Welfare Committee. Counsellors on the committee spoke to the girl and her parents for some time. They expressed moral support to the victim and convinced her parents of the need to file a complaint with the police. The victim’s brother approached the Women’s Helpline on Thursday. On the instruction of Superintendent of Police Lakshman Nimbaragi, a team of police officers and a Child Development and Protection officer visited the village. They assured the victim’s parents of all protection. The police arrested four of the accused from two places in the district on Friday. They have been sent to Hindalga Jail. A team has been formed to investigate the case further and trace Ramappa Vithal Tasali, who is absconding. The Superintendent of Police expressed the confidence that the accused on the run will be caught soon. “Those arrested will be produced before a magistrate on Saturday,” he said. According to the complaint, the girl was gang-raped in a field not far from her house. The five accused took the victim to a field, on the outskirts of the village. “However, after the incident, they threatened her that they would kill her and her parents, if the incident was reported. This had delayed the filing of the case,’’ an officer who was on the counselling team told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/4-held-on-charge-of-raping-minor-dalit-girl-in-belagavi/article36147156.ece

The judge, holding full additional charge of special judge for trial of cases under the POCSO Act, further sentenced the convict to undergo simple imprisonment for one year and pay a fine of Rs. 1000 under Section 506 of the IPC. It may be recalled that the horrific incident sparked widespread public outrage and protests by women’s organisations demanding stringent punishment to the accused who resorted to the heinous act on the pretext of “online instruction assistance” by taking advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic-induced closure of schools at the fag-end of last year. The accused was found guilty for the offences punishable under sections 376 AB, 376 C, 506 of IPC and Section 6 of POCSO Act and he has been convicted under Section 235 (2) of Cr.

Forest Range Officer (Palamaner) Srinivasulu said the tusker, while crossing into Jagamarla from the sanctuary, was blocked by the presence of barbed wire fencing. The confused pachyderm in order to find an entry from the roadside into the reserve forest kept moving along the highway and this led to stranding of vehicular traffic for several minutes. Later, forest personnel cut the fencing to allow the wild elephant pass into the forest. The official said that except for moving along the highway and criss-crossing it often, the wild elephant did not show any signs of charging at the public. Enthusiastic youth tried to move closer to the giant elephant to take selfies, but were prevented by the forest personnel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/wild-tusker-blocks-traffic-on-nh/article36147210.ece

28 August 2021||KADAPA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Ethiopian woman heads home, finally||Born in a poverty-stricken family in Ethiopia, she had migrated to Kuwait in search of livelihood. Her love with a Kadapa man made her move to India for turning a new page in life. As fate would have it, her fiance died before tying the nuptial knot, leaving her in dire straits. After leading a trauma-filled life for six years in Kadapa, Yemanebirhan Atsede Seteye finally reached home early on Friday. Having been through turbulent times for several years, the 33-year-old woman stands today as a symbol of courage. While working in the gulf nation, she had befriended Kamisetti Ramana, a native of Rajampeta, who was eking out a living as a car driver. It appeared to augur well when the two decided to enter wedlock in October 2015. After arranging her a rented accommodation in Kadapa, Ramana had gone back to Kuwait for a short stint to make more money. As her visa validity lapsed, she was in for another shocking news in the form of Ramana’s death in Kuwait. After his body arrived in Rajampet and the final rites were performed on March 6, 2020, Ms. Yemanebirhan started staring at a blank future. It was then she poured out her woes to the Foreigners Registration Office (FRO) in the Special Branch of Kadapa police, with a plea to send her back home. “Being a stranger to the people around, the language, culture and food habits, and with no job to ensure sustenance, she was undergoing a lot of trauma,” Superintendent of Police K.K.N. Anburajan told The Hindu . She had to experience another shocker when she tested positive for COVID-19 a few months ago, when the Police Department again rushed to her support. Special Branch inspector U. Venkata Kumar and constable G. Subba Raju struggled for nearly one year to process the paper work by contacting the Ethiopian embassy in New Delhi. Luck finally smiled on Ms. Yemanebirhan when she got the Emergency Travel Document (ETD), using which she flew to her homeland from Mumbai international airport. In fact, the Kadapa police personnel escorted her by train to Mumbai and stayed till she boarded the flight. Ms. Yemanebirhan witnessed emotional moments on Friday morning after meeting her family members waiting for her arrival at Addis Ababa airport.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ethiopian-woman-heads-home-finally/article36147755.ece

28 August 2021||Mangaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||3 arrested for wrongful restraint in Karnataka||The Punjalkatte police in Dakshina Kannada have arrested three persons of a five-member group on the charge of wrongfully restraining a group of six paramedical students who had gone to Karinjeshwara temple in Bantwal taluk on Thursday. According to the police, the six final-year paramedical students (three boys and three girls), of A.J. Institute of Medical Sciences, Mangaluru, had gone to Karinja hill, off Mangaluru–Bengaluru National Highway, in three motorcycles. The visit to the hill was part of a trip to multiple places in Bantwal. After taking photographs and visiting the temple, the group went to the pond at the foothills around 6 p.m. where they were stopped by the five-member group who questioned them. On learning that the students belong to different religions, the group questioned them about the purpose of their visit to the hill. Soon, the police rushed to the spot. Following a complaint by a girl student, the police registered a case against the five-member group under Section 341 (wrongful restraint) of the IPC. As news about the incident spread, people belonging to two religions gathered outside the police station on Thursday night. The police arrested three of the accused on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/3-arrested-for-wrongful-restraint-in-karnataka/article36147159.ece
28 August 2021||MYSURU,ANDHRA PRADESH||No arrests yet in Mysuru gang rape case||Director-General and Inspector-General of Police Praveen Sood, who visited Mysuru on Friday to oversee the probe into the gang rape of a student, expressed confidence that the case would be cracked and the perpetrators would be brought to book, soon. However, no arrests have so far been made in the incident that occurred on the night of August 24. Refusing to divulge any details, Mr. Sood said the police had gathered “vital technical and scientific evidence from the crime scene” and were following those leads. He expressed confidence that they would help them identify the culprits at the earliest. Home Minister Araga Jnanendra, who was also in the city on Friday and held multiple meetings with the city police apprising himself of the probe into the case, said the police need some more time to complete the probe and make arrests. Both Mr. Sood and Mr. Jnanendra appealed for sensitive coverage of the case. Meanwhile, the police are yet to record the victim’s statement. Mr. Sood said the girl and her family were unable to speak, since they were still in shock over the incident and had assured them they would meet the police once they were able to. “However, this does not preclude the police from carrying out the investigation based on other evidence available and they were being thoroughly pursued,” said Mr. Sood. ‘Victim blaming’ Meanwhile, women activists and writers have criticised the Home Minister for questioning why the college student had chosen to visit a desolate spot near Chamundi foothills in the evening. Though the Minister retracted his remarks later, the activists said such statements questioning the victim are a reflection of the mindset of society. Activists also pointed out that attempts to curtail the movement of women at night, “for their own safety” is the wrong approach, one that shifts blame to women. Jasmeen Patheja, Founder Director, Blank Noise, a movement to demand safe spaces for women, said such statements only reflect a skewed mindset. “We know that violence against women can take place at any time, night or day, and across all spaces,” she said. Several police officials too concede that the home minister’s statement was ill advised. Former State Police Chief S. T. Ramesh said that irrespective of the place, situation or time of day the government is obliged to provide protection to all its citizens and questioning them on their actions has no place in today’s day and age.

28 August 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Mekedatu dam across Cauvery river: Tamil Nadu moves Supreme Court||The Tamil Nadu government has urgently moved the Supreme Court seeking judicial orders to restrain Karnataka from proceedings with “any activity” in regard to the proposed construction of a reservoir at Mekedatu across the inter-State Cauvery river. The application, drawn by advocate G. Umapathy, vetted by Advocate General R. Shanmugasundaram and filed by advocate D. Kumanan, stated that the planning of the Mekedatu project by Karnataka with a capacity of 67.16 TMC ft. and generation of 400 MW project worth Rs. 9,000 crore was in “gross violation" of the decision of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal of February 5, 2007, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court itself on February 16, 2018. “The entire objective of the Tribunal’s final decision is to ensure that the pattern of the release of water to the downstream State to meet irrigation interests is not jeopardised,” Tamil Nadu said. It submitted that Karnataka unilaterally, despite the Tribunal and apex court decisions, sent a feasibility report of the Mekedatu project to the Central Water Commission (CWC), which proceeded to entertain the proposal. “The proposed reservoir would result in the impounding of the flows generated in the Cauvery river from the uncontrolled catchment of the Kabini sub-basin downstream of the Kabini reservoir, the catchment of Cauvery river downstream of KRS dam, uncontrolled flows from Shimsha, Arkavathy and Suvarnavathy sub-basins and various other small streams, which are the sources to ensure 177.25TMC at Billigundlu,” the State application stated. The proposed construction of the reservoir by Karnataka would have a “cascading effect” on the daily and monthly inflows during the crucial months of June to September and “prejudice the livelihood of lakhs of inhabitants of Tamil Nadu depending on the flows from the upstream in Karnataka”, it said. “Any new scheme contemplated should be taken up only with the consent of the other basin States,” Tamil Nadu pressed. The State urged the Supreme Court to direct the CWC to reject and return the DPR for the proposed project filed by Karnataka on January 18, 2019. It also requested the court to restrain the Environment Ministry and its agencies from entertaining any application for clearance relating to the Mekedatu project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mekedatu-dam-tamil-nadu-moves-supreme-court/article36147285.ece
28 August 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Opposition gearing up for a broad-based alliance||Realignment of political forces is on the cards in Andhra Pradesh, as like-minded parties opposed to the ruling BJP at the Centre have decided to make a common cause and rope in more parties for a series of agitations in September to highlight the “anti-people policies” of the ruling dispensation. The major Left parties – the CPI and the CPI(M) – and the Congress party in the State will take the initiative to bring together all the opposition parties opposed to the saffron party with a view to launching different forms of agitations against the “corporate-friendly” policies of the Modi Government between September 20 and 30. This will prepare the stage for a broad-based alliance among the opposition parties for ousting the BJP-led NDA government from power in 2024, according to CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna. “We will extend our invitation to all the non-BJP parties, including the TDP and the YSRCP in the State,” he said, adding that it was up to these parties to make up their mind whether to continue with their old stance of supporting the BJP’s agenda in Parliament and incur the wrath of the people, or to back the people’s struggles against the privatisation spree of public sector units, including the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. The CPI’s erstwhile ally, the Jana Sena Party, should now have to rethink on its tie-up with the BJP, which had allegedly meted out a raw deal to the State on various issues, including Special Category Status, Mr. Ramakrishna said. Issues at stake Issues identified for spearheading the joint struggle include the three controversial farm laws, unprecedented price rise in the wake of spiralling prices of fuel, Pegasus spyware, mismanagement of COVID-19 situation and huge unemployment at a time when people were struggling to cope with the socio-economic crisis due to the pandemic, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/opposition-gearing-up-for-a-broad-based-alliance/article36147753.ece

28 August 2021||SIDDIPET,ANDHRA PRADESH||Mallannasagar set for inauguration||For five days the pumps of Mallannasagar have been running round-the-clock pumping Godavari water from Tukkapur pump house to the 50 tmcft capacity reservoir. Though all the eight pump sets were tested from the wee hours of August 22, after Engineer- In- Chief of the Kaleswaram Project Hari Ram formally switched on the pumps, as on Friday six pumps are pumping water without a hitch. Officials are reported to have planned to fill the reservoir to maximum permissible limit of 10 tmcft. The Chief Minister will switch on the pumps once again to mark the formal inauguration. Mallannasagar — a dream of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao — was realised with the ‘forcible sacrifice’ of some 4,500 families from 14 villages in Toguta and Kondapaka mandals. The villages that are disappearing slowly in Godavari water include — Brahmana Banjerpally, Rampur, Vaddera Colony, Lakshmapur, Etigaddakishtapur, Tirumalagiri, Mogilicheruvu tanda, Vemulaghat, Turkabanjerpally, Pallepahad, Pallepahad tanda and Nagaram in Toguta mandal and Erravalli and Singaram in Kondapaka mandal. The Mallannasagar, which was part of Pranahita-Chevella project initiated by late Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy in the combined Andhra Pradesh, was initially proposed at Tadakapally with 1.5 tmcft. After formation of Telangana under the leadership of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) president and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao the irrigation projects were redesigned. The capacaity of the reservoir was increased from 1.5 tmcft and later increased to 20 tmcft then to 30 tmcft and finally 50 tmcft. Lands in Tukkapur and Toguta are also facing submergence. Oustees of all these villages were promised to be relocated at Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) Colony constructed at Mutrajpally near Gajwel and some 2,400 houses have already been built and the remaining families are being allotted 250 square yard plots. The allocation of plots is completed for only some families. Last Saturday, the day before the pumps were tested, many families were forcibly vacated from submergence villages and some oustees have alleged that their belongings were irreparably damaged. “There is a confusion over the number families displaced by Mallannasagar. Earlier, the officials put the figure at 6,500, however now they have reduced the number to 4,500. It appears they are trying to reduce the number of oustees eligible for benefits,” said one of the oustees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mallannasagar-set-for-inauguration/article36147167.ece
28 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala govt. reintroduces lockdown on Sundays||With COVID-19 case graph spiralling up, the State has reinforced lockdown on Sundays, with “limited permissible activities” alone allowed on the day. The order to the effect was issued by the Chief Secretary on Friday. Health Minister Veena George has cautioned the public to maintain extreme vigil when in public spaces or workplaces and to take all individual precautions to prevent themselves from being infected. Extreme care should be taken in the case of children, who are the most vulnerable to infection now. Parents should ensure that they did not let children accompany them for shopping or other trips outside, Ms. George said while speaking to media persons here on Friday. Defends govt. Defending the manner in which the State had been carrying on with containment, she said the fact that Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) sero prevalence survey in June had reported that over 50% of the population in the State was immunologically naive was testament to the efficient manner in which Kerala had managed to control disease transmission. She said the State’s testing, tracing and containing disease transmission had been hailed as most scientific by public health experts. Kerala’s case under-counting factor was the lowest, with one case detected for every six infections in the community while the national average was 1 in 33. The State’s attempt now was to keep the people safe from serious disease and death by vaccinating them as soon as possible. At this stage of the pandemic, even when a rise in cases was inevitable because of the high transmission of the Delta variant, hospitalisations and ICU occupancy was not rising simultaneously, Ms. George said. She said that 43% of ICUs and 75% ventilators in public health facilities continued to be vacant now. Ms. George reiterated that the government had nothing to hide and that all aspects of COVID was being handled in a very transparently and honestly. COVID death reporting was now taking place real-time from districts, through an online portal and the districts were in the process of updating the “missing COVID deaths” before the online reporting system was introduced. She said there was no change in the government’s policy of providing COVID treatment free of cost to all through public and 281 empanelled private health facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-govt-reintroduces-lockdown-on-sundays/article36147162.ece
28 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Give us the right to fix fees, say private school managements||The State government’s move to put a cap on fees in private unaided schools and junior colleges has riled the managements of the institutions. The release of GO 53 fixing the fee structure for private schools and junior colleges for the next three academic years, till 2023-24, followed by a press conference by the A.P. School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission Chairman R. Kantha Rao, to make it categorical that violation of the GO would not be tolerated and the managements concerned may invite stringent action, did not go down well with the managements of the private educational institutions. “This is irrational. We have met Commission Chairman Kantha Rao a number of times to explain to him our practical problems but to no avail,” says K. Chandra Sekhar, State president of the Andhra Pradesh Private Schools Association (APPSA). Education Act Stating that all unaided schools in the State were guided by the 1982 Education Act, which speaks with clarity on the expenditure incurred by the schools, Mr. Chandra Sekhar refers to the Commission’s insistence on digital transactions for transparency and asks: “How many parents will pay the fee through banks or any other digital mode in schools located in villages?” Uniform fee policy Mr. Chandra Sekhar argues that circumstances vary from school to school and a uniform fee policy is anything but fair. “We fix the fee based on the parents’ financial capacity. That’s how it has been for years,” Mr. Chandra Sekhar maintains. Pointing to the fee structure that would remain for next three academic years, other members wondered about the salary hikes expected annually by the teaching staff. The decision on the fee policy has triggered worry among the managements who are getting together to chalk out their future course of action. The APPSA members have decided to hold a State-level meeting next week and discuss the implications of GO 53. Some of the members have suggested that they would sport black badges on September 5, Teachers’ Day, to make their disenchantment known to the authorities. ‘Far from reality’ “Contrary to the Commission’s claim that an exhaustive study preceded the exercise of fixing the fees, the new fee structure divided in three categories, depending on the location of the school, is far from reality,” said Ramachandra Reddy, State president of Andhra Pradesh Unaided School Managements’ Association (APUSMA). ‘Impractical’ He said the association had been requesting the government to give the provision of fixing the fees to the school managements, as it had been in the past, and pointed to the fact that a maximum fee of Rs. 18,000 per annum for a school located in a Municipal Corporation limits was anything but practical. Citing the enormous increase in the fuel prices, Mr. Ramachandra Reddy said Rs. 1.20 per km for school bus was inadequate. Legal recourse He said the association would appeal to the government yet again to reconsider its stand. “If our pleas are not heeded, we would take a legal recourse and if the need arises, we will not hesitate to close our schools permanently and resort to a sustained agitation,” Mr. Ramachandra Reddy said emphatically.

28 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rockfall mitigation works begin at Durga temple||Nearly a year ago, panic ensued among devotees after boulders came rolling down leading to a major landslide at Indrakeeladri here. The incident happened a short while before Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s visit to the popular hill shrine on the occasion of Dasara festivities. It prompted the Sri Durga Malleswara Swamyvarla Devasthanam authorities to take up measures to mitigate the rockfall/landslide. According to information, the temple administration has taken up the “mitigation measures against rock fall” at Indrakeeladri at an estimated cost of Rs. 4.25 crore after the government gave administrative and technical sanction. The works were launched a couple of days ago. Double-twisted iron meshes done through rock bolting would be installed to prevent the fall of boulders. When contacted, Kanaka Durga temple Executive Officer Bhaskar said that the works were likely to be completed by November. They were taken up as part of the development works. The State government would release necessary funds for the same. The Chief Minister had assured to release the funds for the developmental works during his visit to the temple last year, he recalled. GSI Survey In the past, the Geological Survey of India (GSI) conducted a survey on the rock formations of Indrakeeladri, following a request by the Endowments Department with a view to widen the ghat road in 2005. The GSI, in its report, said that the hill had fractured rock-beds. It also suggested that the government take up short treatment such as rock bolting to prevent landslides. Subsequently, the Kanaka Durga temple authorities took up the stabilisation works and fixed a mesh to capture the boulders rolling down. The administration even took up rock bolting and cement plastering of the hill that is close to the ghat road and parking lot. But, the loose earth fell crashing down onto the ghat road on many occasions. Earlier instances There were many instances of boulders rolling down the Indrakeeladri. A landslide in 2006 was so intense that the debris was reportedly carted away in around 30 lorries. Water supply was badly hit when a boulder rolled down Indrakeeladri damaging the pipeline in 2006-07. A similar incident took place in 2008-09 when a huge boulder, which rolled down from Indrakeeladri during the blasting of rocks for the widening of ghat road, hit the pipeline. The pipeline was laid much before the low-level reservoir near Durga ghat was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi in 1929.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rockfall-mitigation-works-begin-at-durga-temple/article36147214.ece

In the 2019 general elections, Vijaya Kumar, contested as independent candidate for Vijayawada West Assembly constituency, but lost and suffered losses. To clear the debts, Vijaya Kumar allegedly brought pressure on Rahul to return his share from the company. Rahul reportedly took Rs. 6 crore from Gayatri assuring to get PG medical seat for her daughter. He borrowed Rs. 10 lakh from Srinath alias Seetaiah, relative of Vijaya Kumar, and promised to give logistics maintenance, but failed to give the contract. As Rahul was not conducting board meetings and returning his share from the company, Vijaya Kumar allegedly planned to eliminate Rahul and sell his share to Koganti Satyam. The accused reportedly forcibly took Rahul’s signatures on some documents on Zixin Company, and allegedly strangled him to death. Later, they left the body in the car, abandoned the vehicle and escaped, Mr. Srinivasulu claimed.

28 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Firefighting hindered by obsolete equipment: experts||The Fire Services Department is working with ageing machinery and approaching the firefighting job in the traditional way, when the world has gone ahead by inducting high-end technology based firefighting equipment. This was the opinion of all the experts from the department, who attended the one-day seminar on the Indian Fire and Security Yatra- 2021, organised by the Fire and Security Association of India (FSAI) here on Friday. Delivering the keynote address, District Fire Officer B.V.S. Ramprakash said that lighting a fire is easy but fighting it is difficult. He said that despite the drawbacks such as shortage of man and machinery, the men in his department were putting the best foot forward. He said that all stakeholders, be they schools or colleges or hotels or hospitals or for that matter industries, should not compromise on installing the proper firefighting equipment and using quality products. Most of the fire accidents occur due to electrical short-circuits and they are mainly due to use of substandard electrical equipment such as wires or Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCBs), said Mr. Ramprakash. Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) Regional Fire Officer D. Niranjan Reddy said that the department was still using outdated and obsolete equipment and the time has come to upgrade the technology. He said that a change in the attitude of common man, especially in the are of fire safety, is slowly seeping in and many people are approaching the department for advice on fire safety equipment.

Addressing the media here on Friday, former Minister Ch. Ayyanna Patrudu alleged that the State government has done nothing to reduce the prices or take up the matter appropriately with the Union government. He said that the party has created a forum ‘Uttara Andhra Rakshana Charcha Vedika’ and its first meeting will be held on August 30. It will be attended by former Minister Kinjarapu Atchannaidu and former Union Minister P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju, Mr. Ayyanna Patrudu said. He alleged that despite the YSR Congress Party wining the last Assembly elections with a huge majority, the State government has done nothing for the development of the North Andhra region. He alleged that the YSR Congress Party leaders, including Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, were playing a double game pertaining to the issue of privatisation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant and was misguiding the employees and people. He questioned on how did the State government sell its 10% share in Gangavaram Port Limited to the Adani group. This indicates that it is in favour of privatisation and the sale of the VSP is being done with the full knowledge of the Chief Ministers, he alleged. Mr. Patrudu also pointed out that all the roads sanctioned by Union Minister Nitin Gadkari have still not been completed, due to delay from the State’s side. “Former Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu had sanctioned Rs. 350 crore for the Uttarandhra Sujala Sravanthi project, the YSRCP-led State government has only spent Rs. 40 crore and washed their hands away,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-to-organise-protests-against-fuel-price-hike-today/article36147861.ece

28 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||GHMC identifies chronic mosquito breeding spots||Alarmed by the increase in the number of dengue cases, the Entomology wing of GHMC has intensified anti-larval and mosquito eradication programme across the city. As part of the ‘Urban Malaria’ scheme, the Entomology wing has collated data about various chronic mosquito breeding points across circles, in order to address the issue. For the programme, the sites serving as breeding hotspots have been categorised into construction sites, schools, function halls, cellars, open plots and locked houses. A total of 5,325 construction sites, 3,272 schools, 764 function halls, 3,348 cellars, 5,385 open plots and 16,192 locked houses have been identified across the six circles, where the anti larval activities and adult mosquito eradication measures are being carried out. Already, entomology activities have been taken up inside the government schools and hostels as per instructions from the Municipal Administration Department, ahead of reopening of the schools for the physical classroom sessions. A total of 2,173 government schools have been identified across circles for the cleaning, sanitisation and entomology activities which should be completed by August 30 as per the government’s instructions. Anti-larval spraying has been done in 825 schools during the last two days, while 633 schools have been fogged intensively to kill adult mosquitoes. “We are also doing indoor residual spraying in closed spaces, so that mosquitoes perching on the walls are killed instantly,” informed A. Rambabu, Chief Entomologist. These apart, indoor spraying is also being done inside and around the houses where dengue cases have surfaced. About 30 to 40 houses in the half kilometre vicinity of the infected household are being sprayed two to three times a week, so as to arrest the chain of contagion, Mr. Rambabu informed. The Aedes aegypti mosquito which carries the dengue virus can travel up to half a kilometre, and can infect several households. Anti-larval activities have been intensified at the identified chronic breeding points too, especially vacant plots and locked houses. Vacant plots are used as garbage dumps inside the colonies, where rain water gets stored in discarded cups, coconut shells and other such trash, allowing survival of the larva. “Locked houses are another menace. Despite the locked premises, water supply is not cut, resulting in stagnant water in sumps and tanks. They serve as good spots for mosquito breeding,” said Mr.Rambabu. Entomology workers are visiting the locked homes and spraying the premises, besides dumping sand mixed with discarded oil inside the water to kill the larvae. Colony welfare associations and local youth are being apprised of the harm the locked houses could bring, and urged to take initiative to empty the water from time to time, he said. “All said and done, cooperation from residents is of utmost importance. A few gated communities and colonies do not allow our workers inside, nor do they take up anti-larval measures by themselves. All it takes to contain dengue mosquito is to deprive it of breeding space,” Mr. Rambabu said.  A few gated communities and colonies do not allow our workers inside, nor do they take up anti-larval measures by themselves. A.

28 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Minister’s request for waqf land for 2BHK houses raises eyebrows||The Telangana State Waqf Board is grappling with the issue of the State government eyeing a part of a land parcel endowed to Tharthare Shah graveyard in Bansilalpet for constructing dignity housing scheme units. On Thursday, Minister for Animal Husbandry Talasani Srinivas Yadav and officials of TSWB, including chairman Mohammed Saleem, jointly inspected the site, and posted photos of the development on social media. Sources said that some officials appraised the Minister of the nature of the land. According to TSWB sources, revenue officials and a GHMC official had inspected the site last month. Further, in a letter dated July 17, the Revenue Divisional Officer, Secunderabad, wrote to the Collector, stating that Animal Husbandry Minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav had requested that a 375 square yards parcel in the graveyard be handed over for the construction of 16 2BHK units. “Some 13 Muslims sought the Minister’s intervention as the units were intended for them. Everybody knows that once an institution or property is declared waqf, it is always waqf. All documents about the property, including its gazette notification, and muntakhab, are available. It is very strange that the Revenue department is seeking graveyard land for 2BHK houses. A large part of the graveyard is already encroached and whatever is remaining should be protected,” a Board official said. This is not the first time the graveyard has allegedly been threatened. In January, the TSWB lodged a complaint at the Gandhinagar police station stating that attempts were made to demolish a portion of the graveyard wall to gain access to a 2BHK building adjacent to it. The Board also made it clear in the complaint that according to the Waqf Act 1995, any attempt to alienate, buy or take possession of a waqf property without permission from the Board is punishable offence. On Friday, activists raised hackles against the move. Osman bin Mohammed al-Hajiri from the Deccan Protection Society visited the graveyard and said he would approach courts of law, if required. “There is a 2BHK building right beside the graveyard. The 13 petitioners can be accommodated in them, or any other similar building. What is the need to ask for waqf land?” he asked. Mr. Saleem said, “We have only inspected the land. That does not mean we will give away the land. We will put the issue before the State Waqf Board.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ts-govt-bid-to-use-waqf-land-for-2bhk-houses-raises-eyebrows/article36147531.ece

28 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Big changes in CJ Hima Kohli’s short stint||Stringent, scrupulous and simple. That had been the functioning style of Justice Hima Kohli since her first day of assuming charge as Telangana High Court Chief Justice on January 7 to the last day on Friday. CJ Hima Kohli, who is going to assume charge as Supreme Court judge, proved this with her ‘to the point’ farewell speech delivered at the meeting held on HC premises on Thursday. Seven months and 20 days is too short a span for a CJ to bring in any major transformation. Yet within that period, CJ Hima Kohli left her own mark on the HC carved out two years and seven months ago. In addition to making serious attempts to bring down pendency of cases, the CJ ensured PIL petitions were not filed casually. Whenever new PIL pleas came up for hearing, the CJ insisted on knowing the locus standi of the petitioners and would not hear the matters if the petitioners were directly or indirectly connected to any contentious issues raised in the pleas. In fact, the CJ warned some PIL petitioners not to waste the court’s time when she found ‘private interests’ involved in such pleas. In a couple of cases, costs were imposed on such petitioners. At the same time, the CJ acted tough in matters involving public interest, be it road conditions, illegal constructions or encroachment of public properties. Three days ago, the CJ warned city civic authorities of “serious repercussions” if the court’s orders were not complied with over removal of footpath encroachments. Witnessing multiple PIL petitions on a similar subject was not unusual in Telangana HC. The CJ put an end to this pattern and would take one or two pleas as lead matters. She would direct lawyers representing other petitioners (filing pleas on same subject) to assist the court in adjudication of the lead matters. CJ Hima Kohli would be remembered for the seriousness with which she dealt with the contempt of court by officials. Whenever contempt appeal pleas came up for hearing, the CJ made it clear that non-compliance of court directions by bureaucrats would not be taken lightly. The CJ passed clear instructions that whenever a government officer approached the HC division bench appealing against a punishment order by a single judge, the officer concerned should give an affidavit enlisting any previous cases of contempt matters he or she was involved in. Listening to the CJ’s observations on different matters was like music to ears for English language fans as they were full of interesting idioms and phrases. “Twiddling thumbs...on a wing and a prayer...crossing Rubicon...much water has flown under the bridge..” were some of them. The CJ took exception to inordinate delay in filing affidavits or counter affidavits especially by government different petitions. Having initially warned the bureaucrats, the CJ imposed costs on officials when they ignored the cautions. Senior most judge of Telangana High Court M.S. Ramachandra Rao has been appointed to perform duties of the CJ of the HC in the backdrop of CJ Hima Kohli’s appointment as Supreme Court judge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/big-changes-in-cj-hima-kohlis-short-stint/article36147550.ece
28 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||KTR defends Malla Reddy remarks on Revanth||Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) working president K.T. Rama Rao tried to justify the language used by Minister Ch. Malla Reddy against TPCC president A. Revanth Reddy stating that it was a result of waning patience. “We have been tolerant for the last 7 years on the abusive language used against the Chief Minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao who has created the new State. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction,” he said in response to a question at a press conference here. “You should pose similar questions to Congress leaders and others indulging in insulting language,” he suggested to the reporters, “before pointing a finger at the TRS”. KTR termed TPCC president A. Revanth Reddy as a puppet of TDP president, N. Chandrababu Naidu and the Congress had appointed a person who was caught delivering money to buy votes, as its president. His shameful language was being countered by our leaders in similar tone and tenor. “However, we believe in decency in politics.” Referring to Union Minister Narayan Rane’s arrest in Maharashtra, he said the Maharashtra government where Congress was a partner had taken action against a Union Minister for threatening to slap the Chief Minister. “Should we also respond similarly,” he said adding that there was limit to freedom of speech. Some people under the guise of journalism too were following the abusive path, he charged. The Minister also took potshots at the ‘Praja Sangrama Yatra’ of BJP state president Bandi Sanjay, asking him whether his yatra was to identify properties in Telangana for the Union government to sell in order to fill its coffers in the name of disinvestment. The BJP after its ‘Make in India’ and ‘Digital India’ programmes had taken up “Becho India” selling everything in sight. In a sarcastic tone, the Minister said Mr. Sanjay perhaps decided on the walkathon unable to afford the rising fuel prices. “Will he tell people that Modi government has successfully increased fuel prices above Rs. 100 per litre? Let him go and see the development in Telangana and the happy faces in villages,” he said. He further charged the BJP with not only selling the country’s wealth but also denying the promised jobs. Where were the 2 crore jobs that Modi promised? In fact, there were 11 lakh vacancies in the Central government departments of which nearly 5 lakh belonged to the SC, ST and OBC categories. Why were not they filling those, he asked and said Mr. Sanjan should explain it to people during his yatra. Flag festival The TRS working president said the ‘Janda Panduga’ of the TRS would be held on September 2.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ktr-defends-malla-reddy-remarks-on-revanth/article36147554.ece

28 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||JNTUH plans screening test for faculty appointments||Private engineering colleges may find some solution to the quality teaching faculty they are suffering with as the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad (JNTU-H) is planning to conduct a screening test for faculty members. The screened candidates can be chosen by the colleges as the teachers based on their performance in the test. The test will ensure a pool of qualified and tested candidates making it easier for the colleges to pick up from. “The process will be completed within next six months and colleges can choose their teachers for the 2022-23 academic year,” an official said. This will effectively seal the present mode of selection which is being done through the Selection Committee Minutes. Meanwhile, lockdown related issues and also the general decline in engineering courses in the State seem to have affected the engineering college as more institutions are preferring to close the colleges. For this academic year, four engineering colleges have filed closure petitions with the university. These colleges will not see new admissions now but the present strength in the second, third and final years will continue and effectively they will be closed completely after three years. While financial issues concerned with the lockdown effect is one reason colleges with less than 25% of admissions in the previous years are preferring to shut down as offering the courses has become economically unviable due to the stringent norms. Apart from the AICTE, the State government too is not compromising on the quality now. Those who are in the race for admissions are focussing on introduction of innovative courses doing away with traditional ones. Courses now in demand include in the emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Data Science and Cyber Security. With the EAMCET results announced and the admission counselling to begin, JNTUH has 148 engineering colleges applying for affiliation. About 89,500 seats are likely to be on offer this year for students to choose from. In the pharmacy course nearly 7,000 seats are likely to be available.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/jntuh-plans-screening-test-for-faculty-appointments/article36147542.ece

28 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Will strive for cause of SCs till my last breath’||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said he would strive for the overall development of SCs through the Dalit Bandhu programme till the last breath of his life. His resolve to achieve the goal would be as strong as his relentless struggle to secure statehood for Telangana. The State government will see that the scheme became a lesson for rest of the country to learn and replicate the model, Mr. Rao said addressing a meeting on Dalit Bandhu scheme of empowerment of SCs at the Collectorate in Karimnagar during his visit of the town on Friday. Nearly 30 participants, including Ministers, MLAs, bankers, officials and leaders of SC organisations, were present. The government will set up Dalit Bandhu committees at village, mandal, constituency, district and State levels for its effective implementation. A supportive structure for people who benefited from the scheme was also established to see that they did not relapse. A release here quoted him as promising that the State government will see the scheme became a lesson for rest of the country to learn and replicate the model. It was a result of a study of socio-economic conditions of SCs through a subaltern study centre. The study disclosed that 165 communities across the world faced social and economic discrimination. The conditions of SCs in India was similar to those communities. The SCs had no properties and, on top, faced social discrimination though there were gem of people among them who did not get opportunities. “The State government is now giving them access to opportunities. It is not a programme to gain cheap mileage to earn votes. There is no need to hurry through the programme. It will continue till all the SC families developed”. Mr. Rao said a comprehensive household survey by government six years ago showed there were seventeen lakh SC families in the State with a population of seventy five lakh. They constituted eighteen per cent of the total population of the State. The scheme took shape only now though he had contemplated development of SCs long ago.

28 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘Probe charges against Minister’||Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president A. Revanth Reddy has wondered why Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was hesitant to order an inquiry into Minister for Labour Ch. Malla Reddy’s ‘illegal assets’ while claiming his government would not spare any corruption. Releasing the documents of a ‘gift deed’ to Mr. Malla Reddy from his relative and TRS leader Srinivas Reddy, the Congress leader said the same land was used for establishing Malla Reddy University. But there are no records of from where Mr. Srinivas Reddy got that land, he claimed. He said total availability of land in survey 650 of Gundla Pochampally was just 22 acres and 8 guntas but it surprisingly has increased to 33 acres and 26 guntas in Dharani portal. Of this 16 acres are registered on Srinivas Reddy’s name who has gifted it to Malla Reddy University. Similarly, 5 acres of land in Survey No 488 in Jawahar Nagar Municipality has been named as Government land by the Registration department disallowing transactions but CMR Medical College is established in this land. How did this happen, he asked. When senior leaders Rajaiah and Eatala Rajender were removed from the Cabinet citing corruption why is Mr. Malla Reddy being spared, he asked. He reminded that an audio of Mr. Malla Reddy threatening a realtor and demanding money for a 50-acre layout was in public domain but the government is silent. Mr. Reddy claimed the government was unable to respond to his expose of corrupt deals and encouraging the ministers and TRS leaders to abuse him. “Why is the government so frustrated and trying to deviate from the issue,” he asked and said the Opposition had every right to question the unfulfilled promises of the government. On the resignation challenge of Mr. Malla Reddy, he said he had won as a MP against Mr. Malla Reddy’s son-in-law and in his constituency, and it was laughable that the defeated person is challenging him again. “If the government is confident let the Chief Minister call for fresh polls and Congress is ready for it. If the CM was not confident on general elections let him resign in Gajwel at least. Let the contest be between the TRS president and the Congress president.” The Congress president also claimed that the drugs case in the State has come into prominence again due to the case filed by him in the High Court. “The State government is not cooperating with the central agencies in the drug scandal as a prominent person in the government is involved in it,” Mr. Reddy alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/probe-charges-against-minister/article36147556.ece

28 August 2021||SIDDAPUR (SANGAREDDY DISTRICT),TELANGANA||AP man who’s been a tenant farmer here for three decades||The State government has officially stated that there are no tenant farmers in Telangana and there are no records of tenant farmers either. The statement was made by none other than Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao a few years ago in the floor of the Assembly. However, the fact is that even in 2014, the final year of unified Andhra Pradesh, the then government headed by Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy had issued identity cards for tenant farmers. There were tenant farmers then and they still are now. Many farmers, having small holdings ranging between half-an-acre to two acres of land are taking land on lease and cultivating crops like cotton. Polla Rosaiah is one such tenant farmer who has been cultivating land taken on lease for the past three decades. Rosaiah, in his 50s, hails from Bollaram village in Sattenapally constituency of Guntur district, about 300 kilometres from here. Mr. Rosaiah had migrated here in the 1990s along with his wife Shiva Kumari. First he was at Potpally leasing about two acres of land and then shifted to Nandikandi and increasing the extent of land taken for lease. Now he is at Siddapur village and cultivating a large extent of land on lease. “When we came here for taking up cultivation by taking land on lease, the only profession I know, we used to get three acres of land on lease here for the one acre we could taken on lease at our native place. My livelihood was dependent on this though farming job has ups and downs. At one point I had about Rs. 6 lakh debt when there were no rains for three years. Our landlords were kind enough to give me ample time to repay the debts,” Mr. Rosaiah told The Hindu . The tenant farmer, however, has regrets for not buying land here despite being in Telangana for three decades. “Fear loomed high during the separate State movement of Telangana. I could not dare to buy land here and instead invested in Andhra Pradesh. But I regret for what I did as my financial condition might have been quite different had I invested here in Telangana,” commented Mr. Rosaiah.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ap-man-whos-been-a-tenant-farmer-here-for-three-decades/article36147782.ece

28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||‘Sridevi Soda Center’ movie review: Karuna Kumar takes a mainstream approach to a disturbing issue, aided by Sudheer Babu||Director Karuna Kumar’s Palasa 1978 (2020) was in a raw, rustic space and explored caste politics with characters that weren’t typically white and black. With Sridevi Soda Center , Karuna Kumar takes a mainstream approach given the presence of actor Sudheer Babu and tries to keep the narrative gritty while discussing issues of honour. The film is set in the Godavari belt, which is often explored by Telugu cinema for its picturesque quality. Instead of showing us an airbrushed Godavari region, Karuna Kumar and cinematographer Shamdat show us small-town festivities where the fault lines of class and caste divisions run deep, defying the celebratory lights. Suri Babu (Sudheer Babu) is the lighting expert for all festivities in the village. He, his father (Raghu Babu) and friend (Satyam Rajesh) take pride in their work and refuse to be submissive to Kasi (Pavel Navageetham). An adrenaline-pumping boat race that unfolds on sun-kissed waters sets the stage for battles to follow. Sudheer Babu shows off his ripped muscles in the slow-motion shots and Mani Sharma’s rousing background score sets the mood. This is perhaps Karuna Kumar’s way of drawing those who are used to mainstream narratives to stay invested in the proceedings, before navigating uncomfortable spaces in the story (Nagendra Kasi shares the writing credits). The romance between Suri Babu and Sridevi (Anandhi) unfolds at an unhurried pace. Since it’s easy to guess the motives of the main antagonist, a crucial reveal in the latter half doesn’t hold any surprise. Karuna Kumar reveals his cards in the third act, when the story progresses beyond the good guy Vs. bad guy trope. Suri might be up against an obviously negative Kasi, but what does one make of a father (V K Naresh) who takes pride in his daughter’s fiery nature but fails to understand that she has agency in choosing the man she wants to live with? The conversation between the father and daughter, where he asserts that he will hold on to his ideas of family and societal honour even if the world is changing, and she emphasising that she, who has a whole life ahead of her, won’t bend to outdated ideas, is among the best scenes in an otherwise predictable film. Though this is a different story, subconsciously one can draw parallels to the father-daughter confrontation in Uppena as well as director Vetrimaaran’s Or Iravu segment in the Netflix Tamil anthology Paava Kadhaigal .  Sridevi Soda Center has many things going for it — especially the performances by Sudheer Babu, Anandhi, Satyam Rajesh, Naresh and Raghu Babu. However, overdoing the mainstream indulgences pulls the film down. Take for instance the fight sequence between Sudheer and Ajay. Though well choreographed, it does nothing for the story.  Sridevi Soda Center is the kind of film that happens when art-house and mainstream meet midway but it is not seamless. There are a few memorable moments and hard-hitting segments, but the film doesn’t sweep you off your feet.

28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||‘Ichata Vahanamulu Nilupa Radu’ movie review: This Sushanth and Meenakshi film required better writing||Just when we thought Chi La Sow and Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo ushered in a good phase in Sushanth Anumolu’s career, Icchata Vahanamulu Nilaparadhu disappoints because of the way it has been written. If you are looking to understand the relevance of the title to the story, wait till the second half when the hero makes it very obvious, tapping the ‘No Parking’ signboard before he enters the heroine’s house. The message is loud and clear. Arun (Sushanth) is smitten by his intern Meenu (Meenakshi Chaudhary) — an architect in his company — and as their relationship progresses, she tells him that she wants to go on a bike ride with him. Arun’s mother (Aishwarya) wants him to buy a car but relents and funds his bike instead. When Arun lands at Meenu’s place unannounced, she gets worried that her brother Narasimha Yadav (Venkat) who is a local politician might arrive any moment and run into Arun. However, Arun enters the neighbours’ house by mistake, oblivious of a crime that had been committed there. He soon spots Meenu through a window, realises his mistake and quickly meets her, but by then the damage has been done; neighbouring residents and the cops arrive and upon seeing his parked bike, believe that the thief/criminal is the one who came on it and is somewhere around. Arun is therefore their first suspect. Meanwhile, the real culprit is at large. The rest of the story revolves around how Arun absolves himself of the crime. There are several characters in the film, many of them with dramatic entries, but their actions lack intensity or impact. There is little sympathy for the hero when he is caught or being hit by the people from the terrace, instead, there is an air of nonchalance that does not help the story. Priyadarshi’s and Abhinav’s roles do not make a difference to the story. This is all due to poor writing. This isn’t the best we’ve seen from Sushanth and Meenakshi has a long way to go in terms of acting. Sunil and Vennela Kishore manage to bring smiles.

28 August 2021||GURUGRAM,||Citizens’ groups object to proposed waste-to-energy plant||Several citizens’ groups have written to Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) raising serious objections to the proposed waste-to-energy plant at Bandhwari landfill site off Gurugram-Faridabad Road. The Board has fixed August 31 for public hearing on the proposal by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram to set up Integrated Municipal Solid Waste Facility with a proposed expansion of waste-to-energy plant from 15 MW to 25 MW. In a letter addressed to the Chairman, HSPCB, the Citizens for Clean Air group said they were echoing the concern of thousands of citizens of Gurugram in strongly opposing any project for waste-to-energy (WtE) plant in and around Gurugram. Anti-public health act “We are aghast and anguished that Haryana government is bent upon setting up a plant as a solution to Gurugram’s waste management problem. Such a decision will be an anti-public health act by the State government as the consequences of this plant on human health and on the Aravali ecosystem will be enormous and irreparable. The waste-to-energy plants are proven to be environmentally disastrous and unsustainable, not only in India but also in all major developed countries,” said the letter. It further added that the proposed plant at Bandhwari village by no means could be considered an integrated municipal solid waste processing facility or an environmentally and socially acceptable technology for processing city waste. “If the assumption of such a proposal is that the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram has exhausted all possible methods of scientific processing of solid waste as prescribed in Solid Waste Management Rules 2016, then this proposal is a derogatory step. The facts on the ground speak for themselves that even five years after SWM Rules 2016 came into force, the MCG continues to collect, transport, and dump only mixed waste. This is a gross violation of SWM Rules 2016,” said the letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/citizens-groups-object-to-proposed-waste-to-energy-plant/article36147428.ece

28 August 2021||New Delhi/Chandigarh,||Sonu Sood to be brand ambassador for ‘Desh ke Mentor’ programme||Bollywood actor Sonu Sood will be the brand ambassador for Delhi government’s “Desh ke Mentor” programme, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced here on Friday. “We are delighted to have onboard Sonu Sood, who has inspired lakhs of youth across the country with his selfless services to the nation,” the CM said. The soon-to-be-launched programme entails “adopting” one to ten government school students who can be mentored by citizens who are successful in their respective fields, the Chief Minister said at a digital briefing. Mentors will take out 10 minutes every week to guide students over the phone. Interested citizens can adopt between one to ten children studying in the city’s government schools as part of the initiative. When asked whether his association with the AAP government for the initiative heralded his foray into politics, Mr. Sood said he did not need to be a politician to be a patriot. The BJP, however, alleged that the initiative was the AAP’s excuse to get the actor onboard for its poll campaign in States such as Punjab and Goa. Helping hand During the pandemic, the government stated that Mr. Sood had stepped forward to help those who reached out to him and was widely recognised for his humanitarian work. The Sood Charity Foundation had been helping thousands of deserving students achieve their educational and professional goals, whether through financial assistance or efforts to prepare them for a professional career, the government stated. As the face of the “Desh Ke Mentor” initiative, Mr. Sood had appealed to citizens across the country to step forward and support children’s education. “I am impressed by the transformation in Delhi government schools in the past year. High quality education for all children, whether rich or poor, is the key to a brighter future for the country. We need to come together and do our share for nation building. I urge the youth of India to come be a part of Desh Ke Mentor,” Mr. Sood said. “We have worked very hard to transform Delhi government schools. Now we want to make education a people’s revolution. When young people across the country join our education revolution, no one will be able to stop India from becoming a global leader,” Mr. Kejriwal said. AAP MLA Harpal Singh Cheema said Mr. Sood has associated himself with the Delhi government and as far as my understanding goes he is not making a foray into politics. Notably, in April this year, Mr. Sood was appointed as the brand ambassador of the Punjab government for its COVID vaccination programme. Opposition’s contention Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta alleged whether it was this mentorship programme or skill development or education loans, Mr. Kejriwal comes up with such initiatives “only to mislead the youth” and that Mr. Kejriwal would “use Sonu Sood the same way he did poet Shri Kumar Vishwas for coming to power.” “In so far as Mr. Kejriwal’s move to associate Sonu Sood with the Delhi government’s defunct mentoring programme is concerned, this is not to benefit youths but take advantage of his image for his own party benefit in poll-bound States,” he alleged.

28 August 2021||Washington,||‘We will hunt you down,’ Biden warns Afghan airport attackers||President Joe Biden is vowing to avenge the deaths of 13 American troops and dozens of Afghans in attacks at the Kabul airport that thrust the White House deeper into crisis over a chaotic and deadly end to a 20-year war. Retribution, however, will be harder with fewer U.S. intelligence assets in Afghanistan. In an emotional address after the attacks, Mr. Biden declared to the extremists responsible: “We will hunt you down and make you pay.” The President, speaking from the White House on Thursday, said the U.S.-led evacuation of Americans and others from Taliban-controlled Afghanistan would proceed, and indeed more than 12,000 people were airlifted from Kabul in the last 24 hours, as of Friday morning. U.S. military officials have said they are braced for more attempted attacks by the group Biden said was responsible for Thursday’s multi-pronged attack — the Islamic State group’s Afghanistan affiliate. The IS affiliate in Afghanistan has carried out many attacks on civilian targets in the country in recent years. It is more radical than the Taliban, who seized power less than two weeks ago and are an enemy of IS. The group more recently is believed to have concentrated in urban areas, which could complicate U.S. efforts to target them without harming civilians. “We will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place of our choosing,” Mr. Biden said. “These ISIS terrorists will not win.” As for the bombers and gunmen involved, he said, “We have some reason to believe we know who they are. Not certain.” He said he had instructed military commanders to develop plans to strike IS “assets, leadership and facilities.” Meanwhile, the Pentagon said that the attack was carried out by a single suicide bomber at the airport gate. “I can confirm for you that we do not believe that there was a second explosion at or near the Baron Hotel, that it was one suicide bomber,” Army Major General William Taylor told reporters.

The U.S. warned more attacks could come ahead of next week’s end to America’s longest war. The U.S. said more than 1,00,000 people have been safely evacuated from Kabul, but thousands more are struggling to leave in one of history’s largest airlifts. President Joe Biden has pledged to continue the evacuation of Americans and others from Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, and the Pentagon said more than 12,000 people were airlifted from Kabul in the last 24 hours, as of Friday morning. More people hoping to flee arrived on Friday at the airport, though in one area Taliban fighters set up a cordon about 500 m away. Britain has evacuated almost 14,000 U.K. citizens and Afghans from Kabul in the two-week operation, but the final flights are departing on Friday. Hundreds of U.K. troops at the airport are due to leave in the next few days. U.K. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said that about 1,000 Afghans authorized to come to Britain, and about 150 U.K. citizens, have not made it to the airport and will likely be left behind.  Italy’s last evacuation flight from Kabul left Afghanistan on Friday, ending the country’s airlift operation, Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said. The French European Affairs Minister, Clement Beaune, said the country will end its operation “soon”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/new-urgency-in-evacuations/article36146929.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||ISKP, the group behind Kabul blasts||In June 2015, a few months after the Islamic State (IS) announced its Wilayat Khorasan (Khorasan Province), the Taliban wrote a letter to the IS chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, asking him to stop recruiting jihadists in Afghanistan. The letter, signed by the then political committee chief of the Taliban, Mullah Akhtar Mansour (who would take over the insurgency in a month and be killed by a U.S. air strike in May 2016), said there was room for “only one flag and one leadership” in the fight to re-establish Islamic rule in Afghanistan. But the IS faction, which came to be known as the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP), did not stop recruiting disgruntled Taliban fighters. Nor did it stop launching terror attacks across Afghanistan. On August 26, 11 days after the Taliban captured Kabul, the ISKP carried out one of its biggest attacks in Afghanistan, killing over 100 people in the capital, including 13 American service members, posing the first major security threat to Afghanistan’s new rulers, who themselves are no strangers to terror tactics. It was the deadliest day for the U.S. military in Afghanistan since 2011. The day also saw the first American fatalities in Afghanistan since the February 2020 U.S.-Taliban agreement.  An IS branch  In the past six years, the ISKP has built an organisational network in Afghanistan from the eastern Nangarhar province, attracted followers from across South, West and Central Asia, and killed hundreds. When the IS announced the formation of the Khorasan Province, referring to an area encompassing Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia, in January 2015, the group’s immediate strategy was to exploit the divisions within the main jihadist groups operating in the region. It appointed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) commander Hafiz Saeed Khan as its leader and former Afghan Taliban commander Abdul Rauf Aliza as his deputy (both were killed in U.S. strikes). It attracted members from different groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, the Haqqani Network and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan into its fold, according to the U.S.-based Combating Terrorism Centre. The ISKP declared its allegiance to Baghdadi. In operational tactics and ideology, it followed its parental organisation. “There is no doubt that Allah the Almighty has blessed us with jihad in the land of Khorasan since a long time ago, and it is from the grace of Allah that we fought any disbeliever who entered the land of Khorasan. All of this is for the sake of establishing the Shariah,” the ISKP said in a video message in 2015. When the IS in Iraq and Syria came under pressure in 2015 and 2016, the core organisation shifted its focus to Afghanistan, a divided country with the government’s writ hardly reaching its hinterlands. The IS saw an opportunity in the country to rebuild its organisation. Having built its base in eastern Afghanistan, the ISKP issued propaganda messages, calling on Muslim youth across Asia to join the group. Many radicalised youth, including dozens from India, travelled to Afghanistan to either join the IS or live an “Islamic life” under the Caliphate’s rule.  Rivalry with Taliban  But the IS came under pressure in Afghanistan as well. The Taliban did not like its monopoly over violent jihad being challenged by another organisation. Also, the Taliban are a tribal, nationalist militant force, backed by Pakistan, whereas the ISKP doesn’t believe in national borders, and stands for a global Islamic Caliphate. “The leadership of Daesh [IS] is independent, the goals of Daesh are independent,” Omar Khorasani, who was the ISKP’s top leader, told The Wall Street Journal earlier this month from prison. “We have a global agenda and so when people ask who can really represent Islam and the whole Islamic community, of course we’re more attractive.” The ideological and operational differences led to open clashes between the ISKP and the Taliban. When the Taliban seized Kabul and took over prisons, they freed several of their members, but executed Khorasani. Shahab al-Muhajir has been leading the terrorist group since Khorasani was arrested in April 2020.  Conflict continues  The U.S. has carried out a number of targeted attacks, killing several of the ISKP’s leaders. In April 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered troops to drop the ‘Mother of all Bombs’, the most powerful non-nuclear bomb, on IS caves in eastern Afghanistan. But despite U.S.’s targeted bombings and the Taliban’s counter-attacks, the ISKP has continued to expand its operations. As much of Afghanistan remains lawless, the conditions favour the ISKP to grow, like they helped the IS in Iraq and Syria in 2013-14. The Taliban’s growing rivalry with the ISKP was a point of engagement between the U.S. and the Taliban. One of the key terms of the U.S.-Taliban agreement was that the latter would not allow terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda and the IS to use Afghan soil. Unsurprisingly, the Taliban condemned the Kabul blasts. The Taliban offer themselves as a force that can stabilise Afghanistan and fight outfits such as the IS. The Kabul attack could allow them to strengthen this narrative. But the blasts could also serve as a warning of what’s awaiting Afghanistan. When the Taliban are preparing to rule Afghanistan, the ISKP wants to be the new Taliban.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iskp-the-group-behind-kabul-blasts/article36146933.ece

28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||In Haryana, taking the mat by storm||Every September 9, the Sangwans cut a cake. For the family of five at Jhojhu Khurd, a village in Haryana’s Charkhi Dadri district, the date will always be special. It was on this day that their daughter, Komal, chose wrestling as her career, years earlier. When she was nine, Komal sat at home and watched on TV, along with her father Sunil Sangwan, Vinesh Phogat’s performance in the freestyle 48-kg category wrestling match at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Vinesh won that game. Komal was enthralled by Vinesh’s physical strength and immediately decided that she would follow in the footsteps of her favourite wrestler. Vinesh, who is the cousin of Geeta and Babita Phogat, whose story was the basis for the blockbuster film Dangal , stayed just four-km away in Balali village in Bhiwani district. Komal’s dream literally did not seem distant. “September 9 means a lot to her. It means more to her than her birthday. She tells us that was the day of her rebirth. We all celebrate this day with her, but it is strictly a family affair,” says Komal’s mother Snehlata with a broad grin. Komal’s career has been marked by intermittent success. She won a gold medal in the Under-14 national school championship, another gold in the Under-15 national championship, a silver in the Asian Championships and a host of cash prizes at traditional dangals (jousts) in  akharas. Her seven-year-long wrestling career has been full of struggles, challenges and sacrifices not just for her, but for her whole family. “As they say, nothing succeeds like success,” says Sunil. “The fact remains that even today, any help from the government comes only after the players prove themselves. Big functions are held to felicitate Olympians and give them prize money and jobs, but the achievers at the State and national levels need to run around to get their due. It took me more than a year to claim the Rs. 50,000 prize money for my daughter’s win at the national championship. Sometimes, it takes longer,” he says with a sigh. He sits against a backdrop of photos of Komal wearing medals. The couple’s younger daughter, Mukul, 14, also took up wrestling three years ago. Her sister was her inspiration as was Vinesh, whom she says is the “technically most sound” wrestler in the current generation of wrestlers. But despite having produced three international wrestlers, including the Phogat sisters, Balali has no government-aided quality training centre where young wrestlers can train. Sweat and sacrifice The Rajiv Gandhi Khel Stadium, which was set up as part of the government’s policy to provide a stadium in each village, is at a stone’s throw from the Sangwans’ house. The building is dilapidated with wild, overgrown weed covering the ground. No coach has been deployed at the stadium. The locals say they use it to lock cattle. The building naturally keeps sports enthusiasts like Mukul at bay. And so, every day, Mukul, her cousins and a friend, Neha, are driven by Mukul’s uncle for 40 km from Balali to Krishan Akhara in Jhajjar’s Khanpur Khurd. The akhara is run by a wrestling enthusiast and supported by the National Thermal Power Corporation. It has a qualified coach. Mukul’s day begins at 4 a.m. and ends at midnight. Has the thought of quitting wrestling ever crossed her mind given this gruelling routine? Mukul — frail and with a pixie haircut — shakes her head: ‘No.’ Like Mukul’s determined uncle, Sunil too had to make sacrifices. For four years after Komal took up wrestling, he juggled between work and meeting his daughter’s needs before finally deciding to shut his chemist shop and open a liquor shop instead. Like most of the parents of girls who want to take up wrestling, Sunil too had to frequently accompany his daughter to dangals and wrestling events. This affected his work. “It is not safe for a girl to travel outside with a coach and fellow wrestlers. So, most parents accompany the girls outside the city. I also ended up travelling four-five days every month. That’s when I decided to change my profession. Unlike in a chemist shop, you don’t need qualified staff to run a liquor shop. Also, there is little scope for embezzlement in this business,” he says. Money too is no longer a constraint. Snehlata, too, has contributed to her daughter’s career in her own way. She shed all inhibitions to learn to drive a two-wheeler in her thirties, so she could drop and pick up her daughters when her husband was not around. Though a strict vegetarian, she never makes a fuss about cooking meat for her wrestler-daughters. “They must eat meat — they need that kind of protein. Else, how will they compete in the ring,” she asks matter-of-factly. Relatives, friends and the elders of the family support the girls’ decision. Snehlata says she doesn’t pay attention to those who disagree with her decision to allow her girls to do what they want. The couple believe that society’s outlook is changing and there is a growing acceptance of women who make their own choices. Gender bias A bias manifests in other ways, though. There are fewer community dangals for women wrestlers at the village level. The prize money they earn is meagre compared to the hefty cash rewards and expensive gifts bestowed on male wrestlers. And despite the growing popularity of women wrestlers at traditional dangals, with women even challenging men on some occasions, their participation remains very low. Sajjan Singh, the coach at Krishan Akhara, says the number of dangals for women wrestlers will perhaps be just one-fourth of those for men. “To invite women wrestlers to dangals , organisers have to spend extra for changing rooms and washrooms. So, usually they are reluctant. Earlier, instances of women wrestling at these dangals were even fewer. The organisers were reluctant to hold bouts for women in traditional sand bed akharas. But the situation has improved now with the ready availability of wrestling mats. Every committee must hold a wrestling match for women. That would take women wrestling in the State to new heights,” says Sajjan, who is a wrestling coach diploma holder from the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports, Patiala. Many village committees, especially the ones that have local priests on board, generally oppose women dangals. There is a yawning gap in pay, too: while the prize money for women wrestlers at these dangals ranges between Rs. 3,000 and Rs. 5,000, male wrestlers win up to Rs. 1 lakh-Rs. 1.5 lakh for a bout. Lifelines for the sport In the absence of adequate government infrastructure and financial support for wrestlers in the initial years of their careers, it is the cash awards at dangals and the age-old tradition of offering free training at the akharas that keeps the wrestlers motivated. These are the lifelines for the sport. The State boasts of a huge network of such akharas , mostly run by wrestling enthusiasts. Every tenth village in Haryana has such a centre on average. “Wrestling is one sport where there is very little expenditure on equipment, but expenses on the daily diet of the wrestler are huge. That could range between Rs. 7,000 and Rs. 8,000 per month in the beginning and go up over the years. If you add the frequent expenses on travelling and logistics, things become unmanageable for an average lower-middle class family. But the cash rewards at these dangals help to take care of most of this expenditure. Many male wrestlers even make a living out of it,” says Sunil. These dangals also provide much-needed exposure to the players. Come August, freestyle wrestling dangals in the villages across the State are held in fervour till after Holi the next year. Most of them have been a regular affair for decades and are held year after year without a pause. Committees set up by the villagers hold the dangals. These committees collect funds from the locals, businessmen and shopkeepers for the event. The most common patrons, though, are aspiring political leaders as these events pull in large crowds. During the peak season, one dangal is held every day in the State on average. Such is the craze for these wrestling events that even two or three dangals can be held in a village in just a day, though this is rare. Sometimes children are spotted fighting it out in a corner of a village. Their reward? A packet of biscuits and an encouraging crowd. “Wrestling is more than a sport for the people of Haryana,” Sajjan says. “It is their culture. It runs in their veins. It builds character by promoting celibacy among the youth and spreads brotherhood. The rivals shake hands before and after the bout signifying that they were friends before they challenged each other in the akhara and continue to be friends after the game is over.” Hunger for fame, and pride Data show how the participation of women wrestlers at the district and State-level events held by the Haryana Wrestling Association has increased almost five-fold in each of the three categories — sub-junior, junior and senior — from 30-odd participants in 2008-2009 to almost 150-odd till last year. “Till 2008-09, the participation of women wrestlers was so little that no trials were required for senior-level games. There were just a few women wrestlers around like Geeta Phogat, Babita Phogat and Sakshi Malik, but the competition is tough now. It is almost at par with the men,” says Raj Kanwar Hooda, Secretary of the Haryana Wrestling Association. This is quite remarkable in a State that often makes it to the headlines for the wrong reasons. Haryana has a high rate of crime against women, only behind Rajasthan and Assam among the States. In 2018, a village in Sonepat district banned girls from wearing jeans and carrying mobile phones. As per the 2011 Census, Bhiwani district (Charkhi Dadri was carved out of Bhiwani as a separate district in 2016) has a sex ratio of 886 and child sex ratio (0-6 years) of 832, one of the worst in Haryana. So, what drives these young women to aggressively enter a traditionally hyper-masculine sport? What pushes them to be women wrestlers in a State where being a woman alone can be hard enough?  “It is hunger — hunger for fame, and pride,” says Parmesh Gehlot, a former physical training instructor at a private school. Parmesh quit his job to fulfil his unfinished dream of making it big in the sport through his children Tapasya (14) and Daksh (11). He had to give up the sport because of a painful surgery. But he convinced his wife, a college professor, to push both his children into wrestling. He now accompanies them to Krishan Akhara twice a day, and has taken up farming. “There are hundreds of IAS and IPS officers. There are hundreds of MLAs and MPs. But there is only one Neeraj Chopra (gold medallist in javelin at the Tokyo Olympics). It is this desire to stand out from the crowd that is the real driving force,” says Parmesh, a resident of Khanpur Kalan. When the Sangwans are asked whether they have ever regretted the fact that their daughters, and not son Kunal, opted for wrestling, pat comes the reply: ‘no’. Sunil explains how parents in Haryana see female wrestling as a rather easy career opportunity for their daughters since there is little competition till the national level and no caste reservation in sports quota jobs. But despite the growing craze for wrestling among women, the competition for them is still nowhere close to the competition among male wrestlers. In Sonipat, Rohtak, Jhajjar and Hisar, which form the hub of wrestling in Haryana, it is a big deal for the men to even book a berth in the district team. But a woman, even with little calibre, can hope to make it to the national team. And at the national level too, the sport is dominated by wrestlers from Haryana. “With growing competition in male wrestling in Haryana, those not able to make it to the State team often try to play from other States. Even the players in the teams of the Indian Railways, Indian Police and those of Public Sector Undertakings are mostly from Haryana,” says Sunil. The composition of the national wrestling teams, both men and women, for various international events over the past two decades shows how the State dominates the game. India’s first woman wrestler Arjun Awardee Geetika Jakhar says attitudes towards the game have changed a lot over time. “What has changed the most is the outlook of the society towards women wrestlers. Acceptance of the game has grown. Players now have better health facilities compared to those a decade ago. We have been winning medals in wrestling at the Olympics for the past three Games. I believe this is one reason for the growing popularity of the sport. Now, parents want their daughters to become wrestlers and earn medals,” says Geetika, now posted in Fatehabad as Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP). It’s raining rewards Though successive Haryana governments since the Om Prakash Chautala-led regime in the early 2000s have encouraged sports by providing jobs and cash rewards to the winners and making sports an attractive career prospect for the rural youth, the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government took this to a different level by offering jobs in return for medals through the ‘Padak Lao, Pad Pao (Bring a medal, get a post)’ scheme. “The Hooda government took forward the policy of the previous Chautala government to make sports more lucrative by providing better job opportunities and heftier amounts as rewards. The Haryana Police Service rules were amended to reserve 3% permanent posts of DSPs for direct appointment of outstanding sportspersons. Many players such as hockey player Mamta Kharab, wrestler Geetika Jakhar, cricketer Joginder Sharma, wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, boxer Vijender Singh, boxer Akhil Kumar, and incumbent Sports Minister and hockey player Sandeep Singh reaped the benefits of the policy,” says Raj Kanwar, vice-president, Wrestling Federation of India. “ Geeta Phogat, who was appointed as Inspector, was later promoted as DSP. Babita was appointed Sub-Inspector. So, the people in the State began to link sports with jobs. Many of the beneficiaries were women wrestlers. It pulled families, both with wrestling and non-wrestling backgrounds, to the sport in a big way.” The job opportunities for women wrestlers have increased not just in Haryana but in Central government services too, in the Indo-Tibetan Border Police force, the Central Reserve Police Force, the Border Security Force and the Central Industrial Security Force. About a decade ago, wrestling found a place in the All-India Police Sports. Wrestling mats, made available by support from panchayats and the State government, made the choice easier for many girls. Besides, the Hooda government appointed around 550 coaches in different disciplines for different sports in 2013 across the State after nearly two decades. Chandgi Ram, a freestyle wrestler from Hisar’s Sisai village, is regarded as the father of women wrestling in Haryana. He was the first to persuade both his daughters, Sonika Kaliraman and Deepika Kaliraman, to join wrestling in the late 1990s despite stiff social pressure. Chandgi Ram also persuaded his co-coach Jagroop Rathi to introduce his daughter Neha to wrestling. His training centre, commonly known as the Chandgi Ram Akhara, became India’s first training centre for women’s wrestling. Later, Sumer Singh Nandal, running the country’s biggest centre for judo coaching in Haryana’s Hisar, persuaded women players to switch over to wrestling given the striking similarities between both the sports and the better prospects for women wrestlers. Since then, there has been no looking back for the Maliks, Phogats, Sangwans and others. On this September 9, it will be celebration time once again for the Sangwans. The family hopes that Komal, who is now training at the JSW Sports training camp in Karnataka, will join them for yet another round of celebrations. It may be a modest one for the family, but it will be yet another step forward in a traditionally male-dominated society where today, women’s choices are not just being tolerated, but celebrated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-haryana-taking-the-mat-by-storm/article36146928.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Asset monetisation — execution is the key||The Government has announced an ambitious programme of asset monetisation. It hopes to earn Rs. 6 trillion in revenues over a four-year period. At a time when the Government’s finances are in bad shape, that is money the Government can certainly use. Getting asset monetisation right is quite a challenge, though. In asset monetisation, the Government parts with its assets — such as roads, coal mines — for a specified period of time in exchange for a lump sum payment. At the end of the period, the assets return to the Government. Unlike in privatisation, no sale of government assets is involved. By monetising assets it has already built, the Government can earn revenues to build more infrastructure. Asset monetisation will happen mainly in three sectors: roads, railways and power. Other assets to be monetised include: airports, ports, telecom, stadiums and power transmission. First, under-utilised assets Two important statements have been made about the asset monetisation programme. One, the focus will be on under-utilised assets. Two, monetisation will happen through public-private partnerships (PPP) and Investment Trusts. Let us examine each of these in turn. Suppose a port or airport or stadium or even an empty piece of land is not being used adequately because it has not been properly developed or marketed well enough. A private party may judge that it can put the assets to better use. It will pay the Government a price equal to the present value of cash flows at the current level of utilisation. By making the necessary investment, the private player can reap the benefits of a higher level of cash flows. The difference in cash flows under Government and those under private management is a measure of the improvement in efficiency of the assets. This is a win-win situation for the Government and the private player. The Government gets a ‘fair’ value for its assets. The private player gets its return on investment. The economy benefits from an increase in efficiency. Monetising under-utilised assets thus has much to commend it. Those well utilised Matters could be very different in monetisation of an asset that is being properly utilised, say, a highway that has good traffic. In this case, the private player has little incentive to invest and improve efficiency. It simply needs to operate the assets as they are. The private player may value the cash flows assuming a normal rate of growth of traffic. It will pay the Government a price that is the present value of cash flows minus its own return. The Government earns badly needed revenues but these could be less than what it might earn if it continued to operate the assets itself. There is no improvement in efficiency. Suppose the private player does plan to improve efficiency in a well-utilised asset by making the necessary investment and reducing operating costs. The reduction in operating costs need not translate into a higher price for the asset than under government ownership. The cost of capital for a private player is higher than for a public authority. A public authority needs less equity capital and can access debt more cheaply than a private player. The higher cost of capital for the private player could offset the benefit of any reduction in operating costs. As we have seen, the benefits to the economy are likely to be greater where under-utilised assets are monetised. However, private players will prefer well-utilised assets to assets that are under-utilised. That is because, in the former, cash flows and returns are more certain. Private incentives in asset monetisation may not accord with the public interest. Valuation and issues There are other complications. It is very difficult to get the valuation right over a long-term horizon, say, 30 years. Does anybody know what would be the growth rate of the economy over such a period? For a road or highway, growth in traffic would also depend on factors other than the growth of the economy, such as the level of economic activity in the area, the prices of fuel and vehicles, alternative modes of transport and their relative prices, etc. If the rate of growth of traffic turns out to be higher than assessed by the Government in valuing the asset, the private operator will reap windfall gains. Alternatively, if the winning bidder pays what turns out to be a steep price for the asset, it will raise the toll price steeply. The consumer ends up bearing the cost. If transporters have to pay more, the economy suffers. There is also the possibility that roads whose usage is currently free are put up for monetisation. Again, the consumer and the economy bear the cost. It could be argued that a competitive auction process will address these issues and fetch the Government the right price while yielding efficiency gains. But that assumes, among other things, that there will be a large number of bidders for the many assets that will be monetised. Lastly, there is no incentive for the private player to invest in the asset towards the end of the tenure of monetisation. The life of the asset, when it is returned to the Government, may not be long. In that event, asset monetisation virtually amounts to sale. Monetisation through the PPP route is thus fraught with problems. Another way of going about it The other form of monetisation the Government has indicated is creating Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvIT) to which monetisable assets will be transferred. InvITs are mutual fund-like vehicles in which investors can subscribe to units that give dividends. The sponsor of the Trust is required to hold a minimum prescribed proportion of the total units issued. InvITs offer a portfolio of assets, so investors get the benefit of diversification. Assets can be transferred at the construction stage or after they have started earning revenues. In the InvIT route to monetisation, the public authority continues to own the rights to a significant portion of the cash flows and to operate the assets. So, the issues that arise with transfer of assets to a private party — such as incorrect valuation or an increase in price to the consumer — are less of a problem. The pathway What conclusions can we draw from the above? First, a public authority has inherent advantages on the funding side. In general, the economy is best served when public authorities develop infrastructure and monetise these. Second, monetisation through InvITs is likely to prove less of a problem than the PPP route. Third, we are better off monetising under-utilised assets than assets that are well utilised. Fourth, to ensure proper execution, there is a case for independent monitoring of the process. The Government may set up an Asset Monetisation Monitoring Authority staffed by competent professionals. The authority must put all aspects of monetisation under the scanner — valuation, the impact on price charged to the consumer, monetisation of under-utilised versus well-utilised assets, the experience across different sectors, etc. — and document the lessons learnt. Asset monetisation is fine if executed properly — and that is always a big ‘if’. ttrammohan28@gmail.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/asset-monetisation-execution-is-the-key/article36146921.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Kerala’s rising COVID-19 cases explained||Once again, the COVID-19 situation in the State of Kerala is in the spotlight, albeit for all the wrong reasons. More than 60% of the newly reported cases in India in the past week came from Kerala alone, and that naturally raises many eyebrows. How can a State with only 2.5% of India’s population contribute to 60% of its caseload? Antibodies prevalence One thing that we need to acknowledge first is the fact that the most recent nationwide seroprevalence survey in May 2021 by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had estimated that the prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies was the lowest in Kerala at 44% compared to the national average 68%. It meant Kerala had the highest proportion of the population still unexposed to the virus at that time. Given that the virus will keep spreading until a certain level of herd immunity is achieved in the population, either through vaccinations or through natural infections, it is a foregone conclusion that the cases will continue to be high whenever there is increased crowding. Kerala has already vaccinated 75% of its adult population (55% of the total population) with at least a single dose. The daily new COVID-19 cases after peaking at around 40,000 daily during the first week of May have been on a decline ever since and reached a plateau of about 11,000 cases to 12,000 cases and a test positivity rate (TPR) of about 10% during the first week of July this year. Since then, however, the State has been seeing a steady but gradual rise in daily new cases assisted by increased daily testing which reached a peak of nearly two lakh in early August. Decline in daily testing However, the daily caseload saw a decline since August 1 largely owing to a decline in daily testing. The seven-day average daily testing had decreased from 1.7 lakh to 1 lakh leading up to Onam on August 21 even as the TPR went up from 12% to 17%. A series of irrational lockdown relaxation measures and the resulting intermittent spike in mobility on random days, along with reduced daily testing and increased festivities leading up to Onam, were all resulting in increased infections. Yet, the decreasing reported daily new cases in the days leading up to Onam largely assisted by reduced testing gave an inadvertent feeling that the cases were under control. But, it is now understood that the decline was not organic as cases shot up above the 30,000 mark for the last couple of days owing to a slight increase in daily testing. If the State did even two lakh daily tests now, it would be reporting close to 40,000 daily cases. But the low level of testing is still keeping the reported daily case count well below that. Important questions remain. There are genuine apprehensions on whether the current surge in cases in Kerala is due to a new variant of the virus, whether it will mark the beginning of a third wave in India, and if the present surge could result in the collapse of Kerala’s health-care system. Delta variant spread It is to be noted that the Delta variant — a variant that was the primary reason for the majority of cases during the second wave in the rest of India — was detected in nearly 90% of the samples tested from Kerala recently. It implies that this variant of the novel coronavirus is still catching up with the Kerala population while the rest of India has already witnessed one major wave of this variant that resulted in 68% seroprevalence in India. So, concerns about the present surge in Kerala, predominantly by the Delta variant, potentially leading to a third wave in the country may be exaggerated. Kerala’s health-care infrastructure had reached near saturation during the peak of its second wave when daily new cases had passed 40,000 and TPR reached a high of 28%. Given the current surge in cases and increasing TPR, it is highly likely that the State will once again experience a similar situation in the days ahead and overwhelm its health-care infrastructure. Hence, the authorities must be extremely cautious of this situation and make sure that the rising numbers and increased hospitalisation do not exhaust the health-care system. An action plan The State must immediately take stock of its existing health-care infrastructure and see how long it can hold given the current caseload and its inevitable rise in the days ahead. If it cannot handle the impending surge which may potentially see more than 40,000 daily new cases in the immediate term and the associated increased hospitalisations, it may be wise for the State to go in for a complete lockdown for a very short period of one to two weeks to arrest this surge and allow the cases to cool off in the immediate term. In the meantime, the State should make every effort to increase the pace of vaccination, significantly increase testing and tracing efforts so that not many cases go undetected. Once the cases are brought under control, it must evaluate options and envisage a more rationalised lockdown relaxation than the ones that are presently in effect. If managed effectively, the current surge will slow down in a week or two and, by then, the natural infection and vaccinations would have taken the population-level COVID-19 immunity in Kerala to at least 60% to 70%, bringing it closer to the rest of India, but with a lesser human toll compared to other larger Indian States.

28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Filled to the nines||It is not often that nine judges are appointed to the Supreme Court at one go. In a welcome sign of cooperation between the judiciary and the executive, the President of India has signed warrants of appointment within days of the five-member Collegium recommending eight High Court judges, including three women, and a lawyer for elevation. It is nearly two years since Supreme Court appointments were made, and some vacancies have been around for quite some time now. The latest round of appointments possibly signifies the onset of an era in which the two branches agree more and agree faster on the Collegium’s recommendations. The strength of the Bench goes up to 33, in a court that has a sanctioned complement of 34 judges. The presence of three women and the fact that different High Courts are getting representation are positive features and augur well for increasing diversity on the Bench. In particular, Justice B.V. Nagarathna’s elevation at this point of time means that she may become the first woman Chief Justice of India (CJI). The trend of appointing members of the Bar directly to the Supreme Court continues with the honour going this time to former Additional Solicitor-General, P.S. Narasimha, who is also in line to be Chief Justice by efflux of time. A notable candidate whose name does not figure in the list is Justice Akil Kureshi, Chief Justice of the Tripura High Court, who is fairly high in the all-India seniority list of High Court judges. That the finalisation of the recommendations came about after the retirement of Justice Rohinton Nariman — and a change in the composition of the Collegium with it — may indicate that the names were the outcome of a compromise. It is not idle speculation to say that Justice Kureshi’s candidature may have been behind stagnation in the appointment process for a long time. Two years ago, a proposal by the Collegium to name Justice Kureshi as Chief Justice of the Madhya Pradesh High Court was recalled for accommodating the Centre’s sensitivities. He was later assigned to the Tripura High Court. In the larger scheme of things, the omission of individuals may not matter much, but it must not become a practice to sidestep suitable candidates without sufficient cause solely to accommodate the executive’s reservations. After all, the opaque collegium system is sustained only by the belief that it is a bulwark against executive intervention. This raison d’être should not be lost sight of. Going forward, one would wish for fewer spells of impasse in judicial appointments, quicker processing of names, and greater consideration to social and regional representation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/filled-to-the-nines/article36146916.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Near and present||The suicide bombing at Kabul airport which claimed close to 100 lives has shattered any residual optimism the world had that the West pulling out forces and handing the country over to the Taliban, as part of negotiations in Doha, would result in a more peaceful Afghanistan. Instead, what the complex attack claimed by the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) has proven is that no matter what assurances the Taliban’s new regime or its benefactors in Pakistan may provide, they are unable or unwilling to stem the terror threat emanating from the country, despite being provided key intelligence inputs about the attack. There are also suspicions of some collusion within the Taliban regime, as the Haqqani group that is securing Kabul and the airport periphery, is a UN designated terror entity that has carried out attacks with the IS-K in the past. That the U.S. maintains that it continues to “coordinate” with the Taliban on security should further set the seal on any idea of investigations or operations against the Taliban. As this is an alarming scenario, the Government must now acknowledge and prepare for the threats to India. The situation will further enhance India’s already hostile continental flanks, in consonance with threats from Pakistan at the LoC and support to cross-border terrorism, as well China’s LAC aggressions. New Delhi must also focus on diplomacy to highlight its concerns, beginning with the UN where India will have a salient role. As a UNSC member, and President, India must ensure that the UN’s most powerful body does not appear helpless in the face of the Taliban’s challenge, and must make the red lines clear for the kind of government it must guarantee — including one that recognises human rights, adopts some form of representation for its people, and distances itself from terror groups. Chief among these will be the need to ensure that the Haqqani group, including its chief Sirajuddin Haqqani who is the Deputy to Taliban chief Haibatullah Akhundzada, is not included in the official power structure. The group has been responsible for terror and suicide attacks on Indian consulates and the Embassy in particular in 2008-09. As Chairman of the 1988 Sanctions Committee that lists 135 Taliban members as designated terrorists, India must stand firm on any move to ease sanctions on them, including travel, funds access and weaponry. The UN General Assembly (UNGA)’s accreditation committee must also decide on whether to allow a future Taliban-led government to occupy Afghanistan’s seat. Given Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the U.S. later in September, where he is expected to address the UNGA, and then the Quad summit, it is important that India’s position on the Afghan situation and its impact on Indian security are articulated strongly. While briefing MPs, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said the Government is pursuing a “wait and watch” policy, but that assumes the luxury of distance from the ticking time bomb in India’s neighbourhood, which New Delhi does not have.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/near-and-present/article36146917.ece
28 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Self-seeking individuals scuttling intentions of IBC: CEA||Indicating that some stakeholders’ actions were scuttling the intended outcomes of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian invoked the concept of ‘Dharma’ on Friday to urge Indian industry to stop being ‘practical’ and strive to be ‘ideal’, instead. The IBC regime, he said, had helped India emerge from a ‘feudalistic system’ where a corporate debtor felt it was his ‘divine right’ to retain control, and shifted the focus to a ‘Creditor in Control’ regime. Citing India’s ancient literature, including the Bhagavad Gita, Mr. Subramanian said problems arise when there is a wedge between socially optimal behaviour and conduct that is individually optimal for an economic agent. “I think, in the case of IBC, you can clearly see that there are some actions that every stakeholder can take, which would be optimal for the entire IBC system as a whole; visibly what every entity is doing that is basically privately optimal for them. And this wedge is what’s actually leading to the preservation of this Nash equilibrium, where we are stuck where we are,” he said. “When you think about the concept of Dharma from an economic angle, you start realising why it was such a powerful idea… (it means) there is a much bigger goal… “And in some sense, if you think from an economist’s perspective, Dharma is actually this concept of aspiring for what is socially optimal,” he said at a CII meet on five years of the IBC, urging industry captains to think beyond the “I, Me and Myself” perspective.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/self-seeking-individuals-scuttling-intentions-of-ibc-cea/article36146898.ece
28 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||India-Australia aim for ‘early harvest’ trade pact by Dec.||The trade ministers of India and Australia have agreed to speed up trade negotiations with an aim to reach an interim ‘early harvest’ pact by December for liberalising the bilateral flow of goods and services. Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal met Australia’s Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Dan Tehan virtually on Thursday to discuss the road map for concluding a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), beginning with the early harvest accord. The meeting comes within three weeks of a visit to New Delhi by the Australian Prime Minister’s special envoy to India Tony Abbott. Australia views India as a long-standing, valued and trusted partner, Mr. Abbott had asserted in his meetings with Indian ministers, hinting at an expeditious approach on Canberra’s part to CECA negotiations. Three rounds of talks have already been held between the chief trade negotiators of both sides, the ministers said in a joint statement. ‘Pathway to CECA’ “The Ministers noted the importance that negotiations take into account the views of business, industry and other stakeholders, and decided to start consultations on the potential opportunities and impacts of an interim agreement as a pathway to a full CECA,” they added. “The Ministers look forward to a balanced trade agreement that encourages expanded trade and investment flows to the benefit of both of our economies and peoples,” the ministers said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/india-australia-aim-for-early-harvest-trade-pact-by-dec/article36146900.ece
28 August 2021||CHENNAI,||TII exploring electric two-wheeler space: MD||Tube Investments of India Ltd. (TII), which is gearing up to unveil electric three-wheelers by the first quarter of 2022, is exploring the possibility of manufacturing electric two-wheelers to see if it could be profitable, said MD Vellayan Subbiah. “TII is still exploring the two-wheeler space to understand whether it makes business sense, where a slew of new original equipment manufacturers have reportedly ended up losing money,” Mr. Subbiah said during a call with analysts. “We do not want to get into an industry that has a very big revenue pool, but no profit pool,” he said. “TI Cycles president K.K. Paul and his team are exploring it actively,” Mr. Subbiah added. “If we get to a solution where we think that there is a profit pool, then we will jump into,” he said. Earlier, the company had announced plans to unveil electric three-wheelers by the end of 2021. However, it was delayed due to COVID and might hit the market by the first quarter of next year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/tii-exploring-electric-two-wheeler-space-md/article36146902.ece
28 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||IBC: Govt. working with RBI on CoC’s conduct||The corporate affairs ministry is working with the finance ministry, RBI and the Indian Banks’ Association on the conduct of the committee of creditors (CoC) under the insolvency resolution process, a senior official said on Friday. “We are working with IBA, RBI and Department of Financial Services on the very important issue of the conduct of CoC,” Corporate Affairs Secretary Rajesh Verma said. The CoC is crucial in deciding a resolution plan under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The CoC’s conduct assumes significance amid recent instances of creditors taking steep haircuts on their exposure under resolution plans. He did not elaborate further. Mr. Verma also acknowledged that it has been upheld in judgements that commercial wisdom lies with CoC as the IBC provides for a competitive market driven process for value discovery of the debtor. He said erosion of the value of a debtor was a matter of concern and emphasised that “timing and asset preservation is of real essence”.

28 August 2021||KOLKATA,||Tata Motors extends association with WFI||Following the Indian wrestlers’ fine performance in the Tokyo Olympics, Tata Motors on Friday extended its three-year-old association with the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) with a ‘quest for gold’ in Paris 2024. Holistic development of the wrestlers, providing assured and enhanced access to world-class training facilities, internationally-acclaimed coaches, support through nutritional programmes to young and talented wrestlers, and offering central contracts to senior and budding wrestlers are some of the highlights of the association. “There will be an elite development programme and a junior development programme. There are well-defined criteria on how the financial support will be used,” said Girish Wagh, the executive director of Tata Motors, at an event. WFI president Brijbhushan Sharang Singh said, “The elite wrestlers always get the support but we could take this to the wrestlers in rural areas due to the contribution of Tata Motors.” He looked forward to extending support to the State and district associations. Brijbhushan requested Tata Motors to consider setting up a facility around Delhi to address wrestlers’ injury concerns and urged the company to take up the title sponsorship of the COVID-19 hit Pro Wrestling League. The seven wrestlers who competed in the Tokyo Olympics were presented Tata Yodha pick-up vehicles. Deepak Punia was absent due to some prior commitments. Recounting his struggle due to a knee injury prior to Tokyo 2020, Olympic bronze medallist Bajrang Punia said, “The injury did a lot of damage. I did my rehab but could not cure it fully. I consulted the doctor and my rehab is on.” Dahiya satisfied Silver medallist Ravi Dahiya said he was not distracted by the uncertainty surrounding the 2020 Games. “I never participated in a (multi-sport) Games. I thought if it took place it would be nice, or else I would get another chance,” said Ravi. Ace wrestler Vinesh Phogat, who was suspended by the WFI for indiscipline at the Tokyo Games before being let off, said she learnt a lot despite returning empty-handed from her second successive Olympics. “At the senior level we don’t have time to grieve over a defeat, because the next Olympics is approaching and there are back-to-back competitions. It’s one thing to reach the top, but it is challenging to stay there,” said Vinesh. Anshu Malik suggested that the wrestlers need a psychologist and Brijbhushan agreed that at least a couple of psychologists should work with the wrestlers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tata-motors-extends-association-with-wfi/article36147231.ece

The Dutchman had clocked a best lap in one minute and 44.472 seconds to outpace Valtteri Bottas by 0.041 seconds with championship leader and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton a close third before he ended the session after hitting the barriers. Red-flag stoppage Verstappen’s crash at Malmedy was the second to prompt a red-flag stoppage and came only minutes after Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc had gone off at Les Combes in challenging drying conditions at the sprawling circuit in the Ardennes. The two accidents brought a premature end to the session on a day of intermittent rainstorms. Fernando Alonso was fourth for Alpine, ahead of Pierre Gasly of Alpha Tauri, Lance Stroll of Aston Martin and Esteban Ocon in the second Alpine. Four-time champion Sebastian Vettel was eighth in the second Aston Martin ahead of Lando Norris of McLaren and Sergio Perez, who was re-signed by Red Bull for 2021 earlier in the day, taking 10th. After another heavy rain shower between the sessions, the track was declared wet as Bottas, who was fastest in morning practice, led the way with fellow-Finn Kimi Raikkonen. He very quickly decided to pit and switch to slick ‘dry’ tyres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/verstappen-tops-then-crashes/article36147173.ece

This innings of ours was never about survival. Pujara clearly showed that. He was ready to pounce on anything loose. It really helps when you show intent,” Rohit said, after Pujara finished unbeaten on 91 on the third day of the third Test against England on Friday. Rohit said the team was never concerned about Pujara’s form. “There hasn’t been a single conversation about Pujara’s form inside the team. All the talk has happened outside the dressing room. We need to consider what he has done over his career, and not just in one or two innings. Yes, of late, the runs haven’t come, but that doesn’t mean that Pujara’s quality has gone missing. “This wasn’t the easiest situation to bat as we were 300-odd behind. It shows his character and mindset.” Rohit, who was dismissed for 59, said, "It was an unlucky decision. The hundred was not on my mind.

After being restricted to 135 for seven, Oman overhauled the target with one ball and three wickets to spare. With 11 runs required off the last over, Mumbai pinned its hopes on Akash Parkar’s medium-pace.

28 August 2021||Paris,||Messi close to PSG debut||Lionel Messi could make his hotly anticipated debut for Paris Saint-Germain against Reims in Champagne country on Sunday but it is Kylian Mbappe who is the centre of all the attention just now amid ongoing speculation about his future. Messi has not featured in either of PSG’s two Ligue 1 games since arriving in the French capital as he continues to work up his fitness having returned to training late after captaining Argentina to Copa America glory last month. “It will be a long week, but if everything goes well we hope he can be in the squad and feature in the team,” Pochettino told ESPN after the Qatar-owned club beat Brest 4-2 last time out. The logic There is logic in giving Messi a run-out against Reims, so that he is not completely lacking in match sharpness before joining up with the Argentina squad for a series of World Cup qualifiers at the start of September. The same applies to Neymar, who has also not featured for his club this season after playing against Argentina in the Copa America final and then enjoying an extended summer break. The match at the 21,000-capacity Stade Auguste-Delaune — with its statue of former Ballon d’Or winner Raymond Kopa, the ex-Reims and Real Madrid great, outside — is a sell-out, and the Champagne region is fizzing with excitement at the prospect of welcoming Messi. In Paris, though, they are more concerned about Mbappe, after a week which saw Madrid put in an offer of €160 million for the 22-year-old World Cup winner. But with time running out before the transfer window closes on August 31, it remains to be seen if Mbappe will feature in Reims, if the game could be his last in Ligue 1, or if he might already have left by then. Losing Mbappe would be a hammer blow to PSG’s prestige, but then again having Messi and Neymar ready to step in suggests it might cope without the France forward.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/messi-close-to-psg-debut/article36147652.ece
28 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||New faces likely for World championships, says Nieva||The Indian men’s boxing team for the World championships will be selected on the basis of performances at the Nationals next month, High Performance Director Santiago Nieva said, conceding that there is very little time to conduct elaborate trials. Nieva, who is currently on a break, spoke to PTI from his home in Sweden and touched on his assessment of the Indian boxers at the Olympics and the plans ahead for what will be a very busy next few months starting with the Nationals from September 15. “The Worlds in Belgrade from October 26 is a really big assignment coming up. The time for preparation is very less. So we will rely on performances in the Nationals to figure the team. There is no time to hold trials,” Nieva said. “Some new faces will definitely be there but we also need experience. Those who participated in the Olympics will also be considered. But I guess they will have to compete in the Nationals.” Amit Panghal (52kg), Manish Kaushik (63kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg), Ashish Chaudhary (75kg) and Satish Kumar (+91kg) competed in the Tokyo Games. Of these, only Satish managed to go past the first round. Krishan is out of reckoning due to a shoulder injury which will keep him out for three months. Nieva is expected to be back in India ahead of the Nationals. “It is a unique situation because of the pandemic. A World Championships just three months after the Olympics is not common but it is what it is. We would try to go abroad for training after selecting the team but if it doesn’t work out, we stay here and train,” Nieva added. Nieva admitted that the performance of the Indians in the Olympics could have been a lot better and there will be pressure on him as well as the team at the Worlds. “There is always pressure. It is never avoidable. But I don’t think it would be any different from other times. When you do well, people expect you to do better. If you do badly, people expect you to improve. So there is always scrutiny.” New weight categories The upcoming Nationals as well as the Worlds will be competed in the new weight categories introduced by the International Boxing Association last month. The revised weight divisions for men are 48kg, 51kg, 54kg, 57kg, 60kg, 63.5kg, 67kg, 71kg, 75kg, 80kg, 86kg, 92kg, and +92kg. In all likelihood, someone like Panghal would compete in 51kg or 54kg and several others will also weigh their options. On Panghal, Nieva said he has spoken to the world No. 1, who has been aloof after the disappointment at the Olympics. “I expected him to be still bitter but the good thing is he seems to be looking ahead. He came across clear and analytical about his performance and I believe he is well on course to shrug it off and come back stronger,” Nieva said. On the Tokyo performance, Nieva both agreed and disagreed with Boxing Federation of India president Ajay Singh’s assessment that the Indians would need to focus more on the mental aspect.  When you do well, people expect you to do better. If you do badly, people expect you to improve||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/new-faces-likely-for-world-championships-says-nieva/article36146907.ece
28 August 2021||CHENNAI,||Chance for India to be in medal bracket: Sharath||China’s withdrawal from the Asian table tennis championships in Doha gives India a good chance of winning a medal for the first time, feels India’s top paddler Sharath Kamal. Not enough time Chinese Table Tennis Association secretary Qin Zhijian told the State-run website China.org.cn : “As the table tennis competition of the National Games will be held between September 17 and 26 and the Asian Championships begin on September 28 (to October 5), there is not enough time between the two tournaments. “Taking international flights into consideration, it will be quite difficult for the team to arrive in Qatar on schedule to participate.” Having finished fifth the last time — the 2019 edition in Yogyakarta, Indonesia — Sharath Kamal felt there was a chance of the Indian men’s team ending up with a medal this time. “Now, with China not competing, we have moved up a position from fifth seed to fourth. We have never played the semifinals before. Also, both the semifinalists get a bronze. “Moreover, Singapore is not the same strong team it used to be,” Sharath told The Hindu here on Friday. The 39-year-old nine-time National champion said, he had begun training for the championships. “We are expecting clarity on the National camp for the Asians in a few days’ time,” he said. To miss Star Contender Sharath, however, confirmed that he would not be taking part in the WTT Star Contender tournament from September 22-25 in Doha. “I am not ready yet. I want to take my time,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chance-for-india-to-be-in-medal-bracket-sharath/article36146912.ece
28 August 2021||Leeds,||Why was Pant told to change his stance, wonders Gavaskar||The legendary Sunil Gavaskar is baffled as to why the English umpires objected to Rishabh Pant’s stance of standing outside the crease during the ongoing third Test against England as he feels that rules don’t prevent him from doing so. After the end of the first day’s play at Headingley, the swashbuckling wicketkeeper said he had to change his stance after being told by the umpire as batting outside the crease to negate swing formed footmarks in the pitch’s danger area. But Gavaskar said footmarks don’t determine a batsman’s stance. “I was wondering why was he told to change his stance, if that is true. I only read it. Batsman can stand anywhere, even on the middle of the pitch and when the batsman goes down the track against the spinners (footmarks can form even then),” Gavaskar said while commentating during the third day. His fellow-commentator and former India player Sanjay Manjrekar called it “ridiculous”. “Because I was standing outside the crease and my front-foot was coming into the danger area, he (the umpire) told me that you can’t stand there,” Pant had said at a virtual interaction after day one.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/why-was-pant-told-to-change-his-stance-wonders-gavaskar/article36147175.ece
28 August 2021||Madrid,||Casemiro to stay at Real Madrid||Midfielder Casemiro has extended his contract with Real Madrid by two years until 2025, the Spanish giant announced on Friday. The 29-year-old Brazilian international’s previous deal had been due to expire in 2023. He joins Karim Benzema, until 2023, Thibaut Courtois, until 2026, and Federico Valverde, until 2027, in signing contract extensions with the club during the close-season. “Casemiro signed his contract renewal at Cuidad Real Madrid, accompanied by president Florentino Perez,” Real said in a statement. “The Brazilian midfielder remains linked to our club until June 30, 2025.” The defensive midfielder has won four Champions League titles and two La Liga crowns since arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu. Casemiro has signed the new deal four days before the end of the transfer window, with Madrid still chasing the signature of Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/casemiro-to-stay-at-real-madrid/article36147650.ece
29 August 2021||Liverpool,||Liverpool faces Chelsea in early Premier League title showdown||Liverpool and Chelsea face off in the first heavyweight clash between title contenders of the Premier League season, while Arsenal aims to get off the mark when they visit Manchester City on Saturday. Chelsea and Liverpool are two of five teams to take maximum points from two games alongside West Ham, Tottenham and Brighton. But of the pre-season title favourites, they have already opened up a two-point advantage over Manchester United and three-point lead on Manchester City. Tougher test Lukaku faces a much tougher test at a full Anfield with Liverpool rejuvenated by the return of fans and talismanic centre-back Virgil van Dijk from injury. The Dutchman’s presence has seen Jurgen Klopp’s men keep two clean sheets in their opening games against Norwich and Burnley. But goalkeeper Alisson Becker acknowledged that beating Chelsea would send a far stronger signal to its title rivals that Liverpool is back to its best. More misery for Arteta? Arsenal sits second bottom without a point or even a goal to show from its first two league games and faces a daunting trip to the defending champion if it is to break that drought before a two-week international break. The Gunners got a morale-boosting 6-0 win over a youthful West Brom side in the League Cup in midweek to ease the pressure on manager Mikel Arteta with captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scoring a hat-trick in his first start of the season after testing positive for coronavirus. Arteta has reportedly been given until the October international break to turn things around, but Arsenal’s recent record against City gives little cause for optimism come Saturday. City has not lost to Arsenal in the league since 2015 and can ill-afford another slip up after losing to Tottenham on the first weekend of the season. Homecoming for Kane City was forced to concede another defeat to Spurs chairman Daniel Levy this week after Harry Kane announced he will be remaining at Tottenham this season. The England captain had wanted to move to the Etihad with the aim of ending his wait to win a trophy, but City was unwilling to meet Levy’s demands of a fee well in excess of the Premier League record £100 million it paid for Jack Grealish earlier this month. Heroes welcome Despite the speculation over his future, Kane was given a hero’s welcome by the travelling Tottenham support away to Wolves last weekend. After committing his future to his boyhood club, he is expected to start for the first time in the league this season when Spurs aims to keep its perfect start going at home to Watford.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/liverpool-faces-chelsea-in-early-premier-league-title-showdown/article36147654.ece
28 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Abhishek Chavan and Nidhi Gupta lead||Abhishek Chavan of Maharashtra continued to assert his class as he led the men’s field with a cumulative total of seven points after two rounds in the superleague of Indian online carrom challenge organised by the All India Carrom Federation (AICF). Chavan started the proceedings in spectacular fashion with an ultimate slam on the first board. The ten bonus points from the slam, the only slam of the day, reduced his score from 13 to 3, and put him on top of the table. He was followed at a distance by Abdul Rahman (21), Mohd. Rehan (21), Mohammed Sheikh (32), Faisal Khan (32), Gautam Prasad Bhol (33) and Vikas Dharia (36), Abdul Asif (36). The top eight from among the 16 players will make it to the champions league after four rounds of four boards each. They will be joined by the country’s best players at that stage. In the women’s section, Nidhi Gupta of Chandigarh had the best round for a score of 19 and that put her on top of the table with 47 points from two rounds. She was followed by Aakanksha Kadam (49), Kavya Shree (51), Deepa Naik (55), Mamta Kumari (57), Tanishka Viswakarma (58), Shruti Sonawane (59) and Mantasha Iqbal (60) among others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/abhishek-chavan-and-nidhi-gupta-in-lead/article36147218.ece

Sethuraman won the Barcelona Open chess tournament title here while compatriot Karthikeyan Murali finished third. Better tie-break score Sethuraman (Elo 2644) collected 7.5 points from nine rounds to emerge winner on the basis of a better tie-break score after Daniil Yuffa of Russia also finished level with the Indian player. In the ninth and final round played late on Thursday, Sethuraman beat Hakobyan in a Catalan Closed variation game. Sethuraman, who was the top seed, remained unbeaten through the nine rounds, winning six matches and drawing three. He finished strongly, scoring wins in his last three rounds, including over fellow Indian N.R. Visakh and Armenia's Aram Hakobyan. “Elated to win the Barcelona Open 2021,” he tweeted after the win. Sethuraman gained 8.5 Elo points thanks to the triumph while Karthikeyan (Elo 2606) increased his by 6.4 points. Sethuraman and Karthikeyan had played out a draw in the fifth round. Karthikeyan won six games, drew two and went down to Hakobyan in the sixth round. He finished equal on seven points with four others, including fellow Indian Aravindh Chithambaram, but clinched the third spot on the basis of a better tie-break score. In the final round, Karthikeyan outplayed WGM R. Vaishali in 30 moves.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/gm-sethuraman-wins-barcelona-open/article36146909.ece
28 August 2021||Spa-Francorchamps (Belgium),||Hamilton eyes 100th F1 win at Belgian GP||Lewis Hamilton can clinch a record-extending 100th win at this Sunday’s Belgian Grand Prix, where fellow F1 great Michael Schumacher secured the first of his 91 race victories on his favourite track 30 years ago. The 36-year-old Hamilton has earned 78 of his 99 victories with Mercedes since 2013 after leaving McLaren. Six of Hamilton’s seven F1 titles have been with Mercedes and he believes he has surpassed his own expectations. “When I decided to leave McLaren and join this team, I truly believed we would experience great success,” Hamilton said on Thursday. “But of course, I could never have imagined the success we would have had.” Hamilton’s nine straight podium finishes in 2007 are still a record for a driver in his debut season. Although he missed out on the title to Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen by just one point that year, he beat Ferrari’s Felipe Massa by one point the following year. Hamilton has won every title since 2014 except for 2016, when his Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg won the title.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hamilton-eyes-100th-f1-win-at-belgian-gp/article36147178.ece

The Portugal forward is headed back to the club where he won eight major trophies from 2003-2009. Financial details were not disclosed but British and Italian media said United would buy Ronaldo for €25 million on a two-year deal. Ronaldo will leave Juventus with 101 goals, two league crowns and a Coppa Italia to his name. After telling Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri on Thursday of his desire to leave Turin, widespread media reports claimed Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, had agreed personal terms with Manchester City.

A selection of probables — with the exception of Bengaluru FC and ATK Mohun Bagan players on duty in the AFC Cup — trained under National coach Igor Stimac at Salt Lake Stadium from August 15. The squad will leave for Nepal on August 30 to play the friendlies on September 2 and 5 at Kathmandu. “We can’t expect much after 10 days of preparation. The legs are still heavy from the load. We need to slow down and refresh the players,” Stimac said while announcing the squad of 25. “We need to be careful going into the games against Nepal. We understand that the ATK MB and BFC players will be in better shape than others,” Stimac said in his assessment of the probables, who played two practice games during the camp.  The squad: goalkeepers: Amrinder Singh, Dheeraj Singh Moirangthem, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu; defenders: Pritam Kotal, Chinglensana Singh Konsham, Mandar Rao Dessai, Akash Mishra, Rahul Bheke, Subhasish Bose, Seriton Fernandes; midfielders: Lalengmawia, Bipin Singh, Anirudh Thapa, Sahal Abdul Samad, Brandon Fernandes, Liston Colaco, Yasir Mohammad, Glan Martins, Suresh Singh Wangjam, Jeakson Singh, Pronay Halder; forwards: Manvir Singh, Rahim Ali, Sunil Chhetri and Farukh Choudhary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/two-new-faces-in-india-team-for-nepal-friendlies/article36146910.ece

28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Krishna—the Supreme One||In the Bhagavad Gita, chapter nine, Lord Krishna tells Arjuna that He sustains everything, sentient and non-sentient, but He Himself is not dependent on anything. Although He is Omnipresent, we do not know Him. Non-sentient entities lack the capacity to know Him. But even among sentient beings, few know Him. When He took the Rama and Krishna avataras, He lived in the midst of human beings for many years. Yet, few recognised Him as the Supreme One, said Akkarakkani Srinidhi in a discourse. Mandodari, while weeping over her husband Ravana’s death, says that Rama is none but the four armed Vishnu. Those who seek only the Lord, are rare, as Krishna points out in the Gita. He says ‘Vasudeva sarvam iti sa mahatma su durlabhah’ — few are the people to whom Vasudeva is everything. While the Lord sustains everything, it is not in the sense in which, say, a pot holds water. The Lord sustains everything by His will. A body is supported by the atma through its intelligence. In the same way, the Lord, who is present in all, sustains and directs atmas by His will. The idea is summed up brilliantly by Nammazhavar (Thiruvaimozhi 1-1-7), where he says that the Lord who is spoken of in the Vedas is in the entire Universe, although He remains hidden, just as the jivatma is inside the body, and it is this Lord who swallows everything at the time of dissolution. Nammazhvar repeats the idea in yet another pasuram (Thiruvaimozhi 1-1-10). Sage Parasara in Vishnu Purana says the Paramatma is One who knows all about vidya and avidya. In the Gita, Krishna tells Arjuna about Raja vidya. By saying that those with demonic qualities do not surrender to Him (Gita chapter 7, verse 15), He indicates what avidya is. Thus the Paramatma defined by Parasara is none other than Krishna.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/krishnathe-supreme-one/article36146965.ece

28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||for tea and dinner||Some meals never lose their magic. One such memorable lunch was a Maharashtrian feast to mark a joyous occasion – a friend winning a prestigious academic prize several years ago. That meal popped up in my mind as I recently drove past Maharashtra Sadan in central Delhi. I wanted to eat something from Maharashtra, but didn’t really want a regular meal with Kolhapuri mutton et al. So, I decided that I’d look for something else that was typically Maharashtrian — vada pav . It turned out that there was a small centre in Vaishali, Ghaziabad, which specialised in pav . Chilli Vada Pav (Ph no: 9999170046) has different kinds of pav, and has been operating in NCR for the last five years. I asked for three kinds — classic vada pav (Rs. 52), misal pav ( Rs. 169), and pav bhaji (between Rs. 52 and Rs. 72). The food was well packed — each pav came wrapped in butter paper, quite like a burger. They came with all the necessary accompaniments: bhaji , chutney, a powdered garlic spice masala, sev, and gathiya for toppings, apart from chopped onions and green chillies. The pav became our teatime snack, and I had quite a fulfilling high tea. I liked the soft and spongy square bun, and the potato patty inside, which was fresh, lightly spiced, and crunchy. I took the top bun off one of the vada pavs , dipped it in my tea and munched on it. That tasted good, too. We had the misal pav and pav bhaji for dinner, and thought it was quite a nice change from the usual fare. The bhaji — suspiciously orange, but a tasty mix of mashed vegetables — complemented the plain flavours of the bun. I topped the sabzi with chopped coriander leaves, bits of sev and crispy pieces of gathiya . What I missed was the moth beans that the misal pav is served with. Chilli Vada Pav offers a Maharaja vada pav (served with mayonnaise), cheese vada pav, and Schezwan vada pav (with Chinese sauces). There are many who believe that Mumbai’s street food is better than that of Delhi, Kolkata or elsewhere. I am not sure about that. I think the regions all have their own specialities, and each street food dish has its place in the sun — from Delhi’s sweet and sour papri chaat , Lucknow’s succulent kebabs, and Kolkata’s potato filled phuchka to Chennai’s crispy vada . But what attracts me to Maharashtra’s pav bhaji is that it is a meal itself. In a way it is like sabzi-roti , but so very different.

28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Wristwatch for ISRO||The Olympics, and Neeraj Chopra, has given the country cause for celebration recently. But India’s space programme has been doing so for years. With its frugality, its ability to compete on the world stage, and now as a source of inspiration for a new line of watches. The Bangalore Watch Company has launched its Apogee (the farthest point in a satellite’s orbit) collection, and co-founder Nirupesh Joshi explains how it comes out of a childhood spent marvelling at space flight. “We are kids of the 1980s; we grew up watching the Indian space programme grow from strength to strength — from the early satellite launches to later launch vehicle capabilities,” he says. “Especially, the last decade’s achievements. The moon missions and the Mars mission are as much an inspiration to us as they are to a billion people in India.” Of course, space has always held sway with horology brands, and Joshi acknowledges that. “Omega makes watches associated with NASA missions, and many others make timepieces associated with the ESA [European Space Agency]. We believe the Apogee is the first watch collection by an Indian brand that is associated with the Indian space programme.”  Time and space  The watch, which comes in four variants, share the same technical details. The cases are machined out a single block of titanium, the movement is Swiss-made and automatic, each caseback has a 3D artwork of the Aryabhata satellite, and the final product is hand-assembled in Bengaluru. The 44mm convex case is designed in a retro ‘helmet’ style popular in the 1960s and 70s, and features two crowns. Where the models differ is in their dial colours, “each inspired by space”. So there’s blue, green and grey, in addition to the limited-edition ‘Extraterrestrial’ (50 pieces), featuring a dial made of meteorite. “There are mostly two sources of meteorites in the world, one in Gibeon, Namibia, and the other in Sweden. The Gibeon region is now restricted by the Namibian government, but the Muonionalusta isn’t,” explains Joshi. “We worked with a group of meteorite hunters in USA to identify and source the rocks. These were then sent to Switzerland for grading and cutting, and then back to India for printing and final assembly.”  Common goals  The company, which has made timepieces inspired by cricket in the past, and has a range of Pilot watches as well, uses movements manufactured by Sellita, the Swiss manufacturer. The 4Hz movement has a 38-hour power reserve and Joshi says, “These movements are used by many established Swiss watch brands. No improvements were made except regulating them to factory recommended accuracy settings.” Given that the Indian space programme has inspired the watch, the collection was launched online on August 15. “ISRO [Indian Space Research Organisation] is an inspiration. It demonstrates to us that it is possible to achieve projects of huge scale while still working with limited resources as long as you have a great team and your sights are set on the end goal,” Joshi concludes.  The Apogee collection starts at Rs. 68,000, on bangalorewatchco.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/wristwatch-for-isro/article36147087.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Prepping for Kabul||A couple of days ago, Marimuthu, my intrepid istriwallah , returned my Levi’s (circa 2002) beautifully pressed... but with a front crease. Summoning the requisite courage — you’ll know why in a bit — I called him. ‘Marimuthu,’ I said. ‘Er... you seem to have ironed my jeans with a front crease. Again. No worries, but could you iron them flat, seam to seam, the next time, er, if you don’t mind?’ ‘Oh,’ responded Marimuthu after a brief pause. ‘You don’t like the way I do istri-aa , Mr Big Posh Finicky Dorai? Then go to Afghanistan, no. They’ll iron your jeans right for you. And give it a bullet washing, too, free of cost, lol!’ See, Marimuthu can’t be blamed here. He’s on Clubhouse, Insta, Twitter, etc, and is well-informed. If role models like Ramratan Payal, Hari Bhushan Thakur Bachaul and Shobha Karandlaje are asking us to go to Afghanistan when we mention rising fuel prices or women’s safety, Marimuthu is well within his rights to do so, too. Earlier, when my pyjamas came back without their nada and I brought it up, his recommended travel destination for me used to be Pakistan, of course. Since Afghanistan appears to be the next port-of-call for several of us from the look of it, I say there is no harm in being prepared. My first question is what is the Afghan situation on Saravana Bhavan? Are they still operational? Because I can’t go otherwise. I belong to a group — a very large one, mind you — which swore on the Gita that they would never travel to a country that doesn’t have a Saravana Bhavan. That, too, one that serves getti chutney. I request the authorities to get back on this asap. Secondly, and I ask this after intense Googling over the last five years, where can I get my hands on the recipe to Katrina Kaif’s Afghan Jalebi ? I even messaged the ultimate exotic-dish resource, Ms Padma Lakshmi, when all else failed. But, alas, got no response. Also, in the event of us getting into what is referred to as a ‘situation’ in diplomatic circles, who will be coming to airlift us? Will it be Akshay Kumar or Kangana Ranaut? As long as you are rescued, why does it matter who it is, you may ask. It matters. Let me assure you it does. If it is Akki, I want to keep my questions on mango-farming handy and also see if I can get a refund on Smt Haasya Haddis’ books. If it is Kangana, I want to stay back and take my chances. Next, since it used to be Pakistan not too long ago when we needed life lessons, and it is Afghanistan now, my question: using our ancient time-travel techniques (sister technologies of Vedic internet, pushpaka aircraft, and Kurukshetric nuclear warheads), why not arrange a whistle-stop tour of Cambodia, Rwanda, East Timor, Zaire, etc, too — at appropriate points in history — so ingrates like me understand once and for all how much better off we are. But for all those advising us to go to Afghanistan, the most important question I have is this: what do I tell the innocent children there, the ones who haven’t made it across the barbed wire, and the stoic, helpless women when they look into my eyes and see me as a brother from the country of Buddha, Gandhi and Kaniyan Pungundranar the Sangam poet who said, ‘Every city is my city and everyone, my kin’?  Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/prepping-for-kabul/article36147091.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Of sex, politics and discomfort||It’s the start of the day in Oxford. Amia Srinivasan probably woke up quite early for our morning Zoom call, but she doesn’t let on. Her long hair loose and her skin glowing, the Indian-American speaks in a clipped accent, pausing between questions as she frames her responses. It is easy to imagine the 36-year-old in the classroom at Oxford’s All Souls College, where she teaches philosophy and has held the prestigious Chichele Chair for Social and Political Theory (a statutory professorship) since January 2020. Much has been written about her being the first woman, the first person of colour, and the youngest to hold this position, but it is evident Srinivasan shrugs off these labels. Now, with the launch of her first non-fiction book, The Right to Sex , much is being written about her again. The divisive work — a collection of six essays that attempts to break down the politics of desire, discusses the pitfalls of pornography, and asks questions about whether one has the right to sex in a world where the personal is political — has had armchair philosophers, feminists, the LGBTQI+, and even peers critique her for her brazen take on sex. But she is open to it all. “I like criticism; I think it is an important part of the feminist tradition,” she tells me with a smile. The book grew out of an essay, Does anyone have the right to sex? (published in the London Review of Books in 2018), and was written over two summers in California, where, as she told The Guardian , she “would get up at 6 am to surf before settling down to work”. It delves into uncomfortable questions: what makes one person eminently more desirable than another, who decides this, what is the relationship between feminism and state power, how does consent work in the #MeToo era. It is also a heavily-loaded gun that challenges what many feminists and philosophers have said so far. Srinivasan addresses some of these in her conversation with The Hindu Weekend.   What does The Right to Sex mean to you?  The notion I’m interested in is this idea rooted in male sexual entitlement — that men have a right to have a certain amount of sex, regardless of whether the women want to. You see this explicitly in play in the so-called incel subculture [involuntary celibates, who claim they are unable to get a romantic or sexual partner despite desiring one]. These young men talk about themselves as if they are lonely and sexually marginalised, but what they are really upset about is that they are not getting their due, sexually speaking. [As Srinivasan explained in an earlier interview, they aren’t able to attract the sort of women that could confer a high sexual status on them.] This comes out of an ideology of male sexual entitlement.  Feminism has been repurposed today to suit the world we live in.  I think the resurgence of feminism is a good thing, but I do worry about some of the forms that it can take. Globally, there exists a certain kind of mainstream feminism that’s not fundamentally interested in critiquing structures, but in slotting women into pre-existing structures of inequality. So, while the question of how many women are in your boardroom, or how many women are in positions of political leadership matter, it stop us from questioning whether the boardroom is a good democratic structure to begin with. Should we have corporations exercising this much influence over society? Does party politics, as it now exists, really enfranchise people, especially women? I think there can be a tendency to focus on middle-class and wealthy women, and not pay enough attention to those most vulnerable.  H ow does the politics of desire play out in countries that are deeply patriarchal?  There’s a profound asymmetry in most societies. On the one hand, there’s an implicit understanding, even if people deny it objectively like they do in the UK, that men, in some sense, are entitled to sex. For example, mostly everywhere rape in marriage is not recognised, or has only been recognised very recently. The whole point of the marriage contract is that men get to secure their entitlement to as much sex as they want. The flip side is that women aren’t entitled to sex on their terms. They play out differently in different cultures, but I do think it’s no coincidence that the assertion of male sexual entitlement goes hand in hand with the denial of women’s sexual agency, desire, and pleasure.   Why is u nhindered access to pornography problematic?   I wasn’t really concerned about pornography until I started teaching about the debates that feminists had in the US and the UK, especially in the 70s and 80s. And I found that my students responded very strongly, often siding with those who were very critical of pornography. I think the reason is because they are of a generation who have come of age sexually when online pornography is ubiquitous. This mainstream porn doesn’t help set expectations, tell them the truth about sex, offer alternative views. It’s porn [that is limiting] that trains people to experience pleasure as acts of male domination and female subordination.  Many of the concepts you refer to are quite w estern. What is the audience you wrote for ?  I’m a member of the Indian diaspora [born to Indian parents in Bahrain]. I’ve grown up in the US and the UK and, as a result, most of my orienting points come from a feminist tradition within a kind of Anglophone tradition. I think some of these notions, like male sexual entitlement and rape culture, do travel quite well, but there are also important specificities of culture and history that shape regimes of sexual entitlement in particular countries. I don’t expect the book to make automatic sense, and I don’t aspire to a kind of completeness or global reach. But I do hope it contributes to a conversation.

28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Breaking an addiction||At a vipassana course I took years ago, I learnt the difference between making an assumption and gaining true knowledge. When we read something in a book, we assume it’s true; but we can only become knowledgeable through experience. So, even though I write on wellness and was aware of the term biodiversity, I only understood its real impact after visiting author, activist and environmentalist Vandana Shiva’s biodiversity conservation farm, Navdanya, on the outskirts of Dehradun in Uttarakhand. Spread across 52 acres, this land was earlier a sugarcane and eucalyptus plantation. Today, these commercial crops have been replaced with a heaving abundance of trees, shrubs, creepers, grasses, and herbs. There are approximately 72 species of birds, 5,000 varieties of crops (paddy, wheat, pulses, oil seeds, vegetables, millets) and 78 types of herbs within the farm, not to mention worms, beetles, butterflies, lizards, spiders, and toads, all playing their roles in this diverse landscape. In just an acre-long patch, there are 650 indigenous varieties of paddy. Even around the residential huts (made with cobwebs, cow dung, straw and clay), mango trees, heavy with fruit, are clustered with other plants so that every inch of land is covered with green. Lessons in biodiversity In today’s controlled, sanitised and concretised environment, this wilderness is not just comforting but will also be relevant in the post-pandemic world. While there are many such farms across the country, Navdanya is special because it also has an Earth University, which is an endeavour to educate both farmers and novices like me. As scientists including Shiva have observed, new infectious diseases such as Covid-19, Zika or Ebola have emerged after businesses invaded forests to grow global commodities. An institution such this helps us understand why we need to go back to our roots. Just walking around the farm is educational. I learnt that camphor, neem, turmeric and papaya help in natural pest control. Planting radish helps put nitrogen (essential for plant growth) back into the soil, whereas over-planting the potato depletes the land of this mineral. Paddy is surrounded by a border ofragi(which is taller) to help prevent cross-pollination. And the seeds of the paddy (the farm has about 750 indigenous paddy seeds in the seed bank) are preserved from the very centre of the field, where there is least cross-pollination. Shiva says that 70%-80% of pollinators (such as bees) have disappeared in areas where pesticides are used. “Food is central as we all eat and because industrial food is the biggest damager to our health, our planet, the current system of GMOs and agrochemicals is really putting our farmers on edge. Over 4,00,000 farmers have committed suicide since 1995,” she says. Changing old habits “Most of the habits we have today are habits of addiction — we didn’t grow into them, they were forced upon us.” She gives the example of edible oils: “In 1998, we were forced to import genetically-modified soya even though we were the world’s biggest producer of oil seeds then, with the richest diversity and maximum production.” Today, she says, we import 70% of our edible oil needs because of active lobbies. I also learnt that the word ‘consumption’ was initially used for people who had been consumed by tuberculosis. The addiction of buying new things is certainly consuming the modern world, but now that shopping is quite literally at our fingertips, will we be happy with less stuff? I notice the silver rings on Shiva’s fingers, which are all gifted, mostly by indigenous communities. She’s never wanted to change or upgrade them. The new luxury Strangely enough, I felt very content at the farm — open for stays for all — even though my phone was tucked away most of the time and my simple room was devoid of the ‘luxuries’ such as a geyser (hot water available from a common tap in the patio). We were cleaning up after meals, filling our bottles when we needed them, and we were eating together in the canteen. Surrounded by nature, with the engaging company of people, eating nutritious food (millets, indigenous rice, freshly-harvested vegetables, local beans and lentils) breathing clean air, listening to the sounds of birds and insects, I didn’t need new things, an internet connection or room service. Could it be that we try to replace nature and community with shopping and smartphones? Perhaps we need to change our definition of luxury. On my drive back home I looked at the sugarcane fields with new eyes. What was once idyllic now seems barren and industrial without the diverse profusion of plants. I think of what Shiva said moments before we left: “Everyone talks about frontline workers but farmers are care workers because they provide healthcare when they do good farming.” And good farming isn’t about single species or the culture of agrochemicals. It is about multiple varieties of plants, animals and microbes working together to create a healthy ecosystem. If you can’t relate to what I’m saying then maybe you need the experience.

28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Shop at The Armoire||Entrepreneur Nandini Varshnei has always felt that there is a big gap in the market for affordable luxury, especially in Chennai. “Many of us want quality clothing, but without the exorbitant designer price tags. We’d like to pick up a few pieces rather than just one occasionwear,” she begins, explaining why the 14th edition of her luxe pop-up, The Armoire, has mostly stuck to the Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 25,000 price bracket. With the latest collections from 18 designers, the brands featured include big names such as Namrata Joshipura and first-timers to the city like House of Soi, the new label from Hyderabad-based designer Archana Shah. “The brand is all about bold prints, luxe fabrics and flattering silhouettes. A Soi dress can be worn from day to night, to a brunch or an evening out,” she says, adding how most of the designs at the pop-up will cater to the shift in fashion trends, post-pandemic spending patterns and the intimate nature of celebrations nowadays. “While all the designs are prêt, you can customise them with the designers,” she concludes. The Armoire Celebration Edit is on September 2, 11 am - 8 pm, at The Folly at Amethyst, Royapettah.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/shop-at-the-armoire/article36147083.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Is fashion’s future orange?||An earthy colour palette (think mint, peach and indigo) and breezy silhouettes aren’t the only highlights of designer Anita Dongre’s Spring-Summer 21 lineup. ‘Sounds of the Forest’, which dropped recently, is literally derived from the forest — using wood-based cellulosic fibres courtesy a collaboration with Tencel. Since its launch in the 1990s, the Austrian textile speciality brand (under The Lenzing Group) has come a long way. This year, it partnered with Red Carpet Green Dress, an organisation that pushes designers to focus on sustainable textile innovations and custom-made gowns for the Oscars. It found its way into pret with designers like Australia’s Kit Willow and Rajesh Pratap Singh closer home. And courtesy its light-weight nature, it also featured in swimwear collections by design houses such as Mara Hoffman and The Summer House in India. Now, after experiments with indigo and viscose, The Lenzing Group has partnered with Italy’s Orange Fiber to create the first-ever Tencel-branded lyocell fibre made from orange peels. The company, which has collaborated with Salvatore Ferragamo and H&M in the past, taps into the 7,00,000 tonnes of ‘pastazzo’ (by-product of the country’s citrus processing industry) produced every year. International news reports claim that the orange fibre can be dyed, coloured and printed on, to create any look. In addition, thanks to nanotechnology, the material supposedly contains essential oils and vitamin C, is lightweight and absorbs moisture (we are yet to learn if the vitamins are passed on to the wearer). Avinash Mane, Commercial Head, Lenzing AG, takes us through India’s growing sustainable fashion market, why research is serious business at the brand, and how orange is the next best thing in fashion.  Why did you decide to experiment with citrus fibres?   We came across Orange Fibre in early 2021 and were keen to put citrus waste to use. It can be used in combination with wood pulp [sourced from Europe, South Africa, Germany]. At present, the new material is under trial and we’re working towards making yarn out of it. We aim to have a collaborative collection out by the end of this year featuring limited-edition western wear.  What challenges did you face?   Orange pulp has different characteristics when compared to wood’s cellulose content. Creating the right combination to ensure it can be dyed perfectly was an area we had to work on technically. Since we are in the sampling and development stage, there are some additional manufacturing costs. When we enter commercial production, the cost will be on par with our other speciality fabrics, such as the Tencel modal indigo.  What’s next?    A newTencel Lyocell plant will be established in Thailand by the end of this year. Collabs with Indian designers and high-end labels are also in the works, as are experiments with new materials such as hemp waste.

28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||2021’s bride wants more||Two weeks ago, stylist Rhea Kapoor tied the knot dressed in an ivory Anamika Khanna chanderi sari with a vintage pearl veil from Birdhichand Ghanshyamdas. For the intimate ceremony held in her living room, she paired the muted outfit with a pronounced winged eyeliner and jewellery from her mother’s collection, balancing her bohemian and traditional sides. It got me curious about how, after the long wait, post-pandemic brides are getting ready for their big day. Are they keeping it low-key? Or are they injecting some fun into the gloom and going large? When I ask Khanna, who is readying for her digital showcase at the ongoing India Couture Week (ICW), she shares that there is an interesting bridal dichotomy. “A section of brides have simplified everything for themselves and their families, and have accepted the fact that the world has changed. For instance, Rhea wanted to go with ivory mulmul and I respect that,” she says. “But then there’s a category that is not affected and still wants to be the dream bride,” says Khanna, As I look at the creations displayed at ICW, I find that many of the designers — coming out of multiple lockdowns and facing a new festive season — are courting the latter, letting their creative freak flag fly high. Couturier Manish Malhotra tried to capture that sentiment in his opening show. “Brides are understandably emotional, but they also want to have fun. I’ve tried to convey these emotions in my bridal edit ‘Nooraniyat’, featuring actor Kriti Sanon [in an ornate lehenga with statement-making zardozi embroidery],” says Malhotra, who also made sure he checked the inclusivity boxes by including plus-size models and casting former super model Noyonika Chatterjee to bring in ‘age-less’ style. (At his store, plus sizing is addressed through customisation of each outfit.) The designer has been dressing a panoply of brides in Jaipur, Mumbai and Delhi, and calls the 2021 woman the ‘opulent bride’. “Today’s bride wants to go all out; she’s living that moment even if it is with just 50 people. And she wants a mix of tradition and modernity: like pretty veils and a bit of glitz for the sangeet and reception.”  Customisation for the win  Interestingly, preferences are leaning towards a heightened level of customisation. The brides are also bringing stylists on board for trousseau shopping. “Will this lehenga skirt look good on me? Do I need a gown with a longer floor-sweeping trail? I see the post-pandemic bride getting very specific about her bespoke requirements,” says designer Shane Peacock, remarking on how “most brides who approach us have a stylist with them, who helps them make that personalised choice”. While last season, the duo Falguni and Shane had an array of stylists depicting the backstage drama in their couture digital showcase, this season, they’ve let their ‘more is more’ aesthetic take centrestage. “Besides our signature FSP silvers, golds and pinks, we’ve brightened the gloomy mood a bit by inculcating pop hues like bubblegum, pinkish red, and turquoise,” he adds. Revengespending is definitely on the rise. While designers haven’t revealed any numbers in India, according to news reports, many of their international stores and pop-ups have been fully booked of late. Monica Shah, co-founder of brand Jade by Monica and Karishma, revealed to Mint Lounge that when they launched in Los Angeles in April, the opening weekend alone had “about 40 bridal appointments”, while Anita Dongre shared that appointments at her New York store have been full since March. And now, with destination weddings picking up again, people are shopping with a vengeance. Designers Pankaj & Nidhi — who made their couture foray last season with an edited take on evening glamour — is focussing on wearability and weightlessness, with the travelling brides in mind. “We have an extra lehenga panel coming into play, which can be turned out faster for a last-minute couture request,” says Pankaj. “In terms of texturisation, we’ve scaled our core narrative to another level and made the textures more defined [metallicising their signature appliqué work, for example].”  Everything is a statement  Individuality is also big now. According to Gaurav Gupta, the pandemic has catalysed individualistic dressing and “the bride now wants to make an even bigger statement — be it in terms of colour, shape, form or embroidery. While she picks a lightweight lehenga for her engagement, she’ll opt for a larger-than-life, sculpted gown for her sangeet- cocktail. Everything has become more glamorous, more dramatic, but with a sustainable heart”. The designer, who’s always initiated a cultural dialogue with each outing, exploring all sides of love, has titled his latest collection ‘Universal Love’. The showcase featured gay models, lesbian couples, plus-size models and even battled ageism by focussing on mature love. Meanwhile, Amit Aggarwal, known for his push on upcycling and recontextualising textiles, sees a bit of a personal take on how brides want to feel on their important day. “Brides don’t look for embroideries or embellishments any more, but at intelligent design. They look at overall understanding of beauty and value in the product they are investing in, so it’s not about the number of hours spent on embroidery, but on the thought that’s gone behind creating the ensemble. The choice of the outfit has to resonate with their personality,” he concludes. India Couture Week 2021 ends tomorrow, with a finale by Rahul Mishra.

28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Pocket watches step up||The pocket watch may seem like an oxymoron today, but its time is far from over. In recent years, heritage manufactures such as Vacheron Constantin, Breguet and Patek Philippe have come up with imaginative ways to add these auction house staples to their recent collections. Even brands with a younger history, such as Parmigiani Fleurier, are embracing the concept. Not only do 21st century updates range from newer materials such as stainless steel and high-tech ceramic, but also include convertible styles (a 2021 Bovet x Rolls-Royce collab gave us one that turns into a wristwatch and a desk clock!). A blend of tradition and modernity have also given us fine details such as skeletonised movements and tourbillon escapements. What’s most interesting is how the user demographic has changed. What was once tucked into trouser pockets and vests of three-piece suits are now being worn by women as pendants on chains or tucked into jeans and dresses. GaryG, the resident collector of online magazine Quill & Pad , recently wrote about his wife stringing an Audemars Piguet skeletonised pocket watch with a jewelled bezel on to a Victorian necklace to pair with her black sweater and LBDs. And more memorably, actor Cate Blanchett wore the IWC Tribute to Pallweber Edition ‘150 Years’ rose-gold pocket watch as a necklace, framed by a bias-cut John Galliano suit, to the 2018 Canne Film Festival. Here are a few options that will look great, no matter the gender or generation.               Pocket watches are testaments of the coming together of mechanical engineering and personal style. Its beauty is how effortlessly it can amalgamate with any look. Styling a pocket watch with a b andhgala and denims is a style statement in itself. My personal favourite is the Panerai 3 Days because of its brilliant watchmaking content and classic design” — Raghavendra Rathore , menswear designer, who recently started collecting pocket watches||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/pocket-watches-step-up/article36147129.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||An office for every type||The pandemic has ensured that the future of the workplace is at home. A large number of companies across the world have woken up to this, allowing employees a permanent work-from-home (WFH) option. It is estimated that by 2025, an estimated 70% of the workforce will be working remotely at least five days a month. Going forward, hybrid work will be the norm, necessitating the need for a proper home office. But is your home office set up to boost productivity and ensure that you make deadlines? Figure out which kind of WFH personality you are and get started:   You maintain an Excel sheet for ongoing projects, you make to-do lists every morning and evening and you love to tick off things that are done. Therefore, naturally, your home office must be planned and detailed out to the last tack pin!  What you need A clutter-free straight desk, an ergonomic chair and a soft board to pin memos to yourself.   Sure you work from your residence but that doesn’t mean your home office has to be run of the mill. Just like you, your work environment has to have a certain look; the elements will simply have to work their way in.  What you need Attractive prints, bright furniture and bold accents.   The 9-to-5 routine is so not for you. No wonder you choose to work at your time and in your space. Your home office reflects this imaginative streak. Be it movie posters or funky travel mugs, it’s bound to be original.  What you need A plant on your desk, photos and souvenirs and plenty of notepads and diaries.   Like Dr Sheldon Cooper in The Big Bang Theory , you believe you’re the best. The Nobel may be just around the corner and you prepare for it by working in a home office that lets you get your geek on!  What you need Modern art and bright colours on the walls and all possible gadgets around you.   Oh God, how did you ever work in an office? You like everything just so because you said so and beware if anyone shifts a thing. Your desk is always neat and today, with a place for everything and everything in its place.  What you need A glass-topped table, a chest of drawers and plenty of files and folders.   You have the gift of the gab and you have no problems in using it to work your way up the corporate ladder. You meet, network, interact and make new connections — all in the comfort of your home.  What you need A large table, a land line phone, a coffee table with a couple of chairs for visitors.   You just can’t seem to get down to work unless there’s a deadline pressing down on your shoulder. But after that, you can stay up the entire night to make sure you meet it. And no, your work quality doesn’t suffer!  What you need A settee for a snooze, a shelving system to keep your paperwork organised and a couple of coffee mugs.   So much work, so little time but you’re sure that you’ll get to it tomorrow. You keep pushing off work till you possibly can till you land in a deadline mess. You can emerge unscathed only if you’re as good a worker as the deadline lover!  What you need A large clock, a white board and perhaps a chair-and-a-half to get some work done while you are procrastinating!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/an-office-for-every-type/article36147137.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||The age of wellness homes||The unforeseen Covid-19 pandemic has changed our perception of customer behaviour and consumerism in totality. This sudden disruption has given consumers the time and space to explore new experiences and ideas. Due to the chronic mannerism of the pandemic, many people have ventured into fitness and healthcare for the very first time. This has fuelled a whole new momentum of drawing inclination towards a health-oriented lifestyle. In sync with the present customer sentiments, ‘wellness homes’ have now emerged as the new-age home for the modern buyer. Health and hygiene have taken precedence in this pandemic-stricken world, juxtaposed with smart and sustainable homes. The new luxury The wellness quotient of a home has taken a different trajectory, distancing away from tangible materialistic amenities towards more health-oriented lifestyle goals. A rejuvenated outlook towards life includes spaces to relax and for recreational activities. The immunity and well-being of an individual is dependent on the habitat and the potency it can provide for the high quality of life. Customer eccentricity is the core belief behind the brainchild of wellness homes. The uncompromising approach of the customer regarding their health and well-being has paved the path towards the inception of modern homes with well-being quotients. The upcoming wellness-oriented residential real estate is a preventive measure against the recent rise of pandemics and epidemics. Homes are the first line of defence against any disease and virus, so the only possible solution is to invest mindfully in properties that uplift you both financially and health-wise. The reduction in the use of public spaces has increased the value of private spaces exponentially. The incremental value a wellness home offers is only a one-time transaction that safeguards our future vulnerabilities and insecurities. People now intend on living a long life that is equally fulfilling and enriched with quality health and wellness. Top features To constitute a nurturing environment between an individual and its habitat, it needs to be enriched with sustainable resources and conveniences such as: Water and air purification facilities Good ventilation and natural light Thermal health Dust and pest repellent technology Reflexology based pathways Aromatherapy dispensers Vertical gardens  Radiation-freeapartment spaces Balconies and sun decks Circadian rhythm and dawn simulators Roller shutters This nascent wellness home industry places an individual’s wellness at the centre of its design, creation and development process. The multidimensional lens of health and well being uses the state of the art technology which promises a bonus from the wellness driven course of life which includes:  Better personal life  Work-life balance  Quality sleep cycle  Exposure to nature  Safety and security  Privacy All these lifestyle changes will induce a better quality of life in this fast-paced world of contamination and adulteration. These utilities are an arrangement to re-design our lives to be happier and healthier. A better cognitive functioning with added work-life balance will help people to protect themselves from an alien virus or disease in the dystopian future. The road ahead Wellness homes are targetted at the well-travelled and educated clientele. A majority of home buyers today are ready to shell out extra for a lifestyle surrounding sustainability, well-being, and fitness. Wellness homes encourage social interaction with an active lifestyle which is involuntarily inculcated in these homes. A home in this category is currently priced above Rs. 1 crore because of the high upkeep and maintenance of wellness features. According to a recent market research report, the wellness homes segment was valued at $134 billion in 2017 which now has witnessed steady growth and is predicted to reach a valuation of $197 Billion by 2022. In India, the gravitation towards wellness homes among home buyers is emerging soon in urban smart cities like Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, and Pune and will gradually pervade to semi-urban cities like tier 1, 2, and 3 soon. In the long run, wellness homes will be the ‘new comfort’ of vital importance transposing all segments of home buyers.  The writer is National President, National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO)   A home in this category is currently priced above Rs. 1 crore because of the high upkeep and maintenance of wellness features.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/the-age-of-wellness-homes/article36147131.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||IPCC Report 2021: Climate change is very real||Several of Bihar’s 38 districts are flood-hit — people have lost lives, homes continue to get damaged, and countless agricultural fields have been inundated. In Africa, heavy rains ravaged the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Uganda, and Ethiopia. After being hit by a dual disaster — an earthquake and hurricane Grace — Haiti’s health system is severely strained, as are the rescue teams still hunting for survivors. In the U.S., a total of 41,122 wildfires have burned more than 4.59 million acres. One might think these disasters have been recorded over a long period, but unfortunately these are just a fraction of many natural calamities reported in one week of August alone. Besides, all this is occurring when the world is already grappling with a pandemic. These are numbing data, as numbing as the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s Sixth Assessment Report.  The report estimates that the world will probably reach or exceed 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) of warming within just the next two decades. What it also highlights is the current state of the climate: atmospheric concentrations of a range of greenhouse gases are increasing, the water cycle is assessed to be intensifying, frozen parts of the globe are melting, and the oceans are warming up, to list a few indicators. While these findings no doubt give us a sense of impending doom, they come at an important time in human history, a time when environmental consciousness is at an all-time high. Sadly, though, many governments continue to brush environmental concerns under the carpet.  That is why the Report’s third chapter — ‘Human influence on the climate system’ — caught my eye and should be a must-read for everyone. Direct and to-the-point, it charts how our actions over the years have led to where the environment is today. It finds that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of the observed changes in hot and cold extremes on the global scale (virtually certain) and on most continents (very likely)’. It adds that these temperature changes are further ‘amplified at the regional scale by regional processes such as soil moisture or snow/ice-albedo feedbacks, land use and land-cover changes, or aerosol concentrations, etc.’ It estimates irrigation and crop expansion to have increased summer temperatures in some regions such as the U.S. Midwest (medium confidence). And, importantly, urbanisation appears to have furthered temperature extremes in cities.  While such events have been edged on by human-induced climate change, it is most likely to continue to increase with further global warming. Frequent heat waves, droughts, flash floods, and other disasters are proof. Be it large regions such as the Americas, Europe and Asia, or the polar regions and smaller islands, the report is clear that every part of the world is bound to be affected by climate change. Specifically in Asia, marine heatwaves will continue to increase, fire weather seasons will lengthen and intensify, heavy rains will amplify, shorelines will retreat and coastal areas will shrink.  For those who refused to believe in climate change, the news is officially out there now. What needs to be done? For starters, governments need to ensure that the efforts and millions spent on climate action actually deliver the needed results. A recent op-ed in German publication Handelsblatt explains how: ‘The German way has long been to spend many billions on climate action without paying attention to the effects achieved… The use of funds and the effect on climate protection are blatantly disproportionate. The absurdly high funding for the expansion of renewable energies over many years has become legend. When switching to electromobility, politicians are in the process of repeating the same mistake.’ These comments stand true for other world governments too.  In addition to transformational policies, countries need to seriously tap into renewable energy sources. Reducing unsustainable and polluting power sources is no longer enough, we need to do away with them altogether given the dire state of affairs. Governments should develop these policies in close dialogue with corporate climate leaders working to reduce emissions because they can bring immense insight and innovation to the net-zero transition idea. As weforum.org says, ‘Governments can gear the market towards low-carbon activities in the pandemic recovery by stopping fossil fuel subsidies, putting a price on carbon, and making climate-related financial disclosure mandatory’.  Humans might be the reason for environmental degradation but, ironically, human-centric measures can also be the solution. Tapping into indigenous knowledge and technology and investing in them is perhaps a good place to start. Over the last few years, advancements in organic farming, reforestation, water conservation, urban design, energy, and more have shown exceptional results. Taking them seriously would not just help create a tremendous talent pool, but also pave the way for much-needed environmental change. Every change starts off small and revisiting this philosophy rather than bogging the public down with unfathomable statistics and scientific jargon is what we need.

28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Decoding India’s data centre boom||India’s data centre industry is expected to double capacity by 2023, states JLL’s recently-released ‘H1 2021 India Data Center Market Update’. The report states that the sector’s capacity will exceed 1GW by 2023, driven by strong digitalisation, rising cloud adoption and ambitious growth plans of data centre operators. The realty services company highlights that nationwide, the acceleration of digitalisation has forced enterprises to scale up their IT infrastructure. As a result of digital upgrades, a strong demand for co-location/cloud facilities, which offer scalability, security, and connectivity at lower costs, has been witnessed across India. Additionally, investors and global data centre players have increased their commitment during the last six months in the India market by announcing joint ventures to meet expected demand. Expert speak Rachit Mohan, Head, Data Center Advisory – India; Co-Head, Office Leasing Advisory – Mumbai, JLL, says, “The demand momentum which picked up pace in 2020, continues to grow unabated. The Indian data centre industry witnessed 46.4 MW absorption during H1 2021 — equivalent to 90% of supply addition during the period (H1 2021), indicating robust absorption growth.” He goes on to explain that demand has been expanding rapidly due to increasing digital usage emerging from a distributed workforce, growing data security concerns and business disruptions. “Banking and financial services are adopting hybrid options to meet digital growth. Home-grown video and gaming platforms in midst of robust user growth are also fuelling the data centre industry demand. Furthermore, telecom players are formulating the roll out of 5G which is expected to drive exponential growth in data consumption,” adds Mohan. Global investors and data centre players have increased their commitment during the last six months, announcing joint ventures with operators to setup sites. Investment commitments to the tune of $3 billion highlight the growth potential, with the data centre industry expected to double its capacity and cross the 1GW* mark by 2023, states Samantak Das, Chief Economist and Head of Research & REIS (India), JLL. “Mumbai, which currently accounts for 45% of the total capacity, is expected to further add 267MW between now and 2023. Various states have also been providing incentives for the data centre industry as they want to join the next leg of technological change.” Measures being adopted Data centre operators are adopting large land acquisition strategies to fulfil the long-term requirements of hyper-scalers (large cloud players and occupiers with massive computing requirements). These operators would provide occupiers with flexibility in terms of availability zones, fibre pathways and power provisions required for largescale expansions in less time. Players are also adopting strategic alliances by investing in new submarine cables to meet the growing demand. The telecom industry has been gearing for rolling out the 5G services with three providers starting field trials. The trend of sustainability has been gaining pace as tie-ups for green energy are being inked. Prior analysis JLL’s 2020 India Data Center Market Update released earlier this year stated that India’s data center sector will require investment of $3.7 billion over the next three years in order to fulfill the 6 million sq. ft. greenfield development opportunity for the industry. ‘As the data centre landscape continues to evolve, the industry is expected to grow exponentially to reach 1,007 MW by 2023 from its existing capacity of 447 MW. With growing reliance on digital connectivity, demand is likely to ramp up further due to the imminent rollout of 5G rollout, IoT-linked devices, data localisation and cloud adoption’, it mentioned. Mumbai and Chennai are expected to drive 73% of the sector’s total capacity addition during 2021-23, while other cities like Hyderabad and Delhi NCR are emerging as new hotspots. Robust expansion by global cloud players in the established markets of Mumbai and Pune continues owing to prevailing infrastructure, while new markets like Hyderabad are gaining momentum in this space. The report also mentioned how the increasing usage of e-commerce, EdTech and digital transactions placed the existing IT infrastructure of enterprises under pressure. ‘Overall data usage increased by 36% in 2020 due to increased usage of smartphones and fixed wireless access as per Nokia Mobile Broadband India Traffic Index 2021. Enterprises have been upgrading their IT infrastructure by adopting hybrid models, given their budget constraints. Technology trends like 5G rollout, IoT-linked devices and AI will also result in stronger growth in demand’. According to JLL, the rapid growth of the data centre industry has led to increasing energy consumption and environmental impact. Increasingly, global cloud players setting up bases in India aim to reduce their carbon footprint and are looking at data centers that provide sustainable energy alternatives and are entering renewable energy power contracts. India’s renewable energy capacity at 90 gigawatts accounts for 25% share of the installed power capacity and provides tremendous scope for development of green data centres.

28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Approval of plot||I own a plot measuring one ground near Perambur. My parents stay in a building located on the land’s frontal portion. In the backyard, there is a vacant spot where I plan to construct a house by obtaining a loan. I have now realised that not just our land but our entire street is unapproved. How do we take this up with government officials to get the land approved? VNR Vinoth Chennai The duration of your ownership of the property and availability of patta (Town Survey Land Register Extract) in your name have to be considered to ascertain whether approvals can be obtained for the said plot. If the existing building has a sanctioned plan, the same will also be a factor for getting further approvals. For putting up an independent building in the rear portion, subdivision approval would also be required. A friend is the second buyer of a Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB) flat at Anna Nagar West Extension. Though the Undivided Share of Land (UDS) was not given in 1985 for TNHB flats, the original allottee’s sale deed incorrectly mentions a plinth area of 708 sq.ft. (as per TNHB) and unnecessarily mentions 708/3 sq.ft. of UDS equal to 236 sq.ft. When he decided to get into a joint development with a reputed builder, he noticed that the errors have been repeated in the description of the flat of the second buyer. However, the correct UDS as per orientation sketch of TNHB — which must have been made after 2006 — has been mentioned. Per block, the UDS is 6,500 sq.ft. and the builder is providing 650 sq.ft. UDS for 10 flats (six old owners and four new buyers). Is this sufficient or does any rectification need to be done to remove the effect of wrong UDS mentioned by the first allottee to the second allottee? Does this affect other old flat owners? TK Nagasubramanian Chennai In the past, TNHB was not in the practice of mentioning the actual undivided share of land conveyed while executing sale deeds in favour of allottees. The superstructure would be conveyed along with a “proportionate share of land on which the building is erected”. When these properties are redeveloped after several years, the entire extent conveyed by TNHB can be ascertained from the Patta (extract from Town Survey Land Register) issued in the name of the present owners. Wherever it is possible to do a rectification, the same can be done if circumstances so warrant. If the builder is proceeding with the redevelopment based on the available material and properly documenting the correct extent of land in favour of the allottees, there is no need to go back in time and rectify the earlier errors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/approval-of-plot/article36147134.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Chennai’s realty snapshot||Findings from realty consultancy Knight Frank India’s latest survey ‘India Buyer Survey 2021— Living in the Times of Covid-19’ state that over three-fourth (77%) of respondents from Chennai expected the value of their primary residence to increase in the next 12 months. On the other hand, only 16% of the respondents cited to have moved to a new home since the start of the pandemic, and more than half (55%) of the respondents have expressed willingness to purchase a second home in the next 12 months. Around 57% of the respondents have showcased a desire to purchase a second home because of the pandemic. Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist and National Director — Research, Knight Frank India, says, “Chennai’s residential real estate market has managed to remain resilient despite the pandemic. This is reflected in the optimistic sentiments reflected by the buyers. The city’s market is experiencing a turn around after the bottoming of prices due the first lockdown, as more and more buyers, who were on the fence, have been unable to resist the low prices in the city,” adding, “Chennai further received an infrastructure boost in the recent Tamil Nadu state budget announcement, which will improve connectivity to various parts of city and further aid in the increase in price, boosting sentiments for all stakeholders in the city.” The survey for India Buyer Survey – 2021 was conducted with an objective to gauge the impact of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown on residential segment consumers. Part I of the survey comprises respondents from the high-end income segment, while Part II chiefly consists of respondents from the mid-end income segments. The inferences for the Chennai market have been extrapolated chiefly from the mid-end income segment respondents. Findings from the report In terms of home price trajectory; 46% of the city’s respondents expected the price of their current residence to mark up between 10% and 19% in the next 12 months. Around 18% of the respondents expected an increase of more than 20% in the next 12 months. This is indicative of an optimistic shift in the buyer’s sentiment as close to half the respondents from the city reported a decline in the value of their primary residence since the pandemic hit.  On the aspect of relocation or moving to a new home, 84% of those surveyed reported to have not changed their primary residence through the pandemic. Of the remaining 16% of the respondents who did relocate, it has been revealed that 56% had decided to move due to the work from home option. When enquired whether the pandemic influenced any relocation plans over the next 12 months, 55% of respondents were of the opinion that they were more willing to relocate due to pandemic-induced reasons, preferably within the city. As for the key reasons that will influence purchase decisions in the future, 64% of the respondents opined upgrading their family’s primary residency as the main reason that would influence their decision. Increase in family size (20% of the respondents) was opined as the second most important reason that would influence their future home purchase decision. Respondents have also cited purchase decisions pertaining to holiday homes (11%) as an important factor that affects home purchase decisions in the future.  When enquired whether the impact from the pandemic influenced their decision for a second home, 57% expressed a higher likelihood of purchasing a second home in the near future. Regarding the aspect of change in spending propensity for a home, 63% of respondents have cited an increase in their budget for spending on a new home.  On key features buyers will look for in a home post lockdown, 96% of the respondents in Chennai were more likely to consider access to large green areas. About 66% of the respondents have cited proximity to their place of work as a crucial feature they will seek in their next home.  When analysing the impact of the pandemic on the type of home to live in the future, 96% were of the opinion that they were more likely to live in an apartment/condominium. Independent homes/villas (73% ) was the next top choice for Chennaiites.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/chennais-realty-snapshot/article36147132.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Housing market to peak in 2023||The unprecedented rise in the home ownership sentiment, faster adoption of technology and digital marketing, and innovative business practices have served to soften the overall impact of the pandemic on the Indian residential sector. In fact, the housing market in the top seven cities is likely to attain a new peak by 2023, when housing sales are estimated to cross 3.17 lakh units and new launches by 2.62 lakh units during the year. City-wise, MMR and Bengaluru are all set to lead from the front with maximum housing sales and new launches in 2023. Of the total estimated housing sales and new launches in 2023: MMR is likely to comprise a 28% share of total sales and nearly 30% of new launches  Bengaluru is estimated to have a 20% share of homes sold and a 17% share of units launched  NCR may comprise an 18% share of sales and 15% of new launches  Pune will retain its strength among the most active markets and may corner a 15% sales share and 18% new launches share  Kolkata, Chennai and Hyderabad may each account for approx. 6% of sales and 8% of new launches 2021 is expected to fare better than 2020, but it is unlikely to reach the levels of 2019 - the most recent peak year. Anuj Puri, Chairman — Anarock Property Consultants, says, “The residential sector was showing healthy year-on-year growth since 2017 until the latest peak year of 2019, but this trajectory was derailed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Otherwise, 2020 was expected to be a watershed year for the housing sector.” While the second half of the year did showcase the remarkable resilience of Indian residential real estate, he says a new bottom for the sector was created in 2020 with housing sales plunging to nearly 1.38 lakh units while new launches dropped to 1.28 lakh units. “2020 is not a year that the industry is likely to forget very soon.” Sale trends Encouragingly, the ongoing trend of sales exceeding supply is likely to continue and 2021 is expected to witness an increase of 35% in housing launches and a 30% increase in sales over the previous year. However, against the peak year of 2019, supply and sales may be lower by 28% and 31% respectively. Puri adds, “The trend of demand remaining buoyant can be attributed to several factors. These include, but are not limited to sustained low interest rates, an overall improvement on the job market, resumed economic activity and sustained stock market growth, various government interventions to combat the pandemic’s deleterious effects, and an increasing desire to own physical assets during times of unprecedented uncertainty.” In the future With the vaccination drive gaining significant momentum and the spread of COVID-19 under better control for now, 2023 will very likely emerge as the new peak year that breaches 2019 levels with supply that year growing by 11% and sales by 22% over 2019.” A new peak in 2023 notwithstanding, we are unlikely to see the levels of supply and sales witnessed in 2014 anytime soon.

28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Chennai’s realty snapshot||Findings from realty consultancy Knight Frank India’s latest survey ‘India Buyer Survey 2021— Living in the Times of Covid-19’ state that over three-fourth (77%) of respondents from Chennai expected the value of their primary residence to increase in the next 12 months. On the other hand, only 16% of the respondents cited to have moved to a new home since the start of the pandemic, and more than half (55%) of the respondents have expressed willingness to purchase a second home in the next 12 months. Around 57% of the respondents have showcased a desire to purchase a second home because of the pandemic. Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist and National Director — Research, Knight Frank India, says, “Chennai’s residential real estate market has managed to remain resilient despite the pandemic. This is reflected in the optimistic sentiments reflected by the buyers. The city’s market is experiencing a turn around after the bottoming of prices due the first lockdown, as more and more buyers, who were on the fence, have been unable to resist the low prices in the city,” adding, “Chennai further received an infrastructure boost in the recent Tamil Nadu state budget announcement, which will improve connectivity to various parts of city and further aid in the increase in price, boosting sentiments for all stakeholders in the city.” The survey for India Buyer Survey – 2021 was conducted with an objective to gauge the impact of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown on residential segment consumers. Part I of the survey comprises respondents from the high-end income segment, while Part II chiefly consists of respondents from the mid-end income segments. The inferences for the Chennai market have been extrapolated chiefly from the mid-end income segment respondents. Findings from the report In terms of home price trajectory; 46% of the city’s respondents expected the price of their current residence to mark up between 10% and 19% in the next 12 months. Around 18% of the respondents expected an increase of more than 20% in the next 12 months. This is indicative of an optimistic shift in the buyer’s sentiment as close to half the respondents from the city reported a decline in the value of their primary residence since the pandemic hit.  On the aspect of relocation or moving to a new home, 84% of those surveyed reported to have not changed their primary residence through the pandemic. Of the remaining 16% of the respondents who did relocate, it has been revealed that 56% had decided to move due to the work from home option. When enquired whether the pandemic influenced any relocation plans over the next 12 months, 55% of respondents were of the opinion that they were more willing to relocate due to pandemic-induced reasons, preferably within the city. As for the key reasons that will influence purchase decisions in the future, 64% of the respondents opined upgrading their family’s primary residency as the main reason that would influence their decision. Increase in family size (20% of the respondents) was opined as the second most important reason that would influence their future home purchase decision. Respondents have also cited purchase decisions pertaining to holiday homes (11%) as an important factor that affects home purchase decisions in the future.  When enquired whether the impact from the pandemic influenced their decision for a second home, 57% expressed a higher likelihood of purchasing a second home in the near future. Regarding the aspect of change in spending propensity for a home, 63% of respondents have cited an increase in their budget for spending on a new home.  On key features buyers will look for in a home post lockdown, 96% of the respondents in Chennai were more likely to consider access to large green areas. About 66% of the respondents have cited proximity to their place of work as a crucial feature they will seek in their next home.  When analysing the impact of the pandemic on the type of home to live in the future, 96% were of the opinion that they were more likely to live in an apartment/condominium. Independent homes/villas (73% ) was the next top choice for Chennaiites.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/chennais-realty-snapshot/article36147143.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Prepping for Kabul||A couple of days ago, Marimuthu, my intrepid istriwallah , returned my Levi’s (circa 2002) beautifully pressed... but with a front crease. Summoning the requisite courage — you’ll know why in a bit — I called him. ‘Marimuthu,’ I said. ‘Er... you seem to have ironed my jeans with a front crease. Again. No worries, but could you iron them flat, seam to seam, the next time, er, if you don’t mind?’ ‘Oh,’ responded Marimuthu after a brief pause. ‘You don’t like the way I do istri-aa , Mr Big Posh Finicky Dorai? Then go to Afghanistan, no. They’ll iron your jeans right for you. And give it a bullet washing, too, free of cost, lol!’ See, Marimuthu can’t be blamed here. He’s on Clubhouse, Insta, Twitter, etc, and is well-informed. If role models like Ramratan Payal, Hari Bhushan Thakur Bachaul and Shobha Karandlaje are asking us to go to Afghanistan when we mention rising fuel prices or women’s safety, Marimuthu is well within his rights to do so, too. Earlier, when my pyjamas came back without their nada and I brought it up, his recommended travel destination for me used to be Pakistan, of course. Since Afghanistan appears to be the next port-of-call for several of us from the look of it, I say there is no harm in being prepared. My first question is what is the Afghan situation on Saravana Bhavan? Are they still operational? Because I can’t go otherwise. I belong to a group — a very large one, mind you — which swore on the Gita that they would never travel to a country that doesn’t have a Saravana Bhavan. That, too, one that serves getti chutney. I request the authorities to get back on this asap. Secondly, and I ask this after intense Googling over the last five years, where can I get my hands on the recipe to Katrina Kaif’s Afghan Jalebi ? I even messaged the ultimate exotic-dish resource, Ms Padma Lakshmi, when all else failed. But, alas, got no response. Also, in the event of us getting into what is referred to as a ‘situation’ in diplomatic circles, who will be coming to airlift us? Will it be Akshay Kumar or Kangana Ranaut? As long as you are rescued, why does it matter who it is, you may ask. It matters. Let me assure you it does. If it is Akki, I want to keep my questions on mango-farming handy and also see if I can get a refund on Smt Haasya Haddis’ books. If it is Kangana, I want to stay back and take my chances. Next, since it used to be Pakistan not too long ago when we needed life lessons, and it is Afghanistan now, my question: using our ancient time-travel techniques (sister technologies of Vedic internet, pushpaka aircraft, and Kurukshetric nuclear warheads), why not arrange a whistle-stop tour of Cambodia, Rwanda, East Timor, Zaire, etc, too — at appropriate points in history — so ingrates like me understand once and for all how much better off we are. But for all those advising us to go to Afghanistan, the most important question I have is this: what do I tell the innocent children there, the ones who haven’t made it across the barbed wire, and the stoic, helpless women when they look into my eyes and see me as a brother from the country of Buddha, Gandhi and Kaniyan Pungundranar the Sangam poet who said, ‘Every city is my city and everyone, my kin’?  Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/prepping-for-kabul/article36147627.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Breaking an addiction||At a vipassana course I took years ago, I learnt the difference between making an assumption and gaining true knowledge. When we read something in a book, we assume it’s true; but we can only become knowledgeable through experience. So, even though I write on wellness and was aware of the term biodiversity, I only understood its real impact after visiting author, activist and environmentalist Vandana Shiva’s biodiversity conservation farm, Navdanya, on the outskirts of Dehradun in Uttarakhand. Spread across 52 acres, this land was earlier a sugarcane and eucalyptus plantation. Today, these commercial crops have been replaced with a heaving abundance of trees, shrubs, creepers, grasses, and herbs. There are approximately 72 species of birds, 5,000 varieties of crops (paddy, wheat, pulses, oil seeds, vegetables, millets) and 78 types of herbs within the farm, not to mention worms, beetles, butterflies, lizards, spiders, and toads, all playing their roles in this diverse landscape. In just an acre-long patch, there are 650 indigenous varieties of paddy. Even around the residential huts (made with cobwebs, cow dung, straw and clay), mango trees, heavy with fruit, are clustered with other plants so that every inch of land is covered with green. Lessons in biodiversity In today’s controlled, sanitised and concretised environment, this wilderness is not just comforting but will also be relevant in the post-pandemic world. While there are many such farms across the country, Navdanya is special because it also has an Earth University, which is an endeavour to educate both farmers and novices like me. As scientists including Shiva have observed, new infectious diseases such as Covid-19, Zika or Ebola have emerged after businesses invaded forests to grow global commodities. An institution such this helps us understand why we need to go back to our roots. Just walking around the farm is educational. I learnt that camphor, neem, turmeric and papaya help in natural pest control. Planting radish helps put nitrogen (essential for plant growth) back into the soil, whereas over-planting the potato depletes the land of this mineral. Paddy is surrounded by a border ofragi(which is taller) to help prevent cross-pollination. And the seeds of the paddy (the farm has about 750 indigenous paddy seeds in the seed bank) are preserved from the very centre of the field, where there is least cross-pollination. Shiva says that 70%-80% of pollinators (such as bees) have disappeared in areas where pesticides are used. “Food is central as we all eat and because industrial food is the biggest damager to our health, our planet, the current system of GMOs and agrochemicals is really putting our farmers on edge. Over 4,00,000 farmers have committed suicide since 1995,” she says. Breaking old habits “Most of the habits we have today are habits of addiction — we didn’t grow into them, they were forced upon us.” She gives the example of edible oils: “In 1998, we were forced to import genetically-modified soya even though we were the world’s biggest producer of oil seeds then, with the richest diversity and maximum production.” Today, she says, we import 70% of our edible oil needs because of active lobbies. I also learnt that the word ‘consumption’ was initially used for people who had been consumed by tuberculosis. The addiction of buying new things is certainly consuming the modern world, but now that shopping is quite literally at our fingertips, will we be happy with less stuff? I notice the silver rings on Shiva’s fingers, which are all gifted, mostly by indigenous communities. She’s never felt the need to change or upgrade them. The new luxury Strangely enough, I felt very content at the farm — open for stays for all — even though my phone was tucked away most of the time and my simple room was devoid of the ‘luxuries’ such as a geyser (hot water available from a common tap in the patio). We were cleaning up after meals, filling our bottles when we needed them, and we were eating together in the canteen. Surrounded by nature, with the engaging company of people, eating nutritious food (millets, indigenous rice, freshly-harvested vegetables, local beans and lentils) breathing clean air, listening to the sounds of birds and insects, I didn’t need new things, an internet connection or room service. Could it be that we try to replace nature and community with shopping and smartphones? Perhaps we need to change our definition of luxury. On my drive back home I looked at the sugarcane fields with new eyes. What was once idyllic now seems barren and industrial without the diverse profusion of plants. I think of what Shiva said moments before we left: “Everyone talks about frontline workers but farmers are care workers because they provide healthcare when they do good farming.” And good farming isn’t about single species or the culture of agrochemicals. It is about multiple varieties of plants, animals and microbes working together to create a healthy ecosystem. If you can’t relate to what I’m saying then maybe you need the experience.

28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Is fashion’s future orange?||An earthy colour palette (think mint, peach, sage green and indigo) and breezy silhouettes aren’t the only highlights of designer Anita Dongre’s Spring-Summer 21 lineup. ‘Sounds of the Forest’ is literally derived from the forest — using wood-based cellulosic fibres courtesy a collaboration with Tencel. Since its launch in the 1990s, the Austrian textile brand (under The Lenzing Group) has come a long way. This year, it partnered with Red Carpet Green Dress, an organisation that pushes designers to focus on sustainable textile innovations for the Oscars. It found its way into pret with designers like Australia’s Kit Willow and Rajesh Pratap Singh closer home. And courtesy its light-weight nature, it also featured in swimwear collections by design houses such as Mara Hoffman and The Summer House in India. Now, after experiments with indigo and viscose, The Lenzing Group has partnered with Italy’s Orange Fiber to create the first-ever Tencel-branded lyocell fibre made from orange peel. The company, which has collaborated with Salvatore Ferragamo and H&M in the past, taps into the 7,00,000 tonnes of ‘pastazzo’ (by-product of the country’s citrus processing industry) produced every year. Avinash Mane, Commercial Head, Lenzing AG, takes us through India’s growing sustainable fashion market, and more.  Why did you decide to experiment with citrus fibres?   We came across Orange Fibre in early 2021 and were keen to put citrus waste to use. It can be used in combination with wood pulp [sourced from Europe, South Africa, Germany]. At present, the new material is under trial and we’re working towards making yarn out of it. We aim to have a collaborative collection out by the end of this year featuring limited-edition western wear.  What challenges did you face?   Orange pulp has different characteristics when compared to wood’s cellulose content. Creating the right combination to ensure it can be dyed perfectly was an area we had to work on technically. Since we are in the sampling and development stage, there are some additional manufacturing costs. When we enter commercial production, the cost will be on par with our other speciality fabrics, such as the Tencel modal indigo.  Recent brand tie-ups.   In Europe and the UK, brands such as H&M, Marks & Spencer, Superdry, and Primark are gradually moving out of viscose and experimenting with natural fabrics. Outfits such as Patagonia, LuluLemon, and Levis in the US have also switched from viscose to Ecovero. Uniqlo, the Japanese casual wear retailer, is looking to make the shift. And in India, the likes of Levis, Spykar, and Mufti are now adopting Tencel Denim. Soon, home decor and furniture majors such as Bed Bath & Beyond and Macy’s will announce collections crafted in eco fabrics.  Is India willing to shell out more for sustainable fashion?   About five years ago, there was a huge resistance to cost escalation, but buyers are willing to pay today. Approximately 60% of India’s population is below 40 years, are tech savvy with high disposable incomes, and are more aware of what goes into the creation of theirapparel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/is-fashions-future-orange/article36147730.ece
28 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Reply to report on poor conditions of those displaced from Khori Gaon’||The Supreme Court on Friday sought a response from the Haryana government and the Faridabad Municipal Corporation to a field report that said people displaced by the Khori Gaon demolition are living in tin sheds with mud floor with hardly any privacy. The report prepared by a researcher, Manju Menon, and advocate Srishti Agnihotri was brought to the attention of a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar by advocate Sanjay Parikh. The senior lawyer urged the court to form a committee headed by a retired High Court judge to monitor the actual state of facilities for shelter and food provided to the displaced residents. The report submitted that the facilities in the temporary shelter provided at the Radha Swami Satsang community centre were “woefully inadequate”. “The temporary shelter facility is a shed which is completely exposed to the elements, with a mud floor, and no partition for privacy for women and lactating mothers. It further has no space for families to carry and store their belongings, which were left in the open after their homes were demolished. These are belongings that the petitioners and their families have bought after years of saving every Rupee,” Mr. Parikh quoted from the ground report. He said the people should be provided with basic requirements. Protection from the elements and privacy for women. Mr. Parikh said the basic needs of these people have been “outright ignored”. The deplorable conditions raise the spectre of diseases. Hundreds of children from these families face the risk of discontinuation of their education. The court scheduled the next hearing on September 6.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/reply-to-report-on-poor-condition-of-those-displaced-from-khori-gaon/article36147424.ece
28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Shop at The Armoire||Entrepreneur Nandini Varshnei has always felt that there is a big gap in the market for affordable luxury, especially in Chennai. “Many of us want quality clothing, but without the exorbitant designer price tags. We’d like to pick up a few pieces rather than just one occasionwear,” she begins, explaining why the 14th edition of her luxe pop-up, The Armoire, has mostly stuck to the Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 25,000 price bracket. With the latest collections from 18 designers, the brands featured include big names such as Namrata Joshipura and first-timers to the city like House of Soi, the new label from Hyderabad-based designer Archana Shah. “The brand is all about bold prints, luxe fabrics and flattering silhouettes. A Soi dress can be worn from day to night, to a brunch or an evening out,” she says, adding how most of the designs at the pop-up will cater to the shift in fashion trends, post-pandemic spending patterns and the intimate nature of celebrations nowadays. “While all the designs are prêt, you can customise them with the designers,” she concludes. The Armoire Celebration Edit is on September 2, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., at The Folly at Amethyst, Royapettah.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/shop-at-the-armoire/article36147625.ece
28 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Afghan student with JNU degree starts petition for visa extension||Qurban Haidari, an Afghan student who completed his master’s degree from the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) this year, has started an online petition to seek an extension of visas of all students from his country. Over 35K signs As of 6 p.m. on Friday, the petition had already received over 35,000 signatures. Mr. Haidari who pursued a degree in Computer Applications said while his visa had initially expired on July 21, the extension he received is also set to expire on August 31. “Despite a circular issued by the university, I have not been able to receive my bonafide certificate. It is required for my visa application. I visited my department a few times but was refused the certificate each time. Without the certificate, I will not be able to apply for my visa extension. At this point, I do not know what will happen. Returning to Afghanistan would only mean that I will be putting my life at risk,” said Mr. Haidari. As a student who completed his undergraduate degree from Jamia Hamdard University followed by his postgraduation from JNU, Mr. Haidari said he was interested in higher studies. Bomb blast victim With four days left for his visa to expire, Mr. Haidari, who lost his left arm at a bomb blast in Mazhar-e-Sharif 17 years back, appealed to the Centre for assistance while recounting the events that unfolded during the previous Taliban regime. “All my qualifications are from India. If I go back at this point, the Taliban will shoot me. My brother was martyred in 2015 by the Taliban. The situation over there is worse than anybody can imagine. My family back in Afghanistan has repeatedly asked me not to return. They have already started seeing people getting beaten and tortured by the Taliban. I have been trying my best to speak to the authorities, to arrange for my documentation, but nothing has happened so far,” he said. Through the petition, Mr. Haidari has also appealed to the Indian Council for Cultural Relations to extend the student visas of all Afghan nationals in India and to provide a stipend and scholarships to those who are on ICCR fellowship. Stating that each of the thousands arriving at the Kabul Airport would have had members killed by the Taliban at some point, Mr. Haidari said that the situation was worsening by the day. “While some have lost a few family members to the Taliban, for some others, entire families have been wiped out. People are gathering at the airport as they know how the Taliban can behave. Last time, women were denied their basic rights. The same thing is bound to happen again,” said Mr. Haidari.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/afghan-student-with-jnu-degree-starts-petition-for-visa-extension/article36147426.ece
28 August 2021||Patna,||New portal to resume scholarships scheme for SC/ST students in Bihar||The Bihar government on Friday launched a new portal to resume post-Matriculation scholarships in the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes category to meritorious students. Earlier, this Centrally-sponsored scheme was executed through the National Scholarship Portal 2.0. Due to a technical glitch in the portal, the State government had not received any application under the scheme for past three years, denying students the opportunity to take advantage of the scholarships. CM’s direction Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had on August 10 directed the State Education Department to resume the post-Matriculation scholarships for students under the SC/ST scheme as soon as possible. State Education Minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary on Friday launched a new portal — www.pmsonline.bih.nic.in — which was created by the Education Department in coordination with the National Informatics Centre (NIC) and the State SC/ST Welfare Department. SC/ST Welfare Minister Santosh Kumar Suman, too, was present on the occasion. Deputy Chief Minister Renu Devi connected virtually.

Justice Mukta Gupta issued notice on Mr. Tomar’s anticipatory bail application and sought status report from Delhi Police. “Prima facie, there are all kinds of slogans and speeches being given. Let the status report be given,” said the judge as the matter was listed for further hearing on September 13. Mr. Tomar’s counsel submitted that his client was granted interim protection by the trial court and that he was not the one who was shouting the objectionable slogans. “I want to know where you were [at the time of sloganeering]. You were not present at all?..Let me have the complete status report,” the court responded. Advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain, appearing for Mr. Tomar, also said that his client was not the organiser of the event who has already been granted bail in the case. Prosecution counsel Tarang Srivastava informed that he has already shared the video and the transcript of the allegedly objectionable sloganeering to the court. Earlier this month, a sessions court here had dismissed Bhupinder Tomar alias Pinki Chaudhary’s anticipatory bail application, saying, “we are not a Taliban State”. Additional Sessions Judge said in the past such incidents have flared communal tensions leading to riots and loss to life and property.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/jantar-mantar-case-hc-refuses-protection-to-hindu-outfit-president/article36147418.ece

The hostel will be constructed at a cost of Rs. 20.92 crore within 16 months. It will be equipped with a two-mat wrestling hall, medical room, physiotherapy center, gym, steam bath along other state-of-the-art facilities. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who laid the foundation stone of the hostel, said Chhatrasal Stadium has so far given five Olympic medals to the country in wrestling. He added that with these modern facilities, the stadium will further prepare world-class wrestlers for the country. “Sports players who bring medals are honoured and receive prizes in crores, but when the players sweat during the training in the field before bringing the medal, they are supported by the Delhi government’s ‘Play and Progress’ and ‘Mission Excellence’ programmes,” Mr. Sisodia said. He also said the Delhi Sports University and Delhi Sports School will further help players realise their true potential and will consider sports a subject of learning. Sarthak Bhambri — who represented India in the 4x400m relays in Tokyo Olympics — was honoured on the occasion. He said with the construction of the hostel, the players will not only benefit but also be able to concentrate on their training better while staying in the stadium.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/chhatrasal-stadium-to-have-hostel-with-64-rooms-within-16-months/article36147422.ece

The accused mob had gathered outside the police station to demand action against the accused. They believed that the advocate, Ashish Kapoor, had come to bribe the policemen in order to save the offending driver. The IO in the case has been sent to district lines to ensure a fair probe. DCP (Central) Jasmeet Singh said a PCR call was received at 4.05 a.m. wherein the caller said the victim’s family members not only thrashed him but also snatched his bag containing Rs. 5 lakh. Vinod Kumar was on his two-wheeler — on way to deliver food — when one 20-year-old student, Rachit Singhal, in a car, hit him from behind at 11.30 p.m. on Thursday. Kumar died during treatment. The accused, who was drunk at the time of the incident, has been arrested, the police said. Kapoor told the police that he was in the vicinity when he felt that he was being followed by some people. Next, he decided to approach the police for help when the crowd attacked him.

28 August 2021||August 28 2021 00:00 IST,||Pocket watches step up||The pocket watch may seem like an oxymoron today, but its time is far from over. In recent years, heritage manufactures such as Vacheron Constantin, Breguet and Patek Philippe have come up with imaginative ways to add these auction house staples to their recent collections. Even brands with a younger history, such as Parmigiani Fleurier, are embracing the concept. Not only do 21st century updates range from newer materials such as stainless steel and high-tech ceramic, but also include convertible styles (a 2021 Bovet x Rolls-Royce collab gave us one that turns into a wristwatch and a desk clock!). A blend of tradition and modernity have also given us fine details such as skeletonised movements and tourbillon escapements. What’s most interesting is how the user demographic has changed. What was once tucked into trouser pockets and vests of three-piece suits are now being worn by women as pendants on chains or tucked into jeans and dresses. GaryG, the resident collector of online magazine Quill & Pad , recently wrote about his wife stringing an Audemars Piguet skeletonised pocket watch with a jewelled bezel on to a Victorian necklace to pair with her black sweater and LBDs. And more memorably, actor Cate Blanchett wore the IWC Tribute to Pallweber Edition ‘150 Years’ rose-gold pocket watch as a necklace, framed by a bias-cut John Galliano suit, to the 2018 Canne Film Festival. Here are a few options that will look great, no matter the gender or generation.               Pocket watches are testaments of the coming together of mechanical engineering and personal style. Its beauty is how effortlessly it can amalgamate with any look. Styling a pocket watch with a b andhgala and denims is a style statement in itself. My personal favourite is the Panerai 3 Days because of its brilliant watchmaking content and classic design” — Raghavendra Rathore , menswear designer, who recently started collecting pocket watches||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/pocket-watches-step-up/article36147723.ece
