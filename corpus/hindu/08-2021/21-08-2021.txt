21 August 2021||New Delhi,||Oppn. leaders call for unity to take on BJP||Top Opposition leaders came together on a virtual platform on Friday to give a call for unity and working together for the “ultimate goal” of defeating the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2024 Lok Sabha election, and providing a government that believes in the values of the freedom movement and the principles enshrined in the Constitution. The leaders of 19 parties, who participated in the meet, issued a joint statement calling upon “the people of India to rise to the occasion to defend our secular, democratic Republican order” and announced joint protests between September 20 and 30. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who convened the meeting, said the Opposition parties simply had “no alternative to working cohesively together” and needed to rise above “compulsions in the interest of the nation”. Mamata’s call West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee suggested the formation of a core committee to focus on key issues that affect the people, and said parties not aligned to the Congress should also be invited as “every Opposition party should be brought into the fight against the BJP”. Addressing a key point that often stalls Opposition unity, Ms. Banerjee said parties should “forget who is the leader as the people of India will lead” the fight against the BJP. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray endorsed Ms. Banerjee’s views and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin raised the issue of the Centre “undermining” federalism. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi suggested that the Opposition parties offer an alternative vision to counter the vision offered by the BJP-RSS. Taking to Twitter, NCP leader Sharad Pawar said, “Those who believe in democracy and secularism; those who like to work together for saving the democratic principles and ethos of our country must come together.” In a show of Opposition strength, 19 parties, including the Congress, were part of the meeting. However, the Samajwadi Party dropped out at the last minute, with party chief Akhilesh Yadav informing that he was in “an interior part” of Uttar Pradesh and could not join.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/opposition-leaders-call-for-unity/article36026729.ece
21 August 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Reign of terror is never permanent: PM||At a time when the world is anxiously concerned about the Taliban’s seizure of power in Afghanistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on the occasion of launching new projects at the historic Somnath temple on Friday, reminded the world that the reign of terror is always temporary and cannot be permanent. The Prime Minister, in a subtle message, said “destructive and terror forces” may become dominant temporarily but were not permanent, citing the example of Somnath temple, which was razed and plundered several times in the past and resurrected every time with greater glory. “Forces that strive for destruction and those who follow the ideology of creating empires out of terrorism can dominate for some time, but their existence is never permanent as they cannot suppress humanity forever,” he stated. The Somnath temple was the best example and also an assurance to the world. The world is apprehensive of such ideologies, he noted. “This temple was destroyed, its statues were broken but it was resurrected again as many times as it was razed because terrorism cannot suppress faith,” he observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/reign-of-terror-is-always-temporary-says-modi/article36026727.ece

Local residents said the poor quality of the new retaining wall was the reason for the breach. Almost 1,000 cusecs of water was released from the Bhavanisagar Dam into the canal for irrigation from August 15. On Thursday night, a breach was reported below the retaining wall, which had just been set up. A tunnel located below the canal is used by pedestrians. Discharge from the dam was stopped in the early hours, and officials of the Public Works Department (PWD) dumped earth and attempted to plug the breach with the help of earth movers. As a precautionary measure, people in Malaipalayam, Karaikadu and Varavankadu were moved to safe locations in the morning. Second breach At 10.30 a.m., another breach occurred and the wall collapsed. Water entered the villages and farm lands, inundating houses, paddy and sugarcane crop. Also, cattle were washed away in the floods. Since people were evacuated in the morning, no loss of lives was reported, but three houses were damaged. Though the discharge into the canal was stopped, the flow of water continued for five hours. Revenue officials and fire and rescue services personnel carried out relief measures in the villages. As the roads were also flooded, vehicle movement in the villages was disrupted throughout the day. Collector H. Krishnanunni and Superintendent of Police V. Sasi Mohan inspected the canal where work was on to plug the breach. The Collector told mediapersons that 64 houses and farm lands were affected and that only after full assessment, the total crop loss and the number of houses damaged would be known. Perundurai MLA S. Jeyakumar also inspected the restoration works and interacted with the people. Officials distributed food packets and other relief materials to the affected people. Minister for Housing and Rural Development S. Muthusamy inspected the relief and restoration works and also the damaged houses on Pallathur Main Street, East Street and Harijan Colony and Puduvalasu. The canal is made of dumped earth on both sides and extension, renovation and modernisation of LBP main canal work is being carried out from March at Rs. 709.60 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/breach-in-lbp-main-canal-inundates-houses-crops-in-three-erode-villages/article36026984.ece

Venkaiah Naidu has called upon all States to come forward to support the Union government’s ambitious river-linking project. “River-linking project is a dream of the people of this country and it should come true.

This will help farmers to take up agricultural activities with more hopes. Reservoirs are like Akshaya Patra. They play crucial roles in the all-round development. As per the information given by officials, this reservoir was full for the last four years in a row. I wish this dam continues to be full in the years to come and do good for Karnataka and Telangana ... We need to focus on storing rainwater wherever possible as it helps raise the groundwater table,” Mr. Naidu said. Earlier, Mr. Naidu, along with his wife, M.

21 August 2021||HUBBALLI,||Protest over ‘pro-Taliban’ FB post||A “pro-Taliban” post on Facebook allegedly by a youth triggered protest by local people, leading to tension for some time in Jamakhandi town of Bagalkot district on Friday. Tension prevailed for some time after a group of people gathered outside the Jamakhandi police station, seeking action against the youth for his alleged pro-Taliban post. The protesters demanded that the youth be arrested immediately. Following the incident, Superintendent of Police of Bagalkot district Lokesh Jagalasara said the issue was being investigated into and suitable action would be taken. According to sources, the youth reportedly commented on a photograph related to the ongoing developments in Afghanistan, which was shared by another user of Facebook. The youth allegedly praised the Taliban administration and screenshots of his post went viral on social media platforms, leading to the agitation. However, preliminary investigation had revealed that the youth had not posted anything on his Facebook page since November 21, 2018, sources said. No complaint has been filed in connection with the incident.

21 August 2021||MYSURU,||National Education Policy is student-centric, says Ashwath Narayan||Terming apprehensions over the National Education Policy-2020 as unnecessary, Minister for Higher Education and IT and Biotechnology C.N. Ashwath Narayan on Friday said there should not be any misunderstanding over the policy since it had been articulated keeping in view the interests of students and argued that only the NEP-2020 could help build their bright future because of its holistic educational concepts. The education policy that was followed all these years was not student-centric and the gains one would be getting from the NEP-2020 were multifold as it had adopted concepts that go into developing the learners’ prospects. The fruits of the NEP would soon be visible as it pushes for bringing in required changes, he explained. ‘Not anti-poor’ After launching the National Education Policy-2020 at the University of Mysore, the Minister said the Narendra Modi government had brought in reforms in the education sector that had been awaited from the last 35 years. Students now had the choice in learning and it was important that flexibility was now available even in government-run educational institutions. The NEP was not anti-poor, he clarified. Arguing that education and skill development were key for helping the country achieve superpower status, the Minister said education was the perfect tool for achieving empowerment. Sadly, this was forgotten and now emphasis was being laid on this factor, he said, citing the examples of Japan and South Korea which had grown tremendously because of empowerment in education and skill development. Stating that 85% of learning starts between the ages of three and six, Dr. Narayan added that learning in the government set-up was actually commencing at the age of six. This had been corrected now and children in government schools too would start learning from the age of three, which was all these years confined to the rich and affluent. ‘Helps to better future’ Maintaining that the NEP helps to better the country’s future, the Minister said the policy primarily focuses on quality of education and not on quantity. The principles of education had been taken care of by laying emphasis on conceptual learning besides measuring the learning outcomes. The Minister advised people to change their perceptions towards private educational institutions since both government as well as private institutions were strengths in imparting education and building the children’s future. They should not be seen as commercial entities. If people start questioning the fees charged, how could the institutions be run, he sought to know. Describing educational institutions as temples, he congratulated the University of Mysore for implementing the NEP. Earlier, Vice-Chancellor G. Hemanth Kumar made a presentation on the NEP and its implementation in the university. Mysuru MP Pratap Simha said the NEP helps develop critical thinking as it lays emphasis on discussion-based education. It drives students to become analytical and turn them innovative, he said. Shivarathri Deshikendra Swami of Suttur Mutt, Thimme Gowda B., vice-chairman, Karnataka State Higher Education Council, and Registrar Shivappa were present.  The National Education Policy - 2020 primarily focuses on quality of education and not on quantity. The principles of education have been taken care of by laying emphasis on conceptual learning besides measuring the learning outcomes. C.N.

21 August 2021||KOZHIKODE,||When YouTube calls the ‘tune’ with Onam songs||There was a time when music lovers used to look forward to the Onam season with excitement. For, music companies like Tharangini Records would bring out audio cassettes during the festival period. Those melodious days may be long gone, but today YouTube is helping musicians and listeners bring back some semblance of that great tradition. Just listen to the song Chembakappoovil , crooned by K.S. Chithra, and you may be bowled over. It is composed by Sharreth and written by Anoop Mukundan. “I am glad I could at least compose a melody like this now because of YouTube,” says Sharreth. “In the good old times, I had composed an album of Onam songs sung by S. Janaki and P. Unnikrishnan,’ he says. That album, Poovili , was released in 1999. The practice of music companies bringing out a lot of non-film cassettes was already on the decline then. Big craze Sharreth has vivid memories of the days when those cassettes were a big craze. “Growing up in Kollam, I used to wait impatiently for the latest Onam cassette from Tharangini,” he says. “Often the wait would be long, for the cassettes would be sold out in no time. I still remember the excitement with which I listened to the songs of Ulsava Gan an gal (Vol. 1) at Lakshmi Musical in Kollam.” That album, which had lyrics by Sreekumaran Thampi and music by Raveendran, contained timeless classics such as Ennum chirikkunna sooryante and Uthraadappoo nilaave vaa. More than five lakh cassettes of it were sold soon after its release in 1983, Mr. Thampi had once said. A year later, Raveendran came up with another brilliant album, this time in the company of lyricist Bichu Thirumala. Vasanthageethangal featured all-time popular songs such as Valampiri shankhil, Arayanname, Maavu pootha and Mamaankam pala kuri.  Another gem The same year also saw Tharangini bringing out another gem of an album, titled Ganolsavam , which had music by Jerry Amaldev and lyrics by O.N.V. Kurup. It has remains one of the greatest albums of light music in Malayalam, with unforgettable songs like Shraavana chandrikaa pushpam choodiya and Iniyonnu paadi.  “That was indeed the golden period of our non-film songs,” says playback singer Madhu Balakrishnan. “But it is good to find that there are takers for Onam songs even today, thanks to YouTube. I have recorded 20 Onam songs this year,” he says. One of them, Aishwarya ponnonam, written by Viditha Madhu Balakrishnan and composed by Satish Nair, has attracted 1.5 lakh views within five days of its release. This Onam, several singers, including K.S. Harishankar, Sudeep Kumar, Vidhu Prathap, Rimi Tomy and Akhila Anand, have released Onam songs on YouTube. And if you want to rewind the Onam melodies from the past, you could just do that too on YouTube.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/when-youtube-calls-the-tune-with-onam-songs/article36027079.ece
21 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Row over charges for post-COVID treatment||A government order (GO) issued on August 16 fixing treatment package rates for post-COVID complications for APL (above poverty line) patients in government and private hospitals has kicked up a controversy. The government had earlier stated that COVID care will be free of cost for all in government hospitals. Public health experts said that as COVID cases and long-term COVID-related complications suffered by those who survived the disease continued to go up, the government imposing charges for treatment of such conditions even in public sector hospitals would increase the health expenditure and impoverish people. What is more curious is that the GO states that “post-COVID conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience more than four weeks after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.” It also states that “these conditions can have different types and combinations of health problems for various lengths of time.” But in the same breath, the GO states that “for fixing the treatment charges, Post COVID Syndrome presentation may be defined as any patient treated for COVID-19 but still requires hospitalisation for symptoms compatible with COVID-19 within three weeks of turning negative.” By fixing a time frame for post-COVID conditions which the GO itself says can be for “various lengths of time,” the government would be denying free care for thousands suffering from the long-term effects of COVID. The basic premise in the GO that all those categorised as APL can afford to pay their treatment charges was wrong, pointed out S.S. Lal, a public health expert. There are many families who are not BPL but who are not covered by the Government’s Karunya Arogya Suraksha Padhati. The rates fixed by the GO are also arbitrary, it is pointed out. At a time when people are struggling to survive the economic devastation of COVID, alongside the ravages of the disease itself, the government backing off from providing free care cannot happen, Dr. Lal said. Rates fixed According to the GO, for post-COVID syndrome care, the APL category will be charged Rs. 750 a day for the ward, Rs. 1,250 in high dependency units, Rs. 1,500 for ICU care, and Rs. 2,000 for ICU plus ventilator care. The rates for private hospitals range from Rs. 2,645 to Rs. 15,180, depending on bed strength and NABH/non-NABH status of hospitals.  The basic premise in the GO that all those categorised as APL can afford to pay their treatment charges was wrong. S.S.

21 August 2021||VIZIANAGARAM,||Man sets ablaze girlfriend in Vizianagaram dt.||A man allegedly doused his girlfriend with petrol and set her ablaze at Chowduvda village of Pusapatirega mandal of Vizianagaram district in early hours of Friday. The girl was admitted to hospital with about 40% burn injuries, where her condition is said to be stable. According to the police, Rambabu, 26, of Narava village reportedly was in a relationship with Ramulamma, 21, for the last two years. Both their family members had agreed for their marriage and date for the marriage was about to be fixed in the fourth week of August. Rambabu allegedly refused to marry her later accusing her of talking to other youngsters. The girl’s family approached the Pusapatirega police, who ‘counselled’ him and made him to agree for the marriage. Rambabu who was allegedly manhandled in the police station, reportedly tried to take “revenge” on the girl and allegedly poured petrol on her and set her ablaze. Ramulamma’s sister and her son, who tried to save her, also suffered injuries. The girl’s mother, Galikondamma, told the media that they did not know the exact reason for cancellation of marriage. Vizianagaram DSP Pulipati P. Anil Kumar who formed special teams immediately took the accused into custody. Deputy Chief Minister Pamula Pushpa Srivani, Minister for Municipal Administration Botcha Satyanarayana, Vizianagaram Collector A. Suryakumari and Superintendent of Police Deepika M. Patil consoled Ramulamma and her family members in Vizianagaram Maharaja Government Hospital. “The incident shocked everyone. Fortunately, we could ensure timely medical aid for the girl. We have shifted her to Visakhapatnam for better treatment. The police have been directed to speed up investigation,” Ms. Srivani said. Meanwhile, the Telugu Desam Party staged a protest in Vizianagaram, alleging that there was no protection for women in YSRCP’s rule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ap-man-sets-ablaze-his-girlfriend/article36026669.ece

According to an August 16 report by the consortium, of the 49,867 coronavirus samples analysed, about two-thirds — 30,230 — were among the internationally classified variants of concern or variants of interest (VoC/VoI).   Of these, nearly 20,000 were the Delta variant (AY.2) and about 5,000 its associated lineages (AY.1 and AY.3). “The Delta variant is the major VoC in India now. Continuing outbreaks are attributable to Delta, a susceptible population, reduced vaccine effectiveness in blocking transmission, and opportunities for transmission. Vaccination continues to be very effective in reducing severe disease and death,” said an accompanying note.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delta-variant-driving-infections-in-india-says-lab-consortium/article36026725.ece
21 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Zycov-D, first vaccine for those above 12, gets nod||The Drug Controller General has granted emergency approval to the Zycov-D, a COVID-19 vaccine developed by the Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadilla group, on Friday, making it the first vaccine in India that can be administered to adults as well as those 12 and above. It is also the only DNA-based vaccine in the world and can be administered without a needle, purportedly minimising chances of reactions. Interim results from Phase-III Clinical Trials, in July, in over 28,000 volunteers, showed a primary efficacy of 66.6% for symptomatic RT-PCR positive cases. Largest trial “This has been the largest vaccine trial so far in India for COVID-19. This vaccine had already exhibited robust immunogenicity and tolerability and safety profile in the adaptive Phase I/II clinical trials carried out earlier. Both the Phase I/II and Phase III clinical trials have been monitored by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB),” the Department of Biotechnology said in a statement on Friday. The vaccine has been developed in partnership with the Department of Biotechnology under the ‘Mission COVID Suraksha’. The three-dose vaccine once administered produces the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and elicits an immune response. “The plug-and-play technology on which the plasmid DNA platform is based can be easily adapted to deal with mutations in the virus, such as those already occurring,” the DBT noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/zycov-d-first-non-injectable-vaccine-for-all-over-12-gets-nod/article36026647.ece

We are thankful to those who got vaccinated for their co-operation, and request those who are yet to take their vaccine to come forward and make this drive a grand success.” Mr. Shetty said AHAR was grateful to SRCC for helping conduct the drive and ensuring that hotel staff are fully vaccinated and get back to work soon. The drive is being carried out by adhering to COVID-19 protocol and avoiding crowding, he said. The registration information and data for the camps are being collected in advance to avoid wastage of vaccine doses. The camps will be conducted on a daily basis at various locations in the city.

21 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Arrest is not always a must, says Supreme Court||The Supreme Court has held that merely because law allows arrest does not mean the State can use the power indiscriminately to crush personal liberty. “We may note that personal liberty is an important aspect of our constitutional mandate. The occasion to arrest an accused during investigation arises when custodial investigation becomes necessary or it is a heinous crime or where there is a possibility of influencing the witnesses or accused may abscond. Merely because an arrest can be made because it is lawful does not mandate that arrest must be made,” a Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy said. A distinction must be made between the existence of the power to arrest and the justification for exercise of it, it noted. “If arrest is made routine, it can cause incalculable harm to the reputation and self-esteem of a person. If the Investigating Officer has no reason to believe that the accused will abscond or disobey summons and has, in fact, throughout cooperated with the investigation we fail to appreciate why there should be a compulsion on the officer to arrest the accused,” the court observed in its recent order. The order was passed in a plea for anticipatory bail filed by businessman Siddharth, represented by senior advocate Pramod Kumar Dubey and advocates Ravi Sharma and Rahul Shyam Bhandari. The Allahabad High Court had rejected his bail application in July. The case concerns an FIR registered against him for allegedly entering into a conspiracy and criminal breach of trust involving former ministers and high-ranking officials in relation to a project initiated by the Uttar Pradesh government in 2007 to build parks and museums, including the Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Asthal, Kashiram Smarak Asthal Gautambudh Nagar Upvan Echo Park and Noida Ambedkar Park. The FIR alleges a loss of Rs. 14,000 crore to the public exchequer. ‘Wrongly interpreted’ Mr. Dubey argued that his client had joined the seven-year-old investigation. There was no need for his custodial interrogation. There was no apprehension that he would abscond or tamper with evidence. Mr. Dubey said Section 170 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) has been wrongly interpreted by the police and trial courts to make arrest of the accused mandatory at the time of filing of the charge sheet. He argued that the word “custody” in Section 170 had been wrongly interpreted as ‘arrest’. Agreeing with the senior lawyer, the Supreme Court clarified that “the word ‘custody’ appearing in Section 170 does not contemplate either police or judicial custody but it merely connotes the presentation of the accused by the Investigating Officer before the court while filing the charge sheet”. “The trial courts are stated to be insisting on the arrest of an accused as a pre-requisite formality to take the charge sheet on record in view of the provisions of Section 170 of the CrPC. We consider such a course misplaced and contrary to the very intent of Section 170 of the CrPC,” the court laid down the law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/arrest-is-not-always-a-must-says-supreme-court/article36026614.ece
21 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Elopements most prosecuted under child marriage law: study||Legal proceedings against child marriages are commonly undertaken against elopements whereas forced child marriages often go unpunished, finds a new study. The report — “Child Marriage Prosecutions in India” — brought out by Partners for Law in Development (PLD), a Delhi-based legal resource group, analysed 83 high court and district court verdicts in cases relating to child marriage from 2008 and 2017. It selected for analysis judgments and orders in which child marriage was specifically mentioned. These included cases filed under the Prohibition of Child Marriages Act, 2006, as well as legal action initiated under other laws in relation to child marriage such as Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), 2012, and the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The study found that legal prosecution of child marriages was twice as much against elopement or self-arranged marriages by girls with such cases accounting for 65% ( 54 out of a total 83 cases) of the total cases studied. Only 30% of the cases were those of arranged child marriages, and a mere 5% were forced child marriages (such as those that involved kidnapping, enticement or forcible marriage by parents). An analysis of who initiated the legal proceedings shows that it was primarily the parents of girls who approached the legal system with a complaint. A total of 56 of the 83 cases, or 67.4%, were initiated by parents or relatives. These included cases where parents sought custody of their daughter who had eloped or to prosecute the husband. States reluctant Only 7% of the cases were initiated by a child marriage prohibition officer — the State functionary designated for implementing the law. Another 7% of the cases were filed by a third party, including an NGO, or suo moto action by the court. Girls accessed the law on their own the least, with only 3.5% of the cases filed to seek the nullification of their arranged marriage or to initiate criminal legal action against their parents for arranging an underage marriage. Further, the punishment for elopement versus forced and arranged child marriages were hugely disproportionate. The former could invite a punishment of 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted for rape under the IPC or a jail of 20 years to a maximum punishment of death under the POCSO Act, whereas the latter under the PCMA comes with no minimum sentence and a maximum sentence of imprisonment for two years and/or a fine. The study terms this “weaponisation of the law to settle family dishonour”. That the law is tilted against older adolescents is also borne out by national crime data. In 2019, 525 cases were registered under the PCMA, compared with 6,590 children who were “deemed” to have been kidnapped on account of an elopement or love relationship and 12,724 cases of children who were kidnapped for the purpose of marriage. Corrective action “The unintended harm of the law needs to be corrected. Law reform in this area must aim to shield the young in self-arranged marriages, while activating the frontline workers and child protection system against forced marriages. The empowerment of the girl, recognition of her voice and affirmative action to secure girls at risk with educational and livelihood opportunities must be at the heart of responses to child marriage,” says Madhu Mehra, the lead author of the study and Head, Research and Training, at PLD. She adds that the POCSO must be amended to de-criminalise non-coercive consensual sexual relations between peers, by recognising consent under these conditions between 16-18 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/elopements-most-prosecuted-under-child-marriage-law-study/article36026631.ece
21 August 2021||New Delhi,||TRS’ Dalita Bandhu scheme flayed||The Telangana government’s income support scheme for farmers, the Rythu Bandhu scheme, received universal acclaim and was even replicated at the Central level, but its scheme for Scheduled Caste communities, the Dalita Bandhu scheme, has led to criticism from all quarters of the political spectrum, not least because the pilot project has been launched in a bypoll bound Assembly seat. The Huzurabad Assembly seat was vacated after former Health Minister in the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS)-led government, Eatala Rajendra, quit and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a couple of months ago. Belonging to the Backward Class community, his exit created some discomfort in the TRS. Following Mr. Rajendra’s exit, Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhara Rao wasted no time in announcing the Dalita Bandhu scheme, touted as one of the biggest direct cash benefit schemes in the country, the pilot project for which would be launched in the Huzurabad Assembly seat, bypolls for which are due. The scheme provides finance of up to Rs. 10 lakh to Dalit families under 30 different projects without bank linkages. In Huzurabad itself, the pilot project envisages scrutiny of 20,929 families for benefits under the scheme. Plan extended Later, on August 8, the scheme was extended to Mr. Rao’s adoptive village of Vasalamari in Yadadri district, and a sum of Rs. 7.60 crores was set aside for it. The overall State-wide budget for the scheme is pegged at Rs. 80,000-Rs. 1,00,000 crore. Former national general secretary in the BJP, P. Muralidhar Rao, says that the scheme is being criticised by his party for the ad hoc way in which it is being implemented. “The Rytha Bandhu scheme had a policy architecture that was robust. This scheme is reactive to political situations and Dalit communities deserve better than to be made a beneficiary in a scheme that has been launched and is being taken forward in such an ad hoc manner,” he said. Madhu Goud Yaskhi, campaign committee chairman for the Telangana Congress said that his party, too, had a problem with the manner in which the scheme had been brought in. “If you go by past promises made by the TRS government, Dalit communities are owed Rs. 1 crore individually as the government had promised three acres of land, scholarships for Dalit students and other benefits before every poll. We demand that the government fulfil all promises made to the Dalit community,” he said. The Election Commission is yet to notify polls in Huzurabad, but going by the way the TRS has taken on the exit of Mr. Rajendra, it will be a tough contest, and hanging in balance would be the support of 18% of Dalit voters in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trs-dalita-bandhu-scheme-flayed/article36026616.ece
21 August 2021||Pune,||BJP leader tries to hold banned race||Defying the Supreme Court’s ban on bullock cart races, farmers in Sangli’s Zare village reportedly staged a race after heeding to a call to hold the same by BJP leader Gopichand Padalkar amid heavy police deployment throughout the district. The races were reportedly held early morning to avoid the police from cracking down on the ‘errant’ organisers. While Mr. Padalkar, along with other BJP leaders, were stopped by the police well ahead of the chosen spot, he claimed the races as a victory for the farmers while urging the ruling Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to contest and get the ban lifted in the Supreme Court on grounds that it was baneful to the rural economy. Mr. Padalkar, an MLC and an influential Dhangar community leader from Sangli, had earlier challenged the government and the State police machinery, announcing the race would be held come what may. ‘Unfazed by action’ “I have heard through media reports that some farmers escaped the police blockade and held races. This only shows the sentiment of all farmers who are badly hit by the Supreme Court’s ban… I could not reach the spot as the police had completely blocked-off roads around a 30 km radius. Respecting the appeals of the authorities to prevent mobbing, we had decided to cooperate with the police,” Gopichand Padalkar said. Mr. Padalkar said he was least concerned if the State government decided to take action against him for inciting farmers to stage bullock cart races in violation of the court order. Animal activists on the other hand claimed that it could not be called a ‘competition’ in any sense. Only a handful of errant persons had staged a few rounds of race using bullock carts, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-leader-tries-to-hold-banned-race/article36026657.ece

Mr. Thapa, who has been heading the GTA, a regional autonomous body in the hills, said that the details of the party will be brought before the public in the first week of September. Mr. Thapa emerged in the political scene of the Darjeeling hills in 2017, when Gorkha Janamukti Morcha (GJM) president Bimal Gurung had to flee the hills after an almost 100-day violent economic blockade from June to September 2017 over the demand for a separate State of Gorkhaland in the Darjeeling hills. Gurung exit After Mr. Gurung left the hills, Mr. Thapa and Binay Tamang, another GJM leader, entered in talks with the West Bengal government and normalcy gradually returned to hills. Both of them announced themselves as the leaders of the GTA and expelled Mr. Gurung from the party. Speaking to The Hindu Mr. Thapa said that the time had come for the people of the hills to have the option of “practical and pragmatic politics”. “From 1986, the people of the hills have been fooled by local leaders on the promise of a separate State of Gorkhaland. The emotive issue of Gorkhaland is still important but there are issues like jobs for our youths, the water crisis in Darjeeling, and restoring the glory of Darjeeling so that we can realise our full potential as an important tourism destination,” he said. While emphasising that by setting up a new party, he was giving an option to the people of the hills, Mr. Thapa maintained that there is a need for holding elections to the GTA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gta-chief-to-form-new-party/article36026636.ece

The top court also held that members of the reserved category, who are residents of the successor State of Bihar, while participating in open selection in Jharkhand, shall be treated to be migrants, and they can participate in the general category without claiming the benefit of reservation and vice versa . A Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and Ajay Rastogi decided the “peculiar question” after a resident of Jharkhand, Pankaj Kumar, a member of a Scheduled Caste, filed an appeal against the 2:1 majority High Court order, denying him appointment in the State Civil Service examination of 2007, on the ground that his address proof showed that he was a permanent resident of Patna, Bihar. “It is made clear that person is entitled to claim benefit of reservation in either of the successor State of Bihar or State of Jharkhand, but will not be entitled to claim benefit of reservation simultaneously in both the successor States and those who are members of the reserved category and are resident of the successor State of Bihar, while participating in open selection in State of Jharkhand shall be treated to be migrants and it will be open to participate in general category without claiming the benefit of reservation and vice-versa,” the Bench said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/quota-benefit-cant-be-availed-simultaneously-in-2-states-sc/article36026633.ece

The government complaint lists 18 opposition MPs while on directions of the Chair 40 opposition members have been named for “persistently and willfully obstructing” the proceedings of the House, leaving Mr. Naidu with the question on whom to punish and which members to condone. On Friday, the Rajya Sabha secretariat sent out a draft analytical status note to Mr. Naidu, citing precedents and the action that has been taken in such cases. There are a few key discrepancies between the two lists for example, Samajwadi Party’s Vishambhar Prasad Nishad who has been listed out by the Rajya Sabha, does not figure in the government complaint. CPI (M) Elamaram Kareem does not figure in the Rajya Sabha list, while he has been named in Mr Goyal’s complaint. The last two days of the monsoon session of Parliament on August 10 and August 11 the opposition protests turned violent. On August 10, when the government pushed through a debate on “the agricultural problems and solutions” while the opposition refused to settle for anything less than repeal of the three farm laws. On August 11, the government pushed for The General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment 2021 even when the entire opposition wanted the bill to go to a select committee including the BJP friendly parties. The bill was passed in an extraordinary situation even as the opposition MPs were having a tussle with the Parliamentary security officials who had swarmed the Rajya Sabha chamber. Record of events The Rajya Sabha Bulletin 1 that publishes a record of the day’s events in the house also names the members who caused disruptions. The members have been named for “entering the ‘Well’ of the House, displaying placards, shouting slogans and persistently and willfully obstructed the proceedings of the House,”as per the bulletins of the two days. August 10 bulletin names 34 members while the August 11 names 33 members. There are 27 names which are common to these two bulletins. Many opposition MPs too meanwhile have filed counter complaints alleging that they were manhandled by the Parliamentary security officials. They have further alleged that male marshals have assaulted the women members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/venkaiah-in-a-fix-over-complaints-against-mps/article36026621.ece

Public health measures to reduce transmission and vaccination remain critical,” says the note. Globally, there are believed to be 13 sublineages of Delta with characteristic genetic mutations. AY.1, AY.2 and AY.3 are the predominant ones and also found in India. AY.3.1 is a recently classified sublineage of AY.3 in the United States. AY.12 is a sublineage of delta recently classified from Israel. India is currently adding about 35,000 new cases a day, with about 75% coming from only two States: Kerala and Maharashtra. “Vaccination breakthroughs are common during Delta outbreaks and are expected in India as well. Concern regarding appearance of new variants should be calibrated in the context of such data. As of now sequencing of vaccination breakthroughs in India is also showing a very high proportion of Delta variant. Investigations for any new variants are ongoing,” the note adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delta-driving-infections-in-india-lab-consortium/article36026626.ece

The Prime Minister, who is also the chairman of the Somnath temple trust, emphasised the need to strengthen religious tourism, citing examples of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the Somnath temple and other landmark religious and pilgrimage centres. “We need to strengthen religious tourism,” he said. Religious tourism and pilgrimage would provide new employment opportunities and ensure that the future generations would remain connected with India's history, its traditions and its heritage, he noted. The reconstruction of the Somnath temple to grand renovation was due to centuries of strong will and ideological continuity and contribution by great men like Rajendra Prasad, Sardar Patel and K.M. Munshi, who had to face difficulties for this campaign even after Independence, the Prime Minister said.  Among the projects he inaugurated or laid foundation for include a Somnath Promenade, a Somnath Exhibition Centre, and the reconstructed temple precinct of Old Somnath.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/reign-of-terror-is-always-temporary-says-modi/article36026627.ece

Sources claimed though the Bahujan Samaj Party was sent an invite, there was no response; the Aam Admi Party, however, was left out by the Congress. Apart from Chief Ministers of some of the Opposition-ruled States including Jharkhand’s Hemant Soren, other top leaders included Sharad Pawar (NCP), Farooq Abdullah (National Conference), Mehbooba Mufti (PDP), Sitaram Yechury (CPI-M), D. Raja (CPI), Tejaswi Yadav (RJD) among others. Ms. Gandhi set the tone for the meeting by pointing out that Opposition unity was in full display during the monsoon session of Parliament. “I am confident that this unity will be sustained in future sessions of Parliament as well. But the larger political battle has to be fought outside it. Of course, the ultimate goal is the 2024 Lok Sabha elections for which we have to begin to plan systematically with the single-minded objective of giving to our country a government that believes in the values of the Freedom Movement and in the principles and provisions of our Constitution,” she said. “We all have our compulsions, but clearly, a time has come when the interests of our nation demand that we rise above them,” Ms. Gandhi added. 10 demands As reported by The Hindu earlier, the joint statement which touched upon a host of issues, put forward 10 demands. However, Ms. Banerjee suggested that the demands be reduced to five key issues including a judicial probe into the Pegasus snooping controversy, vaccination for all, repeal of the three farm laws, Rs. 7,500 monthly cash transfers to those outside income tax bracket and the immediate rollback of the hike in fuel and cooking gas prices.  After the meeting, CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury said, “The new India is a Modi project which is based on disruption and destruction of the Constitution and erecting the RSS’ intolerant Hindu Rashtra.” At the meeting, CPI’s D. Raja too talked at length about RSS ‘redefining’ the notion of the Indian State and democracy.    (With inputs from Sobhana k.

On August 20 last year, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi chaired the foundation-laying ceremony for these party offices and renovation of the existing ones. The ceremony of inauguration of the offices at Koriya, Surguja, Durg, Dhamtari, Jagdalpur and Sukuma was attended by State in charge P.L. Punia and national secretary Chandan Yadav. Another 10 offices are under construction and four being renovated. The party will soon begin construction in another five districts and land is being acquired for another three. Party offices will also be constructed at four newly minted districts. Mr. Baghel said on the occasion, “The organisation plays an important role for any party to win the election. And a party office helps an organisation to function more effectively.” The new headquarters of the Chhattisgarh Pradesh Congress Committee in Raipur was constructed when the party was in the Opposition. It was inaugurated in 2018 by Mr. Gandhi. “The new Rajiv Bhawan played a positive role in our campaign for the Assembly elections,” Mr. Baghel stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chhattisgarh-cong-gets-new-offices-in-six-districts/article36026619.ece

The court directed the Uttar Pradesh government to ensure that the patient was traced before the next date of hearing, August 27, and submit a report. The family of Ram Lal Yadav, formerly a junior engineer in the Electricity Department in New Delhi, had filed a habeas corpus petition seeking his release from the custody of the T.B Sapru Hospital in Prayagraj, where he was admitted after testing positive for COVID-19. Missing since May 8 He went missing from his bed since the morning of May 8. The court said neither the Prayagraj district administration nor the police appeared “to be serious about the missing of the person although more than three months have passed”. A Division Bench of Justices Surya Prakash Kesarwani and Piyush Agrawal said it was as “a matter of serious concern that gross negligence” was prima facie shown by the officers, doctors and staff of the hospital.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-pulls-up-up-govt-over-hospitals-condition/article36026717.ece

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||The Highest Truth||The very first verse of the Bhagavata Purana is invocatory in tone and unfolds the nature of the Supreme Brahman by the skilful use of scriptural terms, words and phrases, pointed out Sri B. Sundarkumar in a discourse. It says, “Satyam Param Dheemahi.” “We meditate on that Truth Supreme, Satyam Param.” By this is meant the Highest and Absolute Brahman whom the scriptures describe as the One with no second, ‘Ekameva Advitiyam.’ The uniqueness of the Highest Truth is that it exists and remains unchanged at all points of time. Scriptures then explain this truth from the angle of the world of creation and its relation to the Supreme Brahman. This prapancham is superimposed on the Supreme Brahman, that is, Brahman has created this wonderful prapancham. But this prapancham does not qualify to be the Highest Truth as it does not exist always, though it is created and supported by Brahman, and also attains laya in Brahman. It is subject to change. The term ‘Vyavaharika Satya,’ is used in this context to refer to the intermediary state of reality of the jagat in relation to the Absolute Reality of Brahman. The validity of existence of the jagat depends on each one’s awareness of this relationship. It is possible for the mind to err with regard to many issues in daily life. Is not one led to believe a piece of shining nacre on the seashore as a piece of silver? Or to imagine a rope to be a snake owing to lack of knowledge and to continue to live in a state of fear until such time the truth is made clear by some means or other? These states are real as long as the misconception is present. So this prapancham is satya to one who is not realised. But realised souls continue to live in this world and know prapancham as non-existent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-highest-truth/article36026645.ece

The social media giant informed Mr. Gandhi, as well as the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), of the removal of the posts from Facebook and Instagram. In an emailed reply to a query, a Facebook spokesperson said, “We have taken action to remove the content as it was in violation of our policies.” According to Facebook, in this case, the family has pleaded for their safety in the court, and in view of their safety and to maintain the dignity of the victim, the company decided to take down the content from its platform. The social media company’s action followed the NCPCR’s direction to Facebook to take appropriate action against Mr. Gandhi’s Instagram profile over the violation of provisions of Acts such as the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, and the Indian Penal Code. Earlier, on August 7, Twitter too had locked Mr. Gandhi’s account, and subsequently several other handles associated with the Congress, for posting/sharing a photograph of the parents of the 9-year-old victim. A week later, on August 14, Twitter restored Mr. Gandhi’s account, after the company claimed that the Congress leader had submitted a consent letter from the victim’s family.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/facebook-takes-down-post-by-rahul/article36026617.ece

21 August 2021||BENGALURU,TAMIL NADU||HC: get forensic reports ready within a month||Rejecting the longer timeline proposed by the State government to fill up the huge number of vacant posts, upgrade infrastructure, and complete tests at Forensic Science Laboratories (FSLs), the High Court of Karnataka has not only set a shorter timeline but also ordered that forensic reports should be submitted within one month of the date of receipt of all new samples. The court said an effort should be made to submit reports within three months in all the 35,738 articles/samples awaiting tests connected to 6,994 pending criminal cases. “There is a gross violation of the fundamental right of protection of life and personal liberty on account of the State machinery not performing its duties”, the court said. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj issued the series of interim directions on a PIL petition, initiated suo motu by the court in February this year on noticing that the criminal justice system had been “crippled” in the State because of the huge pendency of samples awaiting forensic tests because of a lack of human resources and testing facilities. The measures proposed by the government, the Bench said, were “literally baby steps and too little compared the required action”. It called for greater alacrity on the part of the State to make recruitments. The Bench also directed the government to fill up several of the vacant posts on contract basis within a period of four months till regular recruitments are made or till the persons working in the lower cadres become eligible for promotion. The Bench said the government had “woken up” to the issues plaguing FSLs only after the court took note of the sorry state of affairs. Of the total 468 sanctioned posts in the FSLs, 311 have been lying vacant for years. “It is rather shocking that a period of one year is taken for chemical analysis, and one and a half years for computer forensics, mobile forensics, audio, video forensics, and DNA analysis when some laws set a deadline of less than a year for the completion of trial itself in cases like sexual offence against children,” the Bench said. Data dashboard The Bench also said the State FSL should maintain a dashboard on its website for public viewing, displaying details such as date, nature and number of samples received for analysis, status of processing, date of submission of report, time taken to process, reasoning for delay and more. The Bench said a research and development unit should be set in the SFSL and an R&D unit should examine starting various new wings of forensic study, the need of new equipment, the formulation of an SOP, transportation, storage and processing of samples, and develop a format for submission of reports. TheBench also said trial courts should keep track of submission of forensic reports and could permit FSL officers to appear in videoconference modeduring trials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-get-forensic-reports-ready-within-a-month/article36026662.ece
21 August 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||A long history of Section 144 in Madras||It is only in the last month or so that limited public gatherings have resumed in the city. The State imposed the restrictions on the movement of people to stop the spread of COVID-19. It may well be the longest stretch of lockdown the city has ever witnessed. But there were lockdowns imposed for non-medical reasons, such as maintenance of law and order and wars. Curfews and prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure are the usual tools for the administration to ensure peace and quell protests. One of the earliest occasions when the city went under prohibitory orders (Section 144) was in 1928 when the Simon Commission was visiting. The archives of The Hindu reveal that the then Chief Presidency Magistrate, based on an application from the Assistant Commissioner, Police Headquarters, Madras City, invoked the Section on the seventh day of February 1928 to maintain public peace and prevent riots and disturbances that would mar public tranquillity. “I do hereby order you to abstain from this date for one month from convening or addressing any meeting within the city of Madras with object of advocating or furthering hartal or suspension in connection with the visit of the Simon Commission; attending, directing or organising any procession or other demonstrations with the above object; engaging, leading or organising volunteers with the above object; publishing leaflets, posters or other propaganda with the above object; causing or inciting others to do any of the acts which you are hereby ordered yourself to abstain from,” the order read. The copies were served on leaders, including S. Satymurti, Sami Venkatchalam Chettti and Yakub Hussain.  The Hindu report said the police in various divisions of the city gave wide publicity to the order. Constables were deployed across the city to beat the “tom tom” and ask people not to participate in the hartal. In August 1940, K. Kamaraj, president of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee, was served with an order by Hume, Commissioner of Police, Madras, drawing his attention to the Defence of India Rules issued by the Home Department, Central Government, prohibiting parades and flag hoisting in a military fashion, and wearing of uniform resembling that of the police or the Army, saying these orders were enforced in the city. Venkatesh Ramakrishnan, historian and novelist, said, “In 1943 during the Second World War, the Japanese Air Force and Navy were conducting daring attacks in the Indian Ocean. The threat across the Bay of Bengal was imminent. The city was scared and blackouts were ordered at night. The Defence of India Act made the Marina Beach a prohibited area between lighting-up time and sunrise and anyone found there after sunset, which ironically included fishermen, were fined.” Prohibitory orders were widely used during the anti-Hindi agitations in 1965 and the Emergency in 1975, former police officers recalled. In November 1990, the then Police Commissioner, K.K. Rajasekharan Nair, promulgated an order under Section 41 of the City Police Act, prohibiting processions, demonstrations and assemblies without police permission for 15 days. The order was issued, in anticipation of the Ram Rath Yatra, to maintain public peace and tranquillity in the context of a few developments that were likely to take place, leading to communal unrest. Among the reasons cited were the split in the Janata Dal and the plan of the Sri Ram Kar Seva Samiti to take out processions of the ashes of ‘kar sevaks’ killed in police firing at Ayodhya. After the demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992, a similar order was issued. Since then, the City Police Commissioners have used this Section frequently. In 1991, the Army was called out and a curfew was imposed in several towns as mob violence broke out after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Former Director-General of Police R. Nataraj said curfews or prohibitory orders were imposed to regulate public gatherings and maintain order. “The basic function of the police is maintenance of law and order, prevention of crime and collection of information as per the Police Act. The police have both regulatory and preventive powers. Under Section 41 of the City Police Act, the police regulate public gatherings, saying more than five people cannot gather without police permission. These acts are for meant only for prevention. When the situation went out of control, as it did during the anti-Hindi agitation in 1965, there was police firing. At that time, the prohibitory order under Section 144 was clamped widely.” Mr. Nataraj recalled that during the Vinayaka Chaturthi procession in 1990, there was police firing, in which four persons died. “After the 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai and the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blasts, we had disturbances in the city. However, during the 2005 serial blasts in Delhi, Chennai remained largely calm because of our regulatory order. Again in 2008, after the Mumbai terror attacks, at every stage we enforced prohibitory orders.” The prohibitory order was also invoked in George Town after the police and lawyers clashed on the Madras High Court premises on February 19, 2009. In January 2017, the Marina was closed for weeks with a prohibitory order issued by the then Commissioner S. George. The police said the closure was required after social media messages went viral, urging people to congregate there for the pro-Jallikattu protests. Under Section 144 and based on the government guidelines, a lockdown has been enforced since March 2020 to control the spread of COVID-19. The then City Police Commissioner, A.K. Viswanathan, was the first to promulgate the order. His successors Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal and Shankar Jiwal have extended it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-long-history-of-section-144-in-madras/article36026826.ece
21 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||21 fined for dumping waste in waterbodies||The Greater Chennai Corporation has collected fine from 21 persons who dumped garbage and construction debris in waterbodies. Following the report of the monitoring committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal, Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi directed officials to inspect Perungudi lake on August 18 and 19. A large quantity of garbage and construction debris was found dumped in the lake. During the field inspection, officials identified 21 persons who had dumped the garbage and construction debris in the lake and collected a fine of Rs. 12,000. Geetha Ganesh, of AGS Colony Residents Welfare Association, said residents had complained about the dumping of waste in waterbodies and canals ahead of the monsoon. “Dumping of waste in waterbodies continues at night. Unless the Greater Chennai Corporation becomes strict in fining violators of all categories, including residents, shopkeepers, bulk-waste generators and commercial establishments, the tendency to continue illegal dumping will not change,” she said. “Veerangal Odai is being dumped with garbage from the nearby commercial establishments and street vendors who occupy the pavements. Last year, medical waste was dumped in it, and flat residents approached PWD officials, who warned the offenders,” she said. The work on clearing debris and silt along 48 km of the canals is expected to be completed next month. Most of the waterbodies have shrunk because of the dumping of waste and construction debris, officials said.  Unless the Corporation becomes strict in fining violators, the tendency to continue illegal dumping will not change Geetha GaneshAGS Colony Residents Welfare Association||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/21-fined-for-dumping-waste-in-waterbodies/article36026818.ece
21 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Slum board suspends 2 officials for poor quality of construction||The Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) has suspended two officials following complaints over poor quality of construction at the tenements built in Kesava Pillai (K.P.) Park, Pulianthope. The suspended officials were M. Pandian, assistant engineer, and S. Anbalagan, assistant executive engineer, who were involved in the project. Sources at the TNSCB said the suspension was based on preliminary investigation that indicated that the quality of plastering work, including the quality of materials used, were not up to required standard. An official said the two engineers had the task of monitoring the quality of construction. The structural quality will be assessed by a team from IIT-Madras. Further action on others responsible, including the contractor, will be taken based on the team’s report. “If there is a problem, we will take action,” the official said. Two clusters, one with 864 units and another with 1,056 units, were built by the TNSCB at the site after the old and dilapidated tenements were demolished. The residents were moved to temporary shelters nearby. They are yet to move into the new buildings as they are opposed to the TNSCB’s demand of Rs. 1.5 lakh from each allottee. The quality of construction snowballed into a controversy after it was first raised by the allottees. Meanwhile, V.S. Thennarasu, managing partner of P.S.T. Engineering Construction, the private company that built the tenements, issued a public statement through advertisements in some dailies on Friday, stating that the construction was of good quality. Pointing out that the company had undertaken over hundred construction projects for the State government, Mr. Thennarasu said the two clusters were respectively handed over in 2019 and 2020 and were subsequently certified to be of expected quality by the TNSCB’s Executive Engineer. Arappor Iyakkam on Friday demanded that a criminal case be filed against the officials concerned, the contractor and the third party engaged by the TNSCB to certify quality. It said the role of former Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, who handled the Housing and Urban Development portfolio along with the TNSCB, must also be probed. Alleging that there were a number of issues with the tenements, including lifts, water supply and fire safety, the organisation demanded that a public hearing be conducted to listen to the grievances of the allottees. Demanding the recovery of the cost of construction from the contractor, the organisation asked that the Rs. 1.5 lakh demanded from the allottees be waived.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/slum-board-suspends-2-officials-for-poor-quality-of-construction/article36026830.ece

21 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||With 54 MW, Chennai emerges as data centre hub||With a current capacity of 54 MW, Chennai is steadily emerging as a data centre hub and the city is likely to increase its supply by 1.3 times in the next two years, with a planned pipeline of 79 MW. The Tamil Nadu government is wooing firms in the data centre space, and it has signed MoUs with 11 firms in recent months, entailing investments worth Rs. 18,827 crore. “The most common requirements to establish a data centre, which include submarine cable landing stations, ample power supply and thriving IT infrastructure, already exist in Tamil Nadu. And with the proposed data centre policy, we are well- positioned to take over this growing market,” Pooja Kulkarni, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Guidance Tamil Nadu, told The Hindu . More deals likely State government officials and Guidance have indicated that more deals will happen in the coming months and talks are on with various firms. Currently, Chennai has the third highest data centre capacity in India, after Mumbai (199 MW) and Bangalore (57 MW). Chennai also has high occupancy levels (83%) owing to space taken up by large cloud companies. Jerry Kingsley, senior director, Capital Markets, Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed out that historically, Chennai has been a hub for data centres for telecom operators. “Bharti Airtel, through its subsidiary Nxtra, has established a data centre in Siruseri, and is constructing its second data centre. Similarly, Vodafone and Reliance have established their data centres in Siruseri,” he added. Tata Communications Limited (TCL) had acquired the VSNL Earth Station in 2002. ST Telemedia Global Data Centres (STT GDC) acquired this TCL asset in 2016 to establish its data centre. Apart from STT GDC, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) have established their data centre in Velappanchavadi, 6 km from the Ambattur micro-market. “Sify has established its data centre in Taramani. Its proposed second data centre is to be established in Siruseri,” Mr. Kingsley pointed out. Plans for the future Yotta Infrastructure, a Hiranandani Group subsidiary and a managed data centre service provider developing a hyper-scale data centre park, will set up its park in Chennai. The Hiranandani Group and its group companies, along with Yotta, will invest Rs. 4,000 crore in this proposed project over 8-10 years. Sunil Gupta, co-founder and CEO, Yotta, said the proposed data centre park would be built on a 20-acre campus at Hiranandani Parks on the Singaperumal-Oragadam Highway. He added, “The first data centre building, with a built-up area of 350,000 sq ft, will be live by December 2022. We are coming up with a 5 MW IT power facility on our Chennai campus. This facility will be live by April 2022.” Princeton Digital Group, which has inked an MoU worth Rs. 750 crore with the Tamil Nadu government, said its actual investments were expected to be much higher. Sumit Mukhija, CEO of STT GDC India, said, “We had signed an MoU in May 2020 to expand our data centre footprint in the State and invest up to Rs. 1,500 crore over the next 5-7 years. The company has already invested close to Rs. 1,000 crore over the last couple of years, and is actively considering further expansion of its overall capacity by an additional 40-60 MW of IT load.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/with-54-mw-chennai-emerges-as-data-centre-hub/article36026849.ece
21 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||300 trees cut at HUL site, say activists||Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) illegally chopped down more than 300 trees from four acres at its defunct mercury factory in Kodaikanal and that has exposed the toxic soil at the plant site to erosion by rainwater and wind, according to the Chennai Solidarity Group. The activists group released Google Earth images of the site from March 2018 and January 2020 to show the cutting down of the trees. They said at least 100 kg of soil-bound mercury was likely to have been washed off into the eco-sensitive Pambar Shola section of the Kodaikanal Wildlife Sanctuary. “This clear-felling is a reckless move that will allow Unilever to clean-up its site by poisoning the Wildlife Sanctuary and the Vaigai catchment. The Forest Department and the TNPCB stand exposed as incapable of protecting the sanctuary and environment,” said Nityanand Jayaraman of Chennai Solidarity Group. Mr. Jayaraman said as per the Upscaled Remediation Plan approved by the TNPCB in 2018 and a soil conservation study, no tree should be felled and steps need to be taken to ensure that standing trees are not destabilised due to excavation of contaminated soil. He alleged that the violation was supervised by NEERI that was deputed onsite to ensure that remediation goes as per the plan prepared by it. However, the HUL refuted the charges and said, “only a minimum number of trees have been cut. Once remediation is complete, we will plant more trees than what we have had to cut. This seems to be another attempt to spread misinformation and delay soil remediation”. A company spokesperson said trees were cut prior to the commencement of soil remediation at the site as it was required to execute the excavation and remediation of soil. Furthermore, the trees were cut well above the ground level to ensure soil is not disturbed, the spokesperson said. “Trees were cut down only after HUL obtained the necessary permissions from the Dindigul District Hill Area (Preservation of Trees) Committee, chaired by the District Collector, and the District Forest Officer in October 2019 and December 2019, respectively. This was in line with the recommendation made by the TNPCB and the Scientific Experts Committee constituted by the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee earlier that year, for tree removal in the area requiring soil remediation. Additionally, HUL constructed soil retaining walls, silt settling tanks and silt traps to ensure there is no discharge of contaminated soil outside of the factory premises,” the spokesperson said. Further, the company has already planted 500 trees at the nearby Mother Teresa University, the spokesperson said.  Only a minimum number of trees have been cut. Once remediation is complete, we will plant more trees than what we have had to cut HUL||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/300-trees-cut-at-hul-site-say-activists/article36026886.ece
21 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Speciality centre commissioned to treat hernia||The Institute of Hernia Surgery and Abdominal Wall Reconstruction commissioned at Apollo Hospitals on Friday will be a comprehensive speciality centre, offering advanced treatment techniques, such as robotic and laparoscopic surgery. Hernia occurs when an organ or fatty tissue squeezes through a weak spot in a surrounding muscle or connective tissue. It could be congenital or caused by muscle weakness disorders, excessive smoking, chronic cough, lifting heavy weights without adequate groin support or strenuous activity following abdominal surgery. Paradigm shift Premkumar Balachandran, minimal access, bariatric and robotic surgeon, Apollo Hospital, said hernia management had undergone a paradigm shift with the introduction of minimal access surgery. “The nomenclature of ventral hernia management is now referred to as ‘abdominal wall reconstruction’. Complex reconstructions, abdominal wall component separation surgeries, regular groin and ventral hernia can now be treated with minimal morbidity by laparoscopic and robotic techniques,” he said. Health Minister Ma. Subramanian, who commissioned the Institute, welcomed the initiative to start an exclusive centre for hernia treatment when most hospitals offer the treatment as an add on. “Apollo Hospitals has attracted patients from across the country and even the world,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/speciality-centre-commissioned-to-treat-hernia/article36026828.ece
21 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||High Court stays construction of Kallakurichi Collectorate||The Madras High Court on Thursday stayed the construction of a multi-storey building to house an integrated Collectorate complex for Kallakurichi district, carved out in 2019 by bifurcating Villupuram district. The complex was to be built on around five acres of land, out of a larger tract of 14.09 hectares, belonging to the Nagareswarar or Ardhanareswarar temple in Veeracholapuram. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu passed the interim stay order on a contempt of court petition filed by activist Rangarajan Narasimhan, who said the court had in April permitted the State to commence only preliminary work but the government has begun construction itself, without obtaining statutory clearances. In the contempt plea moved in June, the petitioner said the government had neither obtained environmental clearance nor approval from the Directorate of Town and Country Planning (DTCP). He said construction was under way in full swing at the site, in violation of the lockdown restrictions imposed by the government. Filing his reply by way of an affidavit on Thursday, Public Works Department Secretary Sandeep Saxena told the court that the application for plan approval was submitted on April 29, but there had been a delay in obtaining approval due to the pandemic. The approval application was scrutinised only after June 13 and the DTCP issued the technical clearance on August 9. An application for environmental clearance too was submitted on May 21, but it took time to obtain clearance because the relevant committees could not meet due to COVID-19, and the clearance was finally given on August 17, the court was told. After taking the affidavit on file, the Bench wrote, “However, since there is an order which requires the construction not to be proceeded with, till permission to be accorded by this court, further construction of the project will remain stayed. It is essential that the issue, as to whether the relevant land may be used for the project, is decided first.” The judges also directed the High Court Registry to list on August 26 the contempt petition as well as the main writ petition, in which the litigant had questioned the government’s decision to take 14.09 hectares of temple land on lease for constructing an integrated Collectorate complex, a district court complex and an office for the SP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-stays-construction-of-kallakurichi-collectorate/article36026839.ece
21 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Govt. makes services business friendly||The State government has made it mandatory for the Registration Department to issue encumbrance certificates to business enterprises in three days as part of its push for the ease of doing business. Likewise, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) or any other urban local body has to provide an assessment number to any new property of a business enterprise in 30 days. In the case of issuing documents for the transfer of the name of the property owner, the period is 15 days. The School Education Department has to provide certificates of recognition to schools under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules in 90 days. For the transfer of vehicle registration, the waiting period is three days. These measures and more form part of the two orders issued by the Industries Department a week ago. The service standards are not just meant for business enterprises but also for the public, said officials of the Registration Department, the GCC and the Municipal Administration Directorate, adding that their departments had begun working in this regard. For example, the GCC, in a recent circular to its officers, specifically mentioned that “while issuing approvals for all types of applications [building permits, planning permissions or demolitions] altogether, the time period of 30 days shall not be violated without any valid reason”. In the case of the remaining municipal corporations and municipalities, an “urban tree information system” has been launched, covering 29 services online, for the benefit of citizens across all urban local bodies, with the objective of ensuring “a citizen-friendly, participatory, transparent and accountable government”. As for the Registration Department, the portal,https://tnreginet.gov.in/po rtal/, can be accessed for downloading encumbrance certificates for free. If anyone requires a certified copy, he can get it in three days by e-mail ordinarily, said an official. The Industries Department, in the two orders, eliminated the permissible time limit for the provision of certain services by several Departments to business enterprises and prescribed many more new services. For instance, the renewal of factories licence from the Directorate of Industrial Safety and Health will now be issued automatically and instantly, online, upon payment of the requisite fee, instead of the earlier arrangement of a waiting period of seven days. A senior official of the Industries Department said the orders had brought in six more Departments under the ambit of the Business Facilitation Act — Geology and Mining, Water Resources, Public Works, Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services, the Commissionerate of Transport and School Education. Till now, 24 Departments have been covered. The official said that if the prescribed time limits were exceeded for any application, a committee headed by the Managing Director of the Guidance Bureau and further, a State-level committee headed by the Chief Secretary were in place to clear them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-services-made-business-friendly/article36026809.ece
21 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Thoothukudi inquiry panel gets extension||The State government on Friday extended the tenure of the Justice Aruna Jagadeesan Commission of Inquiry (CoI) by six months to complete inquiry into the Thoothukudi firing incident in May 2018, in which 13 persons were killed. The CoI’s tenure was to expire on August 22. Justice Aruna Jagadeesan (retd.) had sought a year’s extension to complete the inquiry. The government has extended its tenure till February 22, 2022, and no further extension will be provided beyond these six months, according to a Government Order (G.O.). The Commission has to complete its inquiry and submit its report in both English and Tamil to the government, on or before that date. “The Justice Aruna Jagadeesan Commission of Inquiry has stated that considering the nature of inquiry, the time stipulated by the government is insufficient to complete the inquiry and submit the report to the government, and has requested the government to extend the term of the CoI by a year, from August 23, 2021,” the G.O. read. The government said that after careful consideration, a six-month extension had been granted. The CoI submitted its interim report to Chief Minister M.K. Stalin in May. The CoI, in its interim report, reportedly recommended the withdrawal of 244 “foisted cases” against 400 youth, illegally detained after the police firing, and the payment of adequate compensation to the victims of police torture. Over 700 witnesses have been examined by the CoI since it was constituted by the then AIADMK government in May 2018.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thoothukudi-inquiry-panel-gets-extension/article36026843.ece
21 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC: distance degree holders can’t be faculty||Observing that degrees through distance education are invariably earned only for furthering job prospects in the employment market, the Madras High Court has ruled that such degree holders cannot be considered for faculty positions in higher educational institutions. Second Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and V. Parthiban said the distance education mode might have become a social imperative, considering the lack of access to regular education for a vast majority of the disadvantaged class, yet in the larger interest of higher education, such degree holders could not be considered for faculty positions. “The quality of education can be measured through the type of teachers appointed to handle academics. Persons with no experience in campus life, having not studied and earned their degrees in regular institutions/colleges, may not have experienced institutional academic culture and may not match the expectations of the present generation of students,” the Bench said. The verdict was delivered while disposing of a batch of cases related to the appointment of assistant professors (pre law) in government law colleges. The judges disapproved of the practice of appointing cross degree holders (undergraduate degree in one subject and postgraduate in another) to teach the subject in which they had obtained a PG degree. Authoring the verdict for the Bench, Justice Parthiban wrote: “When a postgraduate degree is the minimum qualification for a teaching faculty, obtaining only a postgraduate degree in the relevant subject and claiming eligibility on that account is a clear attempt to hoodwink and get around the system due to a lack of clarity on the issue.” He went on to state: “This court simply cannot comprehend the quality of the teacher if he/she has two degrees in two different subjects and get appointed as assistant professor for taking classes in major subjects like economics, commerce or technology, business administration. Such people cannot claim to have a depth of knowledge.” The judges ruled that it was unnecessary for the State government to insist that candidates applying for the post of assistant professor (pre law), appointed to teach subjects other than law, must have obtained a master’s degree in law with a minimum 55% of marks, besides having enrolled as an advocate with the Bar Council. They held such insistence by the government was ex-facie irrational, arbitrary and unreasonable and in conflict with the minimum standards fixed by the Bar Council of India. The court criticised the State government for not putting in sincere efforts to persuade the court and justify the qualifications prescribed for faculty to teach pre-law courses. “When the policy of the government is under serious attack, this court hardly finds any attempt made on behalf of the government to justify the qualifications prescribed for pre-law courses in government colleges. Despite opportunities afforded… this court finds a lackadaisical approach of the government throughout the hearings of the case,” the judges said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-distance-degree-holders-cant-be-faculty/article36026834.ece
21 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Ramp up vaccination in districts with low seroprevalence’||Districts with low seroprevalence and low COVID-19 vaccination coverage must be prioritised for targeted interventions such as vaccination. The areas where seroprevalence is low, the chances of virus spreading faster and emergence of new variants are high, experts of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE) have said. In an email interview, Manoj Murhekar, director of NIE and T. Jeromie, epidemiologist at NIE, outlined the need for Tamil Nadu to accelerate the pace of vaccination especially in districts where seroprevalence was found to be low since one-third of the population was still susceptible for infection, while continuing adherence to COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. “The recent serosurvey conducted in the State indicates that around two thirds of the population has IgG antibodies against the virus. There is a wide variation in the seroprevalence between the districts, ranging from 37% in Erode to 82% in Chennai. It is reasonable to expect that the transmission will continue especially in districts with lower seroprevalence. The future surge of cases in the State is expected to be lower than the second wave. However, if a new immune escape variant emerges, we might see a bigger surge,” Dr. Murhekar said. Noting that the districts with low vaccination coverage and with low seroprevalence of IgG antibodies are expected to see more cases, Dr. Jeromie said that the population in these districts was more susceptible for transmission, and hence, such districts need to be prioritised for both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. “The current R naught (basic reproduction number) for the State is 0.99 ,” he said. Evaluating the State’s COVID-19 vaccination drive so far, he said that around 39% of the adult population in the State have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. “The availability of vaccines remains an important factor. Hence, prioritising districts with lower seroprevalence and individuals at higher risk of severe outcomes such as elderly, people with co-morbidity and pregnant women may be considered,” he said. On whether they will be a third wave of COVID-19 infections, Dr. Murhekar pointed out that the fourth nation-wide serosurvey indicated that around two third of individuals aged six years and above in India have IgG antibodies against COVID-19. “Studies have shown that the immune response among the infected individuals is robust and antibodies last for at least one year. Re-infections are few among the already infected individuals. Studies also indicate that although the breakthrough infections are frequent among the vaccinated individuals; majority of these infections are mild and mortality among vaccinated individuals is very low,” he said. Based on these findings, he noted that it was reasonable to believe that the third wave in India would be much smaller than the second wave. “However, with the emergence of new immune escape variant, one could see a high upsurge of cases,” he said As of now, there was no new variant of interest found in the country, apart from the Delta variant, he said, adding: “We have to strengthen our genomic surveillance especially in areas with high number of breakthrough infections and hospitalisations, and also in high seroprevalence areas which are seeing surge of cases.” Dr. Jeromie added that genomic surveillance was crucial at this phase of the pandemic. “We have to look out for new variants of interest and their ability to escape immunity. Information from the genomic surveillance will help us to plan to mitigate the future waves of the pandemic,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ramp-up-vaccination-in-districts-with-low-seroprevalence-inoculation/article36026848.ece
21 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Private firms urged to use CSR funds for free jabs||Health Minister Ma. Subramanian has appealed to companies to offer free COVID-19 vaccines through private hospitals. At the launch of the institute of hernia surgery and abdominal wall reconstruction at Apollo Hospitals here on Friday, he said the hospital had asked the government to off-take 5 lakh doses of Covaxin that it had. He urged the hospital to use its CSR funds to administer the doses free as it did in Karur some time ago. Appeal to Reliance Subsequently, the Minister made an appeal to the Reliance Group, which had earlier given free fuel to 1,303 EMRI 108 ambulances and free food to front-line workers, to extend its CSR funds for the free vaccination of people with the 5 lakh doses of Covaxin that Apollo Hospitals had. The State required nine crore more doses to fully vaccinate all citizens. As of now, it had vaccinated over 2.74 crore persons, including those who had been vaccinated at private hospitals. In a few days, around three crore doses would have been administered. The State had approached the Union government and sought 90% of the doses to the government and only 10% to private hospitals, he said. The suggestion was made as most people were hesitant to pay huge sums for the vaccination, and the State was running short of Covaxin. Fully vaccinated Mr. Subramanian said that in Ariyalur district, all 6,981 pregnant women and in Pudukottai district all 11,625 differently abled persons had been vaccinated. In 60 villages, all eligible residents had been vaccinated. In Kodai, all 23,681 persons in the over 18-year-old group had been inoculated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/minister-urges-private-firms-to-use-csr-funds-for-free-jabs/article36026854.ece

Ravikumar has objected to the stand on the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act taken by an AIADMK member at a recent meeting of the Monitoring and Vigilance Committee, chaired by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, to oversee the implementation of the Act. He said the AIADMK representative, who hails from a Scheduled Caste, had said the Act was being misused, and cases should be filed only after investigation by government employees. “He made comments that have the potential to derail the Act. It is shocking that the AIADMK chose a representative from a Scheduled Caste to make these comments. This is akin to using their fingers to poke their own eyes,” he said on Friday. While Mr. Ravikumar criticised the AIADMK for holding only one such meeting, in 2013, in the last 10 years, he praised Mr. Stalin for chairing the meeting within 100 days of assuming office.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-members-stand-on-scst-act-irks-vck/article36026855.ece

The plant was commissioned in 2013. Chennai Metrowater had set up the facility with a capacity to treat 100 million litres of seawater daily (mld) on engineering, procurement and contract basis. According to sources in VA Tech Wabag, the firm has completed seven years of operation and maintenance, and now has been given an extension for operation. The capacity of the plant was upgraded to 110 mld through technological intervention. However, the water agency has restricted supply from the desalination plant to 88.25 mld now as it is drawing more from the city reservoirs that have sufficient storage. Chennai is now being supplied with 900.94 mld of drinking water. Of this, nearly 697 mld is being provided through pipelines in core areas, and nearly 122 mld as piped water supply to added areas. Sources at the VA Tech Wabag said it is also one of the qualified bidders for the 400 mld desalination plant to be set up in Perur. Tenders are set to be finalised in the next few months. Minister for Municipal Administration K.N. Nehru had recently noted that the work on Rs. 6,078 crore plant is expected to be completed by December 2025.

21 August 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore Corpn. tasks five engineers with identifying corridors for NMT||Coimbatore Corporation has tasked five of its engineers with identifying roads for developing non-motorised transport (NMT) corridors. Assistant engineers R. Muthukumar (North Zone), R. Ezhil (East Zone), S.R. Savitha (South Zone), R. Uthaman (West Zone) and R. Sakthivel (Central Zone) would identify roads where the Corporation could develop pedestrian pathways, bicycling tracks and improve roads for easy vehicle movement, said sources familiar with the development. The Corporation had asked the engineers to identify the first road in their respective zone in the next one-and-a-half months and more roads thereafter. It had also tasked them with developing roads to accommodate pedestrian pathways and bicycle lanes as and when it rebuilt roads. The Corporation launched the NMT project a few days ago in association with the German agency GIZ under the Smart Cities Mission. The German agency had trained the five engineers in December 2020-January 2021 with a 70-hour orientation programme on the NMT. The five engineers would in turn train their colleagues so that every engineer had the requisite skill sets to identify and develop roads. The reason that the GIZ, through the Corporation, gave the e-bicycles to the engineers was that the engineers by cycling on roads they wanted to identify before selection would understand the problems first hand. It was better if the Corporation engineers, who would implement the NMT project, understood the problems than the GIZ or any other agency studying roads on their behalf to suggest those to the Corporation, the sources further said while explaining the need for giving the five e-bicycles. The GIZ had conducted a survey a few years ago and identified 300-km roads in the city with the potential to be developed as NMT corridors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-tasks-five-engineers-with-identifying-corridors-for-nmt/article36026872.ece

21 August 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Expedite airport expansion works, Vanathi urges State government||The State government must expedite the land acquisition process for the expansion works of the Coimbatore International Airport and provide adequate compensation to farmers for their land, urged Coimbatore South MLA and National president of BJP’s Mahila Morcha Vanathi Srinivasan here on Friday. She participated in a meeting with landholders whose lands were to be acquired for the airport expansion project in Coimbatore. After the meeting, she told mediapersons the expansion works could commence only after the State government completed the land acquisition process and handed it over to the Airports Authority of India. The State government must ensure that all farmers received the revised compensation amount at the earliest, Ms. Srinivasan said. With many micro, small and medium enterprises present near the airport, the government must clarify on providing compensation to these enterprises, she added. The officials must conduct a separate meeting with all those who were served notices for land acquisition to clarify their queries, she said, calling for an “integrated action plan” for the land acquisition process. Stressing that the expansion of the Airport was essential “for the growth and progress” of the State, Ms. Srinivasan alleged that the expansion works had not been completed even after 15 years. The lack of major announcements pertaining to airport expansion works in the recent Budget tabled by the State government was “disappointing,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/expedite-airport-expansion-works-vanathi-urges-state-government/article36026880.ece

A release said that for the first time the university had transplanted a tree. It took up the transplantation of the tree that was at the entrance of the 113-year-old Botanical Garden to pave the way for the construction of a golden jubilee arch, erected to mark the 50 years of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. The University deployed a team of scientists led by Dean, Horticultural College and Research Institute, L. Pugalendhi, to transplant the tree, called ‘burlapping’. The team lopped the canopy and small branches, treated the cut ends with fungicide and then covered those with moistened straw and jute fabric to prevent transpirational loss of water. The team took up the exercise based on instructions from Vice-Chancellor N. Kumar who did not want the tree chopped. A day prior to burlapping the neem tree, the team, comprising Dean, Agricultural College and Research Institute, M. Kalyanasundaram, Professor and Head, Department of Floriculture and Landscape Architecture K. Rajamani, watered the earth around the tree for easy removal of the root ball. On the day, it trimmed the smaller root branches while taking care to not damage the tap root.

Alagiri on Friday said the Centre had let down Tamil Nadu by denying payout of its compensation dues under the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Talking to reporters here after paying homage to the statue of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on his 77th birth anniversary in Chidambaram, he said that normally special packages would be given to States to ensure that they did not suffer any financial setback. Even if the Centre had not sanctioned any special package for Tamil Nadu, it should have at least released the compensation due to the State under the GST regime. The State was now facing an economic crisis due to the negative approach by the Union government in meeting the requirements of Tamil Nadu, he said. Complimenting Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on implementing pioneering programmes in the first 100 days of office, Mr. Alagiri said the reduction on Value Added Tax on petrol by Rs. 3 was a historic achievement. What Prime Minister Narendra Modi could not do in the last seven years had been accomplished by Mr. Stalin, he said. Replying to a question, Mr. Alagiri denied that the DMK government had foisted false cases on the AIADMK in the Kodanad heist-cum-murder. It was for the person facing the charge to prove himself innocent at the end of the probe, he said. The State’s decision to appoint trained ‘archakas’ of all castes at temples managed by the Department of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments was a step in the right direction and was aimed at social justice, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-let-down-by-centre-in-gst-compensation/article36026852.ece

21 August 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Breach in LBP main canal leaves villages inundated||A breach in the Lower Bhavani Project (LBP) main canal in Malaipalayam village in the Perundurai Union led to the inundation of over 60 houses and crops in three villages in the district. Residents cited the poor quality of the new retaining wall as the reason. Almost 1,000 cusecs of water has been released from the Bhavanisagar Dam into the canal for irrigation from August 15. On Thursday night, a breach was reported beneath the retaining wall, which was just erected. A tunnel is also located beneath the canal that is used by pedestrians. The discharge from the dam was stopped in the early hours, and officials of the Public Works Department (PWD) dumped earth and attempted to plug the breach with the help of earthmovers. As a precaution, people of Malaipalayam, Karaikadu and Varavankadu were moved to safe locations in the morning. At 10.30 a.m., a breach occurred again, bringing the wall down, and water entered the villages and the farmlands, leading to the inundation of houses and paddy crops and sugarcane. Several heads of cattle were washed away. Since people were evacuated in the morning, no loss of lives was reported, but three houses were damaged. Though the discharge was stopped in the canal, water flow continued for five hours, and revenue officials and Fire and Rescue Services personnel carried out relief work. Collector H. Krishnanunni, along with SP V. Sasi Mohan, inspected the canal, where work is on to plug the breach. He said 64 houses and farmland had been affected. Perundurai MLA S. Jeyakumar also inspected the restoration work. Officials distributed food packets and other relief. Minister for Housing and Rural Development S.

21 August 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Residents worry over increase in street dog population||With the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme for street dogs remaining suspended for long in the Corporation limits, residents and shopkeepers in the city are worried over the increase in the number of dogs. The civic body along with a social organisation started the ABC programme at its facility in Solar in 2010 to control dog population. The programme involves catching dogs, sterilising and vaccinating them and returning them in the areas from where they were caught. A separate shelter home with operation theatre, pre-and-post operative wards was constructed at Solar for the purpose. But the programme was halted within a few months. Residents in the city limits said they were scared to venture out on roads due to the increase in the number of dogs. “They not only chase people, but also pose a threat to life,” said M. Kannan of Nadarmedu. Many dogs could be seen fighting among themselves near shops and in residential areas forcing residents to take alternative routes. “The problem needs immediate attention,” said V. Pushpa of Surampatti. Residents in Karungalpalayam, Nadarmedu and Veerappanchatiram said that despite complaining to the civic body, no action was taken so far. Corporation Commissioner M. Elangovan told The Hindu that a tender would soon be floated calling for an NGO or an organisation to run the programme at its facility in Solar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-worry-over-increase-in-street-dog-population/article36026993.ece
21 August 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Plea to stop outsourcing workers in government hospitals||Members of the Erode District Headquarters Hospital Outsourcing Workers’ Association have urged the State government to stop outsourcing workers in hospitals and instead recruit them directly. ‘No wage hike’  Over 150 workers including housekeepers, security men, data entry operators, electrician, plumbers and other non-medical staff, working in the hospital on contract basis took part in a meeting held here recently. The members alleged that they were working for the last four years without wage hike and weekly off. They were also not paid double-wages for working on national holidays, they added. Mr. Chinnasamy, president, Erode District Medical Department Workers’ Association, said the outsourced workers were denied all the benefits that they were entitled to. Hike in wages and weekly leave are the basic rights of workers and it should not be denied to them, he said. The members said that all the non-medical staff in hospitals were recruited by private contractors for a fixed wage. However, they were not given the minimum wage.

21 August 2021||HOSUR,TAMIL NADU||DMDK stages protest against Mekadatu dam||The proposed dam at Mekadatu in Karnataka will divide people of the two States. The Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) will not allow people to be divided by a conflict over water, said party treasurer Premalatha Vijayakant here on Friday while leading a protest against Karnataka’s reservoir project. Staging the protest in Hosur that borders Karnataka, Ms. Premalatha, clad in green, arrived on a mini tractor in a symbolic solidarity with the farmers who opposed the dam proposal. The DMDK leader said there were many people in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka who spoke different languages.  The dam project should be dropped in the interest of amity among these people in both the States. A dam at Mekadatu would turn Tamil Nadu into a desert, and the State was already reeling under a water crisis. The entire Delta region would suffer from the consequences of Karnataka’s actions, she said. Ms. Premalatha called upon the Prime Minister to interlink rivers, in order to ensure that “the country did not get divided over water wars”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmdk-stages-protest-against-mekadatu-dam/article36026987.ece

Venkatesan, Madurai MP, has thanked Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw for ordering restoration of passenger train services. In a statement, Mr. Venkatesan said that in a memorandum he had submitted to the minister, along with North Chennai MP Kalanidhi Veerasamy, it was pointed out that suspension of passenger train services had badly affected the lower and middle class “Now, the Railway Board has asked all zonal railways to take steps for restoration of DEMU/MEMU and conventional passenger trains and has asked them to send the proposed timetable by August 16,” the Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP said. Stating that the timetable for operation of passenger trains have been already sent by all the divisions to the Railway Board, Mr. Venkatesan said that soon passengers train services would resume across the country. Since passenger trains stop at all wayside stations, they transport a large number of people to nearby towns where they could sell their farm produce. People also travel for education and employment. “The rural people were benefited by the season tickets used in passenger trains,” he said. The passenger train services will help in maintaining social distancing due to distribution of passengers in different modes of transportation, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mp-hails-resumption-of-passenger-train-services/article36026974.ece
21 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC sets at liberty woman who wants to live with transman partner||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has set at liberty a woman who was willing to go with her companion, a transman. The family of the woman had opposed the relationship and forcibly separated them. A Division Bench of Justices V. Bharathidasan and J. Nisha Banu took note of the fact that the couple were in a relationship for more than three years. The woman was aware of the fact that her partner was a transman. The petitioner and the woman entered into a relationship, which is both protected and permitted under the Constitution. The woman wanted to live with her partner and left her parents to lead a life of her own. After the woman’s family separated them, the transman moved the High Court. In the habeas corpus petition, the petitioner said they met in 2018 and in due course entered into a relationship. Detained by family However, the family members of the 23-year-old woman, along with a few police officers, separated them, and she was detained against her wish by her family members. The transman sought a direction to produce the woman before the court and set her at liberty. During the course of the hearing, the court inquired with the parties involved. Taking into account the fact the woman was a major and was willing to go with the petitioner on her own volition, the court set her at liberty and permitted her to go with the petitioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/court-sets-at-liberty-woman-who-wants-to-live-with-transman-partner/article36026858.ece

These structures had been put up using sand bags by farmers . A Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and K. Murali Shankar, however, gave liberty to the private parties to give a fresh representation to the PWD officials for putting up check dams solely for irrigation purposes. In his petition, R. Anbalagan of Madurai said that three unauthorised check dams had been constructed on Ootukalvai, a feeder channel of Paralikanmoi in Parali village. He sought a direction to the PWD authorities to remove them and restore the channel to its original width. Encroachments on the channel must also be removed to facilitate free flow of water, he said. In the status report, PWD officials said that the three check dams were put up using sand bags by farmers without obtaining permission. They were irrigating their land in this fashion for the past 50 years.

21 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||A visible change through ‘opening-up’||Till six months ago, 12-year-old Anitha (name changed) was a child suffering from low self-esteem. She wouldn’t mingle with anybody when she attended regular school before COVID-19 struck, and the lockdown only worsened the communication skills of the pre-teen. Luckily, she joined Project Green Slate, an initiative of the NGO Yellow Bag Foundation (YBF), which began conducting multiple intelligence (MI) training for children in the city’s slum areas in February this year. Attending three-hour weekly sessions of ‘opening-up’ have ushered in a visible transformation in Anitha. Encouraging results Her facilitator, Ambika Badri, and peers at the Mathichiyam centre, are amazed to see the shy and reluctant girl now discovering herself through singing, drawing, and sometimes even few steps of hip-hop and jump! There are 45 more children from low-income settlements along the banks of the Vaigai, who have been attending these sessions based on the worldwide MI framework. “Results so far have been encouraging,” said social entrepreneur and YBF co-founder Krishnan Subramanian, “in a no-school year for the children from less-privileged families”. Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner theorises that people are blessed with more than intellectual capacity and outlines eight kinds of intelligences in every individual — musical, spatial-visual, verbal, logical, naturalistic, kinesthetic, inter-and intra-personal intelligences — which when identified and tapped yield improved performance in other spheres, including academics. The idea of MI training struck Mr. Krishnan Subramanian when he saw the children of his tailoring unit staff stitching masks during lockdown 1.0. “Most women brought their children to work, and observing them, I felt these kids have only been attending local government and corporation schools to mug up text and did not get any opportunity to learn special skills at a young age,” he said. “Providing them with the right environment and engaging them in activities that would help them identify their strengths and talent is our aim,” he added. The pilot project was launched in two phases, first for children aged between five to eight, and now for those aged 10-12. Mapping skills “The smiles are back on their faces, and the children enjoy learning their way,” said Ambika. For example, when a child is taught alphabets, some may like to write them down, some enjoy singing aloud, some identify them with the names of animals. Whatever combination of learning happens, it indicates the child’s latent abilities. “Mapping a child’s skills and interpreting their strength is important,” said Mr. Krishnan Subramanian, who wishes to scale up the free programme for another 200 children, but for the lack of volunteers now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-visible-change-through-opening-up/article36026838.ece

The ramming of the mechanised boat into the fibreglass boat had resulted in grievous injuries to three occupants. Fishers of Vanagiri had retaliated by setting on fire four fibreglass boats belonging to their counterparts in Poompuhar.

After the mid-sea skirmish, Collector R. Lalitha had delivered a firm message to owners of mechanised boats that use of purse seine nets would never be permitted in compliance with the High Court directive. The police have strengthened their presence in some of the fishing villages to prevent further escalation of law and order problem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mechanised-vessel-used-for-ramming-boat-seized/article36026973.ece

21 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Art-based biota interpretation centre to be re-opened||The art-themed biota interpretation centre of the Forest Department will shortly be opened for children. Though it was formally inaugurated in October last, it largely remained out of bounds for visitors due to the pandemic. Billed as the country’s first art-based interpretation centre of its kind, the Forest Department facility adjacent to the deer park replicates the characteristics of the Oussudu Lake’s ecosystem and showcases avifauna through a mix of artistic landscaping, three-dimensional modelling, paintings and stone sculptures. The plan is to open the place to schoolchildren in a regulated manner and in compliance with COVID-19 protocols, especially as visits are quite likely to turn into family outings with schools continuing to remain closed. “We propose to restrict visitors to about 30 in an hour by splitting them into two batches,” said Vanjulavalli Karthik, Deputy Conservator of Forests. The place offers a study tour of the region’s exciting floral and faunal diversity. The stone sculpture at the entry point captures all the four State symbols of Puducherry — the Asian Koel, the Indian Palm Squirrel, the Cannon Ball Flower and the Vilva Tree. Apart from single stone carvings of the Indian chameleon, Russel viper and fan-throated lizard or the fibre sculpture of the greater flamingo to herald visitors, the landscaping features paintings on Kadappa stone (black limestone) highlighting species such as the brahminy kite, painted stork, purple swamphen and the pheasant tailed jacana. A highlight is the special gel replica of the Oussudu Lake, which has been documented as one of the important wetlands of Asia by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. The centre has come up at an estimated cost of about Rs. 1 crore that includes a Central grant of Rs. 86 lakh under the National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco System.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/art-based-biota-interpretation-centre-to-be-re-opened/article36026891.ece
21 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Telangana EVMs reach Puducherry||Around 2,000 electronic voting machines belonging to the State Election Commission of Telangana have reached Puducherry for the local body polls in the Union Territory. The EVMs were brought here in two trucks on Thursday and kept in strong rooms at the Bharathidasan Government College for Women. The machines would be under the surveillance of CCTV cameras, a source in the State Election Commission (SEC) of Puducherry told The Hindu . The District Electoral Office here is coordinating with the SEC of Karnataka to bring in another 1,300 machines. The machines would be brought in a few days, the source said. The SEC decided to get EVMs from other States as the number of machines under the possession of the Puducherry Election Commission was found inadequate to conduct the civic body elections. The EC here had only about 1,100 machines at its disposal as each voter in the local body polls will have to cast two votes for municipality elections and three at the panchayat level. The SEC two weeks ago identified the number of reserved seats meant for SCs, SC (women), women (general category) and the backward classes. On August 13, the Commission conducted a draw of lots to identify the number of reserved seats for Other Backwards Castes and Scheduled Tribes. “The notification announcing the number of reserved seats is likely to be issued on Monday. So, the final number of reserved seats for all categories will be known only after the issue of notification,” the source said. As of now, of the total 1,159 seats, 931 are reserved at various levels. On complaints raised by the representatives about the delimitation exercise on the occasion of draw of lots, the source said the Commission had nothing to do with the delimitation. As per the SC directive, the SEC has to complete the local body polls before October 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/telangana-evms-reach-puducherry/article36027282.ece

Pal Market is an important business locality and the road is used by motorists from the District Collectorate to reach Leigh Bazaar, Three Roads junction, Meyannur and farther places.  The entire stretch, measuring less than 200 metres, leading to the Pal Market bridge is ridden with potholes. While one half of the road is used by trucks to offloadgoods at the market, vehicles move at snail’s pace on the other half due to the poor condition of the road. The slow moving traffic leads to congestion during peak hours. N.Gopal, a motorist who uses the road frequently, said that truckers use the road as it provides easy access towards the Bengaluru National Highway through Three Roads junction. If the road is not repaired, the trucks will have to move through the city, he added. Salem Corporation officials said that a proposal to repair the road has been sanctioned and works would begin in a week. The road would be re-laid under the Integrated Urban Development Mission and the works would be carried out at night as the market would be busy during the day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/traders-motorists-seek-steps-to-repair-pal-market-road/article36026999.ece

21 August 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||‘Shortage’ of fertilizers||Farmers have alleged that the prospects of a good harvest of `kuruvai’ and cultivation of `samba’ and `thaladi’ could be affected due to a shortage in fertilizer supply that has cropped up during this crucial hour. With the lifting of shutters of the Stanley Reservoir at Mettur on the scheduled date of June 12 this year also, the Delta farmers took up `kuruvai’ cultivation on about 3.50 lakh acres in this region as anticipated by the State government. However, the non-availability of fertilizers in several parts of the Delta region when the farmers required it has caused concern among them. According to N.V.Kannan, Thanjavur district secretary, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, affiliated to the CPI(M), farmers in Budalur region have found themselves trapped in a tricky situation where they were unable to carry out spraying of urea and other fertilizers on time to get the desired harvest.  Talking to reporters at Thiruthuraipoondi on Friday, G.Ramakrishnan, former State Secretary, CPI(M), said that `kuruvai’ cultivation had been bogged down by the non-availability of water and fertilizers. Meanwhile, official sources said efforts had been initiated to ensure the availability of fertilizers by pointing out the arrival of goods train with urea bags from Karaikal to Thanjavur on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/shortage-of-fertilizers/article36026965.ece
21 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,TAMIL NADU||Rs. 3.2 crore-aid for children who lost parents to COVID||The State government has sanctioned Rs. 3.2 crore as financial assistance for 87 children who have lost their parents/guardians to COVID-19. In a statement here on Friday, Minister for Women and Child Development Veena George said that funds for a Rs. 3-lakh fixed deposit and a monthly payment of Rs. 2,000 till the time the children turned 18 had been sanctioned. Besides this, education expenses till the children graduated would be met from the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund. Ms. George said Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) personnel had conducted house visits and collected the children’s details. District report The district child protection units had then reviewed each child’s situation and submitted a report to the child welfare committee (CWC) concerned. On the basis of the report, steps for the welfare of each child had been taken. The government, she said, had issued an order stipulating the guidelines for sanctioning the financial assistance. Children who had lost both parents to COVID-19, those whose parents had become COVID negative but had died owing to related health problems within three months, those who had lost one parent earlier, and had lost the remaining parent to COVID-19, children who had been abandoned by one parent and had lost the remaining parent to the disease, those whose parents had died or abandoned them and who were living with relatives but their guardians had succumbed to COVID-19 would be given assistance without considering the family’s income limit or other guidelines. Families receiving the family pension for government servants will not be considered for assistance, nor if the current guardians of the child inform in writing that they do not want the assistance. However, they could rejoin the scheme before the children turned 18 and receive the assistance for the remaining period. Withdraw period Children eligible for the government support will be able to withdraw the one-time assistance of Rs. 3 lakh after they turn 18, but can withdraw the interest anytime they require it. The assistance of Rs. 2,000 a month can be deposited in the bank account of the child and the current guardian.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rs-32-crore-aid-for-children-who-lost-parents-to-covid/article36026670.ece
21 August 2021||Thoothukudi,TAMIL NADU||Team formed to nab two policemen for attacking meat shop owner||Special teams have been formed to nab two policemen who allegedly assaulted a meat shop owner and inflicted multiple injuries on him with knife and broken liquor bottle after the meat seller informed higher-ups about a chicken being stolen from his shop by the policemen. Police said policemen Balakrishnan and Sathish, both attached to Kaadalkudi police station, called meat shop owner N. Muthuselvan, 33, of Vadakku Vedapatti over the phone on August 16 midnight and asked him to give them one kilogram of chicken. Mr. Muthuselvan’s wife Jaya, who attended the call, told the policemen that her husband was fast asleep. Even though the policemen called him continuously over the phone, he did not attend the call. When Mr. Muthuselvan went to his shop on August 17 morning, policemen Balakrishnan and Sathish asked him if the number of chicken was intact. Upon counting the chicken, Mr. Muthuselvan understood that the policemen had stolen a chicken. The matter was taken-up with Superintendent of Police S. Jayakumar, who after confirming the theft, shifted the two erring policemen to the Armed Reserve Police unit. Angered by this, Balakrishnan and Sathish allegedly attacked Mr. Muthuselvan with knife and broken liquor bottle. The duo also attacked other traders when they came to his aid. Mr. Muthuselvan was admitted to the Vilathikulam Government Hospital. The Kaadalkudi police registered case against Balakrishnan and Sathish under Sections 294 (b) (reciting or uttering obscene words), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 506 (ii) (criminal intimidation) . Sources also said that three policemen in Kovilpatti took six accused to an eatery near Kovilpatti Old Municipality building on Wednesday night. After having dinner, the policemen left without paying the bill. When the owner asked the policemen to pay the bill, he was silenced with the warning that he would not be allowed to keep his eatery open after 9 p.m. as the lockdown was in force. In another incident, an owner of an eatery on Maathaankovil Street was threatened by two policemen couple of months ago after the old man told them that there was nothing to be served as they had come late in the night. “Both the incidents were being probed,” said sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/team-formed-to-nab-two-policemen-in-assault-case/article36026894.ece

21 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||16 Sri Lankan Tamils housed in Tiruchi Special Camp hospitalised||Sixteen Sri Lankan Tamils housed in the Special Camp functioning near the Central Prison complex were admitted to the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital on Friday after they claimed to have consumed sleeping pills apparently to end their lives in support of their demands. One of them is said to have slashed himself with a sharp weapon, said police sources. The inmates wanted the release of those against whom cases were completed and expedite arrangements for their return to their nation. They also wanted the authorities to allow all those against whom cases were pending to reside with their respective families staying outside and attend court proceedings from there instead of being lodged in the camp. This is the second incident to be reported in the camp in a span of two days. On Wednesday 16 Sri Lankan Tamils attempted to end their lives prompting the intervention of the Collector. They were all admitted to the government hospital. Police sources said the total number of inmates undergoing treatment at the hospital was now 32. The Special Camp houses over 100 inmates of which Sri Lankan Tamils account for majority. There are three women inmates - a Nigerian and two Sri Lankan Tamils. Cash dole is given by the government every month to the inmates who were not being treated as prisoners, say officials.

21 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Govt. school students trained in IT skills||Eighty five government school students hailing from poor background in neighbouring Perambalur district have received hands-on training in information technology skills, thanks to an initiative of the Institute for Entrepreneurship and Career Development (IECD) of the Bharathidasan University. All the students, including 45 girls, who had successfully cleared certificate programmes in different cyber courses under this initiative are from the Panchayat Union Middle School at remote Kothavasal village. Reading materials for the students and software required for conducting the courses were supplied free of cost by the IECD under the Institutional Social Responsibility initiative in this 'face-to-face' learning programme that was conducted for a period of 10 months from June 2019 to March 2020. The Kothavasal panchayat union middle school is the first government school in the central region to have been selected by the IECD for imparting theoretical and practical IT skills for students hailing from very poor background, E. Ramganesh, Director, IECD, Bharathidasan University told 'The Hindu' on Friday. The computer courses were devised by the IECD for boys and girls from class V to VIII. The school was identified by the IECD as it was equipped with a cyber lab with 25 computer terminals and internet facility, thanks to contribution from donors, and also with a view to reaching out to a government school functioning in a remote area, said Dr. Ramganesh. All the 85 students had voluntarily come forward and enrolled themselves for separate IT-related cyber courses meant for each standard. The certificate course for standard V students was on computing skills, while it was on office automation for class VI students. Graphic Design course was meant for class VII students and web design for class VIII students. The IECD had teamed up with a private trust and the computer teacher of the school in imparting theoretical and hands-on training for the students at the school campus. "This is a maiden effort of the IECD in imparting IT skills exclusively for government school students hailing from poor background to help in shaping their academic career", says Dr. Ramganesh. The programme was organised as government school students in remote areas seldom have access and the facility to undergo cyber courses and IT skills, he said. The toppers in each programme conducted in 2019-20 would be honoured during the passing out ceremony scheduled on August 25 at the University's Khajamalai campus in the city, said Dr. Ramganesh. In another step towards reaching out to students especially those in the tribal areas, the IECD would soon procure a passenger vehicle and convert it into a mobile cyber lab by equipping it with 25 laptops along with accessories and internet facility. The Executive Council of the IECD, in which the University Vice-Chancellor is the chairperson, had approved the mobile cyber lab. The vehicle along with tutors would visit remote schools and hold weekly classes on cyber courses for students from Class V to IX, said Dr. Ramganesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-school-students-trained-in-it-skills/article36026957.ece
21 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Future proprietors sensitised to government schemes||Prospective entrepreneurs gained insights into Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme, Unemployed Youth Employment Generation Programme, New Enterprise-cum-Entrepreneurship Development Scheme, and guidelines of New MSME Policy 2021, during the World Entrepreneurs Day celebration at Bharathidasan University earlier this week. The day-long online event conducted by the university's Centre for Entrepreneurship and Skill Development, Department of Commerce and Financial Studies, included special lecture, debate and quiz competitions. Detailing the policies and schemes that provide financial assistance for entrepreneurs at the career counselling camp on the occasion, G. Raveendran, General Manager, District Industries Centre, Tiruchi, urged future entrepreneurs to imbibe the traits of courage, perseverance and hard work to succeed in their ventures. Vice-Chancellor M. Selvam said in his inaugural address that a career in entrepreneurship signifies independence. The Outcome Based Education System promotes student’s skills, creativity and innovation. Skill Acquisition with Nuanced Knowledge Ascendence for Lasting Progress (SANKALP) should be the prime determination of the students for achieving success, the Vice-Chancellor stressed. C. Ramaswamy Desai, Consultant, C.R. Business Solutions, trained the participants on identifying and preparing business proposals. Conversion of business ideas into business strategies, selecting the successful business option, and preparation of project report constituted components of his presentation. M. Selvam, Coordinator, Entrepreneurship and Skill Development, Department of Commerce and Financial Studies, said the takeaways of the event were insights into career opportunities and importance of entrepreneurship imbibed in patriotism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/future-proprietors-sensitised-to-government-schemes/article36026972.ece
21 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Private schools cautioned against denying TCs of students||Against the backdrop of students exiting self-financed schools due to tough economic conditions caused by the pandemic, the Department of School Education has been pushed into walking a tightrope in balancing the compulsions of cash-strapped managements of private institutions and anxiety of the financially-battered parents to shift their wards to government schools. The department has, more than once, cautioned private schools against denying transfer certificates of students intending to enrol themselves in government schools. The officials, no doubt, have to follow the order in letter and spirit. "Acting on complaints, the officials call up the private schools and instruct them to comply with the government instruction, knowing full well that the some of the schools that are on the verge of closing down due to decline in enrolment," a representative of the management of a private school in Tiruchi said. "Nevertheless, on their part, parents of students enrolled in higher levels in private schools find the going tough in making the managements relent to their requests, notwithstanding intervention by officials" a teacher in a government school in Musiri educational district said. Striking a middle ground, the parents end up paying a portion of the fee to secure the Transfer Certificate. This factor, he said, is more prevalent in sub-urban areas where parents settled in villages find it easier to shift their wards to government schools. As for students till class VIII, the heads of government schools do not insist on submission of transfer certificates for enrolling students from private institutions. "There are instances of heads of primary and upper primary panchayat union schools sourcing the data from the EMIS (Education Management Information System) and fulfilling admission formalities. The onus has been placed on the headmasters of government schools to secure the transfer certificates of the newly-admitted students from the private institutions," a senior teacher of a panchayat union school in Manikandam block said. "The current status is still hazy. There is a paradoxical situation of the government emphasising on private schools admitting students from poor socio-economic background to the extent of 25 percent at the entry level under Right to Education Act on the one hand, and welcoming students from the private schools who also gravitate to government schools due to the poor economic condition of their families on the other," a headmaster of a government school said, acknowledging that it does make sense for parents to shift their wards to government schools to be eligible for the freebies on which there is substantial Budgetary allocation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/private-schools-cautioned-against-denying-tcs-of-students/article36026971.ece

21 August 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||‘Steps will be taken to build mechanised boats in T.N.’||Steps will be taken to construct subsidised tuna liner steel mechanised boats in Tamil Nadu instead of relying upon Kochi-based boatyards for building these vessels used for multi-day deep sea stay fishing, Union Minister of State for Fisheries L. Murugan has said. Speaking to reporters after inaugurating Tirunelveli MLA’s office along with BJP State president K. Annamalai at Exhibition Grounds on Friday, Mr. Murugan said the Narendra Modi-led BJP Government at the Centre and the State Governments were sharing 80% subsidy being given for the mechanised steel boats used for multi-day deep sea stay fishing. Since the Tamil Nadu fishermen, who were selected for this scheme, had to rely on the Kochi-based boat yards for constructing these boats, it was causing additional expenses to the beneficiaries. Hence, his ministry would take steps for creating infrastructure facilities in Tamil Nadu itself for constructing these tuna liner steel mechanised boats. When asked about the number of boats sanctioned for Tamil Nadu during this fiscal under this scheme, Mr. Murugan said it would be announced shortly. The Minister said the BJP cadres would dispel the misconceptions over the ‘Fisheries Bill 2021’ as wrong information was being propagated with the objective of tarnishing the image of the Union Government, which had allotted Rs. 20,000 crore for the fishermen’s welfare during the current financial year. The Bill, which was being discussed at various levels and with the fishermen, the stakeholders, before being tabled in the Parliament, would be a “boon for the fishermen” in protecting their interests. Mr. Murugan expressed satisfaction over the performance of four BJP MLAs in Tamil Nadu Assembly. “Even as a few were claiming that the BJP would never find a place in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, we have got four MLAs, who are performing exceedingly well in the Assembly and effectively playing the role of Opposition MLAs,” he added. When asked about the inordinate delay in taking a decision on giving on lease the Chengalpet-based Integrated Vaccine Complex to Tamil Nadu Government for vaccine production, Mr. Murugan did not reply. Mr. Annamalai said the DMK’s 100-days had given “mixed feeling” to everyone. “While the State Government has to maintain cordial rapport with the Union Government for the benefit of Tamil Nadu, it is arresting our party cadres on measly reasons and attempting to foist cases against its political rivals, especially against the AIADMK leaders. Instead, the Tamil Nadu Government should focus on the development of the State by ensuring good relationship with the Centre,” Mr. Annamalai said. Later, Mr. Murugan and Mr. Annamalai garlanded the statue of freedom fighter Ondiveeran at the memorial opposite the District Court Complex on the occasion of his 250th death anniversary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/steps-will-be-taken-to-build-mechanised-boats-in-tn/article36026979.ece

Appreciating the ongoing research on nutritional and medicinal values and climate and disease-resistant capabilities of indigenous paddy varieties, he called upon educational institutions to take up such research on a regular basis. Mr. Duraisingam also appealed to Krishi Vigyan Kendras to allot a portion of agriculture fields on their premises for traditional paddy varieties that could serve as a knowledge hub on traditional paddy varieties. Commenting on the Centre’s plan to distribute fortified rice through PDS as a remedy to fight anaemia and malnutrition, he warned that it would be a great threat to diversity and genuine food security. A resolution urging the State government to provide meals made with unpolished traditional rice varieties through ICDS programme and distribute them through the PDS was also passed at the Seed Festival held as part of the National Paddy Festival. Expressing concern over reports of release of new improved varieties of mappillai samba and karuppu kouni by scientists of Agriculture University for diabetic patients, Mr. Duraisingam said that already the two traditional paddy varieties were known for their medicinal properties, especially their ability to control glucose level in blood.Any attempt to ‘improve’ by applying cross-bred technique and giving the traditional paddy name to such newfound varieties would only hamper the efforts put in to revive the traditional paddy varieties so far. Participating in the festival, Tamizhaga Cauvery Vivasayigal Sangam president P.R. Pandian appreciated the efforts of the State government for presenting a separate budget for agriculture and allocation of funds for strengthening organic agriculture practices. He also welcomed the announcement of setting up of a research centre for organic farming in the name of late G.Nammazhvar and a traditional paddy seed conservation centre for promotion of traditional varieties in the name of late Nel Jayaraman. Viswakantha Kanna, District Development Manager, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, highlighted the need for farmers to come together and initiate collective action in identifying the consumer-oriented production, value addition, certification and marketing of organic products to overcome the challenges in marketing. Pootchi Selvam, Assistant Professor, Thuvakkudi Irrigation Management and Training Institution, spoke about the differences between pest and predators and how the ecological agriculture practices helped in increasing the predator population and, thereby, facilitating the natural pest management process. Tiruvarur Rotary Club president Thiyagapaari inaugurated a food festival of recipes made using traditional paddy varieties to create awareness among consumers. CREATE, which has been spearheading the Nel Thiruvizha in Tamil Nadu since 2006, has organised the festival as district-level events during the last two years in view of the COVID-19 pandemic situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/speakers-call-for-sustained-research-at-paddy-festival/article36026963.ece
21 August 2021||Tiruvarur,TAMIL NADU||Number of rural roads laid to cross 400 mark||The total number of rural roads in Tiruvarur district laid under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana is all set to cross the 400 mark soon. The objective of the PMGSY, launched as a 100 per cent Centrally sponsored scheme in December 2000, was to provide all weather-road access to unconnected habitations having a population of 500 persons and above by utilising the cess levied by the Union government on the high-speed diesel. Under PMGSY-I scheme during 10 financial years ending with 2018-19, a total of 293 roads with 27 long-span bridges (LSB) were laid for a distance of 602.81 kilometres at a cost of Rs. 324.59 crore in the district. Subsequently, under the PMGSY-II scheme implemented on the Cost Sharing Basis during the financial years 2017-18 and 2018-19, Rs. 207.27 crore was spent to lay 73 roads with 11 LSBs covering a distance of 222.02 kilometres. Now, with the Central government launching the PMGSY-III in 2019-20, another 38 rural roads would be laid for a distance of 134.27 kilometres at a cost of Rs. 105.04 crore, according to official sources. In Thanjavur district, 302 roads with 2 LSBs were laid covering a length of 563.45 km at a cost of Rs. 138.06 crore under the PMGSY-I and 22 roads were laid for a total distance of 87.89 kilometres by spending Rs. 45.88 crore under the PMGSY-II scheme. It was proposed to lay 19 roads under PMGSY-III scheme covering a distance of 71.27 kilometres at a cost of Rs. 36.97 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/number-of-rural-roads-laid-to-cross-400-mark/article36026964.ece
21 August 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Trees near Gudalur bus stand at risk of being axed||Two of the largest trees in Gudalur town are at risk of being cut down, if permissions are granted for the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) to axe them for expansion of the Gudalur bus stand. Plans to expand the bus stand were approved last year, with the modernisation set to increase its capacity. Part of the plans involved expanding the bus stand by more than 50 % of its existing area. To continue with the expansion plans, the TNSTC had applied to the Revenue Department to cut down two Albizia lebbeck trees. Both trees are said to be over 40-feet in height, with girths of 10 and 20 feet each. The two trees are among the tallest located within the town limits. R. Mary Justin, who runs a grocery in Gudalur, said the trees provided much needed shade for waiting passengers during summer and monsoon. “The tree has been an ever-present part of the town for as long as I can remember, and it would be a shame if it is cut down,” she said. A few florists and tea shop owners also use the shade of the tree to set up their stalls. “While the expansion of the bus stand is important for development, we hope that the TNSTC thinks of alternatives to chopping down the two trees, which residents claim are more than a hundred years old,” said S. Sivasubramaniam, general secretary of the Gudalur Center for Consumer Protection. When contacted, a senior revenue official said permission had not been granted to cut down the trees. “The request has been sent to the district committee overseeing permissions for tree felling,” said the official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/trees-near-gudalur-bus-stand-at-risk-of-being-axed/article36026883.ece

21 August 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Officials asked to analyse reasons for children dropping out of schools||Officials of the Department of Education have been asked to analyse the specific reasons for dropout of students from schools during the survey on “out of school children (OSC)” and stem them at the earliest. During a review of the OSC survey to be undertaken in the district, Virudhunagar Collector J. Meghanath Reddy, on Thursday said that respective heads of schools, block educational officer, block resource supervisors should review the reasons and find solutions to stop school dropouts. The officials should keep a tab on children who migrate frequently and also on children from nomadic communities and ensure that they are back in schools. “All children in the school-going age should be admitted in schools,” the Collector said. The officials should ensure that no residential area in the district is missed during the OSC survey. All teachers should visit the residential areas around their school to take up the survey. “If any area is found to have contributed to higher number of dropouts, the teachers should seek the help of officials of other departments in the survey,” he added. The teachers should identify the students who have not so far received textbooks and visit them and hand over the books to them in order to bring them back to school. Besides officials of School Education Department, officials of District Child Protection Unit, Labour Department, Inspector of Factories, Integrated Child Development Scheme, Police, Health and Family Welfare, non-Governmental organisations were present at the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/officials-asked-to-analyse-reasons-for-children-dropping-out-of-schools/article36026976.ece
21 August 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Man hacked to death||Vice-president of Vachchakarapatti panchayat P. Anantharaman (45) was hacked to death by a four-member gang at Poosaripatti near here on Friday morning. The police have picked up three persons, suspected to have been involved in the murder. “Former president of the panchayat, Lakshmanan, was killed in a road accident, in which the family members had suspected the role of Anantharaman and have murdered him in revenge,” Superintendent of Police M. Manohar, said. The police said that Anantharaman of Thadangam had gone to neighbouring village, Poosaripatti, to attend the marriage of his employee, Gurusamy. After attending the ceremony, as he was walking towards his car, unidentified armed men attacked him with sharp weapons and Anantharaman was killed on the spot. Madurai Deputy Inspector General of Police, N. Kamini, and Superintendent of Police, M. Manohar, inspected the spot. Initially, the police suspected that enmity over local body election could have led to the murder. However, the police seized an abandoned motorbike from the scene of crime. They identified that the vehicle belonged to Lakshmanan’s son, Dinesh. Meanwhile, the police picked up Lakshmanan’s brother, Mariappan and two of his nephews, identified as Vijayapandi and Muthurakku. “The police had then arrested one Abdul Kader in connection with the hit-and-run accident in which Lakshmanan was killed. However, since Abdul Kader had been the acting driver for Anantharaman, Lakshmanan’s family suspected that he (Anantharaman) had his hand in the accident and had nurtured enmity,” Mr. Manohar said. “The role of Dinesh is yet to be ascertained,” the SP said. Anantharaman, who was previously president of the same panchayat for two terms, became its vice-president after the post of Panchayat president was reserved. His body was handed over to the family members after post-mortem.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/panchayat-vice-president-hacked-to-death/article36026863.ece

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Government services made business friendly||For example, the GCC, in a recent circular to its officers, specifically mentioned that “while issuing approvals for all types of applications [building permits, planning permissions or demolitions] altogether, the time period of 30 days shall not be violated without any valid reason”. In the case of the remaining municipal corporations and municipalities, an “urban tree information system” has been launched, covering 29 services online, for the benefit of citizens across all urban local bodies, with the objective of ensuring “a citizen-friendly, participatory, transparent and accountable government”. As for the Registration Department, the portal,https://tnreginet.gov.in/po rtal/, can be accessed for downloading encumbrance certificates for free. If anyone requires a certified copy, he can get it in three days by e-mail ordinarily, said an official, adding that his Department was making efforts to see to it that holidays and high-transaction days do not come in the way of providing service within the prescribed time. The Industries Department, in the two orders, eliminated the permissible time limit for the provision of certain services by several Departments to business enterprises and prescribed many more new services. For instance, the renewal of factories licence from the Directorate of Industrial Safety and Health will be issued automatically and instantly, online, on payment of the requisite fee, instead of the earlier arrangement of a waiting period of seven days. A similar arrangement has been made in the case of licence renewal for manufacturers from the Labour Department. A senior official of the Industries Department said the orders had brought in six more Departments under the ambit of the Business Facilitation Act — Geology and Mining, Water Resources, Public Works, Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services, the Commissionerate of Transport and School Education. So far, 24 Departments have been covered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/government-services-made-business-friendly/article36026856.ece

He said the DMK government would be transparent in its functioning, and all information relating to the Department of Electricity was being made available online.  He said the AIADMK regime had not undertaken any maintenance work at the power stations in the last nine months of its tenure. “In fact, the officers here [NCTPS] told me that no equipment for maintenance had been purchased in the last three years.” He said the Department had identified transformers that had issues of high or low voltage in all 234 constituencies. “We have started the work to replace 8,900 transformers that have such issues at a cost of Rs. 625 crore. The work will be completed in three months.” Mr. Senthilbalaji said the customer care cell, ‘Minnagam’, had received 2.48 lakh complaints, of which 2.36 had been resolved. The rest were being processed. AIADMK leader and former Electricity Minister P. Thangamani said the irregularity was detected during his tenure itself. He told journalists at Pallipalayam in Namakkal that Mr. Senthilbalaji had only stated what was identified during the previous regime. He said he had sent officers for an inspection at the plant after he was doubtful about coal stock. He said Mr. Senthilbalaji had deliberately used that report to show the AIADMK government in a bad light. But he did not wish to go deeper into the issue as the Minister “has not mentioned any name”. He would welcome any action and cooperate if action was taken in a “just manner”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/238-lakh-tonnes-of-coal-missing/article36026847.ece

21 August 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||BCC polls: New system enthuses some, leaves others worried||The decision of parties to fight the Belagavi City Corporation (BCC) polls on party tickets, has led to excitement and worry in some groups. Cadre members of the BJP and Congress are excited because the polls are being fought on party lines for the first time. However, some leaders and former members are worried about the development. Some leaders like Ramesh Sontakki have been a member for more than one term. It is no secret that the BCC polls were fought among groups of Kannada, Marathi and Urdu groups. ‘New challenge’ “We have always fought as Independents. We have never known party affiliation. We have also ran the urban local body in a non-partisan manner. Now, suddenly, we are faced with a situation where we are constrained to join a party and seek its symbol. This is a new challenge for us,” he said. He admits however, that more than one party has spoken to him, offering him tickets. Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti leader Maloji Ashtekar argues that they have always fought the polls on party lines. “Other candidates have always won after party campaigns. The polls may have been independent for others, but not for us,” he said. He maintains that other parties using symbols will not affect the prospects of the MES. Decision welcomed Kannada organisations have welcomed the decision of parties to fight on tickets. “We have taken a stand that we will not support any party completely. In each ward, we will support candidates who are either fielded by the MES or who support its ideology,” said Ashok Chandaragi, convenor of the action committee of Kannada organisations in the district. “In ward A, we will support the Congress if the Congress there can defeat pro MES candidates, in ward B, we will support the B and in ward C, if the JD(S) can defeat the MES, we will support the JD(S),” he said. He recounts that since the reconstitution of the urban local body as a city corporation, political parties were shy of fielding candidates on symbols, as they did not want to upset the Maratha vote. But Mallick Mohammad, Indian Union Muslim League member, welcomes the system of fielding candidates on symbols. “This is likely to reduce the influence of the MES in the BCC polls, as several voters from the Maratha community tend to be BJP supporters in the Assembly polls. They have been voting for the MES in the local body polls, but have been choosing BJP candidates in the MLA and MP elections. If the BJP were to field its own nominees, the voter may not continue his old preferences,” he said. BJP leaders are upbeat. “Our cadre never campaigned for the party candidates. Workers, especially the youth, have been active in the past. They have participated in the campaign of their leaders, but never as party nominees. They are excited to be part of the party campaign this year,” said a BJP senior leader. Abhay Patil, BJP MLA, says that fighting the polls on party lines will benefit them immensely. “BJP will sweep the polls. That is why we convinced our workers and leaders to fight the BCC polls on party lines,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bcc-polls-new-system-enthuses-some-leaves-others-worried/article36027010.ece
21 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bescom to install prepaid smart meters in government buildings||In a couple of months, Bengaluru Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) will begin installation of prepaid smart electricity meters in all government buildings that fall under its jurisdiction. This comes after the Ministry of Power issued an advisory on the installation of prepaid smart meters on priority in government buildings across the country. Confirming the development, Bescom Managing Director Rajendra Cholan told The Hindu that approximately 18,000 government buildings fall under the power utility’s jurisdiction. Bescom distributes power to eight districts – Bengaluru Urban (including BBMP limits), Bengaluru Rural, Chickballapur, Kolar, Davangere, Tumakuru, Chitradurga, and Ramanagaram. The guidelines were issued recently by the Ministry of Power, and under the Revamped Distribution System, Bescom will be able to avail grants to install the smart meters in all government buildings, he added. Bescom is currently studying the power consumption of government buildings, and the detailed project report (DPR) for the installation of the meters is under preparation. “The deadline to submit the DPR to the Ministry of Power is October. By then, we will have a clear idea of the consumption and energy saving,” said a senior official. Senior Bescom officials said the three-phase prepaid smart metering of all government buildings would help the power utility in two ways. “One, by setting an example of promoting energy efficiency and second, by helping the company move towards financial sustainability,” an official said. “A majority of the government buildings are in Bengaluru, and are major power consumers,” the official pointed out. The senior official pointed out that many government departments owe the power utility huge dues in unpaid power consumption charges. By covering all the government buildings in the first phase, Bescom will not have to worry about pending bills. “The departments will have to make advance payments for their power consumption,” he stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bescom-to-install-prepaid-smart-meters-in-government-buildings/article36026779.ece
21 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Pvt. schools delay reopening due to poor response from parents||Though the State government has declared that schools should hold classes on campus for PU students and those in classes IX to XII from August 23, many private school managements are unlikely to open their doors citing tepid response from worried parents. Instead, they plan to start offline classes for the new 2021-22 academic year in a phased manner. Central board schools, for instance, are planning to conduct classes only for students in XI and XII from Monday, after which they will take a decision on classes IX and X. They will most likely resume only later next week. Mansoor Ali Khan, general secretary of Management of Independent CBSE Schools Association, said they sent survey forms to obtain consent from parents, as per the Government Order. However, only 30% of parents were willing to send their children to school, as they were worried about a possible third wave of COVID-19. “So instead of starting all classes on Monday, we will open in a phased manner to build confidence among students and parents. We will send information of all safety measures that we have undertaken so that they are assured and send their children back to school,” he said. Other private schools have decided not to commence regular classes on campus, and instead only conduct practicals. Dakshayini Kanna, principal, Harvest International School, said that around 84% of parents are not ready to send their children to school. “With this response, we are unsure of how to go about conducting classes. We will have our school management committee’s meeting on Saturday to take a final call on the matter,” she said. One option Ms. Kanna is considering is resuming only practical classes and calling students to the campus to give their tests and examinations. “We want to call students in a staggered manner,” she said. Ramitha Ramachandran, principal of School of India, said the management has decided to reopen for practical classes first. “There is also uncertainty on whether schools will remain open with predictions of the third wave,” she said. Other schools like Little Flower Public School hope to counsel parents and allay their fears. Principals and teachers also expressed concern about conducting offline classes as well as online classes simultaneously. Govt. school students Unlike their peers in private schools, students in government schools and PU colleges are hoping that offline classes will be conducted smoothly without any hitch. Many did not have access to devices or e-resources and are hoping to make up for lost time. Government schools are expected to reopen classes IX and X as well as PU colleges from Monday. H.K. Manjunath, president, High School Assistant Masters’ Association, said that they are expecting attendance of over 50%. “However, we were not able to get in touch with a few students as they had moved to other parts of the State,” he said.

21 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Long COVID’ among challenges faced by elderly during pandemic||The past year and a half has been challenging for everyone, especially senior citizens. Apart from being one of the foremost groups in terms of vulnerability to COVID 19 – for which the proof is in the number of fatalities – some elderly people who contracted the infection ended up dealing with ‘long COVID’. Doctors term ‘long COVID’ as a situation where a person who has contracted COVID-19 is cured of the infection, but continues to experience its symptoms for weeks or even months. Speaking to The Hindu , Sweta Choudhary, head, medical products and services, Nightingales Home Health Services, said though COVID-19 affects all age groups, typically, most people have mild illness, some moderate, while a small percentage are critically ill. “Generally, the symptoms resolve in three to six weeks. But some take months, which is called long COVID. They are not still infected, but experience distressing symptoms of the virus. Most common symptoms are fatigue, long-term weakness, joint pain, chest pain, lower grade cough, muscle weakness, brain fog, depression and anxiety, among others. We have had cases of senior citizens reaching out to us with these symptoms,” she said. Under their post COVID rehabilitation programme, there are a set of interventions developed, which is preceded by analysing which system has been affected more - cardiovascular, respiratory or the nervous system, after which a strategy is devised, she added. Dr. Choudhary urged the elderly to not take long COVID-19 lightly and said one should reach out to a family physician or the nearest medical facility as they already have other problems, low immunity and even chronic diseases. Pretesh Kiran, associate professor, community health, coordinator, Senior Citizen Health Service, St. John’s Medical College, said what happens as a result of COVID-19 is that there is some amount of residual morbidity which remains. “Given some of the issues of the elderly in terms of compromised lung function, co-morbidities, lower immunity, etc. there have been cases of individuals who suffer some amount of fibrosis in the lung due to which they have difficulty in breathing. This may take a longer time to heal compared to younger individuals. Mucormycosis has also occurred in some of the elderly, especially those with co-morbidities,” he said. Long-term effects These have had higher treatment, longer recovery time, and some have also succumbed, he said, adding that long-term effects of post infection fatigue and difficulty could continue in older people for a longer period of time. Dr. Kiran also expanded on the toll COVID-19 takes on a patient’s mental health. “An older person would require some amount of counselling as there is that fear and stigma that it will take longer for them to recover, given that during the first wave, mortality and morbidity was more in the elderly. Apart from hospital-based interventions, a comprehensive multi-pronged approach is required. While the role of the medical fraternity is in identifying issues early and addressing them, the role of families, carers and the support system back home plays a very important role in identifying problems early,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/long-covid-among-challenges-faced-by-elderly-during-pandemic/article36026786.ece
21 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Will improve residential schools: Bommai||Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday said the government would come out with a policy for improving the quality of education in the residential schools for SCs/STs, minorities, and OBCs to enable students to compete for higher education and get jobs in the private sector. Coining “three Es” for upliftment of the people belonging to the downtrodden and the poor categories, he said: “Education, employment and empowerment” were prerequisites for social and economic improvement of people belonging to the SC/ST, minorities, and OBC categories. Speaking at a function organised here to mark the birth anniversary celebrations of former Chief Minister D. Devaraj Urs, Mr. Bommai said special programmes would be introduced to boost the confidence of students studying in residential schools to compete in NEET, CET, and other higher education competitive exams as wells for jobs in the private sector. Only the quality of education at the residential schools would enable students to get jobs in the private sector. On the lines of CBSE schools, efforts should be made to provide good quality of education in the residential schools, the Chief Minister said. The government would start three schools for nomadic children this year. A sum of Rs. 6 crore had been set aside for construction of school buildings of two nomadic schools. Already the State had four nomadic schools and two had their own buildings, he said. Noting the contributions of Devaraj Urs during the unification and growth of the State, Mr. Bommai said the government had been providing scholarships worth Rs. 625 crore annually for students belonging to SC/STs, minorities, and OBCs for pursuing higher education. Devaraj Urs was the first leader in the State to introduce social engineering and nurtured leaders in different communities, the Chief Minister said. On the occasion, Mr. Bommai presented the Devaraj Urs Award to Basavaprabhu Lakhangouda Patil of Athani in Belagavi district, S.G. Susheelamma of Sumangali Seva Ashrama, Bengaluru, and K. Bhaskar Das of Yekkaru in Dakshina Kannada for 2019–20, 2020–21, and 2021–22 respectively, for their work towards welfare of the downtrodden and the poor. Minister for Social Welfare and Backward Classes Kota Srinivas Poojari, P.C. Mohan, MP, and other dignitaries attended the programme organised by the Social Welfare Department. Earlier, Mr. Bommai and other leaders paid floral tributes to Devaraj Urs at the State secretariat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/will-improve-residential-schools-bommai/article36026798.ece
21 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Flower supply hit as farmers shift to other crops fearing loss||Last year, during the festival season of Shravana month, Bengaluru was reeling under the first wave of COVID-19. This year, the festive spirit has taken hold of the city, with people visiting markets and gatherings. However, citizens were shocked to find the price of flowers skyrocketing during Varamahalakshmi festival, while vendors cited short supply as the reason. A kilo of jasmine buds was trading at Rs. 2,000, at least two-and-a-half times its usual cost. Kanakambara, usually in demand for the festival, was selling in the range of Rs. 1,400 to Rs. 1,800 a kilo. Even marigolds and chrysanthemums were in demand, but their prices were on expected lines - Rs. 200 to Rs. 300 a kilo. “There is a severe shortage of supply of flowers this year. The recent rain has also caused crop loss,” said G.M. Divakar, president, K.R. Market Flower Merchants’ Association. K.R. Market is one of the largest flower markets in the State. Vegetables and fruits  Another reason for the shortage is that many farmers who traditionally grew flowers were badly affected by the pandemic and have taken to growing vegetables and fruits, Mr. Divakar observed. Flower growers were one of the worst hit during the pandemic and several lockdowns. As places of worship were closed and festivities remained subdued, flowers were also considered non-essential leading to huge losses to farmers, prompting the State government to announce a relief package for flower growers earlier this year. However, many shifted to other crops fearing more losses this year. Ravi Kumar, a farmer from Anekal, traditionally grew Kanakambara, but has now started cultivating vegetables. “Flowers are considered non-essential not only by the governments, but also by people during the pandemic. One of the first cuts many people implemented in their homes were flowers. We suffered huge losses, prompting us to move to other crops,” he said, adding many of his friends had also similarly taken to other crops. Gauribidanur in Kolar district is a hub for growing Kanakambara, but there, too, output has been considerably lower compared to previous years, sources in the industry said. “There’s a similar trend in the northern districts of Tamil Nadu, from where the city receives jasmine buds,” Mr. Divakar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/flower-supply-hit-as-farmers-shift-to-other-crops-fearing-loss/article36026795.ece
21 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Police embrace QR code-based beat system||As many as 1,997 beat points spread across 18 police stations in the North division of the city have embraced the QR code-based Subahu e-beat system. Under the previous conventional logbook system, beat police had to manually record their movements via swiping machines installed along their respective beats. In the old system, there was scope for manipulation as there was no proper monitoring, said police officials. With Subahu, beat police have to scan QR codes placed along their routes with their mobile phones. The app uses face recognition and allows police officers to download photos and write remarks for better and quick response. The system can also be monitored on a real-time basis from the control room. As soon as the beat policeman scans the code, the officer in-charge will not only get a confirmation, but will also be able to track his or her movement through GPS. The remarks recorded in the app can be stored and analysed for future policing and planning. It was formally launched by Commissioner of Police Kamal Pant on August 18. “The app-based e-beat system is an effort to make the beat policing effective, efficient, transparent, and accountable,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (north east) Dharmender Kumar Meena. In 2020, the South East division police had moved to Subahu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-embrace-qr-code-based-beat-system/article36026778.ece
21 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Senior citizens found dead in their home||A senior citizen couple, P. Shantaraj, 65, and his wife C. Premalata, 62, were found brutally murdered at their residence in Kashinagar, Kumaraswamy Layout, on Friday afternoon. They were discovered by neighbours who suspected something afoot when they did not see the couple step out of their house all morning. Calls to them went unanswered. Concerned, the neighbours entered the house with the police and found Shantaraj in the bedroom with his throat slit and a pillow covering his face. Premalata was on the floor of another room. She had been strangled with a cable wire, said the police. According to a senior police official, there was no forced entry into the house. The couple seem to have served the unidentified murderer/s coffee, indicated by empty glasses in the hall. The police suspect someone known to the couple behind the crime. “The motive is still not clear. We don’t know whether the murderers took away something of value from the house. The victims don’t come from a high income family to be likely targets of murder for gain. The murders seem to be carried out by amateurs. It may be an act of desperation, or they may have thought they had some valuables. We are also not ruling out any personal revenge leading to these murders,” a senior police official said. Shantaraj retired from Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation, while Premalata was a homemaker. The couple did not have children, and owned the house they lived in. They had also rented out two portions in the same property. The police have formed four special teams to investigate the double murder. They are presently analysing CCTV footage in the area to identify those who came to the house. “We are also analysing mobile phone records of the victims for clues,” said the official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/senior-citizens-found-dead-in-their-home/article36026780.ece
21 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Why Karnataka’s second wave is dragging on for long||Although the second wave of COVID-19 in Karnataka has had a rapid ascent and descent, the number of new cases has remained steady within 1,800 since the beginning of this month. Public health experts, who said the second wave is not yet over and is dragging on for a longer period, attributed it to the spillover of cases from the border districts. The surge of cases in some neighbouring States, especially in Kerala, is a major factor that is adding to the high number of cases in the border districts. In fact, over 55% of the new cases on Friday are from the five border districts — Dakshina Kannada (341), Hassan (101), Udupi (76), Mysuru (87) and Kodagu (95). The trend has been similar since the beginning of this month. Besides, largescale non-compliance to COVID appropriate behaviour and waning antibody levels among those who were infected are also major factors for the daily numbers to stagnate and remain within 1,800 and not drop below that. M.K. Sudarshan, Chairman of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said while increasing vaccination coverage and non-emergence of new variants has been slowing down spread of infection, waning antibodies among those infected and people becoming complacent are a cause of concern. “When the pandemic hit the State in March 2020, people were fearful and compliance of COVID norms was better. It is important that people do not let their guard down,” he said. TAC member V. Ravi, who is also the nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, said the surge of cases in Kerala has resulted in an increase in the number of daily cases in the border districts. “Over 55% of the daily cases are from the border districts and the restrictions imposed at the entry points in these districts should not be relaxed unless the Test Positivity rate there falls below 2%,” he said. Pointing out that during the first wave too daily cases had remained steady for two months before further dropping, Dr. Ravi said, “The descent of the first wave began in October but cases hovered around 1,500 for nearly two months till November after which the numbers further dropped. At a point, we had seen as low as 500 cases daily in January-February.” C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said people should be more watchful now as the festival season is beginning. “Crowding during the festivals and political events that are going on in some parts of the State should not add to the problem,” he said. Pointing out that as of now, Karnataka has managed to ensure that the cases remain steady despite the surge in Kerala, Dr. Manjunath said: “If the same trend continues for the next three months and if there are no further mutations, the intensity of the third wave will be less severe. Crowding in public, social and political gatherings must be avoided.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/why-karnatakas-second-wave-is-dragging-on-for-long/article36026788.ece
21 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Dwarakanath joins Congress||C.S. Dwarakanath, former chairman of Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes, formally joined the Congress in the presence of former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and KPCC chief D.K. Shivakumar on Friday. Mr. Dwarakanath, an advocate by profession, joined the Congress at a function held at the party office to mark the birth anniversary of both former Chief Minister D. Devaraj Urs and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Mr. Dwarakanath had earlier joined the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Chickballapur constituency. He got 23,446 votes (1.69%) and finished in fourth place. Noting the contributions of Urs to the State, Mr. Siddaramaiah said he had used his political power to promote social justice through equitable distribution of power, resources, and opportunities. The former Chief Minister said Urs inspired his own political and policy decisions, and recalled Urs’ achievements in the implementation of land reforms and pro-poor schemes. Mr. Shivakumar said the party had planned to hold the function at Ambedkar Bhavan in the city, but permission was denied. “The BJP government has been allowing Janashirwad Yatra of BJP Ministers and has been following different rules for other political parties,” the KPCC chief alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dwarakanath-joins-congress/article36026804.ece

21 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Industrial residential townships planned||Integrated industrial residential townships with all the basic amenities would be established in industrial areas in Karnataka in order to save man hours and reduce traffic congestion, according to Minister for Large and Medium Industries Murugesh R. Nirani. With the unique concept of “walk to work”, Mr. Nirani held discussions with senior officials of the department and decided to prepare a blueprint on residential townships in industrial areas that would come up in future. Residential townships would be developed on KIADB land and other industrial areas so that workers, officials and other staff reside on the premises, which will help them avoiding commuting long distances and thus save crucial man hours, increasing productivity and preventing traffic congestion, he said. The idea is that residential townships would be constructed on 10% to 15% of land reserved in industrial areas with all the basic amenities such as schools, shopping malls, clinics, parks, and recreation facilities, Mr. Nirani said. The department has planned to develop 9,010 acres for industrial work in the coming days in Kolar, Ramanagaram, Mandya, Tumakuru, Vijayapura, and Haveri. Over 81,864 acres in 188 industrial areas have been acquired so far and allotted for industrial units across the State.

21 August 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Muharram observed, Varamahalaxmi festival celebrated in Hubballi||Muslims in the districts of Dharwad, Haveri, Gadag and Belagavi observed Muharram on Friday and in many places, particularly in the rural areas. They were joined by Hindus too. This year Muharram coincided with Varamahalaxmi festival, which is celebrated by Hindus. However, both had subdued events because of COVID-19 protocol. Muharram is observed by Shia Muslims to commemorate the martyrdom of Prophet Mohammed’s grandson, Hazrat Imam Hussain, who was killed in the battle of Karbala in 680 A.D. The prophet’s son-in-law, Ali, and Ali’s elder son, Hassan, are also remembered during this period as having suffered and died for a righteous cause. As has been the practice, ‘panjas’ of Muharram are placed in small pandals during the festival. This time their numbers were less because of the pandemic. In some villages of North Karnataka, where there are only one or two Muslim families, other villagers got together to observe various rituals of Muharram. It is a practice among members of the Hindu community to observe Muharram by getting themselves painted in tiger stripes, visiting households and performing “huli kunita” as part of their “harake” (vow). As processions are banned, there was no procession by people of Iran origin, which is usally taken out in Dharwad during Muharram. However small group of people took out ‘panjas’ in procession and Hindus too participated in these. In Hubballi,a mishap was reported during a ritual on Friday. A boy who was running over live charcoal carrying the ‘panja’ slipped and fell down. But he was immediately lifted out of it preventing any major burn injuries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/muharram-observed-varamahalaxmi-festival-celebrated-in-hubballi/article36027016.ece
21 August 2021||Kalaburagi,KARNATAKA||Outfits condemn opening of gunfire to welcome BJP leader||Pragatipara Sanghatanegala Okkoota, a conglomerate of progressive organisations, condemned the gunfire welcome offered by BJP activists to their leader and Union Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilizers, New and Renewable Energy Bhagawanth Khuba at Jan Ashirvad Yatra in Yadgir on Wednesday. In a media release, R.K. Hudgi, Maruti Gokhale, K. Neela, Arjun Bhadre, Dattatreya Ikkalaki, Prabhu Khanapure, Sudhama Dhanni and Srimanth, the Kalaburagi-based social activists representing different organisations, said that using the firearms amount to terrorising people. “Welcome is generally offered with flowers or other decent ways as per the country’s multi-cultural traditions. It is India’s real culture. But, BJP leaders’ gunfire welcome in Yadgir is essentially Taliban culture. There is no way but to call BJP India’s Taliban. Earlier also, the BJP had given Trishuls and other lethal weapons to students and provoked them for violence. BJP has thus been nurturing and expanding its culture of violence in the country,” they said in the statement. BJP has utterly failed in its governance on the development front. The Jan Ashirvad Yatra is a drama that it is playing to cover up its zero achievements in development. The BJP leaders are violating COVID-19 norms by organising huge crowds. Being a Minister in the Union government, Mr. Khuba and his party had no respect for the law of the land. With its anti-democratic and violent culture, BJP has exposed its autocratic and fascist culture,” they said, demanding the arrest of Mr. Khuba and other BJP leaders who participated in the Jan Ashirwad Yatra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/outfits-condemn-opening-of-gunfire-to-welcome-bjp-leader/article36027008.ece

21 August 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||No dearth of land for industry, says Ashwath Narayan||Minister for Information Technology (IT) and Bio Technology (BT) C.N. Ashwath Narayan on Friday said there is no dearth of land for growth of industries in the State. Speaking after inaugurating the Karnataka Digital Economy Mission’s (KDEM) office in Mysuru, he referred to the emphasis made on expediting acquisition of land by Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB) for already approved projects by Mysuru MP Pratap Simha, who spoke earlier, and said there is no need to worry about land acquisition for development. He said the Additional Chief Secretary for IT and BT Ramana Reddy was also the Additional Chief Secretary for the Department of Industries, which is a good combination, particularly for the growth of IT and BT industries. He said his Department will work with the Industries Department, under Minister for Large and Medium Industries Murugesh Nirani, to ensure that land is made available to IT and BT companies. “There is no need to worry for land. Just ask how much you want and where you want”, he said before adding that the government was in a position to ensure that supply of land is more than demand. With the country aiming to become a 5 trillion-dollar economy by 2025, out of which digital economy should reach 1 trillion dollars, Mr. Narayan pointed out that Karnataka’s IT and BT economy, which is presently worth 50 billion dollars, should reach 150 billion dollars in the next four years. To achieve the target set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the State government has chalked out a number of programmes including Beyond Bengaluru, which among other things, aims to provide 10 lakh jobs by developing IT and IT-Enabled Services (ITES) sector in Tier-2 cities like Mysuru, Mangaluru and Hubbali-Dharwad. IT industry in Karnataka already accounts for 25 per cent of the State Gross Domestic Product (SGDP). The State is aiming to take it upto 30 per cent by 2025. Mr. Narayan, who is also the Minister for Higher Education, emphasised the importance of education as well as broadband and Internet connectivity in the development of the society. Pointing out that India’s capital was in its human resources, which should be developed with proper education and skills, Mr. Narayan said the countries world over have begun investing heavily in virtual infrastructure. After COVID-19, he said there has been a perceptible shift in investment from physical to virtual infrastructure. Roads and railways were also important, but Internet connectivity has become essential to ensure that governance and administration is taken to the “finger-tips” of the people. Taking administration to the “door-step” is passe. Now, administration should be taken to the “finger-tips” of people in terms of governance, health, education, trade as well as in the agriculture sector. The Telecom Department, which had lost its relevance in recent times, had now been roped in by his Department to ensure that Internet connectivity is easily accessible by the people. The Telecom Department, which is working closely with the IT Department of the State under “transaction of business” rules, has strengthened Broadband and Internet connectivity under the State government’s telecom policy. Creating jobs On the occasion, an initiative called futuredigitaljobs@Mysuru was also rolled out to create 350 jobs in the next three months. The programme, which part of the talent accelerator of KDEM, has already on-boarded a company with requirements for digital jobs in companies of Mysuru and Bengaluru. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Ramana Reddy said the KDEM, which is a Government-funded company, was a unique initiative where 51 percent of the equity will be held by industry associations like NASSCOM and ASSOCHAM. The aims include increasing IT industry’s contribution to State Gross Domestic Product (SGDP) from the present 25 per cent to 30 per cent and to create about 10 lakh digital jobs by 2025. “To achieve this, it is not possible on Bengaluru alone. We need to take this forward to other Tier 2 cities like Mysuru, Mangaluru, Hubbali-Dharwad, Shivamogga etc”, he said. Mysuru, which is ideally positioned to take forward the aims of KDEM, has 20,000 IT professionals. Besides, a start-up from Mysuru – Bellatrix – figures among the watch list of 100 start-ups of Asia featured by Forbes. “We want future billionaire start-ups to come from Mysuru”, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-dearth-of-land-for-industry-says-ashwath-narayan/article36027215.ece
21 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||UoM sets up Career Hub for students||Described as a pioneering initiative, the University Career Hub that was launched on Manasagangotri campus here on Friday aims at upskilling youth and enhancing job placements besides bridging the demand-supply gap of talent in the market. With the state-of-the-art infrastructure, the centre is now open to the students and teaching community and will provide opportunities for research, creative experimentation and prototyping. All students of the University of Mysore – be it a student of arts, commerce or science - will benefit from the infrastructure and skilling programme as the hub focuses on three programmes – skill development, innovation and incubation/start-up. It strives for innovative teaching approaches for bringing in discovery, student creativity and hands-on experimentation that will be the core of designing these skilling programmes, according to the University. Minister for Higher Education and IT and BT C.N. Ashwath Narayan inaugurated the career hub besides other new initiatives and new infrastructure of the university at Manasagangotri. He was accompanied by Mysuru MP Pratap Simha, MLA L. Nagendra, Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar, Registrar Shivappa and others. The University officials told the Minister that the skill development initiatives will focus on getting students to be industry-ready. Generic skills like English, coaching for competitive exams like UPSC; resume writing clinics; and industry certification programmes in collaboration with industry leaders like Google Cloud readiness, IB and SAP are planned. The hub has membership with industry bodies like CII and NASSCOM. The hub has a makers’ lab or the innovation centre for fostering innovation culture through hands-on experimentation and rapid prototyping. Multi-disciplinary teams will collaborate on projects in the space of toy making, agritech, rural healthcare and education, a note from the University said. The incubation or the centre for start-ups helps youth to identify and work on social circumstances that will impact lives and communities of semi-urban and rural Mysuru.

21 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Be cautious in varsity appointments, says MP||Mysore-Kodagu MP Pratap Simha on Friday urged Minister for Higher Education and IT and BT C.N. Ashwath Narayan to be cautious while making appointments to teaching posts in universities. Unqualified faculty can derail the university’s growth. A thoughtful step in appointments with strong emphasis on merit can help universities achieve their lost glory, he felt. Speaking at the launch of National Education Policy-2020 at the University of Mysore, Mr. Simha, while indirectly referring to the fall of academic standards in the universities, said, “If teachers lacking merit are appointed, the universities will have to suffer for three decades.” Only if the academic standards are elevated, the universities can prosper and earn name and fame, he opined. Speaking at another programme organised to inaugurate the office of Karnataka Digital Economy Mission (KDEM) at Hebbal, Mr. Simha described the contents of the fan pages of IPS and IAS offices as their ‘pretensions’. He accused a former Deputy Commissioner of Hassan, whom he did not name, for scuttling a Central government road project from Hassan to Maranahalli. Though a 45-km-long cement road had been sanctioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in 2015-16, work has not been carried out yet. He accused the person of failure to allot a quarry to the company that had been awarded the contract to facilitate work. He said IAS officers like the Deputy Commissioner of a district should not just sit in the office, but secure clearance for land acquisition for various projects. He said Mysuru Deputy Commissioner Bagadi Gautham is doing a good job. He said Deputy Commissioners should keep one Twitter account, where their work should be posted regularly. He urged Additional Chief Secretary, Department of IT&BT, Ramana Reddy, who was seated on the dais along with Minister for IT&BT Dr. C.N. Ashwath Narayan, to take steps to stop the fan pages of IPS and IAS officers. ‘Visionary’ He hailed former Chief Minister S.M. Krishna as a “visionary” and pointed out that Mr. Krishna had envisioned the need to promote industries in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities during his tenure as Chief Minister. He regretted that Mysuru had not received any support from the government even though people sought to project Mysuru as the best destination for industries after Bengaluru. “I may be in the BJP. But, I regard Mr. S.M. Krishna as a visionary for his promotion of industries in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities”, he said. Mr. Krishna, who is now a BJP leader, was in the Congress party when he served as the Chief Minister of Karnataka. “One should learn from Mr. Krishna for laying the road map for development”, he said. Regretting the delay in the sanction of funds for land acquisition for the extension of the runway at Mysuru airport, Mr. Simha said the State needs “visionary” Chief Ministers and not “reactionary” Chief Ministers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/be-cautious-in-varsity-appointments-says-mp/article36027213.ece

Mr. Kunjumon was earlier suspended from the party, pending inquiry, following allegations that he had tried to defeat M. Liju, the United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate in the Ambalappuzha Assembly constituency, in the 2021 Assembly polls, by depicting him as an ‘anti-minority community leader.’ Addressing a press conference here on Friday, Mr. Kunjumon alleged conspiracy against him.

21 August 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Striking gold with bush pepper vines||Muhammadali of Puthukkudy, a farmer at Muttil in Wayanad, is known as the magician of pepper vines among his friends following his huge success in managing grafted bush pepper vines in and around his homestead. The progressive farmer is growing more than 300 grafted bush pepper vines belonging to six varieties on his pepper garden on 23 cents of land and gets an average yield of two to three quintals of black pepper every year. Mr. Muhammadali turned to bush pepper cultivation a few years ago after his pepper vines were destroyed in a flood. He used to get more than five quintals of black pepper from 270 pepper vines. In bush pepper farming, Colubrinum (Piper colubrina), locally called Kattu Thippaly, is used as the stock. A nursery is set up in the garden for raising Colubrinum alone and each of the stock is later grafted with pepper varieties such as Panniyoor 1, Karimunda, Thekken and Kombukkal. Higher survival rate, disease resistance and increased yield are some of the noteworthy features of bush pepper farming, says Mr. Muhammadali. Bush pepper needs less attention compared to the field vines, he says. Ease of management is another attraction as the farmer can have a look at each and every leaf of the plant that grows in a polythene bag. Another advantage is round-the-year harvest, if the bushes are managed properly, he says. Organic methods Mr. Muhammadali follows organic method of cultivation and he has devised a novel bio-fertilizer for his plants. A fermented formulation made of locally available plant leaves, cow dung, neem cake and bone meal act as the main fertilizer for his plants. Mr. Muhammadali is a role model for every marginal farmer in the State as he is making an attractive income from a small piece of land, says Joseph John, scientist at M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation. As nearly 78% of farmers in the country are marginal farmers, the methods and techniques developed by Mr. Muhammadali can be replicated by every farmer, Mr. John says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/striking-gold-with-bush-pepper-vines/article36027115.ece
21 August 2021||Kalpetta,KERALA||Panel mooted to study man-animal conflict||Environmental organisations in the district have expressed concern over the alleged apathy of successive governments in adopting proactive steps to mitigate man-animal conflict in hilly areas of the State, including Wayanad. The Wayanad Prakruthi Samrakshana Samiti (WPSS) urged the government to constitute an expert committee to study the issue comprehensively. The government had recently sought suggestions and opinions from environmental organisations, farmer organisations, political parties and NGOs in the State regarding the issue. The WPSS said in its reply that the massive anthropogenic intervention on wildlife habitat was the major reason behind the increasing incidents of man-animal conflict. Temporary measures such as constructing walls, installing power fence, digging trenches and erecting rail fence to mitigate the issue should be continued but corruption in the name of constructions should be avoided. Close to 36% of the forestland in the district has turned into monoculture plantations and they should be converted into natural forest at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/panel-mooted-to-study-man-animal-conflict/article36027171.ece

The Hosdurg police in Kasaragod arrested Umar, his wife Fatima, Iqbal, and Sajitha from Payyanur. The four were arrested on a complaint by a resident of Kadavathra, Kochi, who was caught in the honeytrap and made to part with money and gold. According to the police, Sajitha was involved in similar cases before. Blackmail Sajitha got acquainted with the victim over the phone, and the victim came to Kanhangad on August 2. However, without his knowledge, their private moments in the bedroom were filmed. They later allegedly used the visuals to blackmail him and demanded several lakhs of rupees for not releasing the video. The complainant allegedly paid Rs. 3.75 lakh and gave 7.5 sovereigns of gold. But even after this, when the accused kept demanding more money, the victim approached the police. The police suspect that there are more people in the group and an investigation is on in this connection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/four-held-in-honeytrap-case/article36027083.ece

21 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Campaign against drug, alcohol menace proves a hit||When the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment ordered an intense month-long awareness campaign to strip Ernakulam district of its dubious distinction of being one of the most alcohol-abused places in the country, the Social Justice Department had little option but to turn towards social media, as conventional awareness programmes were out of question during the pandemic. The department staff and 72 anti-drug master volunteers put their heads together and came up with the idea of a contest using all popular social media platforms. An advertisement inviting participants for the contest led to the registration of 40 organisations and educational institutions. However, many dropped out soon, leaving in the fray just 13 contestants who embarked on an innovative messaging through all platforms for over a month since June 26, which is observed as International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. “The idea to take the message against drugs and alcohol to the maximum possible people proved a success, as it reached more than four lakh people,” said Anish K.R., district coordinator, Nasha Mukht Bharat Abhiyan, under which the campaign was held. At the end of it, the National Service Scheme unit of Government VHSS, East Marady, bagged the first prize of Rs. 15,000, as it roped in Lakshmi Nair, a celebrity chef, and Sujith Bhakthan, a vlogger, to maximise the reach of the message. Bharat Mata School of Social Work, Thrikkakara, and Government Law College, Ernakulam, won the second and third prizes of Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 5,000 respectively. The winners effectively used all popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Google Meet, Zoom, and Club House. “The awareness campaign was just the first phase of a protracted mission. In the successive phases, the problems faced by individuals from areas identified as hotspots will be referred to the outreach and drop-in centre followed by community-based peer-led intervention. Those who need help beyond it will be referred to the Integrated Rehabilitation Centre for Addiction,” said Mr. Anish. Ernakulam was found to have 2,300 hotspots of alcohol and drug abuse, according to a recent survey conducted by the Social Justice Department in association with the Kudumbashree.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/campaign-against-drug-alcohol-menace-proves-a-hit/article36027096.ece
21 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Onam comes calling, 3 years after deluge||Three years since what was seen as ‘the deluge of the century’ washed away Independence Day and Onam celebrations in Kerala, those who pioneered rescue efforts spoke of how both the events went largely unobserved, what with much of Kerala remaining submerged that year. Kerala Matsaythozhilali Aikya Vedi (TUCI) president Charles George reminisced about how the continuous downpour of 2018 lasted from August 13 to 16 and the waters taking up to August 22 to submerge prompted fishermen from different parts of the State to launch rescue efforts of their own. Kerala’s own Navy The thousands of people they rescued or helped rescue through their selfless acts resulted in fishers coming to be known as Kerala’s own Navy. “Along with a few others, I helped organise over 100 fishing boats from Kalamukku in Vypeen, load them in container lorries and take them to localities where people were perched on rooftop or on upper floors of houses,” Mr. George said. Someone posted my number on social media, and people began making frantic calls all through day and night to send fishermen to rescue them from the rising floodwaters. Stranded people who were rescued included actor Salim Kumar from his house at North Paravur. Raw deal “Interestingly, fishers refused to accept gold ornaments and valuables offered by people whom they ferried to safety. Three years down the lane, the question is ‘who will save the saviours’, most of whom are neck-deep in poverty, thanks to lack of government support, skyrocketing fuel prices, exploitation by middlemen, pandemic situation, and the fast depleting fish catch due to climate change. The State government has not heeded to the fish famine package that traditional fishers demanded in 2019,” he said. Goods wagons Yet another person who was in the frontline to help evacuate people to safety was Khalid Mundapilly, a socio-environmental activist. “I along with my son Rajeeb could rope in members of a few NGOs to rescue people stranded Aluva, Purayar, Chowara, and Chengamanad. Some of them had managed to reach the Aluva railway station in country boats or even in big enough vessels. The station master helped arrange a two-coach goods train, which operated multiple trips to take people to safety. The railway and police too helped,” Mr. Mundapilly said. Many others who managed to reach the Aluva metro station with no more than clothes they wore and water bottles, boarded metro trains and disembarked at stations in Kochi. The only alternative to reach Aluva was tipper lorries, while helicopters hovered above to rescue people struck atop terraces. The situation in the Edappally-Aluva corridor was so bad that only the top of the Aluva flyover could be seen above the water level on August 17, 2018.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/onam-comes-calling-three-years-after-the-deluge-washed-it-away/article36027092.ece
21 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Despite Bevco’s online trial, queues stay long||An online system to order liquor at a premium outlet of Bevco at Kadavanthra here has not succeeded in reducing crowding. The trial run was rolled out in the district along with select outlets across the State on Tuesday, after crowding at liquor outlets came in for criticism from the High Court. The system allows customers to order liquor and pay in advance through a portal and then collect the bottles from the outlet by producing an SMS reference number. ‘Two queues now’ “If anything, this has only created two queues at the outlet, one for the online customers and the other for those who turn up directly. The online system has evoked such response that two of the available six staff had to be assigned exclusively for that, adding to the overall burden,” said a Bevco employee. A system that still requires customers to come to the outlet to collect liquor seems to be of little use. No. of staff reduced The reduction of staff at the outlet has not helped either. Earlier, there were six security employees, four of whom used to help with the operations inside the outlet. Now, just two security staff are deployed outside the outlet. “In effect, the outlet is left with just four employees if two are assigned to cater to online customers. They share tasks such as visiting banks, excise office, Bevco warehouse, among others,” said the employee. Also, new printers and related paraphernalia with which the staff are yet to be familiar have added to the employees’ burden during the rush Onam season. The swiping machine at the outlet cannot be used for transactions exceeding Rs. 10 lakh a day and this leads to frequent squabbles with customers. “Customers fume when asked to pay in cash at the last minute. It also leads to crowding at the nearby ATM kiosk,” said sources in Bevco.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/despite-bevcos-online-trial-queues-stay-long/article36027102.ece

A total of 59,500 sq.ft. ‘raw space’ above the concourse level of the metro station is available for the purpose. If not business class hotels, the area is apt for use as commercial office space or for mixed development, especially so since the property is strategically located near the main railway station in the city, KMRL sources said. A multi-level car-parking facility too can be developed in the adjacent land, they added. It is part of the metro agency’s proposal to monetise land and buildings in its possession, to garner non-ticketing revenue. It had earlier announced plans to rent out approximately 60,000 sq.ft. retail space and 50,000 sq.ft. office space at metro stations with substantial footfall. The proposal to garner income from the proposed Rs. 3,000-crore Bliss City in 17.43 acres at Kakkanad has been temporarily held up.

In 2020, COVID-19 changed the scene completely and made Onam a desolate affair for the residents. But this time, the district administration is all set to brighten up their Onam through ‘Onathudi 2021’, a string of events to celebrate the festival. Despite the financial crunch due to the pandemic, the authorities will gift Onakodis to all residents of orphanages and destitute homes in Kollam. District Collector B. Abdul Nasar on Friday inaugurated the programme by handing over new cloths to the residents of a private shelter home. “Since contributions to destitute homes have dried up due to COVID-19, the district administration decided to step in and distribute them gifts,” he said.

It almost feels normal but for the fear everyone is trying desperately to conceal and overcome. Onam is like never before this year. It was a low-key affair the previous year when COVID-19 had a devastating effect on normal life. But ever since the struggle for livelihood won over the fear for life, thanks to the business community in the State, there is a sense of almost normalcy. It was just weeks before Onam that the State government let all shops open, and the public heaved a sigh of relief. “Yes, we are aware that COVID may take our life. But why live if we cannot sustain it?,” asked Shibu A.K, an autorickshaw driver from Mankavu in Kozhikode as he plied between Valiyangadi and Mankavu carrying goods. Textile shops, which used to be abuzz with customers on the days before Onam, are not so busy now. “The sale is lower than normal. Many people are cutting down on their traditional ‘Onakkodi’ this year due to various reasons. First, they may be scared to venture out. Second, they cannot afford Onakkodi now. Third, they are purchasing ‘Onakkodi’ online. Fourth, they are going after cheap stuff from the roadsides,” said Gautham Rajeevan, managing partner of a noted textile store in Kozhikode. Local traders are bearing the brunt of the flourishing online business against the backdrop of the pandemic. “People are opting for online shopping now. Not just textiles, almost everything is now available online. They feel it is safer than visiting local stores,” Mr. Rajeevan said, adding that they were planning to set up an online store themselves to cater to the growing demand from customers. There is a Malayalam proverb ‘Kaanam vittum Onam Unnanam’ (You should not miss the Onam meal even if you have to sell your property for it). The proverb is coming true for many people in the State who are spending the last of their savings this Onam, hoping for a prosperous festival next year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/celebrations-on-amid-crises-caused-by-covid/article36027086.ece

Nearly 91% of BTech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering students secured placement, with an average salary of Rs. 9.5 LPA, he said. Despite uncertainties, students of BTech in Mechanical Engineering, Production Engineering and Chemical Engineering also secured a reasonable placement at around 80%, while the placement for Civil Engineering was around 70%, said Mr. Sajith. Top recruiters As a result of aggressive industry outreach, Dr. Sajith said that a total of 145 companies visited the campus. The top recruiters include Wipro (26), Deloitte (25), Cisco (22), Oracle (22), Amdocs (20), ICICI (18), Qualcomm (17), Tata group (15), Intel (15), Capgemini (11), L&T (10), Bosch (12) and many others.

Mr. Sajith said that postgraduate programmes also witnessed an improvement in placements from last year’s 186 to 199 this year. Of the PG programmes, MTech Computer Science received 100% placement. Highest salary The highest salary received by an MTech Computer Science student is Rs. 28 LPA. Moreover, this year, both MBA and MCA students received reasonably good offers, he said. Mr. Sajith said the consistent improvement in the National Institutional Ranking Framework  (NIRF) ranking of the institute during the last two years was a key parameter in contributing to the steady growth in placements and internships.

21 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||IMA warns of post-Onam surge||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has cautioned people to reduce social interactions as much as possible to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the post-Onam period. According to published literature, more than 50% of the transmission of the virus occurs through asymptomatic individuals. Human behaviour has been driving the pandemic and it is the unsafe behaviour of many who go outside homes, which brings the virus home to those who have been remaining indoors The Delta virus spreads fast and has higher secondary attack rate. (Secondary attack rate refers to the number of people that get infected from the first patient). Unfortunately, vaccination has been encouraging people to lower standard precautions to prevent COVID-19, IMA pointed out. Breakthrough infections “Vaccinated individuals tend to socialise more, believing that it is safe to do so. But we know that breakthrough infections can occur in the fully vaccinated. Some of them who pick up the virus will spread it around during small social gatherings,” says Rajeev Jayadevan, scientific adviser, IMA A majority of these breakthrough infections are asymptomatic or mild and while the vaccinated individuals may be safe, they can pass on the infection to a vulnerable person who might succumb to the disease, it is pointed out. Severe outcomes are also being reported among fully vaccinated older people, particularly those with diabetes. Vaccination High levels of vaccination in Kerala – 84% over 45 years have been administered the first dose and 41%, the second dose – has been protecting people from serious disease, which is why, despite the rise in cases, hospitalisations have not risen significantly. People should stick to the smallest “social bubble” as much as possible or in other words, minimise social visits. “Social bubble” refers to the people we are regularly in contact with. Excessive socialisation means that many bubbles converge. Unless we are consciously aware of the multiple bubbles around us, it becomes possible for a virus located in a bubble far away to find its way to our home or work place. Socialisation increases this risk,” says Dr. Jayadevan. Even one extra social visit per family could multiply the spread of the virus during the season. Season peak In Kerala, in 2020 when the case graph peaked in October, the number of cases had been six times the cases that were there in August (Onam season). However, this year, the current baseline of cases is quite high, between 20,000-22,000 daily. This means that a surge in cases from this point can put the health system under serious strain, IMA warned. It pointed out that the risk of virus spread is greater indoors. Therefore, systematic efforts must be made to improve ventilation and air circulation after consulting experts such as architects/engineers. The timing of opening of shops and other public places must be extended so that people have the option of shopping when it is less crowded. Reducing working hours will only increase crowding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ima-warns-of-possible-post-onam-surge/article36027173.ece

However, they manage to keep the business afloat. Starting with the successive floods of 2018 and 2019 and followed by the two years taken away by COVID-19, it has been quite a struggle for most of them. On Friday, the Uthradom day, things were rather looking up compared to the previous days, say traders, as there has been a steady flow of shoppers wanting a considerable quantity of flowers for Athappookkalam. But the high price of flowers has come as a downer. A kilogram of vadamalli, one of the preferred flowers for pookkalam, is now priced at Rs. 450, and jamanthi (marigold) is priced between Rs. 150 to Rs. 500 per kg depending upon the colour. "Many think we are hiking the prices ourselves to get extra profit during the COVID-19 period, but the fact is we are forced to purchase flowers at higher prices. Perhaps, flower growers and agents are trying to make up for the losses sustained in this period. We make only meagre profits," says Biju, who runs Sreelakshmi Flower Shop in the market. Reduced stock Sreekumaran, who runs SSK Flower Mart in Chala and is the joint secretary of the Trivandrum Florists Association, says the area under flower cultivation has come down during the pandemic period, reducing the stock and consequently leading to price rise. "Compared to the previous years, we are paying even double the price for some of the flowers. Most of the fairly bigger traders usually used to order a daily stock of 1 to 1.5 tonnes. But now, many of us are ordering 0.5 tonnes or even less a day," he says. Dindigul, Rayakottai, Hosur, Salem and Thovala are the major sources of flowers for the traders here. Earlier, college and school Onam celebrations, Athappookkalam competitions organised by various organisations and celebrations in government and private institutions ensured a steady business during the season for the florists. With schools and colleges remaining closed and offices now running with skeletal staff, there has hardly been any bulk purchase. Around 600 people involved in the flower trade in the city, including about 70 owners and the remaining workers, are part of the Trivandrum Florists Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-price-adds-to-woes-of-flower-traders-this-onam/article36027165.ece

Nazeer, directed the Director of General Education and the Joint Director (Examinations) to take steps for fresh revaluation of the English answer script and publish the results within a month. They were asked to make available to the petitioner the answer script of the Plus Two Physics practical examination as well and a photocopy of the document recording the marks. The petitioner, from Thrissur, had said in her complaint that she had obtained 97 marks in the English exam in plus One and was expecting more than 90 marks in the subject in Plus Two exam. However, she secured only 65 marks. Dissatisfied, she applied for revaluation and a copy of the answer script. Post-revaluation, she secured only 14 more marks. She then approached four experienced teachers with the answer script who told her she was eligible for 11 more marks. In Physics, she secured 72 out of 80 marks and A+ grade in Plus One. In Plus Two, she had 51 marks in theory and 33 in practical. After internal assessment marks were added, she lost out on A+ by four marks and could not join the course she had desired. Though she had applied for a copy of the answer script after revaluation and a copy of the Physics practical exam answer script, no step was taken, the petitioner said, seeking the commission’s intervention. ‘No mistake’ In a report, the Joint Director (Examinations) said there had been no mistake in the entry of her Physics practical marks. In English, revaluation had not been missed for any answer either. As her marks had increased after revaluation, a fresh revaluation was not possible. The exam notification issued by the higher secondary exam board each year specified that for practical examinations, revaluation, scrutiny, and photocopy facilities were not available, the official pointed out. The commission observed that while the petitioner’s arguments did not have much legal standing, she was denied the copy of the revalued answer scripts, and her marks did increase after revaluation. It was thus imperative that the answer scripts be revalued again to protect her best interests and ensure transparency. Denying her a copy of the revalued answer script was a violation of child rights, the commission said. Children had the right to know the details of revaluation and fresh revaluation. Only when they received the answer scripts would they be able to ascertain whether revaluation had been done well, the commission said. Right to know They also had the right to know where they had lost marks in the practical examinations, even though the exam manual did not allow for photocopies of the practical exam answer scripts to be given to them. Hence, if any student applied for records of higher secondary practical examination marks, these should be made available, and steps should be taken to amend the higher secondary exam manual, the commission said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/amend-exam-manual-panel/article36027163.ece
21 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Special Onam markets helped curb price rise, says Agri dept.||Over 4,200 tonnes of vegetables and fruits were procured from farmers for the Onasamriddhi special markets this year, said the Agriculture Department on Friday, adding that the markets helped keep vegetable prices within the affordable range during the festival season. The department had organised the four-day markets across the State from August 17 to August 20 as part of the government's market intervention programmes for Onam. The initiative was aimed at ensuring a fair price for farmers, the department said. Around 4,220 tonnes of vegetables and fruits were directly procured from farmers. This included 1,390 tonnes procured directly by the department, 2,230 tonnes through the Kerala State Horticultural Products Development Corporation (Horticorp) and 600 tonnes collected by the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council, Keralam (VFPCK). Subsidised rates The Onasamriddhi markets were successful in making traders tone down the exorbitant prices of many items in the open markets in all the districts, the department said. For the 2,000 markets, agricultural produce was procured at a 10% higher price from farmers, and were made available to customers at up to 30% subsidised rates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/special-onam-markets-helped-in-keeping-veggies-affordable/article36027168.ece
21 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||SHRC directs KTU registrar to investigate non-refund of fee||The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has directed the registrar of APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University to conduct a time-bound investigation to determine if there has been a violation of a University Grants Commission (UGC) order on return of fee and original certificates to a student. If there has been a lapse on the part of the college concerned, legal action should be taken. Acting on a petition from a student who got admission to a government college immediately after taking admission to a private college in the State capital, commission chairperson Antony Dominic said instances of technical education institutions denying fee refund or failing to return certificates in violation of students’ rights had come to its notice.  The student had said in her complaint that ACE Engineering College, Thiruvallam, took Rs. 44,000 from her, but was not returning the money or the certificates it had asked for. Panel seeks report The commission asked for a report from the KTU. Mr. Dominic said reports from the university made it clear that it adopted a lackadaisical attitude towards such complaints. He said the private college had violated the UGC direction of December 2016 that original certificates of students should not be kept with institutions. Redressal committee The order also contained clear guidelines on returning the fee to a student who had taken admission to another college. The UGC also directed that a committee be set up to address complaints related to issues mentioned in the order. But all these were violated. If a complaint redressal mechanism had not been set up, it should be formed, the commission said. Steps should be taken to amend the university laws, if necessary, to set up the committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/shrc-directs-ktu-to-probe-non-refund-of-fee/article36027169.ece
21 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||CPI(M), IUML exchange barbs over Taliban||The Taliban’s take over of Afghanistan seemed to have prompted the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] to trade barbs about the question of nationality and religion. CPI(M) Polit Bureau member M.A. Baby appeared to have provoked the purported exchange. Radical Islam In a Facebook post, the CPI(M) leader said that Taliban victory increases the possibility of radical Islam becoming a magnet for more citizens, including Keralites. He said the unwelcome trend would catalyse majoritarian politics. The working class could get crushed between the opposing political forces. Hence, it was the time to reinforce proletarian values and fight for the livelihood issues of the masses than quarrel over religion, Mr. Baby said. A corresponding Facebook post by IUML leader Abdu Rabb was widely touted as a counter to Mr. Baby’s averments. Mr. Rabb recalled the patriotic legacy of the IUML and its stellar contribution to nationhood. Quoting the late C.H. Muhammad Koya, Mr. Rabb said: “If Saudi Arabia, the custodian of Mecca and Medina, attacks India, we would stand with India.” The CPI(M) could not claim the same, Mr. Rabb said. Chinese connection During the 1962 Indo-China war, the CPI(M) had whitewashed Chinese aggression. E.M.S. Namboodiripad had infamously stated that Indian territory overrun by the Chinese was a disputed region over which both nations had aired claims. “EMS is not IUML’s role model in patriotism,” he said. Mr. Rabb said China, the ideological lodestar of the CPI(M), had already made overtures to the Taliban leadership for a slice of the Afghan pie. He accused the CPI(M) of encouraging Islamist forces in Kerala to undermine the IUML politically. “The CPI(M) might nurture a Taliban with Chinese help in Kerala merely to weaken the secular IUML for short-sighted political advantage,” he said.  Time to reinforce proletarian values and fight for livelihood issues of the masses than quarrel over religion.

Sudhakaran, MP, has said the Centre’s push to ramp up palm oil production will sound the death knell for coconut farmers in the State. The Centre’s move to extend oil palm plantation by an additional 6.5 lakh ha by 2026. Its refusal to promote coconut oil production has hit farmers hard. Coconut prices have plummeted over the years. Pest infestations and the high cost of production plagued coconut farmers. The Centre was unwilling to waive the debt incurred by coconut farmers. The Centre’s move to transform virgin land into oil palm plantations would destroy biodiversity and accelerate climate change. Biodiversity concerns He said Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand had abandoned palm oil production and were focused on reconverting the plantations to natural forests. India’s emphasis on extending oil palm plantation cover across the country was misplaced. He said the State government had failed to highlight the plight of coconut farmers.

The police also seized two earthmovers, eight two-wheelers, one car, and eight mobile phones used by the accused in the operations over the past several months. Superintendent of Police Fakkeerappa Kaginelli, displaying the equipment seized and producing the accused, told a press conference that the treasure hunting operations in Kanaganapalli, Roddam, and Yadiki were done with highly sophisticated equipment to reduce the amount of time they spend. “These gangs operated mostly in the vicinity of some ancient temple or other religious places where the locals believed huge amounts of gold and silver articles were tucked away by people in those times. Mostly believing in hearsay or in fortune-tellers from Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Telangana, the suspected treasure hunters mostly dug deep in and around temples,” Mr. Fakeerappa said. In majority of cases, these “treasure hunters” did not find anything worthwhile and it just became a vice for them by investing time and money in their eagerness to earn a fast buck, the SP said. The accused were unsuccessful in finding any treasure though they had made such attempts at several places in the past also, he added. “We could get all the videos of their efforts from their cellphones seized from the spot,” he added. Keshavaiah and Nagaraju in Daduluru village of Kanaganapalli mandal own 4.98 acres, where a large blackstone block existed with some writing on it in undeciphered language, which made them believe there was treasure underneath the slab, which prompted four persons to use an earthmover and dig the place. The Kanaganapalli police arrested them while the operations were going on in the night. At Roddankapalli village in Roddam mandal a “sasanam on a plaque” believed to be that of Sri Krishnadevaraya period, made B. Eswarappa believe that there was a treasure in the 1.98 acres of land owned by him in which the plaque existede. Six persons, including a mastermind from Tumkur in Karnataka, were arrested and an earthmover along with two two-wheelers were seized. In Yadiki mandal at Kundanakota old fort area, Kaluri Venkata Satyanarayana along with seven others acquired two different sets of sophisticated metal detectors, which reportedly could show if there was gold, silver, or diamonds and dug up at several places. Here too the Yadiki police nabbed eight persons, and seized four two-wheelers, a car, 2 metal detectors, and implements for digging.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/3-inter-state-treasure-hunting-gangs-busted-in-ap-18-held/article36026661.ece
21 August 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||2.38 lakh tonnes of coal missing in T.N.||Tamil Nadu Electricity Minister V. Senthilbalaji said on Friday that 2.38 lakh tonnes of coal, valued at Rs. 85 crore, was missing from TANGEDCO’s North Chennai Thermal Power Station (NCTPS) at Athipattu in Tiruvallur district instead of Ennore. After a meeting with officials at the power station, he told reporters that an initial investigation had revealed that 2.38 lakh tonnes of coal was present in the books but was missing from the stock. “If 5 tonnes or 10 tonnes of coal is missing, it is understandable. But 2.38 lakh tonnes is missing, though it is there in the records. Further investigation will be done, and we will find out how it went missing, and action will be taken against the guilty...,” Mr. Senthilbalaji said. Similar investigations were being done at the power plants at Thoothukudi and Mettur, and an initial report would be ready soon, he said. Accusing the AIADMK government of mismanagement, the Minister said TANGEDCO had good officers whose work was going down the drain owing to the wrongdoings of a few. “Whoever has done wrong will be punished,” he said. He said the DMK government would be transparent in its functioning, and all information relating to the Department of Electricity was being made available online. He said the AIADMK government had not undertaken any maintenance work at the power stations in the last nine months of its tenure. “In fact, the officers here [NCTPS] told me that no equipment for maintenance had been purchased in the last three years.” Faulty transformers The Minister said the department had identified transformers that had issues of high or low voltage in all 234 constituencies. “We have started the work to replace 8,900 such transformers at a cost of Rs. 625 crore. The work will be completed in three months.” Mr. Senthilbalaji said the customer care cell, ‘Minnagam’, had received 2.48 lakh complaints, of which 2.36 had been resolved. The rest were being processed. AIADMK’s response AIADMK leader and former Electricity Minister P. Thangamani said the irregularity was detected during his tenure itself. He told journalists in Namakkal that Mr. Senthilbalaji had only stated what was identified during the previous government. He said he had sent officers for an inspection at the plant after he was doubtful about the coal stock. He alleged that Mr. Senthilbalaji had deliberately used that report to show the AIADMK government in a bad light. However, he did not wish to go deeper into the issue as the Minister “has not mentioned any name”. He would welcome any action against wrongdoers and was ready to cooperate if action was taken in a “just manner”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/238-lakh-tonnes-of-coal-missing-in-tamil-nadu/article36026796.ece

A series of spells of rain in several mandals led to water stagnation in several villages. Deputy District Medical and Health Officer P.

The official said that as per the instructions of District Collector M. Hari Narayanan, the paramedical staff along with the civic staff at the panchyats and municipalities would promote the guidelines to observe dry-day on all Fridays, besides prompting the villagers to remove the water stagnation at the households and surroundings and at the public places as well.

21 August 2021||HUBBALLI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Minister’s faux pas puts soldier’s family in a fix||In a faux pas that resulted in a big embarrassment to himself and the ruling BJP, A. Narayanaswamy, Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, promised a government job and land to an ‘in-service’ soldier in Gadag, thinking he had been martyred. The incident took place during a programme organised as part of the ‘Janashirwad Yatra’ in Gadag district on Thursday. Later, it turned out that the statement was the result of a miscommunication between him and thelocal BJP leaders. As per the Minister’s itinerary, he was to visit the residence of a soldier at Mulagund in Gadag district. Mr. Narayanaswamy, who was behind schedule, was in a hurry when he reached Mulagund town along with local MP Shivakumar Udasi. Visiting the house of soldier Ravikumar Kattimani, who is presently deployed inJammu and Kashmir, the Minister enquired about the health and condition of the family members. And much to the shock and confusion of the family members, he announced that a government job would be provided to one of the family members, apart from land. Realising the faux pas by the Minister, a local party worker who was familiar with soldier immediately made a video call to Mr. Kattimani and asked the Minister to speak to him. Caught in an embarrassing situation, Mr. Narayanaswamy felicitated the family members and left. After leaving the soldier’s residence, the Minister is said to have taken the local leaders to task for providing him with wrong information that he was visiting the house of a martyr.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ministers-faux-pas-puts-soldiers-family-in-a-fix/article36026663.ece
21 August 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Robots at restaurant a big draw||Chitti blinks her eyes, manoeuvres around cautiously and brings your food to the table. At Chitti In Town, a restaurant in Dilsukhnagar here, the excitement of diners, children, and adults alike is palpable. Chitti In Town is a robot-integrated multi-cuisine restaurant, where sensor-equipped robots draped in saris deliver food to diners at the tables and interact with them by shaking hands. These robots make children feel they are a part of a movie like Wall-E or meeting a distant cousin of Chappie . All the robots are made in Hyderabad by HITEC City-based Vistan NextGen’s manufacturing unit. Currently, they use fibre glass for the body and are constructed manually in the manufacturing unit. Robot restaurants have made homes in other cities too — Robots in Chennai opened in 2017 while Robot Restaurant was started in 2019 in Bengaluru with Android-run robots. Hyderabad, too, has Robo Kitchen in Jubilee Hills. Chitti In Town, co-owned by Ganesh Reddy, Teja Kiran Srikanth and Padmaja Goud, has five autonomous robots delivering food and one interactive robot named MAiRA. IoT-enabled robots Restaurant robots leverage cognitive technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning as well as robotics with IoT (Internet of Things). The robot comes integrated with Alexa and Google Home, and is programmed with 6 basic interactive chatlines such as ‘What is your name?’, ‘How are you?’ and ‘Where do you stay?’. MAiRA is a multi-sensing intelligent robotic assistant also manufactured by Vistan NextGen. The interactive robots manufactured by the company are programmed to see, feel, and hear surroundings so that they can rapidly adapt to whatever environment they are placed in, says Ram Raju Singam of Vistan NextGen. Mr. Singam took close to 18 months to roll out robots from his production unit in Kukatpally. He says since the robots are made and put together by hand, it is slowing down production time. “The other deterrent was the skill gap. We also had to get our team trained to be able to manufacture robots in our factory. Up to 80% of the robots are made in our factories. We only import intelligent chips from abroad,” he adds. The company will soon be switching to a fully automated manufacturing process that will use thermoforming (the process of heating thermoplastic sheet to its softening point so that it be moulded) to manufacture the robots. Mr. Singam has now upgraded his machines and made use of fully automated machines to manufacture robots using ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene, a thermoplastic polymer) and  a thermoforming machine. The demand for robots is such that Mr. Singam and his team are working to meet demand across India, UK, Canada and Australia. Within India, Mr. Singam says he has got orders from places like Tirupati and Warangal, where robot-integrated restaurants are coming up. “Real estate companies are looking at integrating robots for home tours for clients, too,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/robots-at-restaurant-a-big-draw/article36026660.ece
21 August 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Hyderabad Municipal corporation certified Water Plus||The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has been certified as Water Plus by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MOHUA) on Friday. It has become the first local body of Telangana to achieve this coveted status in the Swachh Bharat certifications, a statement from the GHMC said. The certifications ranged from ODF (Open Defecation Free), ODF+, ODF++ and Water+, of which the GHMC had already achieved ODF++ status. For this certification, the GHMC was assessed through third party inspections against nine indicators, respectively with regard to safe discharge of sewage, safe cleaning practices, mechanical equipment support, treatment capacities, reuse of treated water, maintenance of drains, cost recovery, grievance redress mechanism, and establishment of sanitation authority and response units. Sewage treatment plants The GHMC statement has attributed the certification to the 25 sewage treatment plants set up by the HMWS&SB and three by the HMDA for treatment of waste water released from households and commercial establishments. A total of 772 million litres of sewage per day is effectively treated in all these STPs, before being discharged, it claimed. The treated water is reused for parks, construction of roads, and public toilets before being let downstream for agricultural needs. This is in line with the government’s focus on water conservation and reuse in consonance with Sustainable Development Goals on clean water and sanitation, the note said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/greater-hyderabad-municipal-corporation-certified-water-plus/article36026666.ece
21 August 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Investors want quick resolution of litigation’||Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana on Friday said that industries and investors want to experience an ease of business and expect a quick and amicable resolution of disputes. The CJI was speaking at the registration of trust deed of the International Arbitration and Mediation Centre, Hyderabad, a first in India. “The reason is industries and investors in India, or anywhere, want to have an ease of business, and don’t want to have litigation. By any chance, if they are involved in litigation, they expect it to be resolved peacefully, amicably, without expenses, and time lag, so their investments are safe,” he said, underscoring the concerns of investors. Describing former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao as a ‘Telangana bidda’ and the ‘father of economic reforms’, the CJI said that it was he who set the wheels in motion for arbitration procedures. He recalled that investors at that time were concerned about duration of litigation, and were of the opinion that they were buying ‘both properties and litigation’. “So at that point of time, the honourable Prime Minister initiated a new law. In 1996, Arbitration and Conciliation Act came into force. Thereafter, a movement started for arbitration conciliation and mediation procedures,” he said. Justice L. Nageswara Rao of the Supreme Court said that in the west, around 75% of arbitration were done by accredited institutions. He said that though there are advantages of ad-hoc arbitration, in comparison to institutional arbitration, they have their problems. Justice Rao said that the advantages of this centre are that international arbitrators with specialised experience would be appointed, and the proceedings would be monitored, and fee decided by the Centre. Chief Justice of the Telangana High Court Justice Hima Kohli said, “It is a special day for us. It is not too often that these defining moments take place when the judiciary and the executive join hands to create a bridge. This is a special bridge because it is a subject that is close to the heart of the judiciary, alternate disputes resolution. Any platform that is created to promote this will always be close to us.” Justice R. Subhash Reddy of the Supreme Court and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao also spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/investors-want-quick-resolution-of-litigation/article36027053.ece

21 August 2021||KOLLAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Palm oil plan enthuses Kerala farmers||National Mission on Edible Oils-Oil Palm (NMEO-OP), a Rs. 11,040-crore project by the Union government to maximize cultivation and production, is expected to bring in remarkable growth prospects for the palm oil industry in the State. While both farmers and refiners find the scheme extremely encouraging, it can also revitalise the estates run by Oil Palm India Limited and Plantation Corporation of Kerala. Since India is heavily dependent on imports when it comes to crude and refined palm oils, the industry stakeholders believe that the current development will be highly beneficial for the sector. 6.5 lakh ha more The NMEO-OP proposes to extend cultivation of oil palm, considered a top oil crop, to an additional 6.5 lakh hectare so that the crude palm oil (CPO) production touches 11.20 lakh tonnes by the 2025-26 financial year. In the total financial outlay of Rs. 11,040 crore, the share of the Centre will be Rs. 8,844 crore while the State share of Rs. 2,196 crore includes the viability gap funding as well. Reportedly, the State government was considering some projects to expand cultivation even before the scheme was announced. Wayanad, Palakkad Potential sites for cultivation were identified in Wayanad and Palakkad districts while projects to rope in more farmers are also being discussed. “COVID-19 had affected the industry like any other sector, but even before that the situation was not good. But now rubber farmers seem interested in switching to oil palm and the new scheme will attract more. I think all these new developments will definitely revive the sector by 2022,” says Vijayan Kunissery, former chairman, Oil Palm India Limited. Oil Palm India Limited maintains a 3,500 ha plantation in the State while Plantation Corporation of Kerala has a 705-ha estate. While NMEO-OP offers a special assistance for the rejuvenation of old gardens, it is also expected generate more employment in the sector. First State “Kerala is the first State in India to start oil palm cultivation and later it spread to 12 more States. But our domestic production is very limited and we import huge quantities from countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. In Kerala, we have plantations, factories, seed farms and research facilities, but so far the Centre had opted to neglect the State. We need a strong strategy to attain self-reliance and if we can exploit all the possibilities, the State will be able to produce a considerable volume of oil. With adequate support from Centre we can produce oil required for at least four States,” says S. Jayamohan, trade union leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/palm-oil-plan-enthuses-kerala-farmers/article36026668.ece

Sriraj has been suspended from the primary membership of the party with immediate effect. APCC’s Disciplinary Committee chairman L. Eswara Rao issued the suspension order on Friday. “Mr. Sriraj’s act of frying a quail bird symbolising a Twitter bird and sending it through courier to the Twitter headquarters in Mumbai, and calling it a unique protest against the suspension of party leader Rahul Gandhi’s Twitter account has brought disrepute to the party,” Mr. Eswara Rao said in the order. Cardinal principles Mr. Rao said the principles of honesty and non-violence were integral part of the Congress party from the times of Mahatma Gandhi. The party, at no point, had lost sight of these values, and they were intact to this day. Pointing to the video shared by Mr. Sriraj, which showed him torturing a bird in the name of Twitter bird and frying it in oil in full public view, was in bad taste and had tarnished the image of the party. Reminding him how important it was for everybody to follow the party ideology, Mr. Rao said, “You have become accustomed to using Rahul Gandhi’s name in a way that degrades the values of the party.” Stating that the Congress party condemned the act, Mr. Rao said, at the behest of the All-India Congress Committee, he was suspending Mr. Sriraj from the primary membership of the party with immediate effect. Mr. Sriraj is the son of former MP Harsha Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cong-suspends-sriraj-from-partys-primary-membership/article36027266.ece
21 August 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Alla blames Naidu for ‘poor’ state of schools||Taking serious objection to adverse reports in a section of the media on the condition of schools vis-a-vis the implementation of ‘Mana Badi - Nadu Nedu’ programme, Mangalagiri MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy has said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is committed to reforming the education system by completely overhauling it. “Former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu should be blamed for the poor condition of schools. They are now being given a facelift to bring them on a par with private schools,” Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy told the media at the YSRCP central office on Friday. He said 57,000 government schools were being spruced up at a cost of Rs. 17,000 crore. Of them, 15,175 were revamped under Phase-1 of the programme at a cost of Rs. 3,700 crore, he added. Nearly Rs. 13 crore was spent on the programme in Mangalagiri constituency alone in the first phase, he said. Enrolment of students in the government schools across the State increased from 37.20 lakh to 43.43 lakh, he added.

21 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Prevalence of non-communicable diseases high in A.P., Telangana’||Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have 16.19% prevalence of key Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), which is higher than the national average of 11.62%, according to a primary healthcare survey report released by the Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM). The apex trade association, as part of its ‘Illness to Wellness’ campaign, unveiled the findings of the report followed by a virtual panel discussion on ‘Non-Communicable Diseases: The New Health Challenges for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana’ on Friday. The report revealed that these States particularly had a higher prevalence of NCDs such as hypertension, digestive diseases, diabetes and neurological diseases, as compared to the national average. High stress levels, workplace pollution and dietary habits were said to be leading to the ailments. However, prevalence of heart diseases, cancer, digestive diseases and respiratory diseases were found to be lower in the two Telugu-speaking States compared to the national average prevalence rate for these diseases. Senior Consultant Physician, Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad, C.H. Vasanth Kumar, cautioned that NCDs were a real threat to human life as they affect everyone, irrespective of age and financial status. K.S. Soma Sekhar Rao, Consultant Gastroenterologist and Hepatologist, Department of Medical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Apollo Health City, Hyderabad, said an unhealthy gut was the mother of all diseases and “we must take good care of our gut from a very young age for a long healthy life.” Founder and Director, Total Care Control, Rajesh Kesari, said NCDs were an impediment to socio-economic development.

21 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Release White Paper on State’s finances: TDP||Telugu Desam Party MLC P. Ashok Babu has demanded that the State Government release a White Paper on the State’s financial situation in view of the alarming reports that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken a very serious view of the excessive loans taken by it in violation of the rules and FRBM limits. Addressing a press conference on Friday, Mr. Babu said the State government was in such a position that it could not even pay the salaries to its employees next month. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy owed an explanation to the people on the deep financial crisis and resultant reports about the Prime Minister’s concern. The government and the ruling YSRCP leaders were propagating lies on the loans of the State. In just two years, the YSRCP regime availed itself of over Rs. 2.40 lakh crore worth loans. The overall debt burden of the State now came to over Rs. 5 lakh crore. The government got Rs. 2 lakh crore revenue in the past two years, while it spent Rs. 95,000 crore on the welfare programmes. The Union government was now stopping all new loans just because the State government was taking massive loans disproportionate to its revenue. “If the Chief Minister does not clarify, it would be deemed that the Prime Minister had taken a serious view,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/release-white-paper-on-states-finances-tdp/article36027265.ece

21 August 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||Too early to decide on booster dose: experts||Medical experts in the city say it is too early to take a call on a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, even as the United States has decided to administer a booster shot to its citizens eight months after the second dose. So far in India, only over 50 crore people have taken at least one dose, while in Viskhapatnam district, around 26 lakh were given at least one dose. “To even begin considering a booster dose or a third dose, at least 80% of the entire population should be fully vaccinated,” Andhra Medical College Principal and District COVID-19 Special Officer Prof. P.V. Sudhakar said. After 80% of the population is fully vaccinated and if the antibodies drop after eight months, a booster dose can be thought of, he said. Right now, research is on to verify the prevalence of antibodies after two doses. There is not enough data or scientific evidence to suggest the need for a booster dose as of now, said senior doctors at KGH. “Moreover, there is a false perception that the third dose could be a Moderna or Pfizer or any other vaccine such as Sputnik. The third dose or booster shot should be the same vaccine that was administered for the first and second dose, be it Covishield or Covaxin, as these were the only two vaccines available and being administered as of now,” pointed out Dr. Sudhakar. According to him, a clearer picture will emerge probably by early next year when there will be enough scientific data to suggest if a booster dose will be required. Monoclonal cocktail Another factor highlighted by the doctors in treating COVID patients was the use of a monoclonal cocktail for developing antibodies. The treatment for COVID-19 is evolving every passing day and clinical experiments using monoclonal cocktail on patients has shown good results, said Dr. Muhammad Adrish, associate professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, USA. He was speaking at the weekly webinar organised by Andhra Medical College. The monoclonal cocktail is nothing but a combination of two drugs such as Casirivimab and Imdevimab, and it should be given in the initial days of COVID-19 to enhance the monoclonal antibodies, said Dr. Sudhakar. COVID update Meanwhile, the district recorded 97 new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours ending Friday morning, taking the total count to 1,54,681 cases. With no deaths being recorded, the death count stands at 1,068. In the same period, 82 persons suffering from COVID tested negative, taking the recoveries to 1,52,296. Active cases now stand at 1,317.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/too-early-to-decide-on-booster-dose-experts/article36027334.ece

Representatives of the organisations who are scheduled to meet Collector A. Suryakumari on Saturday planned to give a detailed presentation to her for the speedy progress of the city. According to them, Prince Wallice Market (PW Market) located in the heart of the city has become congested, causing a lot of inconvenience for customers as well as traders. The market, built 100 years ago, does not have wide roads for the free movement of heavy vehicles. Business is affected in almost all 200 shops with the continuous presence of vehicles on narrow roads. Moreover, the traders are forced to pay extra charges due to delay in loading and unloading of goods. “Apart from continuing the existing market, the government should explore opportunities to develop new markets on the Raipur-Vizianagaram-Visakhapatnam route. The government can study various big markets located in Guntur, Malakpet of Hyderabad and other places. The initiative will reduce traffic congestion in PW Market and lead to more business activity,” said Kapuganti Prakash, president-elect of Vizianagaram Chamber of Commerce for 2022. AITUC district secretary Bugata Ashok said that the interests of the workers of PW Market should be protected if the government wants to develop new business regions, adjacent to Vizianagaram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/new-markets-need-of-the-hour-for-fort-city/article36027290.ece

Sources said that Neelachalam, 38, a labourer, allegedly hanged himself to death in the wee hours of the day worried over mounting debts. Even as his relatives made the funeral arrangements, the son of the deceased reportedly refused to perform the final rites over a ‘grudge’ against the latter.

21 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||6th unit of Srisailam Left Bank station to be ready next year||It was exactly a year ago that the 6×150 megawatt Srisailam Left Bank Hydro Electric Station went into flames that started with a spark in the panel board of the fourth unit, leaving the power project out of service in the middle of the flood season when hydel generation takes place in full capacity. Taking the incident, which left nine persons dead, including seven employees and two members of a contract agency, and leaving the unit out of service, in its stride, the Telangana State Power Generation Corporation Ltd (TS Genco) had put back into service five of the six units with minimal costs in a phased manner from the last week of October 2020. “Setting aside doubts over the revival of the power station with speculation of huge losses running into thousands of crores, the engineers of TS Genco in association with private partners (material suppliers) could revive two units (1 and 2) in just two months after the incident. Two more units (5 and 6) were brought back into service in the next three months before the pandemic affecting the remaining work,” director (hydel) of the power utility Ch. Venkata Rajam told The Hindu . One more unit (3) was brought back into service in mid-May by sourcing the material required locally. The revival of the five units cost the TS Genco only about Rs. 20 crore. However, the revival of the sixth unit (4) is getting delayed right from the beginning, again due to COVID restrictions on international travel for the arrival of engineers from the Japanese firm that supplied the equipment. “After the engineers from Japan reached, the unbundling of the unit took time to ascertain the extent of the exact damage. The generator in the unit was found to be badly-damaged but the turbine was intact,” another Genco engineer explained. The authorities then decided to replace the core and winding in the generator. After finalising the agency for the work through tenders, designs and drawings were being finalised to fabricate the material, Mr. Rajam said. He said that the unit could be ready for generation in the next flood season. He stated that they have modernised the exhaust and ventilation systems to prevent such mishaps in future. Asked about the internal committee report on the incident, he said that the report along with the recommendations were submitted already but was yet to be approved and added that they were also replacing the existing SCADA system in the power station with a modern one.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/6th-unit-of-srisailam-left-bank-station-to-be-ready-next-year/article36027070.ece

As per the details, the land property admeasuring 6,357 square yards near the Ranga Reddy district court complex in survey numbers 13, 14, and 15 was allotted to Deccan Chronicle Holdings Limited in the year 2009, at Rs. 7,000 per square yard, which was much lower than the prevailing government registration value of Rs. 18,000 per square yard. DCHL, which obtained the land citing the needs of media enterprise, ran into troubles later. Eventually, the property was attached by the Enforcement Directorate in relation to the legal wrangles faced by the media organisation. Mr. Rao sought to know how the attached property had changed hands before the builder started construction there. “We requested for the file related to the land allocation orders under the RTI, but got a reply saying the file went missing during State bifurcation. We wrote to the GHMC and the HMDA to share the building permission, but haven’t got any reply,” Mr. Rao said. Chief City Planner S.Devender Reddy, upon enquiry, said no permission has been given to the said construction. Remarks from HMDA were sought over the application seeking building permission, which are yet to come, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-leader-questions-illegal-construction/article36027036.ece
21 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||SCR falls behind in vaccination goals||The Railways’ grand plan to have the entire workforce, including families, vaccinated against COVID-19 by July-end is unlikely to be achieved by end of this month too, considering the manner in which vaccination has been taken up so far. An official circular issued by the Railway Board last month to general managers of the 17 zones sought expedition of the vaccination process but since the vaccine supply is totally dependent on the State governments, it was simply not possible. Till date, for 90,000-odd employees of South Central Railway (SCR), more than 64,000 got the first dose while over 26,000 got the second dose. Even contractual employees are covered in this vaccination process but senior officials admitted that inoculation happens as and when the vaccine supplies come in from the respective State health departments. Apart from these about 32,000 retired railway personnel and family members took the first dose and 14,000 the second dose. “Many got the jabs on their own from other sources, both government and private, as there was no certainty regarding the availability of the vaccine in the railway health units,” they said, wishing to remain anonymous. Reimbursement The Railway Board even offered to reimburse Rs. 780 for each vaccine dose taken in private hospitals despite the vaccine price being higher than that. Apparently, the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh government has been far more forthcoming in ensuring that more vaccine doses were available to the railway personnel, helping close to 90% of the target groups get the jabs in the Vijayawada, Guntur and Guntakal divisions. “We have met top Telangana government functionaries and appealed for more supplies but even they are constrained with limited or non-reliable supplies,” pointed out senior officials. “Vaccination rate among staff working in the smaller centres is also poor because they have to travel to the headquarters without any official leave sanctioned. Or, they are at the mercy of the local health authorities,” they claimed. This has got the unions worked up. “We are the biggest government organisation but are forced to depend on States’ vaccine allotment. We have been running services continuously and our staff have braved the first and second waves in ensuring essential goods, including oxygen, and passengers got moving, yet we have not been even being considered as frontline workers by the Centre,” charged SCR Mazdoor Union general secretary Ch. Shankar Rao. He opines that this had happened despite the Central government employees “sponsoring” the whole vaccination drive for 130 crore citizens as they took a day’s salary cut for COVID donation, and benefits like dearness allowance amounting to Rs. 38,000 crore was denied for 18 months. Besides, many lost their lives during this period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/scr-falls-behind-in-vaccination-goals/article36027044.ece
21 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Post death of 2 workers, civic body scores 100% on safety||Over a fortnight after two hapless workers died in a sewerage manhole at Vanasthalipuram, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has topped the scores for ‘Safe cleaning of sewer and septic tanks through mechanised equipment and availability of PPEs/safety equipment in case [of] manual entry..’ during third party assessment for ‘Water+’ status given by the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. Full marks The civic body passed the muster by scoring 20 out of 20 allotted marks for the said indication, against which the certification mentioned that availability of mechanised equipment and PPE/safety equipment was 76% to 100%. The two workers who died of asphyxiation after entering the manhole, reportedly at the contractor’s behest, did not wear any of the PPE gear, neither were they supported by oxygen. Safety gear While GHMC officials categorically denied having given permission to the contractor to employ manual labour, fact of the matter is that the corporation does not spell out use of safety gear or PPE during sewer/drain cleaning operations as one of the conditions in its tender documents. Sewage discharge GHMC scored cent per cent in all the nine categories -- assessed with 94% safe discharge of sewage, 75 to 100% of required capacity for mechanised cleaning, 76 to 100% treatment capacity and operational efficiency, 100% maintenance of municipal drains, 100 percent recovery of operational and maintenance cost, and 90 to 100% grievance resolution.

21 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Dissent crushed under TRS family rule: BJP leader||“In the last seven years, democratic values deteriorated in Telangana going by the manner in which the Assembly proceedings are conducted, and dissent is sought to be crushed with the first family of TRS having a stranglehold in power,” said senior BJP leader P. Muralidhar Rao on Friday. “We expected democracy to deepen and strengthen with the formation of the State of Telangana but it has gone the other way due to the ‘machinations’ of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. There is lot of discontent among the youth and the unemployed due to lack of education and employment opportunities in the State,” he said. Addressing a press conference at the party office, he said that the government has neither been able to generate fresh employment nor has filled the existing vacancies much to the frustration of the youth. “There is a lot of hollow propaganda about the welfare schemes for SCs and weaker sections as these sections have been affected the most in these years,” he said. Mr. Rao accused the TRS government of pushing the State into a debt trap with nothing much to show for development. “This is not a government that will change with criticism or questioning. So, it needs to be thrown off power. Other Opposition parties are also feudal and family-ruled ones. BJP alone can take on TRS,” he claimed. “The proposed ‘Mahasangram Yatra’ of party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar next week is going to be ‘Jana Chaitanya Yatra’ to convince people about the need for a political change just like Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought about changes in the country,” he said on Friday, and released the logo and publicity material for the tour programme of the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/dissent-crushed-under-trs/article36027076.ece

21 August 2021||Mumbai,||‘I have been made a scapegoat in phone call leak controversy’||IPS officer Rashmi Shukla told the Bombay High Court on Friday that she was made a scapegoat in the alleged leak of phone calls regarding transfers of police officials. A Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and N.J. Jamadar was hearing a criminal petition filed by Ms. Shukla seeking to quash the FIR and charges against her under the Indian Telegraph Act and the Official Secrets Act. The FIR filed by an unidentified person has booked Ms. Shukla for leaking confidential documents related to corruption in police transfers in Maharashtra. Senior advocate Mahesh Jethamalani, representing Ms. Shukla, contended that she was illegally transferred from the State Intelligence Department as Director General Civil Defence, a post that did not exist prior to her transfer. Mr. Jethamalani said, “I have not challenged that, but I am pointing this out to show mala fides. Ms. Shukla has not been paid since January. This is the treatment meted out to one of the most upright officers.” Mr. Jethamalani said she was made a scapegoat for this alleged leak. The whole reason for filing this FIR was to prevent transfer of documents from the State to the Central Bureau of Investigation. He said the intercepted calls were about the transfer of 150 police officers of whom nine postings were being bargained through brokers. Mr. Jethamalani will continue his arguments on Saturday. Letter by Fadnavis The case dates back to March, when Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra cited a letter allegedly written by Ms. Shukla to the then Maharashtra Director General of Police Subodh Jaiswal about alleged corruption in police transfers. The letter is believed to have relied upon leaked conversations by Ms. Shukla. Thereafter, Maharashtra Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte, in a report to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, alleged that Ms. Shukla had leaked the confidential report to Mr. Fadnavis which led to the FIR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/i-have-been-made-a-scapegoat-in-phone-call-leak-controversy/article36026945.ece

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the Centre had yet again rejected the high-level committee of medical experts set up by the Delhi government to get to the bottom of the matter. Raj Niwas termed Mr. Sisodia’s allegations “misleading” while the Delhi BJP accused the AAP government of floating conspiracy theories to hide its own failure when it came to ensuring adequate supply of oxygen during the second wave. “The Delhi government has constituted a panel to probe the number of deaths... so that the reason behind these deaths could be investigated and compensation of Rs. 5 lakh could be given to the families of the victims, but the Lieutenant- Governor has yet again rejected this committee,” Mr. Sisodia told reporters. The L-G is of the view that no oxygen-scarcity deaths occurred in Delhi, so there is no need to form an inquiry committee, he alleged Mr. Sisodia said that on the one hand, the Centre was asking States for details on oxygen-scarcity deaths, and on the other was not approving the inquiry committee to investigate the matter. “It is a matter of shame that in the 21st Century, the Centre is saying there should be no probe into such deaths. During April-May, the gross mismanagement of oxygen by the Centre, whether deliberate or unintentional, is a matter of investigation,” he added. “The Centre is responsible for the mismanagement of oxygen. Today, it is trying to hide the facts by avoiding a probe,” said Mr. Sisodia.  All for probe: Raj Niwas Sources from Raj Niwas, however, sought to clarify that neither the L-G nor the Centre had said that deaths due to oxygen shortage “should not be probed.” In both instances related to the formation of an inquiry panel by the Delhi government — first on July 6 and then on August 8 — the AAP government was told that a panel constituted as per Supreme Court directions was already looking into the matter, said Raj Niwas sources, This committee has submitted its interim report and is working on the final report, the sources added. The L-G and the Union Health Minister had reiterated that this panel should be “allowed to do its work” and that setting up another committee for the same purpose “will only create confusion”. Responding to this, the Delhi government alleged it was clear that the L-G’s office, “under Centre’s pressure”, was trying to scuttle any probe into the deaths. “The scope of the panel set up by the SC is only to look at oxygen supply issues in Delhi, not to probe the oxygen-scarcity deaths,” the Delhi government alleged. “Why is the Centre on the one hand asking us to submit data on the deaths, and on the other hand using the L-G office to stop us from compiling this data? Why is the Centre so desperate to hide the truth regarding these deaths” the Delhi government demanded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/panel-on-oxygen-scarcity-deaths-rejected-by-centre-again-sisodia/article36026933.ece
21 August 2021||New Delhi,||AAP govt. notifies policy to be self-reliant in medical oxygen||The Delhi government on Friday notified the Medical Oxygen Production Promotion Policy of Delhi, 2021, with an aim to make the city self-reliant in the production of medical oxygen. According to the government, the policy will ensure time -bound fulfilment of the requirement of medical oxygen by incentivising early investment in the production and storage infrastructure for medical oxygen. “The Aam Aadmi Party government is committed towards strengthening its healthcare infrastructure and has a vision to make Delhi self-reliant in times of crisis. The policy provides several incentives to the private sector to set up oxygen production plants and storage facilities,” Health Minister Satyendar Jain said. “This will help us tackle the problem of oxygen shortage in the future and avert a crisis like we saw in the past. The Delhi government is preparing to combat any future waves of COVID-19 on a war-footing and is devoted towards ensuring that it is better equipped for any such crisis,” he added The objectives of the policy include making Delhi self-reliant in medical oxygen production and supply by setting up new manufacturing enterprises or expanding the production capacity of existing units. It also seeks to facilitate storage and transportation of medical oxygen, and setting up of liquid oxygen manufacturing facilities of minimum 50 MT capacity, up to a total of 100 MT, and of non-captive oxygen generation plants of minimum 10 MT and maximum 50 MT capacity, up to a total of 100 MT.  Cryogenic tankers Captive oxygen generation plants of minimum 500 LPM (flow rate) capacity at hospitals and nursing homes to cater to their peak demand for medical oxygen up to a total capacity of 200 MT will also be set up, the government stated. It will also seek the setting up of cryogenic tankers of minimum 10 MT capacity for exclusive purpose of ferrying liquid medical oxygen (LMO) up to a total capacity of 500 MT and LMO storage tanks of minimum 10 MT capacity up to a total capacity of 1,000 MT.  The policy will help us tackle the problem of oxygen shortage in the future and avert a crisis like we saw in the past Satyendar Jain Delhi Health Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/aap-govt-notifies-policy-to-be-self-reliant-in-medical-oxygen/article36026931.ece
21 August 2021||New Delhi,||Nod for CBI probe into DTC scam spells downfall of AAP govt.: BJP||The Delhi BJP on Friday said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is “neck-deep in corruption’ and that the Centre’s nod for a CBI probe into the alleged ‘multi-crore DTC scam’ was the beginning of the AAP government’s downfall. State unit president Adesh Gupta said the Ministry of Home Affair’s recommendation for a probe by the CBI was “not an ordinary thing” as there was a similar CBI probe which had led to the discovery of the Commonwealth Games scam in 2010. “There are direct charges against Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot. People will surely throw this government out in next year’s municipal corporation elections,” Mr. Gupta said, adding that Mr. Gahlot and all officials responsible for the scam should be sacked before the agency begins its probe. ‘Suppressing issue’ Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said when Rohini BJP MLA Vijender Gupta had raised the matter in the House he was not allowed to speak. “From the very beginning, the Kejriwal-led government had been trying to suppress the issue,” Mr. Bidhuri said. Mr. Gupta, who filed a complaint related to the case on the basis of which the CBI probe has been ordered, alleged that when the entire country was grappling with the pandemic, Mr. Kejriwal, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and Mr. Gahlot were hatching a conspiracy to take out Rs. 3,500 crore from the State exchequer in the name of maintenance of buses. “It is for the first time that a politician was made the head of DTC so that the siphoned off money in this manner could be easily digested,” Mr. Gupta said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/nod-for-cbi-probe-into-dtc-scam-spells-downfall-of-aap-govt-bjp/article36026936.ece
21 August 2021||New Delhi,||BJP robbed civic bodies of Rs. 2,640 crore, says AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday accused the BJP of having “robbed” the Capital’s civic bodies of Rs. 2,640 crore by using the advertisement sites under them without “paying a penny”. AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said each hoarding costs around Rs. 1 lakh-Rs. 2 lakh to put up and the BJP had installed countless hoardings “for free”. “Every road of Delhi bears proof of BJP’s corruption and every resident is a witness to their scams. Most of the hoardings, especially the ones put up on municipal sites, belong to the BJP,” Mr. Bhardwaj said, adding: “These hoardings are put up at municipal sites, which are supposed to be paid for, but they don’t. Crores of rupees, which can be earned from these hoardings, are robbed by the BJP. The BJP politicians don’t pay a single penny for these hoardings.” In response, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said Mr. Bhardwaj had raised the issue to try and shift focus from the “burning topic” of the CBI inquiry being initiated in the Delhi government’s alleged DTC bus purchase scam. “It will be better if Mr. Bhardwaj, instead of raising frivolous issues, tells the people of Delhi how the DTC caravan has been looted in the last seven years. The people of Delhi are not interested in frivolous issues but want to know the Delhi government’s reply on the DTC scam,” Mr. Kapoor said. Meanwhile, former North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash accused the Delhi government of having “consumed” wheat and rice meant for students studying in municipal schools. “It is the responsibility of the Delhi government to provide wheat and rice to corporation schools in the dry ration kit. The North body has been continuously writing letters to the Delhi government since April 6 to provide wheat and rice,” Mr. Jai Prakash alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-robbed-civic-bodies-of-rs-2640-crore-says-aap/article36026929.ece
21 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi reports zero deaths, 57 fresh infections||The Capital recorded no deaths due to COVID-19, according to the health bulletin released on Friday. This is the eleventh time since the start of the second wave of the pandemic in Delhi that zero fatalities have been logged over a 24-hour period. A total of 57 new cases were reported, taking the tally to 14,37,274 on Friday. As many as 73,718 tests were conducted over the past 24 hours and the test positivity rate was 0.08%. The death toll remains at 25,079. Over 14.11 lakh patients have recovered from the virus and there are 459 active cases in the city, up from 448 on Thursday. The number of people under home isolation is 135, and the number of containment zones has gone up to 237. On Thursday, only 25 new cases of COVID-19 were reported — the lowest since April 15, 2020. Since April 19, 2021, both daily cases and single-day deaths count had been spiralling up, with over 28,000 cases and 277 deaths recorded on April 20; rising to 306 fatalities on April 22. On May 3, the city registered a record 448 deaths. However, the number of cases have shown a downward trend and the positivity rate too has been shrinking in the last several weeks. The number of deaths per day, has also been showing a decline in the last several days. Vaccination drive Under the vaccination drive on Friday, 1,44,929 beneficiaries were vaccinated over 24 hours out of which 1,06,733 received their first dose. A total of 1,21,00,127 beneficiaries have been vaccinated out of which 34,29,474 have received both doses. The government said the vaccine stock will last two days and that it has 2,04,990 doses of Covaxin and 2,02,280 doses of Covishield left as on Friday morning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-reports-zero-deaths-57-fresh-infections/article36026938.ece
21 August 2021||Pune,||Dabholkar murder: hearing on framing of charges postponed||A special court on Friday adjourned till September 3 the hearing of arguments on the framing of charges in the Dr. Narendra Dabholkar murder after the defence counsel submitted that the CBI had not furnished the accused with a copy of the 2017 report from the Gujarat Directorate of Forensic Science (DFS) which had analysed the firearm retrieved from one of the alleged shooters in the case. Advocate Prakash Salsingikar, counsel for Sanatan Sanstha member Vikram Bhave, one of the five charged accused, submitted an application before the court of Special UAPA Judge S.R. Navandar seeking the Gujarat DFS report, which the CBI had submitted to the Bombay High Court in January 2017. Advocate Mr. Salsingikar said neither was a copy of the report given to the accused as per the Bombay High court directions nor was it submitted by the agency to the special court. “We brought it to the court’s notice the Bombay High Court’s order of January 20, 2017, pertaining to the Gujarat DFS’ report and submitted that the CBI must clarify its position on whether or not it was relying on this report. The CBI itself had earlier pointed to contradictions between the ballistic report from the Gujarat DFS and that received form the Forensic Science Laboratory in Mumbai,” Mr. Salsingikar told The Hindu . The judge asked CBI’s counsel Prakash Suryawanshi about the report, to which the latter said he would consult the investigating officer and make a submission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/dabholkar-murder-hearing-on-framing-of-charges-postponed/article36026944.ece
21 August 2021||Kabul,||Reports of targeted Taliban killings spark Afghans’ fears||Reports of targeted killings in areas overrun by the Taliban mounted on Friday, fuelling fears that they will return Afghanistan to the repressive rule they imposed when they were last in power, even as they urged imams to push a message of unity at Friday’s prayers. Terrified that the militants would commit such abuses and despairing for their country’s future, thousands have raced to Kabul’s airport and border crossings. Others have taken to the streets to protest the takeover. An Amnesty International report provided more evidence on Friday that undercut the Taliban’s claims they have changed. The rights group said that its researchers spoke to eyewitnesses in Ghazni province who recounted how the Taliban killed nine ethnic Hazara men in the village of Mundarakht from July 4 to 6. It said six of the men were shot, and three were tortured to death. Hazaras are Shia Muslims who were previously persecuted by the Taliban and who made major gains in education and social status in recent years. The brutality of the killings was “a reminder of the Taliban’s past record, and a horrifying indicator of what Taliban rule may bring,” said Agnes Callamard, the head of Amnesty International. It warned that many more killings may have gone unreported because the Taliban cut cellphone services in many areas they’ve captured. Separately, Reporters without Borders expressed alarm at the news that Taliban fighters killed the family member of an Afghan journalist working for German’s Deutsche Welle on Wednesday. The broadcaster said fighters conducted house-to-house searches for their reporter, who had already relocated to Germany. Meanwhile, RHIPTO Norwegian Center for Global Analyses, which provides information to the UN, said it obtained evidence that the Taliban have rounded up Afghans on a blacklist of people they believe worked for the previous administration or with U.S.-led forces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/reports-of-targeted-taliban-killings-spark-afghans-fears/article36026608.ece
21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Both Trump and Biden administrations responsible for Afghan situation’||A concerted international commitment is necessary to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, says  Lisa Curtis  , former South and Central Asia Director of the U.S. National Security Council, says. In an interview, Ms. Curtis, who is currently Director of the Indo Pacific Security Program at the Center for New American Security, discusses what led to the current situation with the Taliban, the U.S.’ counterterrorism interests, and the future of U.S.-Pakistan ties. Excerpts from the interview:  I wanted to talk to you about Afghanistan. Very broadly, what went wrong? Could anybody have foreseen that the Afghan security forces would not really fight back? Well, look, I think there are several factors that have contributed to the disaster that we’re seeing today. And I think both the Trump and the Biden administrations bear responsibility for the way things are playing out. First, there was a very weak agreement that was negotiated with the Taliban during the Trump administration. It undermined the legitimacy of the government, by being weighed very heavily toward the Taliban. The U.S. forced [Afghan President Ashraf] Ghani to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners, before the Taliban had even really committed to a genuine peace process. So, I think that contributed to undermining the legitimacy of President Ghani, as well as the U.S. negotiator talking about an interim government, of which Ghani would not be a part. So, I think that fuelled the political divisions that were already there among the Afghan political elite. The second factor is the way in which the Biden administration withdrew. It was an extremely hasty withdrawal, and the fact that they thought necessary to withdraw 16,000 contractors, all at once, it literally was pulling the rug out from under the Afghans. So, I think that there are a lot of things that have contributed. Not to mention the Taliban safe haven in Pakistan all these years. No U.S. administration — going back four administrations — was ever able to do anything about that safe haven. So, that’s certainly contributed to the Taliban’s ability to make these rapid military gains. So there’s a combination of factors that have led us to this point. And I think what is important now is that we relocate as many Afghans as possible, resettle them in the U.S. These are people who have helped us, who supported the mission in Afghanistan, we have a moral responsibility to take care of them. Second, we need to prevent a humanitarian disaster. This will require a concerted international commitment to making sure that the people of Afghanistan are fed, that they find places to stay. There’s a lot of IDPs, internally displaced people, so that has to be dealt with. And lastly, I don’t think that the international community should rush to recognise the Taliban, any diplomatic recognition should be conditioned on human rights, women’s rights in particular, and counterterrorism. And until we see action, not just words, but action on these issues, they certainly don’t deserve international recognition. The Trump administration was and is being criticised for, by and large, leaving out the Afghan government from its negotiations for a settlement in Afghanistan. It sounds like based on what you’re saying, there were differing voices within the Trump administration. Why did they end up pretty much cutting out the Afghan government from those talks and is what we’re seeing today a natural consequences of that? Well, the decision to hold direct U.S.-Taliban talks and not insist to the Taliban that the Afghan government be there, which is what the U.S. was doing in previous years (the Taliban did not want the Afghan government at the table, said they were illegitimate) — and the U.S. had respected that for many, many years — the decision was made in 2018 by the Trump administration to allow the U.S. to engage directly with the Taliban. The U.S. felt that its hands would forever be tied and it would not be able to reach any kind of political accommodation, without being able to engage directly with the Taliban. The idea was always that eventually the Afghan government would be brought into those talks. And I think there also was an expectation that the U.S. would represent Afghan interests. But unfortunately this is not what happened. What we saw was a consistent undermining of the Afghan government. It was easier to extract concessions from the Afghan government and give concessions to the Taliban. Unfortunately, there was not a balanced handling of that process, it wasn’t a ‘peace process’. We neither got peace from the Doha Agreement, nor did we get a clean break from terrorism. We didn’t get the Taliban actually breaking from al-Qaeda. The only thing the U.S. got out of the Doha Agreement was the fact that Taliban did not shoot at U.S. forces as they were departing the country. So it really should be [called] the Doha Withdrawal Agreement, not the Peace Agreement. Officials in the Biden administration have said alternatives to the way in which the exit was actually conducted would have come with their own human costs borne largely in these counterfactual situations by American soldiers and their families. What would you have suggested, in terms of an exit? I personally think that the U.S. could have kept a limited presence. There are some 3,500 troops when Biden took office in January, along with the 7,000 to 8,000 NATO troops that were also willing to stay. And I think that there are ways to protect those forces. When I engaged with senior military leadership before the decision was made to go to zero, they had assured me that there were capabilities, there were ways to protect U.S. forces, and also to respond. It’s not as if the U.S. were sitting ducks — we had ways to respond to the Taliban. So, that would not have been a solution that would defeat the Taliban, it would have largely been a holding position just a way for the U.S. to continue to protect its counterterrorism interests, and give the government, an opportunity to perhaps negotiate a better deal with the Taliban. I think the thinking behind keeping a small CT (counterterrorism) presence there, while not solving the problem completely, it would have at least protected fundamental U.S. national, counterterrorism interest.dd Speaking of safe havens for terrorists, what’s unfolding in Afghanistan is a gift of sorts to Pakistan, and Prime Minister Imran Khan has not hidden his appreciation for the turn of events. How do you think this is going to impact America’s relationship with Pakistan? Like I said earlier, it’s a fundamental failure of U.S. policy that across four administrations, we were not able to deal with the Taliban sanctuary inside Pakistan... I don’t foresee any reinvigoration of the relationship or any great efforts made to try to re-establish an alliance or anything with Pakistan. I don’t see the relationship plummeting, either. I think it will just probably remain rather stagnant over the next several years.

21 August 2021||Brussels,||NATO urges Taliban to allow evacuation||NATO on Friday called on the Taliban to allow people being evacuated to leave Afghanistan, and vowed that the allies would remain in “close coordination” while operations continue. The joint declaration by NATO’s 30 member countries was made following an emergency video conference of their Foreign Ministers to discuss evacuation efforts and the next steps to take to resolve the crisis. “We call on those in positions of authority in Afghanistan to respect and facilitate their safe and orderly departure, including through Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul,” they said. “As long as evacuation operations continue, we will maintain our close operational coordination through allied military means at” the airport. The U.S. and NATO allies have been flying their citizens, Afghan staff and their families out of Kabul since the weekend, when the Taliban overran the capital and regained power. While thousands have been evacuated so far, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said at the start of the videoconference that foreigners and Afghans were struggling to reach Kabul airport. President Joe Biden said on Friday he could not guarantee the final outcome of the emergency evacuation from Kabul’s airport, calling it one of the most “difficult” airlift operations ever. “This is one of the largest, most difficult airlifts in history,” Mr. Biden said in a televised address from the White House. “I cannot promise what the final outcome will be.” “I don’t think anyone of us can see these pictures and not feel that pain on a human level,” Mr. Biden said, but “now I’m focused on getting this job done.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/nato-urges-taliban-to-allow-evacuation/article36026606.ece
21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||China formally passes three-child policy into law||China’s legislature on Friday formally amended the country’s family planning rules to allow couples to have three children, also announcing a number of policy measures aimed at boosting declining birth rates. The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, or Parliament, passed an amendment to the Population and Family Planning Law, state media said, adding that the amended law calls on the authorities to "take supportive measures, including those in finances, taxes, insurance, education, housing and employment, to reduce families' burdens as well as the cost of raising and educating children.” The ruling Communist Party announced in May that couples in China would for the first time be allowed to have a third child in a relaxation of family planning rules. In 2016, a “two-child policy” was introduced that largely failed to boost birth rates. China’s regulators in recent weeks have taken drastic measures to reduce education costs - cited in many surveys as a main reason why many couples prefer to have only one child - including by overhauling the booming private education industry, which may be ordered to go non-profit according to reports in the Chinese press. The changes come in the wake of China’s once-in-ten year population census that recorded rapidly declining birth rates over the past decade. The National Bureau of Statistics said on May 11 that 12 million babies were born last year, the lowest number since 1961. ‘Biggest challenge’ The census said China’s population was 1.41 billion in 2020, an increase of 72 million since the last census in 2010. The census recorded 264 million in the age group of 60 and over, up 5.44% since 2010 and accounting for 18.70% of the population. Those in the 15-59 age group were 894 million persons, down by 6.79% since 2010 and accounting for 63.35% of the population. China’s workforce in the 15-59 age bracket peaked at 925 million in 2011, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security said previously. That number was down to 894 million in this census and would drop to 700 million by 2050. Huang Wenzheng, a fellow at the Center for China and Globalisation, in Beijing, told China Global Television Network (CGTN), an official broadcaster, following the release of the census that the ageing crisis “might be the biggest challenge the Chinese nation faces in the next century.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-formally-passes-three-child-policy-into-law/article36026600.ece

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||The rumbling hills of Himachal Pradesh||It was a relatively warm monsoon afternoon on July 25 when Arjun Devi, 65, was sitting outside her house, legs stretched out. Her house is located in the middle of an apple orchard in Batseri village in Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh. It was a picture of calm and quiet when suddenly, Devi sprang up in alarm hearing a rumbling noise. She hurried upstairs. From her rooftop she watched transfixed as boulders came rolling down from the steep hilltop at great speed, not too far from her house. They crashed into a mini-bus on Sangla-Chitkul road, killing nine people, all tourists, Devi learned later. The boulders severely damaged the Sangla-Chitkul and Sangla-Batseri link roads. They destroyed a bridge on Baspa river, on the banks of which Batseri is located. Several mature trees that got in their way fell like ninepins. All this happened in just a few minutes. “I have never seen such a horrific scene in my life,” says Devi. “The previous day too, some stones fell down the hill, but July 25 was different. When I heard the loud noise and went to the rooftop, I saw huge rocks come thundering down. They fell some distance away from my house. Only when they stopped falling did I heave a sigh of relief.” This wasn’t a one-time calamity. Nature unleashed its fury again on August 11 in Kinnaur, this time in Nigulsari village. Twenty-eight people lost their lives that day when a State transport bus, a truck, and three small vehicles were completely damaged after they were hit by boulders and mud on National Highway 5. Such was the force of the landslide that the bus rolled down several feet towards the Sutlej river, along with the debris. The residents of Kinnaur are scared, angry and frustrated. Such incidents are becoming common, they say, thanks to the development model adopted by successive governments. Reports urging a rethink of the development model are frequently brought out but they lead to little change. The beautiful Himalayan region is only becoming more fragile and susceptible to disasters, they say. A double-edged sword In the last two months alone, several landslides have been reported in Himachal Pradesh, especially in the tribal districts of Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur which have seen incessant rains. From June 13 to August 12, as many as 248 people lost their lives in various incidents relating to heavy rains. Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur, who visited Nigulsari to oversee the rescue work after the incident, said the State government would conduct a geological survey of the area. Jai Vijender Negi, 45, an orchardist at Batseri, says development has become a double-edged sword. He urges the government to review its policy on hydro power projects. “These incidents are a wake-up call for us. The dams and hydro power projects have brought prosperity to the region, but they have also brought suffering. During the construction of these power projects and dams, the use of rock blasting and heavy machinery in construction sites, besides tree felling, have damaged the fragile hills,” he says. Om Prakash, who has been working at a tourist camping site in Batseri since the late 1990s, says landslides used to occur earlier as well but their number and intensity have increased in recent times. “For the tourism sector to flourish here, road connectivity is key, but I feel that converting single roads into double lanes and more is not a good idea. When roads are constructed, debris is thrown into the valley and falls into the rivers. The government should focus on the maintenance of existing roads instead of opting for unregulated development. Scientific disposal of debris is very important,” he says. These are not mere observations of residents. In its 2012 State Strategy and Action Plan on Climate Change, Himachal Pradesh’s Department of Environment, Science and Technology had pointed out that deforestation, landslides, land degradation, desertification and Glacier Lake Outbursts Floods are some of the common but critical environmental issues in the Himalayan region. The environment is facing major challenges given the escalation of such issues due to changes in the atmosphere and interferences by man, it said. “Himachal Pradesh, though a small Himalayan State, is nevertheless playing a very crucial role in sustaining the livelihoods of downstream areas. The conservation, sustenance of these ecologically fragile regions is the biggest challenge being faced at the moment which can get further aggravated due to financial constraints and limited resources... Therefore, it can be safely stated that climate change will manifest most in Himachal Pradesh,” it noted. The report also stated that warming, erratic rainfall and rainfall changes, floods, and change in precipitation patterns are commonly observed events or are likely to occur in the region. In a state of denial Urni, a tiny village along National Highway 5 in Kinnaur district, witnessed a major landslide in 2014 which resulted in the erosion of several bighas of agricultural land and cracks in many houses. Ramanand Negi, 77, of Urni village, says the signs of ecology degradation are clearly visible, yet successive governments have been in a state of denial. “The key problem is that the government is quick to declare landslides as natural disasters. But these are man-made disasters. In July 2014, a big portion of our village was destroyed and so were several acres of agricultural and horticultural land including the orchards of over 20 families. The livelihoods of people are at stake,” he says. People now live in fear, he adds. The government gave relief to the affected families, but they have have been demanding compensation, Negi says. “The administration maintains that flood irrigation could have triggered the landslide, but we don’t have any natural water sources here, so how can we use the method of flood irrigation? Our village is situated right above the intersection of the flushing tunnel, head race tunnel and two Adit tunnels of the 1091 MW Karcham Wangtoo project built on the Sutlej River (commissioned in 2011). These tunnels were constructed using heavy machinery and rock blasting. We used to feel the vibrations when the blasting was done,” Negi says. He drops his head in despair as he points to the damaged portion of the hill slope. Sita Ram, another resident, says he was a sub-contractor on the Karcham Wangtoo project. “During construction, blasting was done for digging tunnels in the mountain. Cracks developed as a result, and the soil got eroded. Later, when heavy rain struck the region, there were landslips,” he says. Manshi Asher, an environmentalist associated with the Himdhara Environment Research and Action Collective, an advocacy and research group working on issues of environmental justice and forest rights in the Himalayan region, says the climate crisis has exacerbated the frequency and intensity of disasters over the past few decades. “But the most critical factor that gets hidden behind the label of ‘natural calamities’ is the kind of development model that we have adopted. It has led to deforestation, increased erosion and slope destabilisation which not just trigger more disasters but multiply the damage caused. The State Disaster Management Authority report on Landslide Hazard Risk Assessment 2015 stated that 90% of the State is in the high-risk zone. Areas like Kinnaur, Chamba and Lahaul-Spiti are particularly sensitive. Yet, the focus of policymakers and government departments is on management rather than prevention,” she says. The State’s 2015 Landslide Hazard Risk Assessment report, which Asher refers to, reads, “Hilly areas of Himachal Pradesh are vulnerable to landslides due to geological, meteorological and anthropogenic factors. Several devastating landslides have occurred in Himachal Pradesh... The hydro-meteorological conditions and fragile structural fabric of geological strata of Himachal Pradesh increase the possibility of landslides. Anthropogenic factors such as removal of vegetation cover, overloading of slopes by debris also contribute to a great extent. Development activities like construction of roads, tunnels and excavation for hydro projects have further accentuated the problem.” The report was prepared by the Disaster Management Cell of the Department of Revenue. It adds: “Most of the area under... Himachal Pradesh is under threat of landslides. It is the topographical profile of the state and the extreme climatic conditions which makes it susceptible to landslides. Hazard risk map of the state depicts that the area of the state falling under the three categories of hazard proneness viz. low, medium and high hazard. Most of the area under... Himachal Pradesh is under high hazard.” There are 932 hydropower projects in Himachal Pradesh, which include mini, small, large, and mega projects. Most of these projects are in Kinnaur, Chamba and Shimla districts. Asher says there is plenty of evidence on how these calamities are not natural but such evidence is not fed into policy decisions. This is why governments continue pushing for more hydro power projects and four-lane highways, she says. Protests against projects Several residents of the tribal districts are now up in arms against the setting up of new power projects. Many assert that the projects severely impact the fragile mountain slopes and cause significant loss to life and property. As Kinnaur continues to bear the brunt of catastrophes, a group of youngsters at Kalpa gathered for a meeting on August 10 to craft a strategy to intensify their State-wide campaign of creating awareness against the setting up of new hydro power projects in the district. “There should be a ban on such projects. Already substantial damage to the fragile ecology is visible, yet the government in the name of national interest is continuing to play with the lives and livelihood of locals. Today, we have gathered here to discuss the proposed construction of the Jangi Thopan Powari hydroelectric project plant of 804 MW capacity near Jangi village. This project, to be built by SJVN, will impact people and natural resources of at least six panchayats — Spillow, Kanan, Moorang, Jangi, Akpa and Rarang. Our purpose is to create awareness in all the villages about this upcoming project and others as well. Any decision on the commissioning of a project should be based on discussions with the gram sabhas,” says Sunder Negi, a member of the group. Negi says the group got in touch with youth clubs of different villages. Through regular meetings, they are conveying these villages of the “ill-effects of power projects”. He believes that people should be aware about the impacts of such projects on water, forest and land and should come forward to speak up their mind “before it’s too late”. The Jangi Thopan Powari hydroelectric project envisages the construction of a concrete gravity dam of 48-metres high from the level of the riverbed across the river Sutlej near Jangi village and an underground powerhouse on the right bank upstream of Tehsil boundary (Kashang Nallah). It proposes to excavate a circular-shaped head race tunnel of 9.40-m wide and 12-kilometres long using tunnel boring machine. The tentative land requirement for the project is 295.93 ha out of which 270.43 ha is forest land and 25.5 ha private land. The construction of the dam will result in the submergence of about 156.2917 ha of land of which 143.2093 ha is forest land and 13.0824 ha private land. Abhishek Wazir, 25, of Moorang village says this is a “fight to save ‘Zangti’ (golden water) of Sutlej River.” Dinesh Negi, 32, from Kanan village, remarks that this is more that that; it is a fight for survival. “The indigenous pine nuts (chilgoza) trees are under threat here. As transmission lines of hydro projects pass through forests, trees are cut. This impacts not only the environment but our livelihoods too,” he says. “We have to save Kinnaur at any cost, and so we are mobilising the youth. We will make it a mass movement,” says Bharat Bhushan, 35, of Kalpa. Jiya Negi, a Kinnaur-based environmentalist and activist, says the entire stretch of the Sutlej is filled with debris that is thrown into the river from construction sites of power projects, dams and roads. No one, he says, bothers to ensure the scientific disposal of debris. Deputy Commissioner (Kinnaur) Abid Hussain Sadiq says the administration is always there to look into the concerns of people. “The decision to set up power projects is taken in national interest, but at the same time there’s no doubt that the concerns of people are to be understood and addressed. A balance has to be struck between national interest and the concerns of the local people. We are always willing to work towards that,” he says. A power sector expert and head of the Jangi Thopan Powari hydroelectric project, Roshan Negi, asserts that the construction of tunnels does not damage the ecology as the work is done in a scientific manner. “All the necessary precautions are taken while we construct tunnels. If the environment was at risk of damage, the Government of India would have not allowed the setting up of these projects. However, I believe that there should always be a consensus with the locals before setting up a project. The projects that have been set up and the allied activities have given a boost to the local economy and infrastructure. They have benefited the residents over the years,” he says. All these explanations don’t make much sense to Devi. She doesn’t know why, but she knows that landslides in the Sangla Valley have been increasing over the years. “For some 30 years it used to snow heavily in this area, but in recent years I have seen more rain than snow. At the same time, many dams and roads have come up and landslides have become common. Our rivers are turning muddy as they carry debris. The government must take steps to preserve our mountains. Development is welcome, but not at the cost of human lives,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-rumbling-hills-of-himachal-pradesh/article36026599.ece
21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||The fall of Kabul, the future of regional geopolitics||The fall of Kabul in the wake of the American withdrawal from Afghanistan will prove to be a defining moment for the region and the future shape of its geopolitics; it would be as defining, if not more, as the Soviet intervention in 1979 and the American one in 2001. While a lot depends on the Taliban’s actual conduct both domestically as well as on the southern and western Asian geopolitical chessboard in the months ahead, the Taliban are likely to continue as a ‘useful villain’ in the unfolding great power competition. For New Delhi, the fall of Kabul is a moment of reckoning and it must rethink its regional strategies and options. Unfortunately, of the latter, it does not have many. A vacuum What is most disconcerting is the regional power vacuum in the Eurasian heartland created by the haphazard manner in which the United States withdrew from Afghanistan and its potential knock-on effects. An axis of regional powers such as China, Pakistan, Russia, and the Taliban, have already started filling this power vacuum, shaping, thereby, the contours of the region’s geopolitics based on their individual and common interests. Iran might also jump on this opportunistic bandwagon under the Chinese leadership. What is abundantly clear is that each of these countries harbour deep anti-American feelings in varying degrees which will further shrink the American influence in the Eurasian heartland. While it is too early to determine whether what these countries have on their hands is an opportunity or a ticking bomb, the U.S., as a direct consequence of the formation of this axis, might decide to explore new ways of working with them to stabilise the region, if it desires to do so, and remain relevant there. If indeed that happens, could it result in a potential softening of the American rhetoric against China, Pakistan, Russia and perhaps even Iran? More so, what would that mean for India? While a healthy conversation among the great powers — the U.S., China and Russia — on global and regional challenges is a good sign, India is neither a great power nor present at the table. New Delhi must ensure that it does not become a casualty on the south-western Asian geopolitical chessboard. Advantage China; extremism The post-American power vacuum in the region will be primarily advantageous to China and its grand strategic plans for the region. Beijing will further strengthen its efforts to bring every country in the region, except India, on the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative bandwagon, thereby altering the geopolitical and geoeconomic foundations of the region. More so, the much-feared Chinese encirclement of India will become ever more pronounced. Having been further emboldened by the U.S.’s withdrawal and in stamping its writ on the region, Beijing is likely to become less accommodative towards India including on the Line of Actual Control. Even in trade, given the sorry state of the post-COVID-19 Indian economy, India needs trade with China more than the other way round. Unless New Delhi can find ways of ensuring a rapprochement with China, it must expect Beijing to challenge India on occasion, and be prepared for it. The bigger challenge for India though would be a near-certain increase in terrorism and extremism in the region. The U.S. presence in Afghanistan, international pressure on the Taliban and Financial Action Task Force worries in Pakistan had a relatively moderating effect on the region’s terror ecosystem. With the Taliban now back in Kabul, things are bound to change. The visuals of the Taliban releasing terrorists from Afghan jails would send a powerful message to their fellow travellers, handlers, and sympathisers in the region. While the neighbouring countries are also worried about terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, the reality is that they are busy making their own private deals with the Taliban to not host terror organisations targeting them. There is little appetite for a regional approach to curbing terrorism from a Taliban-led Afghanistan. This enables the Taliban to engage in a selective treatment towards terror outfits present there or they have relations with. Moreover, given that the international community may have no choice but to recognise the Taliban regime — UN Security Council members such as China and Russia have already indicated their intent to do so — would also mean that the Taliban would hold more power in a bargain on the terror question. Sanctions are unlikely to deter an outfit that does not need to bother about the next election. It is unlikely that the Taliban will proactively export terror to other countries unless of course for tactical purposes by, say for instance, Pakistan against India. The real worry, however, is the inspiration that disgruntled elements in the region will draw from the Taliban’s victory against the world’s sole superpower. To that extent, the triumphalism in Pakistan over the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan could eventually become counterproductive for Pakistan itself. Whether Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan refers to them as a force that has ‘unshackled the chains of slavery’ or the country’s deep state considers them as a strategic asset, the reality is that many anti-Pakistan terror organisations would be emboldened as well. Impact on regional interests The return of the Taliban to Kabul has effectively laid India’s ‘mission Central Asia’ to rest. If New Delhi could not find its way to Central Asia with encouraging partners such as Iran and the Hamid Karzai/Ashraf Ghani governments, the possibility of New Delhi doing so now is next to nil. India’s diplomatic and civilian presence as well as its civilian investments will now be at the mercy of the Taliban, and to some extent Pakistan. If there is a concerted effort by China, Pakistan and the Taliban to erase the Indian presence from Afghanistan, there is little India can do about it. Had New Delhi, as I had argued earlier, cultivated deeper relations (which by no means would have meant recognising the outfit) with the Taliban, Indian interests would have been more secure in a post-American Afghanistan. New Delhi’s lack of strategic foresight will prove to be costly. What is perhaps not yet understood is how the rise of the anti-America axis (China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan and a Taliban-led Afghanistan) and anti-American sentiments in the region would impact India’s regional interests given that it has become closer to the U.S. than ever before in its history. We have to wait and see what this mismatch between the region’s mood and India’s strategic choices would mean for the country. There is little doubt that because of these developments, India’s regional ambitions will take a major hit in the months and years ahead. The fall of Kabul and the consequent knock-on effects in the region will have several potential implications for India’s foreign policy and its strategic choices and behaviour. For one, given the little physical access India has to its north-western landmass, its focus is bound to shift more to the Indo-Pacific even though a maritime grand strategy may not necessarily be an answer to its continental challenges. Second, New Delhi might also seek to shed the arrogance it displayed towards its smaller neighbours during Modi 1.0 and cultivate friendly relations with them. Myanmar is a case in point. India has already indicated that it would not challenge the junta on the coup and its widespread human rights violations. This policy is likely to continue even if the Joe Biden administration seeks New Delhi’s help in turning up the heat on Myanmar’s generals. The last thing New Delhi needs now is an angry neighbour rushing to China. India-Pakistan ties Third, the developments in Afghanistan could nudge New Delhi to seek stability, if not peace, with Pakistan. While there is little desire in New Delhi today to reopen a broad-based dialogue process with Pakistan, even a ‘cold peace’ would be in India’s interest. For Pakistan too, such a ‘cold peace’ will help it to focus its energies on consolidating its interests and gains in Afghanistan. As a result, both sides might refrain from indulging in competitive risk-taking unless something dramatic happens which is always a possibility between the two rivals. That said, stability between India and Pakistan depends a great deal on how politics in Kashmir plays out, and whether New Delhi is able to pacify the aggrieved sections in the Valley. The lesson for India in the wake of these developments is clear: It will have to fight its own battles. So it must make enemies wisely, choose friends carefully, rekindle flickering friendships, and make peace while it can.

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||In battleground Uttar Pradesh, a churn in Dalit politics||In an emerging and new situation, the political mobilisation of Dalits and the marginalised in Uttar Pradesh is now becoming complex. It is no longer simple and unidirectional as it was in the decades of the 1990s. During my visits to various Dalit bastis (hamlets) in and around Allahabad, Banaras/Varanasi and a few other district towns nearby, I met several people who are Scheduled Castes (SCs) and who used to, for years, cast their votes in favour of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). They were staunch BSP supporters, and without doubt, its vote bank. But things have changed after the advent of the Seva project of the Rashtriya SwayamsevakSangh (RSS). They have begun to admire the RSS, with some of them even beginning to send their children to the Saraswati Shishu Mandir, the Vidya Bharati-run chain of schools in India. The section that is being influenced by the Hindutva mission — which is reaching to them either through the politics of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or the Seva Karya (the social service project of the Sangh) — is growing by the day in Uttar Pradesh. The slums and bastis inhabited by the migrant poor, mainlyDalits, are evolving into a centre of activities of Sangh-inspired organisations who are working for their education, health and microfinance. Various governmental schemes of the BJP government, at the Centre and in the State of Uttar Pradesh, are impacting the BSP’s vote base and finding resonance among the marginalised communities of the State. The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (affordable housing), the Pradhan Mantri Ujjawala Yojana (LPG connections to women of Below Poverty Line families) and various cash transfer schemes are rapidly changing the politico-socio landscape of the Dalits and marginalised communities. The strategies of the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, to focus developmental initiatives on the most marginalised communities such as the Mushahars and Bantangiyas are evolving new constituencies for the BJP among Dalits and the marginalised. Real empowerment The marginalised need empowerment in a real sense beyond ideologies and political positioning. They are ready to receive their share in developmental opportunities be it in the form of support from the right, left or centre. Those who have to ‘dig a well every day to drink water ( roj kuwan khodana, roj pani pina )’ are more aware now, which the middle class with facilities and access to the power of social media may not be able to comprehend. One should not perceive the Dalits and the marginalised as a vote bank for a certain kind of politics. The shift in their voting patterns in the last few years shows that considering them as a homogeneous vote bank of a particular political party may be a myth. They are open to any political party which may offer them an appropriate package which enables them to partake in the country’s developmental projects and representation in democracy. In the decades preceding the 1990s, the dreams that the national freedom movement evoked more or less worked as a binding thread by keeping them mobilised towards the Congress despite being let down at times in terms of meeting their aspirations. Gradually, things began to change and became visible in States such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar; the Kanshi Ram initiated Bahujan movement which later emerged as the BSP in the northern part of India especially in Uttar Pradesh was an example of this. It is true that in the beginning of the 1990s, the Ram Janmabhoomi movement attracted a section of marginalised communities towards Hindutva mobilisation. Centres of mobilisation The RSS’s work among these communities, in the form of seva karya (opening schools, hospitals, highlighting sanitation and cleanliness and other support services), and their cultural project to provide cultural and religious dignity, offered the Hindutva stream as another alternative for Dalits and subalterns in a State such as Uttar Pradesh. So, the Bahujan and Hindutva are the two centres of mobilisation that have emerged in the socio-cultural and political arena of Dalits in Uttar Pradesh. Both are reshaping Dalit aspirations in their own way. The Bahujan positioning, which was earlier a socio-political project, has now been reduced to political campaigns that try and create aspirations among the marginalised for their share in power. In contrast,Hindutva mobilisation is trying to provide them socio-cultural religious dignity in various ways and also working to ensure their share in power by providing them space in the politics of the BJP. There are also a few other political options in the form of Samajwadi politics (in U.P.) which also offer them space in the democratic politics of the State. Other factors Another side of this growing heterogeneity in terms of their political mobilisation is the result of constant changes that are taking place in the making of the community. The impact of the liberal economy, the rise of the Dalit middle class, and exposure to the mainstream and alternative media have encouraged aspiration among the marginalised and subalterns and working as a motivational force to search for ways to ensure their development and empowerment. Dalit mobilisation in Uttar Pradesh is undergoing a big churn. One can easily see how multiplicity is emerging in their political choices. This is the result of various changes taking place in the social-political and developmental mobility of the community and the constantly changing nature of politics in Uttar Pradesh in recent times.

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Reboot to reset||India’s largest trading partner, and one with whom it has a significant trade surplus, the U.S., is no longer interested in securing a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA), as per indications from the Joe Biden administration. An official acknowledgement of this, from Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, suggests that years of negotiations towards a ‘mini-trade deal’ followed by a full-blown trade pact that Mr. Biden’s predecessor oversaw may well be infructuous now. The Government will now seek to work on market access issues on both sides, he said, adding that lowering of non-tariff barriers, mutual recognition pacts and adopting common quality standards can also help Indian exports in the interim. There is a possibility that even these issues, which include long-festering dissonances over providing access to U.S. agricultural products or easing import duties on automobiles and Bourbons, would have to be discussed afresh. On Friday, the U.S. envoy to India met Mr. Goyal for what he said was a parley on attaining the $500 billion bilateral trade vision of the U.S. President. The trade target, set when Mr. Biden was the Vice President in the Barack Obama regime, remains unchanged, but the tools for achieving it are no longer clear. India was pulled out of the U.S.’s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) that granted some tariff relief to its exports by the Trump government in 2019, and hopes of its reinduction through a mini-trade deal now appear bleak. While India was expected to gain from the Sino-U.S. trade wars under the Donald Trump administration, its retaliation to the GSP status revocation with hiked tariffs on U.S. products had led to frictions that perhaps stymied the conclusion of a mini-trade deal before the change at the helm in the White House. The U.S.’s no-go stance on the FTA implies ambitions may have to be pared down but also provides an opportunity for India to holistically review its stance on global trade. It is refreshing that Mr. Goyal has signalled a revamped approach towards FTAs and reminded Indian industry there cannot be one-way traffic. This needs to be matched by actions that start unwinding India’s creeping walls of import tariffs. The Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign has further exacerbated that view — as the advent of a protectionist ‘closed market’ project. Strenuous exhortations that the self-reliance drive is one that seeks to integrate with global value chains can only go so far. Trade policy cannot be perpetuated in isolation and, in fact, affects investments too. Having walked out of RCEP, India needs to demonstrate to its potential FTA partners, including the EU and the U.K., with which rivals like Vietnam have already sealed a deal, that it is a viable alternative to China in a post-COVID world. To be a major trading and manufacturing nation, India can ill-afford to keep sending mixed signals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/reboot-to-reset/article36026586.ece
21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Faith and marriage||A regressive and patently unconstitutional feature of recent anti-conversion laws enacted by different States is the criminalisation of inter-faith marriages by treating them as a means to convert one of the parties from one religion to another. While anti-conversion laws, euphemistically called in some States as laws on ‘freedom of religion’, have always sought to criminalise conversions obtained through fraud, force or allurement, the recent enactments or amendments have created “conversion by marriage” as one of the illegal forms of conversion. In its interim order protecting parties to inter-religious marriages from needless harassment, the Gujarat HC has made it clear that the “rigours” of the State’s amendments introduced earlier this year will not apply to marriages that do not involve any fraud, force or allurement. So, it has stopped the initiation of criminal proceedings against those who have married across religious faiths, unless there was any of these illegal elements. A Bench has rejected the State government’s attempt to adopt an innocent reading of the provisions of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021, by claiming that inter-faith marriages that did not involve fraud or coercion and leading to conversion would not attract the penal provisions. The argument is obviously contrary to the wording of the amendment, which makes conversion “by marriage” or “by getting a person married” or “by aiding a person to get married” an offence. The court said, “A plain reading of Section 3 would indicate that any conversion on account of marriage is also prohibited.” It is regrettable that Hindutva votaries continue to believe in medieval-minded laws aimed at curbing inter-faith marriages. Despite clear Supreme Court rulings that it is no more constitutional to police private lives and beliefs, sections in the polity still believe that inter-religious marriages are aimed at religious conversion, that they have an adverse impact on public order and invariably involve coercion or deceit. It was always clear to the secular minded and legal experts that constitutional courts will not see such marriages as events that impinge on public order, and that making their solemnisation a ground for prosecution under anti-conversion laws was unlikely to be upheld. It is clear that the Gujarat law’s provisions “interfere with the intricacies of marriage” and an individual’s right to choice, thereby infringing Article 21 of the Constitution. The principle that the right to marry a person of one’s choice is integral to Article 21 flows from the verdict in Shafin Jahan vs Asokan . The order stalling criminal action against those entering into a valid inter-faith marriage constitutes a significant judicial pushback against disconcerting attempts by various States to foment communal divides through dubious legislation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/faith-and-marriage/article36026587.ece
21 August 2021||MUMBAI,||MPC’s Varma flags risks of policy stance||Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member Jayanth Varma has expressed serious reservations about the RBI’s protracted “accommodative” policy stance in light of uncertainty about the duration of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, contending that the forward guidance and stance were becoming “counter productive”. “By creating the erroneous perception that the MPC is no longer concerned about inflation and is focused exclusively on growth, the MPC may be inadvertently aggravating the risk that inflationary expectations will be disanchored,” he was cited as having said at the August 4-6 meeting of the central bank’s rate-setting panel, the minutes released by RBI on Friday show. The MPC decided unanimously to hold the policy repo rate and by a 5-1 majority voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth, with Mr. Varma the sole dissenter. “As the pandemic continues to mutate, it appears to me that the balance of risk and reward is gradually shifting” meriting a hard look at the stance, Mr. Varma said. ‘Neutron bomb’ Contending that COVID-19 was beginning to look more and more like tuberculosis which kills a large number of people every year without inflicting major damage to the economy, and thus resembling a ‘neutron bomb’, he said the ability of monetary policy to mitigate a human tragedy of this nature was very limited as compared to its ability to contain an economic crisis. “The possibility that COVID-19 will haunt us (though with lower mortality) for the next 3-5 years can no longer be ruled out. Keeping monetary policy highly accommodative for such a long horizon is very different from doing so for what was earlier expected to be a relatively short crisis,” he said. Arguing that monetary policy was much less effective than fiscal policy for providing targeted relief to the worst affected segments of the economy, he said: “monetary accommodation appears to be stimulating asset price inflation to a greater extent than it is mitigating the distress in the economy”. Emphasising that inflationary pressures were beginning to show signs of greater persistence than anticipated earlier he said, “There are indications that inflationary expectations may be becoming more widely entrenched. Most worrying of all, there is now a reduced degree of confidence that demand side inflationary pressures would remain quiescent.” Mr. Varma also argued that the reverse repo needed to be raised from 3.35% so as to allow the MPC room to keep the policy repo rate at 4% for a longer period. “At a time when the economic recovery is still nascent, it is extremely important that monetary policy serves as an anchor of macroeconomic stability. That would reduce the inflation risk premium” and stabilise long-term rates, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mpcs-varma-flags-risks-of-policy-stance/article36026355.ece
21 August 2021||New Delhi,||Eicher shareholders reject reappointment of Lal as MD||Shareholders of Eicher Motors, the manufacturer of Royal Enfield motorcycles, have voted against the reappointment of Siddhartha Lal as managing director (MD) of the company. According to a regulatory filing, the special resolution to consider and approve Mr. Lal’s reappointment for a period of five years and payment of remuneration, failed to muster the requisite majority at the 39th AGM. A total of 21,74,67,139 votes were cast for this special resolution, of which only 15,88,49,543 votes (73%) were in favour of the resolution, with the rest against. For a special resolution to be passed, 75% votes need to be in favour of the resolution. Institutional investors More than 70% of institutional investors who participated had voted against the resolution, likely due to the proposal relating to Mr. Lal’s remuneration. While the company did not specify details of the proposed remuneration in the notice for the AGM, Eicher had said the total remuneration payable to Mr. Lal for any financial year ‘shall not exceed 3% of its net profits’. According to the company’s annual report for 2020-21, the total remuneration for Mr. Lal, who is credited with turning the company around, stood at about Rs. 21 crore for the financial year ended March 31, 2021. This included salary of Rs. 7.38 crore, commission of Rs. 6.7 crore and perquisites of Rs. 7.04 crore. Meanwhile, a separate ordinary resolution to reappoint Mr. Lal as a director was passed with more than 86% shareholders voting in favour of the resolution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/eicher-shareholders-reject-reappointment-of-lal-as-md/article36026357.ece

(SFL) is planning to increase exports to 50% of the total turnover by focussing on electric vehicle (EV) components, said chairman Suresh Krishna. “The newly commissioned unit in SEZ Sri City is totally committed to exports,” Mr. Krishna told shareholders. “We are also getting substantial orders from major customers outside of India for EV components,” the chairman added. During FY21, SFL exported products worth Rs. 1,010 crore that accounted for 34% of the total turnover. In Q1 of FY22, exports grew by 39% to Rs. 356 crore. “We will reach 50% of exports of total turnover from the existing 40%, as it would provide tremendous amount of cushion for the company in case of a downward trend in the domestic market,” the chairman said. “During FY21, SFL incurred a capex of Rs. 140 crore for existing and new products. The capex was incurred in tandem with the production plans of key customers,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sfl-plans-to-raise-exports-to-50-of-turnover/article36026360.ece
21 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||RBI, IRDAI nod must for FDI in bank-led insurance||Applications for foreign direct investment in an insurance company promoted by a private bank would be cleared by the RBI and IRDAI to ensure that the 74% limit of overseas investment is not breached. The changes took effect following amendments to the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, as per the gazette notification issued by the Finance Ministry on August 19. “These rules may be called the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) (Second Amendment) Rules, 2021,” it said. In March, Parliament passed a bill to raise the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in the insurance sector from 49% to 74%. The Insurance Act, 1938 was last amended in 2015, raising the limit to 49%, resulting in foreign capital inflow of Rs. 26,000 crore over 5 years. “Applications for foreign direct investment in private banks having joint venture or subsidiary in insurance may be addressed to the Reserve Bank for consideration in consultation with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI),” to ensure that the foreign investment limit is not breached, the notification said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rbi-irdai-nod-must-for-fdi-in-bank-led-insurance/article36026363.ece

21 August 2021||London,||Chelsea to unleash Lukaku on Arsenal||Arsenal’s miserable start to the Premier League season could get even worse as Chelsea unleashes record signing Romelu Lukaku for his debut on Sunday, while Liverpool and Manchester United look to build on a promising start to their title challenge. The Blues believe the Belgian striker can be the final weapon needed to turn a squad that already won the Champions League last season into a Premier League title contender. Lukaku is already in the top 20 all-time Premier League goalscorers with 113 to his name for West Brom, Everton and Manchester United. Under pressure Manager Mikel Arteta is under pressure after a 2-0 defeat to newly-promoted Brentford to open the new season. City’s title defence got off to a faltering start with a 1-0 defeat to Tottenham last weekend with the future of Harry Kane still hanging over both clubs.  According to reports, Kane remains unhappy at Spurs chairman Daniel Levy’s stubborn stance to not negotiate with City despite the English champions’ willingness to break the Premier League transfer record for the second time this month. City’s bid for the England captain could go as high as £150 million before the window closes, but Pep Guardiola will have to continue without the number nine he craves for Saturday’s visit of Norwich. Guardiola’s men should be much stronger for an extra week’s training with the likes of Kevin De Bruyne, John Stones, Kyle Walker, Rodrigo, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Aymeric Laporte in contention after starting on the bench against Spurs due to their limited pre-season after reaching the latter stages of Euro 2020. Full house Sean Dyche’s men return to Anfield in very different circumstances this weekend in front of the first full house for a Premier League game since before Liverpool ended a 30-year wait to win the title in 2020. In front of a home crowd, Klopp’s side has not lost a league game since 2017. United will also be confident of building on its opening 5-1 win over Leeds when the Red Devils travel to Southampton on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chelsea-to-unleash-lukaku-on-arsenal/article36026755.ece
21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Sathiyan and Manika create Pro Tour history||G. Sathiyan and Manika Batra couldn’t have asked for a better beginning to their preparations for the next Olympic cycle. After announcing that they would compete as a duo till the 2024 Paris Olympics, Sathiyan and Manika made it a memorable outing at the World Table Tennis Contender at Budapest on Friday by clinching the mixed doubles crown with a resounding 11-9, 9-11, 12-10, 11-6 win over Nandor Ecseki and Dora Madarasz of Hungary in the final. They became the first Indian pair to win a mixed doubles title on the Pro Tour. Hardly challenged Sathiyan and Manika combined wonderfully well throughout the tournament. With Sathiyan’s deft receives, an attacking forehand, and nimble-footedness backed by Manika’s attacking forehand and the backhand pushes and jabs on the long-pimpled rubber, they were hardly challenged. In the four rounds, they had lost just three games. It was clear within minutes into the summit clash that Madarasz was the weaker link. She doesn’t possess any particular weapon to win points, exerting more pressure on Ecseki. The latter wilted under it, making quite a few errors. In the third game, the Hungarians had a game point at 10-9 but couldn’t convert. That was the only time they came close to winning something. Sathiyan and Manika gained 400 points each and a total amount of $3000. “It was great. We didn’t expect to be this good! We just had a day to practice. “My quickness on the table and Manika’s intelligent play, and her much-improved forehand enabled us to win the tournament,” said Sathiyan. He said beating the World No. 7 and the top-seeded duo of Lubomir Pistej and Barbora Balazova of Slovakia in the quarterfinals was a morale-booster. “We will next play in the WTT Doha event and the Asian TT championships,” Sathiyan added. “I am very happy to win my first mixed title for India on the ITTF Tour,” said Manika, who is expected to return to India on Saturday.  The results (all finals):   Men: Truis Moregard (Swe) bt Kilian ORT (Ger) 3-11, 11-9, 12-10, 9-11, 11-7, 9-11, 11-9; Doubles: Tobias Hippler & Kilian ORT (Ger) bt Vladimir Sidorenko & Kirill Skachkov (Rus) 11-3, 11-7, 6-11, 11-7.   Women: Xiaoxin Yang (Mon) bt Elizabet Abraamian (Rus) 11-9, 12-10, 11-6, 11-1; Doubles: Szandra Pergel & Dora Madarasz (Hun) bt Yana Noskova & Olga Vorobeva (Rus) 11-7, 11-6, 11-6.   Mixed doubles: G. Sathiyan & Manika Batra bt Nandor Ecseki & Dora Madarasz (Hun) 11-9, 9-11, 12-10, 11-6.

The 17-year-old from Jhansi, coached by Robert Bobby George at the Anju Bobby Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru, opened with 6.34m, narrowly missing the automatic qualification mark of 6.35. Saili then produced her best in the last round. Sweden's under-20 European champion Maja Askag, who won the triple jump on Friday with an effort of 13.75m, was second in qualification with 6.39. While Shaili was flying high, another medal hope Kunwer Ajai Raj Singh Rana (73.68m) was fifth in men’s javelin while teammate Jay Shah (70.74m) was sixth. Finland’s Janne Laspa won the gold with 76.46m. Nandini Asagara was sixth in her women’s 100m hurdles semifinal in 14.16s. She was 19th overall. She had clocked 14.18 in round one.

21 August 2021||UFA (RUSSIA),||Silver for Sanju Devi, Bhateri||India claimed two more silver medals after Sanju Devi and Bhateri lost their respective final matches at the World junior wrestling championships here on Friday. Sanju was beaten 10-0 by home wrestler Alina Kasabieva in the women’s 62kg summit clash. Following Sanju’s passive approach, Alina employed two leg attacks to amass points comfortably and win the bout on the basis of technical superiority in the first period. Bhateri lost to Irina Ringaci of Moldova 12-2 in the 65kg final. Bhateri defended well after conceding four points inside the first 30 seconds and closed the gap to two points through a takedown early in the second period. However, the Moldovan was too good with her attacks to establish a 10-point lead and win the bout with technical superiority. Saneh retired midway through her 72kg bronze medal match against Russian Mariam Guseinova. The Indian was trailing 0-3 in the opening period when her right knee got awkwardly twisted due to an attack by the Russian. She was stretchered off the mat. Five Indian Greco-Roman wrestlers in action crashed out of the medal race after facing defeat in initial rounds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/silver-for-sanju-devi-bhateri/article36026685.ece
21 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||India will win at least 15 medals: Chef de mission||Gursharan Singh, Chef de Mission for the Tokyo Paralympics, said India will come up with its best ever performance, returning with at least 15 medals including five gold. India will field 54 athletes, its largest ever contingent, in nine sports — para archery, para athletics, para badminton, para canoeing, shooting para sport, para swimming, para powerlifting, para table tennis and para taekwondo. “I am confident that these would be our best ever Paralympic Games. “Our Para-athletes have worked very hard and shown great results in international competitions. They are raring to go,” the secretary-general of the Paralympic Committee of India said in a release. “We are expecting around 15 medals including five gold. We have high medal hopes in para athletics, para badminton, para shooting and para archery.” India has won 12 medals, including four gold, in 11 appearances. The first batch of the Indian team, led by PCI president Deepa Malik, arrived in Tokyo. T. Mariyappan, who will be the flag-bearer, also arrived in Tokyo and there will be a lot of expectations from the para high jumper to clinch his second gold. India’s other medal hopefuls include the para javelin throwers, led by two-time Paralympic champion Devendra Jhajharia (F46). Reigning world champion Sundar Singh Gurjar and Ajeet Singh (F46), world champion and world record holder in F64 Sandeep Chaudhary and Navdeep Singh (F41) are the others to watch out for.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-will-win-at-least-15-medals-chef-de-mission/article36026691.ece

Then again, she’s hardly complaining. If anything, she’s leaning into it. The American gymnastics star has no regrets about her decision to opt-out of five of the six finals in Tokyo because of a mental block, calling it a small price to pay if it lets others realise they retain the right to say “it’s OK not to be OK” no matter how bright the spotlight. “I wouldn’t change anything for the world,” said Biles, who left Japan with a silver medal from the team competition and an individual bronze on balance beam. “I gave an outlet for athletes to speak up about their mental health and their well-being and learn that you can put yourself (as a person) first before the athlete.” Asked if she had any clarity on what might have brought on “the twisties,” Biles thinks it may have been the build-up of various issues she’s faced over several years, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/i-gave-an-outlet-for-athletes-to-speak-up-about-mental-health/article36027148.ece

Kings, the Bangladesh Premier champions, are coming off a 2-0 win over Maziya S&RC in their first group stage game. “We’re up against a team that scored 55 goals in the League and are champions,” said BFC coach Marco Pezzaiuoli, ahead of the match. “They conceded only nine goals in the League, and won their first group game 2-0. They are compact at the back and counter very well. Our plan will be to maybe go backwards a bit and create space behind them to score goals and create chances.” Pezzaiuoli felt that the defeat to ATKMB would not set the team back, more so when the squad has seen significant upheaval in the summer. “I choose to take the positives. We had almost 70% ball possession. I think we only need to improve in certain aspects. We want to better our free-kicks and corners, and create better chances and finish them.” The Kings made their AFC Cup debut last season in a campaign that was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic and retained the 2020-21 Bangladesh Federation Cup in January, and this season the team scored 67 goals in all competitions.

Moved out of India due to the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the mega event will be held in the UAE and Oman from Oct. 17 to Nov. 14. Morgan, whose team won the last edition of the tournament in 2016, has stressed on the importance of continuing to play in the manner it has in the last two years. Biggest strength “I think our biggest strength is the consistency with which we’ve performed at over the last two years. “I think in T20 cricket because the game can change quite quickly, I think every game is important to us,” said Morgan during a chat with the ICC on Friday. Key factor The 34-year-old skipper feels adapting to the conditions in the UAE, where England have not played a T20 International since 2015, will be one of the key factors for them in the tournament. “I think we’re gathering momentum nicely, and the important side to that from our perspective is that we’re continuously trying to get better and learn as we go on, simply because the tournament is held away from home. We’re really looking forward to it.” In 2016, England finished runner-up as Carlos Brathwaite smashed four consecutive sixes off Ben Stokes in a dramatic last over of the final to take the West Indies to a title triumph. Hugely significant “The evolution of T20 cricket and the role it’s played in our great game is hugely significant for the development of the game and the popularity of the game. It’s huge. It’s been a long time coming. We haven’t had one since 2016,” said Morgan. South Africa and Australia join England and the West Indies in Group 1 of the Super 12s along with the two yet-to-be-determined qualifiers from Round 1 for this year’s men’s T20 World Cup. England will open its campaign in the 2021 edition of the tournament against the West Indies in Abu Dhabi on October 23.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/we-are-gathering-momentum-nicely-morgan/article36027149.ece
21 August 2021||Male (Maldives),||Back-to-back success is what ATKMB seeks||On a high after a clinical performance in its opener, ATK Mohun Bagan (ATKMB) will eye back-to-back success and move closer to qualifying for the knockout stage when it faces Maziya Sports & Recreation of Maldives in the AFC Cup on Saturday. The Kolkata side defeated Bengaluru FC 2-0, registering more shots on target despite having only 32% possession. A victory on Saturday could put ATKMB on the verge of a knockout berth from Group D. Coach Antonio Habas said: “We are going from match to match and we have another opponent waiting. It’s the same idea. “Give absolute respect to the opponent and develop our football on the pitch. You could have one bad day or situation that could change the outcome.” The Spaniard said the team has to play with intensity throughout. “We know how Maziya Sports & Recreation played with other teams, but we have to see how they will perform against us, because maybe they might play differently.” The home side is coming into the match after a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Bangladesh’s Bashundhara Kings, but head coach Risto Vidakovic is hoping to build on the second-half performance to upset ATKMB. “I’ve talked to the players, and we know that we didn’t give our best. We were too nervous, especially in the first-half. After the first goal, the team was more nervous,” Vidakovic said.

21 August 2021||Madrid,||Barcelona continues post-Messi era rebuild||Barcelona faces Athletic Bilbao on Saturday in its first away match since the departure of Lionel Messi, hoping to back up a promising LaLiga opener last weekend, while Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid also look to notch second straight wins. The Catalan giant is also still without injured winger Ousmane Dembele and close-season arrival Sergio Aguero as it looks to rebuild. Martin Braithwaite stepped into the six-time Ballon d’Or winner’s shoes last Sunday by grabbing a brace, while Memphis Depay impressed on his debut after joining from Lyon. Koeman admitted after the win over Sociedad that other players in his team need to step up without Messi. “We no longer have a player who can decide the fate of matches on his own — now it will be a collective effort,” said the Dutchman. Veteran centre-back Gerard Pique, who scored last weekend, could miss out with a calf problem against Athletic. Diego Simeone’s Atletico on Sunday welcomes Elche to the Wanda Metropolitano, where fans will be present to celebrate its 2021 title triumph. Plenty of change Real has also seen plenty of change in the close-season, with coach Zinedine Zidane departing the club to be replaced by former boss Carlo Ancelotti. Ancelotti brought Gareth Bale back into the fold for a 4-1 thumping of Alaves last week when Karim Benzema netted a double.   Key stats   3: Wins for Levante in its last six matches against Real Madrid  6: Consecutive LaLiga victories for Atletico against Elche  17: Years since a team other than Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid won the title||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/barcelona-continues-post-messi-era-rebuild/article36026765.ece
21 August 2021||Milan,||Roma’s Mourinho leads a manager merry-go-round in Italy||Jose Mourinho is the biggest name to arrive on a Serie A bench this summer but the once Special One’s shock move to Roma is one of 12 managerial changes in Italy’s top flight in a chaotic summer. The two-time Champions League winner’s arrival came like a bolt from the blue for Roma’s trophy-starved supporters, who reacted to the shock appointment as though they had signed a superstar striker. Massimiliano Allegri returns to Juventus and will be looking to continue his streak of league titles after guiding the Old Lady to four straight league and cup doubles between 2015 and 2019. Simone Inzaghi — a Lazio legend — jumped into the huge hole left by Antonio Conte and has a job on his hands to defend Inter’s Serie A title after the departures of Romelu Lukaku and Achraf Hakimi. Luciano Spalletti inherits a talented Napoli squad which missed out on Europe’s top competition by a single point and will again be a serious contender for the top four positions. After Maurizio Sarri’s arrival at Lazio, Rome derbies will have an interesting clash of styles now that ‘Sarriball’ will face off against arch pragmatist Mourinho. He has talent at his disposal with the likes of Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Luis Alberto backing up Italy forward Ciro Immobile.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/romas-mourinho-leads-a-manager-merry-go-round-in-italy/article36026767.ece
21 August 2021||Berlin,||Bayern’s new-look defence shows promise||After thwarting Dortmund star Erling Braut Haaland, Bayern Munich’s new centre-back pairing Niklas Suele and Dayot Upamecano can help the defending champion claim its first Bundesliga win this season at home to Cologne on Sunday. The pressure was on Suele and Upamecano to forge a partnership after the departures of double Champions League winners Jerome Boateng and David Alaba. Having wobbled on occasion in last Friday’s 1-1 draw at Monchengladbach, the duo earned praise from Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann after victory at Dortmund in the German Super Cup. “We defended very well and were very aggressive. Niki and ‘Upa’ were very stable in the back four,” said Nagelsmann.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bayerns-new-look-defence-shows-promise/article36026745.ece

Langer has come under a barrage of scrutiny in the wake of consecutive white-ball series losses to the West Indies and Bangladesh. Paine told national sports radio network SEN he held an emergency meeting with vice-captain Pat Cummins, limited-overs skipper Aaron Finch and Langer. “We’ve had some really robust conversations amongst our leaders in the last few days and we’re really looking forward to the next six months with JL,” he said. “It was important that myself, Aaron Finch, Pat Cummins and the leaders of Australian cricket got around him.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/paine-backs-langer-after-robust-discussions/article36026585.ece

The number of support staff has been capped at 10. The Ranji Trophy, which wasn’t held last season due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the logistical obstacles in having an extended bio-bubble for 38 teams, will run from January 5 to March 20. The senior men's programme will begin on October 27 with the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. The Vijay Hazare Trophy (National one-dayers) will be played from December 1 to 29 while the senior women will play their first tournament — National one-dayers — from October 20 to November 20. For the Ranji, Vijay Hazare and Syed Mushtaq Ali trophies, the 38 teams will be divided into six groups. There will be five Elite Groups with six teams each and one Plate group with eight teams.

21 August 2021||New Delhi,||Kohli, BCCI top brass chat ‘informally’ over roadmap||The Indian team is fully focused on winning the ongoing Test series in England but both skipper Virat Kohli and the BCCI mandarins are also discussing the roadmap for the upcoming T20 World Cup, which will be an acid test for the captain himself. The Test win at Lord’s has certainly released a lot of pressure off Kohli but he is well aware that his captaincy future hinges on the team’s performance in UAE where they start against arch-rival Pakistan. It is learnt that BCCI president Sourav Ganguly, secretary Jay Shah and vice-president Rajiv Shukla had an informal meeting with the captain during the second Test match at Lord’s and various aspects related to T20 World Cup came up for discussion. “Yes, BCCI top bosses did meet Kohli but let’s say that it will not be fair to divulge the finer details of the discussion. But with very little time left for the T20 World Cup and India not having any games prior to the (IPL), discussion was more about the roadmap going into the event,” a senior BCCI official said on conditions of anonymity. With India playing the Test series till Sept. 14 and then the players to be busy with the IPL, time is of essence. Cause for concern Under Kohli, India has lost in the 2017 Champions Trophy final, 2019 ODI World Cup semifinal apart from this year’s WTC final. Not being able to clear ICC semifinal or final hurdle has been a cause for concern. With the team selection slated for next month, there are multiple issues that needs to be sorted out including bowling workloads, all-rounder’s position, wrist spinners and the like-for-like replacements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kohli-bcci-brass-chat-informally-over-roadmap/article36026680.ece

21 August 2021||CHENNAI,||The plan to confuse opponents worked: Ashok||A penalty corner combines delicate touch and accuracy with brutal power. In other words, it is a tango of a ballet and a boxer’s sledgehammer blow. The Indian men excelled at penalty corners during their memorable bronze medal run at the Tokyo Olympics. The side’s video analyst C. Ashok Kumar told The Hindu , “Everyone knew Rupinder Pal Singh and Harmanpreet took our penalty corners. But, by adding Varun Kumar and Amit Rohidas to our list of potent penalty-corner takers, we managed to confuse our opponents. They could not plan. “Our penalty corners had speed, accuracy and power. We tried different variations and were quick on rebounds,” he added. Having worked with the men’s and women’s junior National teams, the 30-year-old Ashok, a defender who represented Nilgiris in hockey apart from being a qualified umpire, joined the senior team in 2019. Ashok said the role of the “first rusher” was most crucial in stopping penalty corners. “He has to give the drag-flicker as little time as possible. Then, of course, our goalkeeper Sreejesh was outstanding.” Providing an insight into the team’s commitment, Ashok said, “I would be off every morning at 7 a.m. and would return to the room late. We had to watch all the matches, well past midnight. Even then, our senior players would be waiting for me to give inputs and watch the videos of our opponents. “Britain had two players who took penalty corners and each one would hit to a different part of the cage. I told Sreejesh about this ahead of the quarterfinal and it worked.” The video analyst said he had one-on-one sessions with the players on strategy. “The weather was hot and humid and we could not go all out in those conditions. We had to hold the ball,” said Ashok. He felt that the team erred by going defensive after having the better of the exchanges till half-time against Belgium in the semifinal. Ashok was, however, relieved that the side picked itself up for the bronze playoff. “We were spot on with our tactics against Germany. Whenever they raised the tempo and attempted to play fast hockey, we slowed down the game. This denied them rhythm while we could still hit them on the break.” The man from Nilgiris was delighted that Indian hockey reached great heights in Tokyo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-plan-to-confuse-opponents-worked-ashok/article36026678.ece

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Onam’s harvest of many dishes||The freshly washed banana leaf placed in front of me sparkled with all kinds of dishes. I broke a piece of the papadam , and began a memorable meal. We were at a friend’s place for an Onam sadhya before the pandemic. Since then, I have been waiting for COVID-19 restrictions to lift, to be able to enjoy a communal meal. That will happen one day, I am sure, but meanwhile — on the occasion of Onam this year — I had sadhya food at home.  Sadhya , as we all know, is the festive feast of Kerala. Because of the pandemic, home chefs and restaurants have started delivering a full sadhya to all those pining for it. One of the outlets is the Gurugram-based Magic with Spices, run by chef Rekha Raghavan. She is offering a special Onam lunch at Le Meridien in Gurugram today and tomorrow, and is also delivering food for the occasion (Rs. 1100 plus taxes; ph: 9773613978). Likewise, Zambar has an Onam special for dinner and lunch till August 23 at the Ambience Mall in Gurugram (Rs. 999 plus taxes; ph: 9958564400). It has a sadhya hamper delivery service across Delhi-NCR, too (Rs. 1,095 plus taxes). Zambar has chef Vetri Murugan, a southern coastal cuisine specialist, at the helm. It’s difficult to do justice to the wide spectrum of dishes that figure in a traditional Kerala banana leaf meal. Chef Rekha, who describes herself as a corporate slave turned passionate chef, tells me that people traditionally serve nine dishes at home. But the number of dishes can go up to 25 or more — as it does in both these sadhyas . There is nothing not to like in this vegetarian meal, so let me focus on the dishes that I enjoyed the most. I began with red rice, a small helping of ghee and parippu curry (yellow moong dal cooked with coconut), velvety and light. It set the tone for the varied flavours that followed. I loved the spiciness of the rasam , and the mildly tart taste of the sambar, pepped up with seasonal vegetables. The morru kachiyatha — a yoghurt dish seasoned with herbs and shallots — was superb as was the aviyal, cooked with yam, carrot, raw banana, drumstick, beans, potatoes, bottle gourd, eggplant, and other veggies. Chef Rekha added coconut paste to it along with some curd and topped it with coconut oil. Then there was kalan , a dish of yogurt, raw banana and grated coconut. The eriserry — pumpkin, red beans, and coconut — had all the right flavours, as did the nicely crunchy beans thoran . I particularly enjoyed chef Murugan’s kootu curry, prepared with raw bananas, black chana, and grated coconut. The olan , ash gourd and red beans in creamy coconut milk, was good too. The sadhya meal has a lot of add-ons — pickles, banana chips, chips coated with jaggery and so on. The inji curry — ginger, tamarind, and jaggery chutney — was deliciously tart, and made for a great side dish. I ended the meal with two types of payasam, and loved them both. The pal payasam with dry fruits and rice in milk was rich and smooth, as was the scrumptious ada pradhamam , rice flakes with coconut and jaggery. What more can I say, but Happy Onam?

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Judge Sabyasachi on his core strength: business||Barely a week into designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee’s global collaboration with fashion retail giant H&M, everything that could go wrong has done so. The ‘crashed apps and stubborn carts’ as he called them on an Instagram post, problems with fits and not enough size inclusivity, and that very bad word: viscose. Not to mention a collective open letter from the country’s craft communities that has gone viral. In the midst of all this, I feel we have forgotten something crucial about Sabyasachi the designer. That he is, foremost, a businessman. He has made no secret of it ever since he started doing interviews, which was pretty much from his debut on the ramp at the then Lakmé India Fashion Week at the turn of the millennium. And I, for one, do not see a problem with that. For over 20 years, Sabyasachi has evolved into a brand that has pushed a craft-oriented narrative in his bridal wear, creating a tribe of moneyed loyalists across the world. He has become a household name for even those who can only dream of owning a handkerchief with the Bengal Tiger logo. Why, then, is a collaboration that makes his designs available to a global audience, being judged through the lens of socialist morals when it is clearly a capitalist business exercise?  Highlighting our hypocrisy  The questions being posed to him make me laugh because, while the board is the same, he’s playing checkers and we’re stuck in the arcana of chess. Example: ‘He’s known as a champion of the crafts of India. Why did he not ensure that even a percentage of this collection features Indian crafts?’ Why should he? It’s a collaboration with H&M! The same people who were happy to queue outside H&M stores when their Balmain line launched in 2015 — with the worst blended wool military coats and ill-cut trousers — are questioning why something Sabyasachi already sells for lakhs of rupees isn’t available for thousands while also being mass produced for a global launch? No designer or creative person on this planet owes us affordability. That they choose to do so through such collabs is, well, their business. Which leads me to this: behind the criticism that Sabyasachi today faces lies a denial of our own hypocrisy. We love the idea of such fashion collaborations as great levellers as long as they’re done with international designer names. Yet we are also the ones who are quick to suggest a lighterodhanior a border or two fewer when that couture weddinglehengais just out of budget. Let’s admit it, it was never about Sabyasachi or the craftspeople. It’s about us not getting what we want for cheaper; about the fact that here, at home, we are coddled by designers who are happy to oblige because they produce fewer SKUs of higher value as part of their business strategy. And that’s OK, because it is our unique ecosystem. Sabyasachi, I’m told, is one of the few Indian designers who does not entertain such requests. So how is a global fashion collaboration, the very premise of which is to sell in numbers, being held responsible for ringing the ‘death knell’ on the future of craft communities of India? When did a choice to collaborate with a fast-fashion retailer become a zero sum game? The artisans of India do not rely solely on Sabyasachi giving them work, do they? Many designers before him have made exquisite saris and lehengas , and continue to do so. One of his greatest innovations is creating a system of line production when it was almost unheard of in India, giving him an edge over his competition.  Putting business first  So why are we so disappointed in this one-of-a-kind global design collaboration that, according to Sabyasachi Mukherjee, has shown the world that India can also be a hub of design, and not just cheap, skilled labour? And what real possibility ever existed for India’s artisans to actually be a part of this collaboration without prices shooting up even beyond the (gasp!) Rs. 9,999, digitally-printed sari featuring (allegedly) Sanganeri block print motifs? Few designers across the world have a head for business. Sabyasachi is one of them. If he is to be judged as a designer, then this conversation is pointless. Let us judge him on the basis of his core strength, which is business. The questions we should be asking are: has he created a global furore like H&M’s previous collections with Karl Lagerfeld and Balmain did? Yes. Does this range make his design signature available to people who otherwise cannot afford his couture? Yes. Does it crack the door open for other talented Indian designers to explore planet-wide design collaborations? Yes. And perhaps the most relevant question of all: did it ever have anything to do with our artisanal legacy beyond informing the visual aesthetics of the collection? The answer, as has been proved with every resounding ka-ching of the till, is no.

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||The next hit web series||Since our most committed relationships of late have been with web series through the lockdown, surely we’re experts at what makes one now?  Bullet-proof chest: Everyone else gets shot and killed in every action scene. The hero clings on. The bad men are bad shots. Everyone misses the hero. Worrying about him in any episode is useless because he has to survive till the end of the series. Even if he’s killed in the first scene as Ganesh Gaitonde is in Sacred Games , he still lives through 16 episodes till that point.  Reptilian eye muscles: Before each break, the camera freezes on someone’s face. They never blink. Often with tears that never spill. Don’t pretend you’ve never seen Sony Crime Patrol . This look is supposed to convey deep meaning. But you suspect the cameraman has gone for a hygiene break.  An empty closet : When a cheating couple is about to get caught, the man hides in a closet where his phone must ring. I don’t know which house has a closet not stuffed with wedding saris and gifts to recycle. Mine has clothes I resolve to one day fit back into. I mean — who has an empty closet?  A second empty closet : Screen women shower a lot. Whenever the villain enters, the woman must be showering. The villain hides in the empty closet too. If the villain and the cheating man jump into the same closet together, it may turn into quite another story.  Almost — but never — solve it: So that your viewers binge-watch themselves into paranoia. After the Family Man , hordes of people began to plead to join the Threat And Surveillance Cell of the NIA. When told it didn’t exist, they began to do their own espionage, calling in terrorist threats from old women’s grocery bags and pigeon poop on windowsills.  Feeble family trees: The actor will be paired with a mother and father who look as different from him as geese from a rhino. Heroes and heroines could be selling their mother’s gold bangles because they are so desperately poor, but you soon suspect that’s because they blow it all on designer wardrobes through 10 colourful episodes.  Less story per story : If all else fails, do a Narcos . Fill each episode with so much violence, orgies, bloodshed and swear words that you only need five minutes of actual story. Bet we could draw Three Little Pigs into a 3-season 30-episode tearjerker. And given the global-warming effect on the wolf’s lungs, he could huff and puff for another 10 episodes without blowing the house down.  Put a Pankaj Tripathi in. Even better! He’s so good, you won’t even need the story.  A red herring: The murderer is the only one who has no motive or means, until the last scene where he gets mind-boggling multiples of both. You’ve watched so many Swedish noir web series that you now suspect the first one in the first episode who has no means or motive, even if it’s the fish in the fishbowl. I’m opening auditions for my new web series. Those with reptilian eye muscles may apply.

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Nine ways to say nothing||Much has been written about the cinematic disaster that is the anthology film Navarasa , now showing on Netflix. And while one usually dismisses bad films with a shrug, these nine shorts come from Tamil cinema’s supposedly top filmmakers, which makes the mediocrity a bit inexplicable. Worse, the series is created by star director Mani Ratnam, about whose cinematic mojo the less said the better after this outing. But what stood out for me after the four-hour anthology was the extraordinary aridity of the cinematic imagination on display. And this, I believe, comes from the great cultural vacuum we now occupy where all creative energy is expended on negotiating what, for want of a better word, I will call the ‘middle’. Nothing else explains why the segment on ‘Wonder’ could not frame a 30-minute futuristic plot about a time machine without dragging in astrology and God and feeling compelled to name its protagonists Vishnu, Krishna and Kalki. The inability of Indian artists and writers to go beyond mythology might at one level be looked at simply as artistic failure but I would argue that this bogging down also explains our continuing lack of creativity in, for instance, engineering or pharmacology or even dance, where bold, original, cutting-edge ideas still elude us. A society that continuously harks back is ill-equipped to meet the future and that gets reflected in this anthology as well, whether in its decision to rake up the ancient Natyashastra or in its failure to craft a critical and contemporary lens to explore the ninerasas. The episode on ‘Disgust’, for example, is intent on perfectly reproducing a Brahmin village in 1965. So you get authenticity of a photographic kind, admirable no doubt, but one can’t evoke something as primal as disgust when drowning in sweet nostalgia, especially when disgust itself is such a strong and subjective emotion, varying across cultures and across generations. The film is unreal, blank, like a pretty ad forkanjeevaramsaris, its social setting limited, its transgression too petty for horror. In ‘Anger’, where a single mother is forced to sleep with her employer for a loan to tide her family over, the responses the filmmaker dredges up are rage and humiliation. Not respect, not understanding, not even just love, but the same tired, violent responses that drive honour killings. If murder and an unforgiving daughter are the only things a film can conjure up in 2021, if one must still ‘judge’ a woman’s bodily choices and not just shut up, it exposes not only the project’s creative poverty, but the barrenness of the cultural landscape it inhabits. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that not one of the nine episodes has a woman director. One suspects a woman might have at least had a different sense of humour. In ‘Haasya’, Priyadarshan not only lazily decides that the mere presence of a large, dark, unkempt personage will generate laughter, but that spinsterhood is the ultimate defeat for a woman. Indian society’s deep discomfort with dark skin, academic failure, human waste, impurity, single women, all come together in this sad excuse of an episode that any self-respecting creative director would have thrown out. Artistic uncertainty of this magnitude can only be the reflection of a tottering society — one where we feel compelled to equate religion with science to prove our ‘ancient’ credentials; where not a day goes by without women being bullied on social media, often by violent male fans of the same film industry; where the worst ‘insults’ against women still question her ‘virginity’ and ‘chastity’; where people can still be labelled ‘unclean’ and thus excluded; where caste is an obsession and public humiliation honed to perfection; where we are so obsessed by a romanticised past that we have lost the ability to question an unpleasant present. Such an uneasy, unsure and underconfident society will invariably inspire bizarre art as well. And, not least, result in the kind of clueless impotence that marks the last Navarasa segment, ‘Romance’. Directed by Gautham Menon, the segment’s emotional emptiness and vacuity, the artifice it substitutes for candour, the verbosity it chooses over action is in many, many ways a simulacrum of society today. The hollow men of this anthology are no accident, but wholly a product of our times. Where the writer tries to make sense of society with seven hundred words and a bit of snark.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/nine-ways-to-say-nothing/article36026506.ece
21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Summer in Berlin||And so, my peregrinations bring me to Berlin, for the first time in summer. I’d only been here for the justly celebrated Berlin Film Festival, which is held during the winter and the act of rushing from screening to screening keeps you warm at what is truly a miserable time, weather-wise, in this great metropolis. Summer in Berlin, on the other hand, is a glorious time. The sun is shining, Covid is at bay, and vaccinated people are back at cinemas, museums, galleries and restaurants. Pausing only to meet a few filmmaker friends who are based in Berlin, I launched into my musings about films set in this magnificent city without much delay. Leni Riefenstahl’s Olympia (1938) in two parts — Festival of Nations and Festival of Beauty — her document of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, is correctly derided as Nazi propaganda, and she was subsequently disgraced. However, there is no denying her immense cinematic talent and the films are beautiful to look at, though the politics and underlying social history cannot and should not be denied. There is of course Sebastian Schipper’s pounding Victoria (2015), where a young Spanish woman in Berlin is caught up in events beyond her control. Set across one night in the city, Victoria is one of those one-shot films featuring non-stop exhilarating action with nary a pause for breath. A dazzling technical achievement which was duly recognised at the Berlin festival. A key sequence in Victoria takes place at Checkpoint Charlie, that hallowed gateway between the erstwhile East and West Berlin which has been referenced in countless novels and movies. I duly visited the place which now also has a harrowing exhibit detailing the history of Berlin from 1933-45. Martin Ritt’s The Spy Who Came in From the Cold (1965) opens at Checkpoint Charlie, James Bond crosses over in Octopussy (1983) and the locale and indeed the Berlin Wall has been featured time and again in many films dealing with the Cold War including recently, Steven Spielberg’s Bridge of Spies (2015). This can in no way be a comprehensive look at films set in Berlin, so after a quick hat tip to Wim Wenders’ Wings of Desire (1987), I’ll confine myself now to the various iterations of Berlin Alexanderplatz , named after the vast square in the heart of the city. In 1929, Alfred Döblin wrote Berlin Alexanderplatz , about a small-time criminal who has just been released from prison after being involved in a murder and finds himself in the big, bad city, and inevitably is drawn to those of his own ilk. The book was adapted as a film as early as 1931. The most comprehensive adaptation of the book is Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s sprawling 14-part 1980 television series. In preparation for this trip, I pulled out my hitherto unwatched blu-ray of Burhan Qurbani’s 2020 adaptation, which changed the lead character to an illegal immigrant from Bissau, West Africa, lending layers of complexity to an already dense tale. The film is three hours short and is another breathtaking ode to the city that has and will continue to give to cinema.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/summer-in-berlin/article36026512.ece

She’s had her hands full with ad films with cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni and actor Hrithik Roshan, a music video with actor Sonu Sood, and a comedy show for Zee TV. What Khan has now been in the news for is the recently-concluded masterclass for Airbnb, ‘Behind The Lens With Farah Khan’, where she speed-mentored a small group of participants on the art of auditioning, and the gritty yet glamorous world of Hindi cinema. “Auditions will continue being remote for a long time. They are easier for casting directors as a lot more people can join and you also get talent from across India, which otherwise you wouldn’t be privy to,” she says. Her tips for a good audition: nDress the part, if you can. It shows that you have put in extra effort. nStand in good lighting. It might be difficult when people have smaller houses, but find a flattering light.

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Art lists and the questions that arise||The third edition of the Hurun India Art List was released last week. Technically, the artist who topped it this year as well, Anish Kapoor, with sales worth Rs. 20.64 crore at public auctions last year, doesn’t even live in India. The London-based sculptor’s conceptual work has made it to the Venice Biennale and the Royal Academy of Arts (the first living artist to be given a solo there), and he has won renown with landmarks such as the Cloud Gate in Chicago and Britain’s ArcelorMittal Orbit. Interestingly, there’s no mention of Hurun on his social media. One wonders if it matters to him or if he is even aware of it. Many artists are not. When I reached out to Vasundhara Tewari-Broota, whose husband Rameshwar Broota is number three on the list, she was surprised. “He is not someone who looks at these lists,” she tells me. How about the news that she has clocked in at number eight on Hurun’s Women Artists’ list? “It is a pleasant surprise,” smiles the artist, whose figurative paintings explore the psycho-political existence of the female body. But she quickly adds that “it brings me back to the old argument: the artist never gets a share in these astronomical sales [that puts them on these lists in the first place]. They have usually sold the artwork long ago for a sum that looks meagre when placed next to the current auctioned price, which is usually in crores of rupees.” This is just one of the uncomfortable questions that lists such as Hurun’s (which draws its data from online resource artprice.com) bring up. Do rankings affect how galleries showcase artists or how collectors invest in artwork? Does knowing where the artists are from — West Bengal contributed the most number in the list (10 entrants), followed by Kerala and Maharashtra — help, beyond making good headlines? Most often, it’s a no. “Anish Kapoor is represented in our international Post War and Contemporary auctions across the globe,” says Deepanjana Klein, International Head, Department for Contemporary Indian & Southeast Asian Art at Christie’s Auction House. “His price points are very different and do not reflect the Indian art market or have an impact on it, as the majority of his works are bought mainly by international collectors.”  Let’s talk money  But before we get to the questions... do these lists matter? Many come out each year, from Forbes to Time to Business Standard . Internationally, Shanghai-based Hurun Report, the wealth research firm, puts out several — from rich lists and top philanthropists to global art top 50s. But do artists and collectors care about them? “I don’t know who actually looks at them,” says Ashvin E Rajagopalan, co-founder of Chennai-based Ashvita gallery, stating that Hurun India’s numbers are off. “I don’t know what their source of data is. If it is public auctions, then Krishen Khanna sold more than Rs. 6.87 crores last year!” Meanwhile, Sharan Apparao, of Apparao Galleries, says, “Seasoned collectors don’t refer to lists when buying high-end art, and it’s not important to artists either because their prices aren’t controlled by these.” One of the few she looks at is ArtReview ’s Power 100 in the Art World (and that too, occasionally). What such lists can do, however, is be conversation starters. For example, about the need for royalties in the art world. “Artists don’t really benefit from auction sales, not directly at least,” says Anjolie Ela Menon over the phone from her studio in Nizamuddin. Incidentally, the 81-year-old contemporary artist, whose solo show, By The River , is on at the AICON Gallery in New York, is number eight on the Hurun list. “Just before the pandemic, we were proposing the formation of a board that would oversee issues of 7% royalties to the artist of every auction sale, authentication and other such matters. But because everything shut down, it got halted and I doubt it will be formed any time soon.” Menon points out that an artist like Tyeb Mehta never made any direct earnings from the auction sales, though it has raked in crores (in 2018, his painting, Kali , was purchased anonymously for over Rs. 26 crore) and put him on innumerable records. “A percentage should come to the artist every time their work is sold,” she says, along the lines of what Artist Resale Rights has achieved in Europe, the UK and California. “But, currently, there’s a sense of helplessness; we must form at least an artists’ union.” Anas Rahman Junaid, who heads Hurun India, the organisation that brings out the annual list, says he’s been closely observing the transitioning of India’s entrepreneurial landscape from being largely run by family businesses, to the era of new-age entrepreneurs and their revolutionary business ideas. “Rapid advancements in technology have enabled the ‘millennial entrepreneur’ to show great enthusiasm towards this new economic culture,” he says, adding that auction prices follow the ‘trickle down theory’ and affect gallery prices as it indicates global acclaim of the artworks. “I believe that the next decade presents a great opportunity for India to reposition herself. My continuing mission for the Hurun report is to find these synergies and contribute value to the entrepreneurial landscape.”  The NFT debate  Technology is one of the ways open to artists to keep track of their work and get just rewards. Mumbai-based artist Santanu Hazarika believes blockchain will dismantle the culture of gatekeeping in a bid to empower artists. If the authentication of artworks can be digitised — with blockchain keeping track of sales automatically — it would be easier to ensure a percentage goes to the artist as royalty. At present, several international NFT platforms, such as SuperRare, offer this. Artists get 5%-15% royalty every time their artwork is resold. However, he says, it’s still early days in India. “We will have to wait and watch, as it is a growing market that needs many kinks to be ironed out. For instance, the difficulties around obtaining authentication certificates when the artist is no more. Or tracing the provenance of artworks that have been resold more than once.” Auction houses, however, are more cautious. “It is true that an NFT is inscribed on a blockchain and so the provenance history is forever publicly accessible. But to date auction houses cannot offer NFTs all around the world, as there are no general guidelines in place, which would include the question of copyright,” says Klein. Christie’s pioneered NFTs in the global auction market and is leading this category with $93.2 million in sales this year. Meanwhile, the lists will continue. And whether we take them as definitive voices celebrating wealth creation or not, as Junaid points out “most newcomers to the art world almost always refer to a power-list”. It’s up to us how best we utilise them and what conversations we push forward.  “My father Krishen Khanna [number 3 on the list] was happy to hear he was featured. His words were: ‘Technically I am number one because Anish Kapoor is not living in India!’ I would say that such lists help us get an aggregate notion of the art market. Auction prices do filter down to affect gallery prices” — Karan Khanna , the artist’s son||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/art-lists-and-the-questions-that-arise/article36026540.ece
21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||The next hit web series||Since our most committed relationships of late have been with web series through the lockdown, surely we’re experts at what makes one now?  Bullet-proof chest: Everyone else gets shot and killed in every action scene. The hero clings on. The bad men are bad shots. Everyone misses the hero. Worrying about him in any episode is useless because he has to survive till the end of the series. Even if he’s killed in the first scene as Ganesh Gaitonde is in Sacred Games , he still lives through 16 episodes till that point.  Reptilian eye muscles: Before each break, the camera freezes on someone’s face. They never blink. Often with tears that never spill. Don’t pretend you’ve never seen Sony Crime Patrol . This look is supposed to convey deep meaning. But you suspect the cameraman has gone for a hygiene break.  An empty closet : When a cheating couple is about to get caught, the man hides in a closet where his phone must ring. I don’t know which house has a closet not stuffed with wedding saris and gifts to recycle. Mine has clothes I resolve to one day fit back into. I mean — who has an empty closet?  A second empty closet : Screen women shower a lot. Whenever the villain enters, the woman must be showering. The villain hides in the empty closet too. If the villain and the cheating man jump into the same closet together, it may turn into quite another story.  Almost — but never — solve it: So that your viewers binge-watch themselves into paranoia. After the Family Man , hordes of people began to plead to join the Threat And Surveillance Cell of the NIA. When told it didn’t exist, they began to do their own espionage, calling in terrorist threats from old women’s grocery bags and pigeon poop on windowsills.  Feeble family trees: The actor will be paired with a mother and father who look as different from him as geese from a rhino. Heroes and heroines could be selling their mother’s gold bangles because they are so desperately poor, but you soon suspect that’s because they blow it all on designer wardrobes through 10 colourful episodes.  Less story per story : If all else fails, do a Narcos . Fill each episode with so much violence, orgies, bloodshed and swear words that you only need five minutes of actual story. Bet we could draw Three Little Pigs into a 3-season 30-episode tearjerker. And given the global-warming effect on the wolf’s lungs, he could huff and puff for another 10 episodes without blowing the house down.  Put a Pankaj Tripathi in. Even better! He’s so good, you won’t even need the story.  A red herring: The murderer is the only one who has no motive or means, until the last scene where he gets mind-boggling multiples of both. You’ve watched so many Swedish noir web series that you now suspect the first one in the first episode who has no means or motive, even if it’s the fish in the fishbowl. I’m opening auditions for my new web series. Those with reptilian eye muscles may apply.

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Summer in Berlin||And so, my peregrinations bring me to Berlin, for the first time in summer. I’d only been here for the justly celebrated Berlin Film Festival, which is held during the winter and the act of rushing from screening to screening keeps you warm at what is truly a miserable time, weather-wise, in this great metropolis. Summer in Berlin, on the other hand, is a glorious time. The sun is shining, Covid is at bay, and vaccinated people are back at cinemas, museums, galleries and restaurants. Pausing only to meet a few filmmaker friends who are based in Berlin, I launched into my musings about films set in this magnificent city without much delay. Leni Riefenstahl’s Olympia (1938) in two parts — Festival of Nations and Festival of Beauty — her document of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, is correctly derided as Nazi propaganda, and she was subsequently disgraced. However, there is no denying her immense cinematic talent and the films are beautiful to look at, though the politics and underlying social history cannot and should not be denied. There is of course Sebastian Schipper’s pounding Victoria (2015), where a young Spanish woman in Berlin is caught up in events beyond her control. Set across one night in the city, Victoria is one of those one-shot films featuring non-stop exhilarating action with nary a pause for breath. A dazzling technical achievement which was duly recognised at the Berlin festival. A key sequence in Victoria takes place at Checkpoint Charlie, that hallowed gateway between the erstwhile East and West Berlin which has been referenced in countless novels and movies. I duly visited the place which now also has a harrowing exhibit detailing the history of Berlin from 1933-45. Martin Ritt’s The Spy Who Came in From the Cold (1965) opens at Checkpoint Charlie, James Bond crosses over in Octopussy (1983) and the locale and indeed the Berlin Wall has been featured time and again in many films dealing with the Cold War including recently, Steven Spielberg’s Bridge of Spies (2015). This can in no way be a comprehensive look at films set in Berlin, so after a quick hat tip to Wim Wenders’ Wings of Desire (1987), I’ll confine myself now to the various iterations of Berlin Alexanderplatz , named after the vast square in the heart of the city.

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||India’s delayed and stalled projects||Given the huge funding crunch in the construction industry, the outlook for people who bought units in completely stalled projects is disastrous, while the prospects for buyers in heavily delayed projects are bleak at best. The overall value of the 1.74 lakh homes which are totally stuck across the seven top cities currently exceeds Rs. 1,40,613 crore. Nearly 66% of these units fall in the price bracket of under Rs. 80 lakh. The Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) fund has come to the rescue of several projects, while the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) has also ‘adopted’ some others specifically in NCR. Prashant Thakur, Director and Head — Research, Anarock Property Consultants says, “For our earlier 2019-end tally of stalled and heavily delayed projects, we had considered projects launched in 2013 or before. Now, more than one and half years later, we have included projects launched in 2014 as well. Thus, there is a rise in the numbers — as of H1 2021-end, we have nearly 6.29 lakh units that are yet to be completed across the top seven cities.” Thakur adds that previously, NCR had a 35% share of total delayed units (in 2019). However, its share now increased to 52% as several projects launched in NCR in 2014 are also included, he says. “There are many possible reasons, including COVID-19, funding issues, and litigations. The decrease in delayed units in Pune and MMR is remarkable - from 16% and 36% by 2019-end to 8% and 24% by H1 2021-end,” he says. Stalled projects: city-wise data NCR has maximum stalled stock of approx. 1,13,860 units (approx. value Rs. 86,463 crore) or 66% of the total across the top seven cities. Of the total stalled units in the region, 50% is in the mid-segment, followed by 24% in the affordable segment, 20% in the premium segment and 6% in the luxury category. MMR has 41,730 totally stalled units (approx. value Rs. 42,417 crore) or 24% of the total affected stock. The maximum stuck stock in MMR is in the luxury category (37%), followed by 22% in affordable housing, 21% in the premium segment, and 20% in the mid-segment. Pune, the other major Western market, has a 6% share of stalled units (worth approx. Rs. 5,854 crore). Pune has 52% of its stalled stock share in the mid-segment, 26% in the affordable segment, 15% in the premium segment, and 7% in the luxury category. In the Southern cities, Chennai has no stalled projects. Hyderabad and Bengaluru together have 8,020 stalled units which is a mere 5% share. The approx. value of stalled projects in these two cities is Rs. 5,788 crore. In Bengaluru, of the total 3,870 stalled units, 44% are in the mid-segment, 32% in the premium segment, 17% in the luxury category, and just 7% in the affordable housing category; in Hyderabad, of total 4,150 stalled units, 55% are in the mid-segment, 28% in the premium segment, 9% in the luxury category, and in the affordable housing segment. Kolkata has a mere 150 stalled units (valued at approx. Rs. 91 crore). All stalled units are priced >Rs. 80 lakh. The bigger picture Altogether, approx. 6.29 lakh homes are either completely stalled or languishing under heavy delivery delays across the top seven cities. At least 71% (approx. 4.49 lakh) of these delayed or stuck units fall within the price-sensitive Rs. 80 lakh budget range. Just 18% fall in the premium segment, and another 11% in the luxury category. Launched in 2014 or before, the total value of the currently stuck/delayed housing stock exceeds Rs. 5.05 lakh crore. Nearly 28% (approx. 1,73,730) of these units are completely stalled. City-wise data  NCR has overtaken MMR with a 52% share of the stuck/delayed stock, the highest in the top seven cities — approx. value Rs. 2,49,540 crore. MMR reduced its overall share with several projects getting completed in the last year. Currently, it has 28% of the total affected stock — approx. value Rs. 1,52,105 crore. Pune, the other major Western market, has an 8% share of stuck/delayed units — approx. worth Rs. 29,390 crore. In the Southern cities, housing projects are mostly on track. Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai together have just 11% of the total delayed/stuck units, with Chennai comprising a mere 2% — approx. value of delayed/stuck projects in these three cities is Rs. 56,420 crore. Kolkata has a 5% share valued at Rs. 17,960 crore City-wise budget segmentation Of approx. 6.29 lakh delayed/stuck units, close to 39% (approx. 2,47,930 units) is in the mid-range segment where units are priced within Rs. 40-80 lakh, followed by 32% (approx. 2,01,350 units) in the affordable housing segment (priced <Rs. 40 lakh). Premium homes (Rs. 80 lakh to Rs. 1.5 crore) account for 18% (approx. 1,11,050 units). The luxury segment (units priced >Rs. 1.5 crore) has just 68,300 delayed/stuck units in the top seven cities.

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||The IT/ITeS boom||To say the least, COVID-19 seriously disrupted the Indian office sector in 2020. The total sector-specific office leasing activity in the three dominant IT hubs of Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune declined by approx. 55% against the preceding year — from 62.35 million sq. ft. in 2019 to 27.80 million sq. ft. in 2020. However, these three cities are witnessing a significant rise in leasing activity by the non-IT/ITeS sectors like the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) segment. Prashant Thakur, Director & Head — Research, Anarock Property Consultants says, “BFSI firms are primarily attracted to these cities because of their more affordable rentals and the availability of relevant talent and workforce. It is clearly a hedge against future disruptions and a bid to ensure business continuity.” BFSI’s increasing prominence IT/ITeS hotbed Hyderabad recorded the highest rise in BFSI segment leasing activity. Of the total gross absorption of 12.35 million sq. ft. in 2019, BFSI comprised a 10% share. This nearly doubled to 19% of the total 5.70 million sq. ft. space leased in 2020. Interestingly, out of the 1.02 million sq. ft. leased in H1 2021, the share of the BFSI sector rose to 38%. Bengaluru saw similar trends — from an 8% share in 2019 (of 42.6 million sq. ft. gross absorption) to 15% in 2020 (of 17.8 million sq. ft.), and 13% in H1 2021 (of 6.70 million sq. ft.). The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) — India’s most expensive real estate destination —— was once the nation’s predominant BFSI hub preferred by most global and national players. Post the pandemic, many companies are adopting work-from-home and thereby optimising their operational costs. Amid these new realities, the BFSI sector is finally seeing the feasibility of looking beyond MMR. Cities with sub dollar (under USD 1/sq/ft.) office rents and enough relevant talent pools are now gaining momentum.  The surge in Pune Meanwhile, many consulting companies’ delivery centres are looking at Pune to set up base in. The city offers a healthy mix of industrial and IT/ITeS real estate, with lower rental values and burgeoning infrastructure also pivotal decision drivers. The increased preference for the city as a manufacturing hub for companies shifting out of China has been a major demand boost for the professional services segment. Out of the total 1.09 million sq. ft. office space leased in Pune in H1 2021, nearly 13% was by the professional services sector. In both 2020 and 2019, this sector’s occupancy share was approx. 7%. In 2020, gross absorption in Pune was approx. 4.4 million sq. ft. while in 2019 it was 7.4 million sq. ft. Future trends Despite the above, the IT/ITeS sectors will continue to lead in terms of share of commercial office leasing in these three cities. Demand for IT/ITeS-specific office spaces in Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune will gain further momentum in the coming years. However, the emergence of an alternate demand driver is crucial for regaining ground lost due to the pandemic. We will see these cities’ office markets see a DNA-level transformation in the post pandemic era.  Anarock Property Consultants   Out of the 1.02 million sq. ft. leased in H1 2021, the share of the BFSI sector rose to 38%||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/the-itites-boom/article36026566.ece
21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Demystifying ‘green’ buildings||According to a recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, global warming will increase the planet’s temperatures by as much as 1.5 degrees celsius in the next 20 years. Indian coastal cities like Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata have been put ‘on notice’, but all our cities will be affected to some or the other extent. The global warming issue is no longer futuristic — it will affect us in our lifetime. Global warming has several reasons, but they all come down to one major factor — the unsustainable way we build and run our cities, live our lives and exploit the planet without giving enough back. Real estate developers shoulder a major responsibility. An increasing number of homebuyers are willing to buy ‘green’ homes, but somebody has to build them. In fact, in the future, developers must only build genuinely green and sustainable habitats - for us today and for the coming generations. The India story In India, the rate at which we are depleting our natural resources is alarming. Most of the buildings being developed here even today are extremely wasteful and environmentally damaging. Globally, regular (read unsustainable) real estate consumes almost 40% of a country’s available energy, 30% of its existing natural resources, 20% of its available groundwater, and accounts for 20% of the land use. Besides using precious water and energy, urban real estate across the world generates 40% of a city’s carbon emissions, releases 30% of its solid waste, and adds 20% of its overall water effluents into rivers and seas. In India, around 70% of the buildings to be completed by 2030 are still only on paper. In the UK, more than 80% of the buildings to be built by 2050 are already completed. With almost 70% of India’s building stock still to come up, we are using up natural resources much faster than developed countries. No doubt, the country’s green footprint is slowly rising. From just 20,000 sq. ft. of green built-up area in 2003, today there are more than 6,781 green buildings projects (covering over 7.86 billion sq. ft. area) registered with the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). Of these total green building projects, 33% are already certified and fully functional. But it isn’t enough. These green buildings represent only 5-7% of the total building stock in the country. Reaping ‘green’ benefits Green buildings have both tangible and intangible benefits. Reduction of water and energy consumption is a tangible benefit — green buildings use anywhere between 20-30% less energy and 30-50% less water. Some of the intangible benefits are improved air quality, proper ventilation, healthy use of daylight and natural ventilation instead of electrical lighting and cooling, and improved occupants’ overall health. And, equally if not more importantly, they slow down the process of environmental degradation — buying us a few more precious years to stop and reverse the damage we are causing with our real estate, our lifestyles, and our industrial policies. So, if there are so many benefits to green buildings, why are we not building more of them? Need for incentives One reason is the all-around lack of awareness. Indians need to educate themselves about the benefits of living in green homes, and developers need more incentives to build such homes. Such incentives can include (but are not limited to) an easier approval process, making land for green buildings available at lower rates, and providing GST benefits on raw materials used in green buildings. Homebuyers must also become more aware of the benefits of sustainable living. There is a general perception that the cost of constructing a green building is exorbitant, which means that the cost of homes in such a building is also very high. This is a completely wrong perception. The cost is just 10-20% higher than conventional homes, depending on the types of materials used and the extent of sustainable features included in the project. This extra cost is easily compensated for in the mid to long term by diminished water and electricity bills, lower property taxes (if provided by the local authorities) and reduced healthcare bills. The benefits are much higher in integrated townships, where the entire ecosystem is built on and around sustainability principles. Because of the economies of scale, such townships deliver much more green benefits to their residents than smaller projects do. What’s the government doing? The problem is obviously a national one that involves industrial policies and overall economic decisions. However, land and land use is a state subject — in other words, each state is individually responsible for its environmental impact. At the local level, some state governments have been pushing certain mandatory rules concerning sustainability. For example, civic bodies like the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) have made rainwater harvesting provisions and facilities compulsory for standalone buildings and housing societies. The newer integrated townships have all the required sustainability features, as a matter of course. In all other cases, all new buildings with more or equal to 150 flats need a sewage treatment plant in the project. But more often than not, the installation and operation of green features are not taken seriously. Even if solar panels, rainwater harvesting, water/sewage treatment, and natural composting have been set up, many housing societies do not maintain them properly. The big picture Addressing the sustainability imperative does not end with green buildings. The major task of local governing bodies is to make cities and human settlements more inclusive, resilient, safe, and sustainable in the long run. Already, development authorities like the PMRDA are working to take a greener path by implementing environment-friendly green technologies for infrastructure development. Green infrastructure reaps not only economic benefits but also ecological ones. In some better-planned Indian cities, transit-oriented development is now the new norm for future urban centres. Thanks to reforms in land-use regulations, developers are given more freedom to construct mixed-use and higher-density developments. While the government has laid down several rules for maintaining ecological balance, it is also the prerogative of local authorities to check if they are being implemented at the ground level. They need to efficiently weigh the economic impact of a particular project vs. its ecological impact. India’s future cities must be built as per geographical requirements, achieve optimal residential density, integrate transportation and land-use, ensure motor vehicle-free areas, depend more on locally-owned and operated stores, and have walkable neighbourhoods within their urban planning designs. In simple terms, urban planners must expand on the model of integrated townships and start creating integrated cities. But even before that happens, we can make a difference with how we choose to live. When more citizens prefer green homes in sustainable projects, the market will respond to the increased demand with more supply. Each one of us can begin to make a positive difference to the environment today.

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||The global city index||As per property consultancy Knight Frank India’s latest ‘Prime Global Cities Index Q2 2021’ report, New Delhi moved down five spots in the latest index. The capital city is now at the 37th rank in the second quarter of 2021. It saw a marginal decline of 0.2% year-on-year (YoY) in prime residential prices, leading to the drop in global position from 32nd rank in Q1 2021. The premium micro-markets of the city remained unchanged on a QoQ basis in Q2 2021 to record an average price of Rs. 33,572 per sq. ft. Mumbai and Bengaluru also moved down to 40th and 43rd rank in Q2 2021 compared to 36th and 40th rank in Q1 2021, respectively. Bengaluru in the global index saw a decline of 2.7% in terms of annual capital value change in the prime resident market to an average price of Rs. 19,200 per sq.ft. Mumbai’s prime residential market on the other hand registered a marginal decline of 1.1% with an average price of Rs. 63,697 per sq.ft. Shishir Baijal, Chairman and Managing Director at Knight Frank India said, “Despite the on-going COVID-19 pandemic situation, the residential segments globally have outperformed when compared to the corresponding period of Q2 2020. This can be attributed to a strong buyer appetite for residential due to extended time spent indoors, appreciation for larger homes and low-interest rates regime followed by central banks globally.” He explained that easing of travel rules in some markets, a surge in safe-haven purchases by domestic buyers, stamp duty holidays, and an overall reassessment of lifestyles has helped the prime segment recover quickly from the pandemic impact and record strong growth. “Prime property prices in India are yet to catch-up with this global trend,” he added. Breaking it down Prime residential property is defined as the most desirable and most expensive property in a given location, generally defined as the top 5% of each market by value. The Prime Global Cities Index is a valuation-based index tracking the movement in prime residential prices in local currency across 45+ cities worldwide. According to Knight Frank’s research analysis, 35 cities witnessed a rise in prime residential prices in Q2 2021 (YoY). Around 13 cities registered double-digit priced growth up from just one a year ago. Prime prices across 46 cities increased at an average rate of 8.2% in the year to June 2021, up from 4.6% in March. The average annual increase in prime prices was 16% across the six North American cities tracked by the index. According to the report, 22% of the global cities registered flat or decline in price growth; while Toronto recorded the strongest performing world region in the year to Q2 2021 with 27%, Bangkok was the weakest performing market with -6.4%. Some of the world’s top Asian cities, Shanghai (21%), Guangzhou (20%) and Seoul (20%). Key highlights New Delhi ranked 37th with a -0.2% annual price change for Q2 2020 – Q2 2021. The city saw a flat 0.00% price change in Q2 2021 compared to the previous quarter. Mumbai ranked 40th with a -1.1% annual price change for the period Q2 2020 – Q2 2021. The city registered a marginal decline of 0.1% price change in Q2 2021 compared to the previous quarter.  Bengaluru ranked 43rd with a -2.7% annual change for the period Q2 2020 – Q2 2021. The city saw a flat 0.0% price change in Q2 2021 compared to the previous quarter.  The Global Index’s annual increase in the year to June 2021 (8.2%), highest rate of growth since 2008.  13 cities registered double-digit annual price growth in Q2 2021.  Toronto tops with 27% highest rate of annual prime price growth in the year to June 2021.  The average annual increase in prime prices was 16% across the six North American cities tracked by the index. Future outlook The report states that housing bubbles are grabbing headlines worldwide but the prospect of rising interest rates, government intervention and the withdrawal of stimulus measures to rein in the market’s exuberance in the second half of 2021 is expected. More cooling measures as policymakers grapple with the affordability conundrum are anticipated. ‘The Chinese mainland’s longdebated national property tax now looks more likely. We expect to see London, New York, Paris and Dubai move up the rankings in Q3 as travel restrictions ease and international buyers start to recognise the relative value in these cities’, it states.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/the-global-city-index/article36026557.ece
21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Constructing on inherited property||We are six brothers and our mother is no more. We have a property in her name and the patta has been transferred to us. We plan to construct six flats. Kindly advise if a partition deed is necessary. If not, is a Memorandum Of Understanding (MoU) sufficient? Among us six siblings, two want to transfer their share to their children, take a loan and join the construction process with the remaining four brothers. Sundar Raj KK Nagar, Chennai On the demise of your mother and in the absence of any Will, the six sons would have inherited the property in equal shares (one-sixth undivided share each). If the flats proposed to be constructed are going to be of equal size, no partition or any other document would be necessary. Two of the owners can execute deeds of settlement in favour of any of their children. Separate construction agreements for each flat have to be entered into with the builder and the same have to be duly registered. In this document, the undivided share of land, particulars of the flat (size, location, etc) and details of amenities (such as car parking slots) have to be mentioned. I reside in an apartment complex at Kochi, Kerala, that comprises 60 units. Less than 15 owners stay in the building and the rest are NRIs who have rented out their apartments. Recently, the committee decided to seek approval from the owners who attend meetings for an additional car parking space in our premises. Decisions are usually taken on the basis of majority. My queries are: - Can an owner’s association get such projects approved where common funds are utilised? - Are their powers restricted to maintenance of existing facilities? - For such investments, shouldn’t the approval of all owners be mandatory? - If 15 people attend a meeting, they get approvals from 8 to 9 people and the rest need to contribute funds as well. Sudeep John Kochi If your association is duly registered and bye-laws are in place, the members can take decisions in the general body within the framework of the bye-laws. The provisions in the bye-laws relating to quorum, ordinary vis-à-vis special resolution, mode of approvals for capital expenses etc., have to be looked into for ascertaining whether the association is correct or not in dealing with such matters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/constructing-on-inherited-property/article36026559.ece
21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Playing with typography||From laptops and signages to books and shop fronts, we are surrounded by several typography styles. Put simply, typography is the art of arranging letters and text in ‘a way that makes the copy legible, clear, and visually appealing’. It involves the style of the font, appearance, and structure, and aims to convey specific messaging and create a certain impact. If you are a typophile — a lover of the alphabet — and your p’s and q’s matter as much as the other things you are passionate about, then may we suggest typography-inspired décor in your home? Here are eight ways you can get graphic and play with typography in your home: On the wall Hang calligraphic words that echo a sentiment close to your heart such as ‘believe’, ‘hero’, ‘family’, etc. Or you could go bold and use a single huge letter that has significance in your life. Another great idea is to put typography on wallpaper and have two design statements in one! Alphabetical accessories Bookends, paperweights, time zone clocks, candle holders, ampersand décor pieces — there are endless options when introducing typography through accessories. Apart from being able to buy many things online and offline, it’s also possible to DIY many of these. In the kitchen Take your love for the letter to the kitchen and use the refrigerator as a canvas. Adhesive or magnetic letters come in all shapes, colours and sizes (and we are not talking of kids’ alphabets!). To avoid them looking like a child’s board, you could make full words like ‘bakery’, ‘eat well’ or ‘bon appétit’. Fun with furniture Look for a statement piece such as chairs shaped as letters or a sofa with textual-printed upholstery. Coffee tables with laminated surfaces full of quotes or lyrics will be a bookworm’s delight. You could also print some, line the table and top it with a sheet of glass — this works well for people who like shifting their décor as they can keep changing as they like it. Stack it up For a subtle introduction, how about stacking coffee table books so that their spines create an interesting typographic effect? The effect will look better with a plain background so make sure the wall behind isn’t very loud or busy. Top with a candle and a vase of flowers. The best part about a coffee table display is that it can keep changing — you can rotate your books along with the seasons, perhaps? Put it outside A great way to let everyone know your love for the typed letter is to put typography outside the home. It could be your address and even a sign like ‘hello’ or ‘welcome’. You could get custom wooden or metal letters made or simply paint the letters on the wall. A ‘hola’ or ‘howdy’ hand-painted on the door can add colour and a touch of quirkiness. Text to reflect We love the idea of having an entire poem written on a mirror. You could get the text etched on the mirror or stick a translucent sticker with the poem on it. Every time you look at yourself in the mirror, the lyrics will sing out to you. And what could be better than that? On linen and fabrics These days, there’s a wide variety of linen that helps you make a statement. Cushions, runners, tablecloths, and more — just keep scouring till you find a fabric that’s more your style and bring it home. Words and sentences that mean much to you can become a part of your daily life if you make them a part of your décor. Seeing them around you is a sure-shot way to start the day on a good note.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/playing-with-typography/article36026564.ece

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||An act of love,||Is Sona Mohapatra and Deepti Gupta’s documentary Shut Up Sona the kind of story you only get to tell once? “Let me tell you, there’s a ‘Please Sing Sona’ sequel that’s happening,” Mohapatra says of the film based on her ‘unrelenting fight for an equal space in modern day India’. Irony and wit are among the narrative devices of Shut Up Sona , which is currently getting its Australia premiere at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne this month. Originally slated to take place in theatres, a worrying wave of COVID-19 cases in the city caused organisers to launch it virtually. For Mohapatra — who had her own billboard at Times Square, New York, in July as part of the Spotify ‘Equal’ global campaign — and filmmaker-cinematographer Gupta, this was an addition to the tumultuous four-year journey of making, editing and showcasing the documentary. Slated to release on an OTT platform later this year in India, it shines the spotlight not just on the musician and the pushback she receives for being an outspoken, sometimes mercurial woman in India, but also the state of cultural discourse.  At the festival circuit   Gupta says it originally started with just the two friends taking on the project, being joined by Mohapatra’s partner, composer Ram Sampath, and editor Arjun Gourisaria. “We were both learning everything for the first time. All the well-wishers came up saying, ‘Oh, you did an India premiere, now (so) none of the big international festivals are going to take up your film’. That was heartbreaking, because we didn’t know any better,” says Mohapatra of the film (produced by her) that had its premiere at the Mumbai Academy of Moving Image (MAMI) Film Festival in Mumbai in 2019. Nevertheless, the team persevered to take it to the International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2020 and several other countries.  Battling the system   Counting the film as a “symbolic catharsis” for both of them, Gupta was driven by not just Mohapatra’s music but also her continual battle against systemic, patriarchal issues. “There are many notes that the film is hitting, like how when we protest as an artist for equality, what is the price to pay for it professionally,” says Gupta, referring to the times Mohapatra has taken the music industry to task. The singer recounts, “I was being accosted and literally ambushed in my house by a reporter from a news channel.” Gupta was coincidentally at Mohapatra’s house, after they had wrapped up shooting a music video, gathered around for tea time on a Sunday evening. Mohapatra recounts, “Deepti thought this was an opportunity for the documentary. But that camera person who had come with the reporter started telling Deepti which is a better place for her to shoot me from, and started directing her. She captured that.”  This, along with the sequence of Mohapatra watching a male-dominated mixed doubles match featuring Roger Federer, are left in Shut Up Sona to “leave an unconscious impression on the viewer”, according to Gupta. Mohapatra feels documentaries are not that well understood in India among the masses, but the popularity of OTT platforms is changing that and Shut Up Sona fits right in. “It’s not one of those artsy, niche documentaries. It’s a fully masaledaar , musical, gaali-galoch film… everything else that you would not expect,” concludes Mohapatra.

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Summer in Berlin||And so, my peregrinations bring me to Berlin, for the first time in summer. I’d only been here for the justly celebrated Berlin Film Festival, which is held during the winter and the act of rushing from screening to screening keeps you warm at what is truly a miserable time, weather-wise, in this great metropolis. Summer in Berlin, on the other hand, is a glorious time. The sun is shining, Covid is at bay, and vaccinated people are back at cinemas, museums, galleries and restaurants. Pausing only to meet a few filmmaker friends who are based in Berlin, I launched into my musings about films set in this magnificent city without much delay. Leni Riefenstahl’s Olympia (1938) in two parts — Festival of Nations and Festival of Beauty — her document of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, is correctly derided as Nazi propaganda, and she was subsequently disgraced. However, there is no denying her immense cinematic talent and the films are beautiful to look at, though the politics and underlying social history cannot and should not be denied. There is of course Sebastian Schipper’s pounding Victoria (2015), where a young Spanish woman in Berlin is caught up in events beyond her control. Set across one night in the city, Victoria is one of those one-shot films featuring non-stop exhilarating action with nary a pause for breath. A dazzling technical achievement which was duly recognised at the Berlin festival. A key sequence in Victoria takes place at Checkpoint Charlie, that hallowed gateway between the erstwhile East and West Berlin which has been referenced in countless novels and movies. I duly visited the place which now also has a harrowing exhibit detailing the history of Berlin from 1933-45. Martin Ritt’s The Spy Who Came in From the Cold (1965) opens at Checkpoint Charlie, James Bond crosses over in Octopussy (1983) and the locale and indeed the Berlin Wall has been featured time and again in many films dealing with the Cold War including recently, Steven Spielberg’s Bridge of Spies (2015). This can in no way be a comprehensive look at films set in Berlin, so after a quick hat tip to Wim Wenders’ Wings of Desire (1987), I’ll confine myself now to the various iterations of Berlin Alexanderplatz , named after the vast square in the heart of the city. In 1929, Alfred Döblin wrote Berlin Alexanderplatz , about a small-time criminal who has just been released from prison after being involved in a murder and finds himself in the big, bad city, and inevitably is drawn to those of his own ilk. The book was adapted as a film as early as 1931. The most comprehensive adaptation of the book is Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s sprawling 14-part 1980 television series. In preparation for this trip, I pulled out my hitherto unwatched blu-ray of Burhan Qurbani’s 2020 adaptation, which changed the lead character to an illegal immigrant from Bissau, West Africa, lending layers of complexity to an already dense tale. The film is three hours short and is another breathtaking ode to the city that has and will continue to give to cinema.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/summer-in-berlin/article36027128.ece
21 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Afghans reach out to Embassies, ask for refuge in other countries||A number of Afghan refugees have been standing at the roundabout outside Ashoka Hotel on the road leading to Shanti Path. They have been knocking on the doors of Embassies that dot the stretch, seeking a “road to peace”. The hope for documents to seek refuge in Australia, Canada and some European countries has kept the Afghan nationals on the street, which is a stone’s throw away from the Prime Minister’s residence, for three days now. Meanwhile, the Australian Government has said there are no plans to evacuate Afghan nationals from India. “Every human being in this world has hope. We will never lose our hope that we can go back to our country and rebuild it one day. Afghanistan has a glorious past but it has been torn apart by other nations as well as the Taliban. They say that a friend in need is a friend indeed and right now we are asking for friends to help us survive,” says Mahadia Ahmedi, who came to Delhi to study engineering and now is completing his MBA from a private university in Greater Noida. Mr. Ahmedi adds, “We are all human. We are depending not upon nations but fellow humans to think about our situation and provide us with a future so that we can go back to our country one day. It is better to die with pride than in the hands of the Taliban.” Mr. Ahmedi came as a student and is now unsure of his future. Like him, many others have been in the country as refugees for over five years but have not found employment yet. ‘Unemployment in India’ “We do not want anything for free. We are willing to work hard and make a life for ourselves. Our country has been torn apart but we are proud to be from Afghanistan. We hope that the countries, which promised us peace and the future, will take responsibility for allowing the Taliban to take over. They should shelter us,” says Ahmed Walim, a refugee. Mr. Walim says that he “understands the unemployment problems in India”. He hopes that some other country will let him enter for work. “This problem is not just for the people of Afghanistan. India, Pakistan and the entire region will face it too. This is the end of the United States of America as a world power as they have failed to provide peace in Afghanistan. Our future is hanging in the balance,” says another refugee. Other students who came to the country to study said they had hopes that they would be able to study in India and return to Afghanistan and start a business but their hopes have been dashed. “We need to know what the world is planning for us. India needs to protect us. If they can’t do that, they should let whoever can. We are embarrassed that the Taliban’s flag is flying in our country, but we are helpless,” says a student. The Australian government, in a statement, said “Afghan nationals who are based in India and who have protection concerns should register with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) if they have not already done so.”  This problem is not just for the people of Afghanistan. India, Pakistan and the entire region will face it too.

21 August 2021||CHANDIGARH,||2 protesting farmers charged with sedition in Haryana||Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij on Friday informed the State Assembly that during the ongoing agitation against agriculture laws in Haryana, two farmers have been booked for sedition, while 136 other protesters have been booked under different sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC). This information was given by Mr. Vij in a written reply during the first day of monsoon session of the State Assembly. According to the Minister, two FIRs were registered under Section 124-A (sedition). One case was registered on July 11, 2021 in Sirsa, and according to the complaint recorded by the duty magistrate, the agitating farmers attacked the convoy of Deputy Speaker of Haryana Vidhan Sabha. The second case, registered on January 15, 2021 in Bahadurgarh of Jhajjar, was based on a video uploaded on social media by the accused who is seen saying that if the government did not pay heed to the protesting farmers, he would attack the government with a cannon. Earlier Congress MLAs marched to the Assembly, led by former Chief Minister and Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on the issues of paper leak scam, atrocities on farmers, rising unemployment, inflation and rising crime graph in the State. The party MLAs raised slogans against the BJP-JJP government and displayed placards. Mr. Hooda said the present government is trying to suppress all the scams including liquor, registry, mining, electricity meters and paddy purchase. “The government also wants to cover up the recruitment paper leak scam, but the Congress demands that there should be a CBI inquiry into the matter under the supervision of the sitting judge of the High Court,” he said. ‘Bid to stop Cong. MLAs’ “Ii is the responsibility of the Opposition to raise the voice of the public from the street to the House on issues of public interest. The government does not want the Opposition to raise public issues in the House and hence today an attempt was made to stop the Congress MLAs by putting up barricades far away from the Assembly,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/2-protesting-farmers-charged-with-sedition-in-haryana/article36026913.ece
21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Art lists and the questions that arise||The third edition of the Hurun India Art List was released last week. Technically, the artist who topped it this year as well, Anish Kapoor, with sales worth Rs. 20.64 crore at public auctions last year, doesn’t even live in India. The London-based sculptor’s conceptual work has made it to the Venice Biennale and the Royal Academy of Arts (the first living artist to be given a solo there). He has won renown with landmarks such as the Cloud Gate in Chicago and Britain’s ArcelorMittal Orbit. Interestingly, there’s no mention of Hurun on his social media. One wonders if it matters to him or if he is even aware of it. Many artists are not. When I reached out to Vasundhara Tewari-Broota, whose husband Rameshwar Broota is number three on the list, she was surprised. “He is not someone who looks at these lists,” she tells me. How about the news that she has clocked in at number eight on Hurun’s Women Artists’ list? “It is a pleasant surprise,” smiles the artist, whose figurative paintings explore the psycho-political existence of the female body. But she quickly adds that “it brings me back to the old argument: the artist never gets a share in these astronomical sales [that puts them on these lists in the first place]. They have usually sold the artwork long ago for a sum that looks meagre when placed next to the current auctioned price, which is usually in crores of rupees.” This is just one of the uncomfortable questions that lists such as Hurun’s (which draws its data from online resource artprice.com) bring up. Do rankings affect how galleries showcase artists or how collectors invest in artwork? Does knowing where the artists are from — West Bengal contributed the most number in the list (10 entrants), followed by Kerala and Maharashtra — help, beyond making good headlines? Most often, it’s a no. “Anish Kapoor is represented in our international Post War and Contemporary auctions across the globe,” says Deepanjana Klein, International Head, Department for Contemporary Indian & Southeast Asian Art at Christie’s Auction House. “His price points are very different and do not reflect the Indian art market or have an impact on it, as the majority of his works are bought mainly by international collectors.”  Let’s talk money  But before we get to the questions, do these lists matter? Many come out each year, from Forbes to Time to Business Standard . Internationally, Shanghai-based Hurun Report, the wealth research firm, puts out several — from rich lists and top philanthropists to global art top 50s. But do artists and collectors care about them? “I don’t know who actually looks at them,” says Ashvin E Rajagopalan, co-founder of Chennai-based Ashvita gallery, stating that Hurun India’s numbers are off. “I don’t know what their source of data is. If it is public auctions, then Krishen Khanna sold more than Rs. 6.87 crores last year!” Meanwhile, Sharan Apparao, of Apparao Galleries, says, “Seasoned collectors don’t refer to lists when buying high-end art, and it’s not important to artists either because their prices aren’t controlled by these.” One of the few she looks at is ArtReview ’s Power 100 in the Art World (and that too, occasionally). What such lists can do, however, is be conversation starters. For example, about the need for royalties in the art world. “Artists don’t really benefit from auction sales, not directly at least,” says Anjolie Ela Menon over the phone from her studio in Nizamuddin. Incidentally, the 81-year-old contemporary artist, whose solo show, By The River , is on at the AICON Gallery in New York, is number eight on the Hurun list. “Just before the pandemic, we were proposing the formation of a board that would oversee issues of 7% royalties to the artist of every auction sale, authentication and other such matters. But because everything shut down, it got halted and I doubt it will be formed any time soon.” Menon points out that an artist like Tyeb Mehta never made any direct earnings from the auction sales, though it has raked in crores (in 2018, his painting, Kali , was purchased anonymously for over Rs. 26 crore) and put him on innumerable records. “ A percentage should come to the artist every time their work is sold,” she says, along the lines of what Artist Resale Rights has achieved in Europe, the UK and California. “But, currently, there’s a sense of helplessness; we must form at least an artists’ union.” Anas Rahman Junaid, who heads Hurun India, the organisation that brings out the annual list, says he’s been closely observing the transitioning of India’s entrepreneurial landscape from being largely run by family businesses, to the era of new-age entrepreneurs and their revolutionary business ideas. “Rapid advancements in technology have enabled the ‘millennial entrepreneur’ to show great enthusiasm towards this new economic culture,” he says, adding that auction prices follow the ‘trickle down theory’ and affect gallery prices as it indicates global acclaim of the artworks. “I believe that the next decade presents a great opportunity for India to reposition herself. My continuing mission for the Hurun report is to find these synergies and contribute value to the entrepreneurial landscape.”  The NFT debate  Technology is one of the ways open to artists to keep track of their work and get just rewards. Mumbai-based artist Santanu Hazarika believes blockchain will dismantle the culture of gatekeeping in a bid to empower artists. If the authentication of artworks can be digitised — with blockchain keeping track of sales automatically — it would be easier to ensure a percentage goes to the artist as royalty. At present, several international NFT platforms, such as SuperRare, offer this. Artists get 5%-15% royalty every time their artwork is resold. However, he says, it’s still early days in India. “We will have to wait and watch, as it is a growing market that needs many kinks to be ironed out. For instance, the difficulties around obtaining authentication certificates when the artist is no more. Or tracing the provenance of artworks that have been resold more than once.” Auction houses, however, are more cautious. “It is true that an NFT is inscribed on a blockchain and so the provenance history is forever publicly accessible. But to date auction houses cannot offer NFTs all around the world, as there are no general guidelines in place, which would include the question of copyright,” says Klein. Christie’s pioneered NFTs in the global auction market and is leading this category with $93.2 million in sales this year. Meanwhile, the lists will continue. And whether we take them as definitive voices celebrating wealth creation or not, as Junaid points out, “Most newcomers to the art world almost always refer to a power-list.” It’s up to us how best we utilise them and what conversations we push forward.  “My father Krishen Khanna [number 3 on the list] was happy to hear he was featured. His words were: ‘Technically I am number one because Anish Kapoor is not living in India!’ I would say that such lists help us get an aggregate notion of the art market. Auction prices do filter down to affect gallery prices” — Karan Khanna , the artist’s son||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/art-lists-and-the-questions-that-arise/article36027228.ece
21 August 2021||New Delhi,||HC rejects bail plea of woman for threatening man with rape charges||The Delhi High Court has declined the anticipatory bail plea of a woman who has been accused of threatening a man with rape charges if her demand of Rs. 2 lakh, a mobile phone, and a TV were not met. Justice Subramonium Prasad noted that the investigation was at a nascent stage and it was yet to be ascertained if the woman was involved in any other cases. “The petitioner’s [woman] voice sample has to be taken and the investigation has also to be conducted as to whether there are any other cases in which the petitioner is involved...,” the court said. The court also highlighted that the woman is accused of an offence under Section 328 IPC, which is a serious offence. “This court feels that this is not a fit case where the petitioner should be granted bail in the event of arrest. Accordingly, the petition is dismissed,” the court said. Section 328 IPC provides for punishment of upto 10 years for administration of intoxicating drug with intent to cause hurt or commit or to facilitate the commission of an offence. The FIR, in the present case, stated that the complainant had gone to the house of a man known to him, who introduced the accused woman to the complainant as his girlfriend. It is claimed that after consuming a soft drink, the complainant started feeling dizzy and became unconscious. After regaining consciousness, the complainant said he was shocked to see the woman with him in an objectionable position. The complainant then narrated the incident to his friend. However, his friend and the woman started demanding a mobile phone, a TV and Rs. 2 lakh in cash from him. The complainant said he was threatened that if the demands were not met the woman would file a case of rape against him. Later, the woman filed a case of rape against him. “A reading of the FIR shows that this is a case of honey trap. The allegation against the petitioner is that she has threatened the complainant and has demanded money,” the High Court said. “Material on record shows that only when the complainant filed the instant FIR, the petitioner filed her complaint under Section 376 [rape] of the IPC against the complainant herein,” the court added. It noted that there was “some justification” in the contention of the public prosecutor that the conduct of the woman “does show that there is a likelihood of her fleeing from justice and that she would not cooperate with the investigation”. The probability of the woman and her boyfriend threatening the complainant also could not be ruled out at this stage, the court said while rejecting the anticipatory bail plea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-rejects-bail-plea-of-woman-for-threatening-man-with-rape-charges/article36026917.ece
21 August 2021||LUCKNOW,||COVID-19 patient missing from hospital since 3 months||The Allahabad High Court has raised concern over the “apathetic condition” of a hospital in Prayagraj and the “gross negligence” of its doctors and staff in the disappearance of an elderly COVID-19 patient whose whereabouts are unknown ever since he was admitted there more than three months ago. The court directed the Uttar Pradesh government to ensure that the patient was traced before the next date of hearing, August 27, and submit a report. The family of Ram Lal Yadav, formerly a junior engineer in the Electricity Department in New Delhi, had filed a habeas corpus petition seeking his release from the custody of the T.B Sapru Hospital in Prayagraj, where he was admitted after testing positive for COVID-19. He went missing from his bed since the morning of May 8, as per a report of the hospital’s Chief Medical Superintendent. The court said neither the Prayagraj district administration nor the police or the hospital appeared “to be serious about the missing of the person although more than three months have passed” since the missing report was registered. A division Bench of Justices Surya Prakash Kesarwani and Piyush Agrawal said it was as “a matter of serious concern that gross negligence” was prima facie shown by the officers, doctors and staff of the hospital .  “The facts stated by the Senior Superintendent of Police, Prayagraj, in his personal affidavit also indicated the apathetic condition of the T.B. Sapru Hospital...where even CCTV cameras are non functional,” the court said in an order dated August 19. ‘Dereliction of duty’ Not only it was a case of dereliction of duty and gross negligence but also “indicates total carelessness in treatment, look-after and safety of COVID patients” at the hospital, the Bench noted. The DM Prayagraj, in a personal affidavit, informed the court that a fact-finding inquiry had been set up on August 18 under the City Magistrate Prayagraj to enquire into the matter and submit a report within a week. The court also directed the government to immediately ensure that all infrastructure facilities and security equipment, safety and security measures of high standards be installed with inbuilt provisions of its regular maintenance and periodical audit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/covid-19-patient-missing-from-hospital-for-3-months/article36026911.ece
21 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Online petition seeking asylum for Afghan women gets 3L signatures||Adeeba Qayoumi, a 21-year-old woman who fled to India from Herat, Afghanistan, in 2019, has started an online petition in memory of her 29-year-old cousin Farishta — a civil rights activist killed by the Taliban last year. As of Friday evening, the online petition, which urges the Central government to grant asylum to women and children who are fleeing Afghanistan, had received over three lakh signatures. Speaking to The Hindu about her cousin, who she lost to the Taliban, Ms. Qayoumi said: “She [Farishta] was a civil rights activist and always raised her voice for the rights of women and children. Even while many of us left, she continued to stay in Afghanistan and kept raising her voice. That is why the Taliban shot her. Even her brother got shot while he was trying to save her.” With Kabul falling to the Taliban, people are now reminded of events that took place two decades back when the country was under the strict Taliban regime, she said. ‘People staying indoors’ “People are so afraid that they are almost behaving as if a lockdown has been imposed. This is happening because people know how the Taliban can behave and to what extent they can go. People are afraid that the same things will be repeated and hence, they are choosing to remain indoors. It is becoming worse by the day. All my relatives and friends are also trying to desperately leave Afghanistan,” said Ms. Qayoumi, who now works as a translator in Delhi. “I appeal to all governments to give these people asylum if possible, especially to the women and children who are not safe in Afghanistan. In India we are safe even though a lack of identity sometimes becomes a barrier in getting employment,” she said. Once an MBBS student at Herat University, Ms. Qayoumi said: “I had to leave Afghanistan because my mother, who is also a civil rights activist was receiving death threats from the Taliban. I had to leave my childhood and my entire life there and come to India. When I see doctors these days, I often ask myself why did this have to happen to me? Even you could have become a doctor Adeeba if things were different. I tell myself.”  My cousin [Farishta] was a civil rights activist... Even when many of us left [in 2019] , she stayed in Afghanistan and kept raising her voice.

21 August 2021||JAIPUR,||BJP unable to tolerate criticism, says Gehlot||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was unable to tolerate criticism because of its “inherent anti-democratic character”, which had led it to believe that any disagreement with its ideology amounted to sedition. Such an approach would only weaken the country’s democratic traditions, he said. Addressing a virtual event marking the 77th birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Mr. Gehlot said the BJP government at the Centre was destroying democratic institutions and targeting the Opposition parties. “Ironically, the BJP came to power through democracy [which was] kept intact by Congress.” Mr. Gehlot said. “It is very easy to ask what the Congress did during its 70 years in power. My reply is that the Congress kept the country united and strengthened the roots of democracy... Unlike Pakistan, India did not fall under military rule,” Mr. Gehlot said. The Chief Minister said India had got independence as a result of sacrifices made by the Congress leaders. “The governments in the country keep coming and going. But the present government [at the Centre] is playing the game of toppling the governments in the States by unfair means,” he said. Rajiv Gandhi praised Addressing the event, titled “Rajasthan innovation vision: IT for good governance”, Sam Pitroda, who served as advisor to Rajiv Gandhi, said India had made progress in telecommunication, literacy, immunisation and education and marched ahead through e-governance as a result of Rajiv Gandhi's vision. He said the BJP government was discouraging scientific temperament and suppressing the civil society groups. Mr. Gehlot launched a Kisan Sathi portal for the convenience of farmers and released an e-book prepared by the Agriculture Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bjp-unable-to-tolerate-criticism-says-gehlot/article36026910.ece
21 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Man held for conspiring to harm DS of Tihar jail||A conspiracy to harm a Deputy Superintendent of Tihar jail has been unearthed with the arrest of a 28-year-old criminal after his audio clip on planning to procure an AK-47 rifle went viral, the police said on Friday. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) P.S. Kushwah said the accused has been identified as Satender alias Satte — sharpshooter of Rohit Chaudhary gang. The police said that in the audio, the caller on one side can be heard asking his accomplice to arrange for an AK-47 to execute the killing of a person to settle a personal score. “Satender is also talking of causing harm to a Deputy Superintendent of Central Jail at Tihar, Delhi, to avenge the death of their accomplice — namely Ankit Gujjar in jail,” Mr. Kushwah said. ‘DS sought Rs. 1 lakh’ Ankit was found dead inside the jail on August 4. His family alleged that he was beaten to death because the DS had asked for Rs. 1 lakh as “protection money” and they had only paid Rs. 50,000. Subsequently, after the post-mortem report, a case on charges of murder was registered against the DS and three staffers and all of them were suspended. While working to identify the two callers, Special Cell found that the two were Satte and one Ajay Gujjar after which surveillance was mounted on their movement. On August 17, he was arrested near Chirag Delhi. The police said he disclosed his plan to harm the DS to avenge the death of Gujjar. He also asked Ajay to arrange for the rifle to show their power and establish supremacy in south Delhi. Over 20 criminal cases Satender has over 20 criminal cases registered against him, an officer said. Along with accomplices, he used to collect money from property dealers, satta operators and bookies, builders in south Delhi by threatening them. He was released on bail in July, the police added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/man-held-for-conspiring-to-harm-tihar-jail-official/article36026920.ece

21 August 2021||August 21 2021 00:00 IST,||Meet Dr Kirby||Whether as the young Franciscan novice Adso, playing Watson to Sean Connery’s Baskerville in The Name of the Rose (1986) or as strait-laced Riley to wildly grandstanding John Travolta in John Woo’s Broken Arrow 10 years later, Christian Slater always radiates positive energy in his roles. That energy is evident as the 51-year-old actor talks about his latest role in Dr Death over a video call. The mini-series — based on a podcast that focusses on medical malpractice — was released globally last month and had its India premiere this week. It tells the harrowing true story of a neurosurgeon, Christopher Duntsch (Joshua Jackson), who maimed and killed his patients. Slater plays Dr Kirby who, alongside Dr Henderson (Alec Baldwin), brings down Duntsch. Slater recalls a scene with Jackson when they were in the operating theatre. “When you are shooting these types of uncomfortable scenes, you tend to find humour. Both Josh and I are so inept as surgeons that I found those moments to be quite humorous,” he says. Though Slater had plans to meet Kirby, COVID-19 made it impossible. For the surgical aspects, he says he spent time with his brother-in-law who is also a vascular surgeon like Kirby. Admitting to playing characters that possess energy and charisma, Slater says he and Kirby are similar in a few ways. “I enjoy life; I have a good time. I do have an energy that I think I need to taper a little bit. In order to play this character, I needed a certain amount of freedom, and I am grateful to Patrick [Macmanus, creator] for allowing me to be creative in the moment. That lent to the type of energy that came across.” Jackson, 43, had to go into some dark spaces as Duntsch. “For a large part of the show he does not know that he is the bad guy. He did not have the ability to see the effect of his actions,” says the actor. The show, with criss-crossing timelines and disturbing content, is a gripping one and credit for that goes to Macmanus, he says. “Patrick had the entire show, every image of it catalogued in his mind. He was an unbelievable resource.” Dr Death is streaming on   Lionsgate Play||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/meet-dr-kirby/article36027223.ece
