25 August 2021||MUMBAI/ PUNE,||Union Minister arrested in Maharashtra for remark on CM||Union Minister Narayan Rane was on Tuesday arrested and taken into custody by the police at Sangameshwar in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra for his statement on Monday that he would have slapped State Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray for forgetting the year India got freedom during his Independence Day speech. Late in the evening, a court in Mahad granted him bail. Mr. Rane was produced in the court by the police a little after 9 p.m. Reports say the court considered his health condition and age. BJP leader Pravin Darekar and Prasad Lad, MLC, told a news agency that he had left for Mumbai. Earlier, the Bombay High Court denied him relief. A Ratnagiri court too rejected his petition for anticipatory bail. His lawyer, Aniket Nikam, will approach the court on Wednesday, seeking to quash the first information reports against the former Chief Minister. Soon after Mr. Rane spoke at the “Jan Ashirvad Yatra” of the BJP in Raigad district, clashes broke out in the State. He is charged with Section 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot, if rioting be committed, if not committed) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the IPC. Shiv Sena supporters protested in various places.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/union-minister-arrested-in-maharashtra-for-remark-on-cm/article36091068.ece
25 August 2021||Chandigarh,||Amarinder Ministry reels under Congress feud again||The Congress high command’s efforts to resolve issues in the party’s Punjab unit have failed to yield the desired results as the crisis deepened on Tuesday, after factions supporting Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh (retd) and Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee chief Navjot Singh Sidhu spoke out against each other. Four Ministers and over 20 MLAs openly came out against Capt. Amarinder’s leadership. And, taking exception to the “anti-national” and “pro-Pakistan” comments of two of Mr. Sidhu’s aides — Malwinder Mali and Pyare Lal Garg — a group of Congress Ministers and MLAs called for strong legal action against them. Raising the pitch against Capt. Amarinder at a meeting held here, four Ministers, including Sukhjinder Randhawa, Tript Rajinder Bajwa, Sukhbinder Sarkaria and Charanjit Channi, apart from close to two dozen MLAs, expressed lack of faith in the leadership of the Chief Minister in fulfilling the party’s 2017 Assembly election promises. “We have lost faith in his [the CM’s] leadership. There are certain issues for which we have been fighting for a while now. It’s all about those issues, which are not settled, be it the Bargari sacrilege, curbing the drugs and transport mafias, etc. All these issues relate to the previous Akali Dal government, which have not yet been addressed. We earlier apprised the Central leadership of these issues, after which an 18-point programme was released to resolve them. But the Chief Minister is only attempting to kill time and doing nothing on the ground. Each passing day is critical as we are inching towards the Assembly election,” Mr. Channi told The Hindu . Within hours, however, seven of the 20-odd Punjab Congress MLAs and ex-MLAs purported to have been party to the demand for the removal of Capt. Amarinder, categorically disassociated themselves from any such move. Denying having been a part of what they termed “a conspiracy hatched by a section engaged in trying to drive a wedge within the party”, these seven leaders reposed their full faith in the CM’s leadership. The seven leaders are Kuldeep Vaid (MLA), Dalvir Singh Goldie (MLA), Santokh Singh Bhalaipur (MLA), Ajit Singh Mofar (ex-MLA), Angad Singh (MLA), Raja Warring (MLA) and Gurkirat Singh Kotli (MLA).

25 August 2021||Bengaluru,||Park only where there is a board that allows it: Police||Taking a serious note of wayward parking that poses hindrance to free flow of traffic, the police have said except roads with parking sign boards, all the other roads should be considered as no-parking zones. Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda said roads are meant for traffic movement and should not be used for parking. “If there is a provision for parking, we will put up parking signboards. Otherwise, it is deemed a no-parking zone,” he said. He reasoned that the city has around 14,000 km of roads and it is practically impossible to put up ‘no parking’ signs everywhere. In this scenario, in the absence of sign boards for parking, it will be deemed a no-parking zone and action will be taken against owners of such vehicles, he added. In the backdrop of increasing attacks on towing staff, Mr. Gowda said that there is a set of SOPs for the towing staff, which they have to follow. “If people have any problem with the towing staff, it should be brought to the notice of the traffic police. Assaulting the staff is illegal and would be dealt with seriously. Those who have already been arrested for assaulting the towing staff have been booked under serious charges and a rowdy-sheet opened against them,” he said. At a recent online grievance meet, many participants had complained about the alleged high handedness of the towing staff.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/park-only-where-there-is-a-board-that-allows-it-police/article36091100.ece
25 August 2021||KALABURAGI,||‘NEP will help new generation become more competent’||Briefing about the salient features of National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Minister of Higher Education, Information Technology and Bio-Technology C.N. Ashwath Narayan said that the policy is designed to make India’s young generation more competent and to prepare it to face global competition. Inaugurating a seminar on NEP at Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Auditorium on the Gulbarga University campus, the Minister said that the policy has been drafted after incorporating over three lakh suggestions that were collected over a period of five years. “Flexibility in learning and educational administration is one of the core ideas envisaged by NEP. It allows educational institutions to collaborate with other institutions in their neighbourhood to pool resources and expertise. It also allows learners to join academics at any point and leave at any time and the part that they learnt will be duly recognised to offer them a qualification. The other important aspect is the autonomy of educational institutions. It sees each college as an autonomous institution and wants it to develop as an independent university to offer its own degrees,” Mr. Narayan said. Stressing the importance of treating each child as a unique learner, the Minister said that the uniform teaching methodology to mould different talents into a single framework was unscientific. “Each child is unique and has different levels of cognition. Moulding all students in a single framework is unscientific. Learning should not be restricted or confined to classrooms but be extended to the real fields of life. Many scientific studies have shown that children have great learning capacities between the age of three and six. But, our children have hitherto missed the learning opportunities at this period as our formal schooling starts at the age of six. NEP has taken all these crucial issues into consideration and orients the stakeholders to corrective measures,” Mr. Narayan said. On State intervention in private educational institutions, Mr. Narayan said that the government will not be a hurdle in the ways of private institutions. “We [the government] will not be a hurdle to any educational institution. We won’t trouble them. We want to implement NEP and take it to the last learner through you only. We can effectively implement the policy only with your active support and cooperation. The gross enrolment ratio in higher education in the State has risen to 32% in 2019-2020 from 28.8% in the year before. We have set a target of taking it to 50% in the next 15 years,” Mr. Narayan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/nep-will-help-new-generation-become-more-competent/article36091355.ece
25 August 2021||Srinagar,||Graveyard silence in J&K is not normalcy: Gupkar alliance||The People’s Alliance for the Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) on Tuesday reiterated its demand for the restoration of the pre-August 5, 2019 special constitutional position of Jammu and Kashmir, and warned the Union government against mistaking “the current graveyard’s silence in J&K as normalcy”. It demanded an “end to humiliating people that, otherwise, has dangerous consequences”. ‘Life of dignity’ “To India’s civil society and political parties, we want to convey that we too want to live a life of dignity. However, the current government takes pride in inflicting humiliation on us. It’s unacceptable to the people of Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh,” Gupkar alliance spokesman M.Y. Tarigami said. He made these remarks after a meeting of the Gupkar alliance at the residence of National Conference president Farooq Abdullah. Former Chief Minister and Peoples Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti participated. The “unjustified and frequent” raids by agencies such as the National Investigation Agency and the Enforcement Directorate on the leaders seemed to be aimed at “projecting all the leaders as thieves and criminals in J&K”, Mr. Tarigami said. “We will rest our case before the people of India and the political parties. We appeal to all that the current trend of humiliating people should end. Besides, the voices are being muzzled. It has dangerous consequences for the entire nation.” The government got unnerved even by the press conferences of leaders, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/end-humiliation-says-gupkar-alliance/article36091064.ece
25 August 2021||Kolkata,||West Bengal rolls out largest cash transfer||West Bengal government has started the process of rolling out its largest cash transfer scheme, Lakshmi Bhandar, and hundreds of thousands of women across the rural and urban areas of the State are queuing up to enroll for the scheme. Lakshmi Bhandar entails a direct benefit transfer of Rs. 500 per month to women of the general category and Rs. 1,000 per month to women from reserved categories. The scheme was a poll promise of the Trinamool Congress and, riding high on such promises and other welfare schemes, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee came to power for the third consecutive time. Scenes of crowds gathering at the ‘Duare Sarkar’ camps, often leading to stampede-like situations, were reported from different parts of the State. There were reports of women being injured at Malda, Basirhat and Hooghly, among other places. At some places, police personnel had to resort to force to bring the situation under control. Ms. Banerjee urged people to not crowd at the camps, and suggested that, if required, the State government would extend the duration of these camps. The Duare Sarkar outreach camps started on August 16 and after almost a week, the number of people approaching the camps has touched 1 crore. The official website of the West Bengal government states that till August 23, the footfalls at the Duare Sarkar camps was 97.79 lakh, and on Wednesday (August 24) about 17.24 lakh people came to the camps. Most of the applications this year are for Lakshmi Bhandar scheme. “The turnout for Lakshmi Bhandhar this year is expected to be the main draw for this phase, compared to the ‘Swastha Sathi’ experience of the previous phase. More than 2 crore women are expected to turn up in the camps, especially to enroll themselves in Lakshmi Bhandar,” read the minutes of a meeting chaired by the State’s Chief Secretary on August 12. Preliminary estimates by the State government had suggested that Rs. 1,100 crore would be spent per month for the scheme, and the number of beneficiaries may end up at 1.6 crore. Only families that have a government job or pension cannot apply for the scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/west-bengal-rolls-out-largest-cash-transfer/article36091502.ece

Additional District Session Judge (First) Avinash Kumar at Jhanjharpur in Madhubani district of north Bihar granted bail to the accused, Nitish Kumar, who was arrested in November 2020 under the 2016 State prohibition law.  ‘Adhere to the law’ The court also asked the accused to adhere to the law in the future. The FIR against Kumar was lodged at the Madhepur police station by the village chowkidar (watchman), Jaldhari Paswan. The complainant said he had received information that some liquor smugglers had reached the vicinity of a temple in Pachahi village in an SUV and a motorbike. “When I reached there and tried to stop the smugglers, they fled the spot after firing in the air,” he said. Kumar, a resident of the Bhargama-Bheja village, was riding the motorcycle loaded with illicit liquor, Mr. Paswan said in the police complaint. Kumar was later arrested and sent to jail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/educate-5-children-for-3-months-bail-condition-for-liquor-smuggler/article36091233.ece
25 August 2021||PUNE,||‘Remark inappropriate, but will stand by Rane’||While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) feels Union Minister Narayan Rane’s remarks against Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was inappropriate, the party will firmly stand by him, former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said on Tuesday. Mr. Rane, he said, might have made the objectionable statement unintentionally. It was important to observe restraint while speaking about the Chief Minister and Mr. Rane’s ire at the CM ‘forgetting’ the 75th anniversary of Independence could have been expressed differently. Nevertheless, Mr. Fadnavis said, the manner in which the State government was proceeding against Mr. Rane was “highly objectionable” and could not be supported. Mr. Rane’s remarks triggered violent protests and demonstrations by Sena workers across Maharashtra as well as in Delhi, with stone-throwing incidents reported in several places, including Mumbai, Pune and Nashik. “Shiv Sena activists are indulging in wanton stone-throwing and, in interviews to television channels, claiming that Chief Minister has instructed them,” said the former Chief Minister. “Now, how is this offence going to be registered and what probe will be conducted into these misdemeanours?” Mr. Fadnavis said if the police began conducting investigations merely to please the government, then its prestige would be permanently sullied. “I would advise the police to work within the legal framework. Who does the Police Commissioner [who issued a warrant for Mr. Rane’s arrest] think he is?” he asked. Meanwhile, the Sena’s alliance partner, the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) came out strongly in its criticism of Mr. Rane. NCP leaders said an insult to Mr. Thackeray was akin to a ‘slap’ for all MLAs and the people of the State. Senior NCP leader and State Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil said that while the level of politics in Maharashtra may not be so bad, some people were certainly acting in an undignified manner.  While Mr. Pawar said he did not accord any importance to people like Mr. Rane who were deficient in proper behaviour and values, Minister Jitendra Awhad said the Konkan strongman’s comments were “cheap”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/remark-inappropriate-but-will-stand-by-rane/article36091653.ece
25 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Jagan releases Rs. 667 cr. as relief to AgriGold victims||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday credited nearly Rs. 667 crore into the bank accounts of over seven lakh persons towards compensation for the deposits (below Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 20,000) made by them in the AgriGold Group. A sum of Rs. 208 crore was remitted to 3.86 lakh persons who invested up to Rs. 10,000, and Rs. 459 crore to 3.14 lakh persons with investments ranging from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 20,000. With this, the total amount of compensation paid to 10.40 lakh victims of AgriGold scam so far reached approximately Rs. 906 crore. While releasing the funds, Mr. Jagan said the Telugu Desam Party had promised to do justice to the AgriGold depositors soon after forming the government, but that was confined to rhetoric whereas the YSR Congress Party kept its word to pay compensation to the lakhs of investors whose hard-earned money was gobbled up by the company. It was an unprecedented step as nowhere in the country had a government owned up responsibility to come to the rescue of victims of financial fraud committed by a private company. The Chief Minister alleged that the leaders who called the shots in the TDP government had tried to acquire the assets of AgriGold through dubious means by taking advantage of the situation. The TDP government had done little to recover the lost money, he stated. The government had identified the victims of the multi-State scam through the ward and village secretariats and was committed to compensating all those who were duped, he said. The government would ensure that the properties of AgriGold were monetised and the money recovered was given to the depositors to the extent of loss incurred by them, Mr. Jagan added. Deputy Chief Ministers Dharmana Krishnadas and P. Pushpa Sreevani and Ministers Mekathoti Sucharitha (Home), Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy (Panchayat Raj) and Botsa Satyanarayana (Municipal Administration), M. Sankara Narayana (R&B) and Ch.

25 August 2021||Bengaluru,||Many ORR companies wary of extending WFH||The Outer Ring Road Companies Association (ORRCA) said a majority of its members were not comfortable with the government advisory suggesting that IT and BT companies located in the area extend the work-from-home option for most of their employees until December 2022. The advisory was issued on Monday in the wake of commencement of metro work on ORR, from Silk Board to K.R. Puram, with an aim to avoid congestion and traffic hassles. ORRCA spokesperson told The Hindu that the association has already shared the feedback it collected from its member companies with the State government. “ORRCA’s understanding is that the government is going to issue a revised statement following questions they have received on the advisory. We are waiting for the revised statement,” said Krishna Kumar Gowda, Consultant, ORRCA.  The advisory comes at a time when many companies are planning to get their employees back to office from December 2021, he pointed out. Mr. Gowda expressed apprehension about the prospect of metro rail work not getting completed by December 2022. Meanwhile, a clarification letter issued by the Department of Electronics, Information Technology, Biotechnology and Science and Technology, sent out on Wednesday sought to allay this fear. It said that “BMRCL is focused on getting the Namma Metro project completed on time with minimum inconvenience to companies and employees who want to commute to work and back during the construction phase.” Dr. E.V. Ramana Reddy, Additional Chief Secretary to Government Department of Electronics, IT, BT, S&T said it is “to be treated only as an advisory for the consideration of the industry.”  BBMP and DULT are being requested to ensure all pre-construction activities are completed before the construction phase to ensure companies can return to their offices in a seamless manner, said the letter. Nasscom Vice President (Industry Initiative) K.S. Viswanathan said, “This is just an advisory from the government so that work for all, including that of Metro Rail, will continue without one disturbing the other.” There are over 700 IT and BT companies, between the Silk Board to K.R. Puram, that employ over 1.7 lakh people. This area, under BBMP jurisdiction, also houses tech parks such as Eco Space, Eco World, Prestige Tech Park, Salarpuria Tech Park, Embassy Tech Village, Global Tech Park and Bagmage Tech Park.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/many-orr-companies-wary-of-extending-wfh/article36091101.ece

25 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Nadda condemns Rane’s arrest||The BJP on Tuesday came out strongly in support of Union Minister Narayan Rane, who has been arrested by the Maharashtra police after he made comments against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. The party’s national president J.P. Nadda termed the arrest “a violation of constitutional values”. Taking to Twitter, Mr. Nadda said, “The arrest of Union Minister Narayan Rane ji by the Maharashtra government is a violation of constitutional values. We will neither be scared nor suppressed by such action.” “These people are troubled by the immense support the BJP is getting in the Jan-Aashirvad Yatra. We will continue to fight democratically, the yatra will continue,” he added. BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra termed the arrest a “murder of democracy”. “He must have said some words which could have been avoided. But is this the tolerance of the Uddhav government, is this the law,” Mr. Patra said, addressing a press conference n New Delhi on the issue. Mr Patra said, “Some ministers of Maharashtra are saying that the law has to be followed, but is there a law to pelt stones at BJP offices? Is it law to put people’s lives at risk? Is it law to file 30-40 FIRs against a minister?" Mr. Patra referred to cases registered against Ministers in the Uddhav Thackeray government and compared them to the precipitate action against Mr Rane. “There are cases against 27 Ministers out of 42 of the Maharashtra government. There are allegations of recovery on Anil Deshmukh, there are many allegations against Anil Parab too. Were they arrested, did the police go to their homes,” he asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nadda-protests-ranes-arrest/article36090974.ece
25 August 2021||August 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Modi, Putin discuss crisis in Afghanistan||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday discussed charting out a “coordinated” strategy in Afghanistan, while National Security Advisers (NSA) from the five BRICS countries met virtually to discuss developments there with a focus on combating terrorism. Officials said the Russian President called Mr. Modi to discuss developments in Afghanistan, with the two leaders agreeing to set up a “permanent bilateral channel” on the issues arising from the Taliban takeover. “Had a detailed and useful exchange of views with my friend President Putin on recent developments in Afghanistan,” Mr. Modi tweeted after the 45-minute conversation. Among the particular areas of concern were ensuring regional security, countering radicalisation and spread of “terrorist ideology”, and the proliferation of drugs as a consequence of the developments, a Russian Embassy spokesperson said. These were also issues that figured as the NSAs from India, Russia, China, Brazil and South Africa met virtually, one of the key meetings in the lead-up to next month’s BRICS leaders’ summit, which India is chairing. NSA Ajit Doval hosted the virtual meeting. The Ministry of External Affairs said the meeting “reviewed the regional and global political and security scenario with particular reference to current developments in Afghanistan, Iran, West Asia and the Gulf, and emerging threats to national security, such as cybersecurity”. The meeting also discussed counter-terrorism, and India raised “the issue of cross-border terrorism and activities of groups such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba [LeT] and Jaish-e-Mohammed [JeM], which enjoy State support and threaten peace and security,” it said. The Ministry added that the representatives “adopted and recommended the BRICS Counter Terrorism Action Plan”. On Afghanistan, there do remain differences within the grouping, with China and Russia broadly aligning their positions. China and Russia, along with Pakistan, are among the few countries that continue to keep their embassies open in Afghanistan in contrast to India, which has evacuated all diplomatic personnel. Both Russia and China continue to maintain their diplomatic presence in Kabul and have hosted Taliban delegations on a number of occasions, most recently by China on July 28. However, both are yet to offer recognition to the new regime. How far India and Russia can indeed coordinate their strategies, as both leaders discussed on Tuesday, remains to be seen. Both Indian and Russian officials said it was significant that Mr. Putin reached out to Mr. Modi directly, indicating the Russian interest in working with India bilaterally, and multilaterally at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and at other forums like BRICS, despite the differences between India and China on the Afghanistan issue, and on the role of Pakistan in facilitating the Taliban. China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the BRICS NSA’s meet was “an important platform for the five countries to strengthen political security cooperation”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/modi-putin-discuss-afghanistan-crisis/article36090992.ece
25 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Experts seek faster pace of vaccination||The complacency in people’s behaviour early this year was one of the major reasons for the severe second COVID-19 wave, say experts. Also, with only 15% of the eligible population fully vaccinated so far, “if the infection spreads uncontrollably, it will give the virus an opportunity to mutate more. These mutations can change its characteristics — it can become less or more transmissible or virulent,” cautioned Gitanjali Batmanabane, Director of AIIMS, Bhubaneswar. She said that the only way to contain the virus spread was by following COVID-19 appropriate behaviour at all times. Ramji Singh, Director of AIIMS, Kalyani, West Bengal, said, “Any carelessness during the coming festivals or during the opening up may lead to a sudden surge in the number of cases. Though the daily positivity rate has been less than 3% for the last 23 days, the upcoming festivals may help the virus to surge, jeopardising our gain in controlling the pandemic.” The warning assumes greater importance given that a majority of the population, which is not completely vaccinated, continues to be vulnerable to a potential third wave. “India has provided one COVID vaccination dose to 45.6 crore people, that is 49% of the adult population of about 94 crore, and two doses to 13.28 crore people, that is 14% of the adult population,” NITI Aayog member (Health) V.K. Paul told The Hindu . Gagandeep Kang, leading virologist and Professor at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, spoke about the need for a quicker pace of vaccination. Priority groups She said, “We should be trying to get as high as possible, as fast as possible. Unfortunately with supply being limited, we can only move at the pace which supply dictates. But within supply, we need to prioritise vulnerable groups and we have not been monitoring coverage by priority groups beyond healthcare and frontline workers. I am told that by last week only 60% of those above 60 years have been reached with one dose of vaccine and 30% with two doses and that is really low given that we started to vaccinate them on March 1.” Dr. Kang also stressed better tracking. “Pregnant women need coverage as priority group 2, according to the World Health Organisation [WHO]. I think we are already seeing some impact of the vaccines, but we need better tracking. We need at least 75% coverage in priority groups with both doses before we move to new groups.” The Ministry noted that more than 57.15 crore doses have been provided to the States and Union Territories so far through the Central government’s free-of-cost channel and through direct State procurement category.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/experts-seek-faster-pace-of-vaccination/article36091000.ece
25 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||No request to delist Taliban leaders: officials||There are no requests from the United Nations Security Council’s (UNSC) permanent members for the delisting of the Taliban’s top leadership from sanctions thus far, officials said here. They also refuted reports that the next meeting of the UN’s 1988 Sanctions Committee, due next month, would lift restrictions on designated terrorists like Sirajuddin Haqqani and Mullah Baradar. Sources told The Hindu that the next meeting of the Taliban Sanctions Committee, as the resolution 1988 committee is referred to, is due to be held in “mid-September”, ahead of an important meeting to discuss the renewal of the mandate of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), which expires on September 17. India’s Permanent Representative to the UN (UNPR), T.S. Tirumurti, is the Chairman of the committee until December 31 this year, and is key to deciding the date of the meetings, and scrutinising requests to delist the Taliban leaders. While diplomats from at least three countries as well as External Affairs Ministry officials confirmed that there were no requests to de-designate or delist any of the sanctioned 135 individuals and five entities, they said a decision was likely to be taken on whether to extend the special travel exemptions given to 14 Taliban members to participate in the “peace and reconciliation efforts”. The meeting could also discuss whether to include other Taliban leaders in the exemptions. Significant for India The reports concerning Sirajuddin Haqqani are significant for India as he and the Haqqani group, founded by his father Jalaluddin Haqqani, are wanted for the Indian Embassy bombings in Kabul in 2008 and 2009. Around 70 persons were killed in the attacks. In November 2012, India was instrumental, as the then President of the UN Security Council, in ensuring that the Haqqani group was designated as a terror entity. Sirajuddin, deputy to Taliban chief Haibatullah Akhundzada, is now likely to have considerable influence in the next government in Afghanistan. His brother Anas Haqqani, who was arrested in 2014 for financing the group’s terror attacks and was released as part of a hostage swap in 2019 from Bagram prison, is now one of the chief negotiators in government formation talks in Kabul. This is the first time the committees would meet after the Taliban takeover of Kabul on August 15. The stand taken by the UNSC members, particularly the P-5 — the U.S., Russia, China, France and the U.K. — would indicate how they intend to approach a future Taliban-led regime in Afghanistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-request-to-delist-taliban-leaders-officials/article36090994.ece
25 August 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. selling India’s crown jewels, says Rahul Gandhi||The Narendra Modi government is selling India’s “crown jewels”, built over the past 70 years with public money, to help three or four people, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said about the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) on Tuesday. Addressing a press conference along with former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, Mr. Gandhi said the NMP is “designed to create monopolies through privatisation” and will eventually take away jobs from the youth. He accused the Modi government of “assassinating” the informal sector, impacting job reservations by privatising public sector undertakings (PSU) and warned of “social tension, social anger and finally social explosion that will see a dramatic increase in violence”. On Monday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had unveiled an ambitious plan to monetise Rs. 6 lakh crore over the next four years by “unlocking” the value of “underutilised” infrastructure projects, including passenger trains, railway stations, airports, ports, natural gas pipelines, power transmission lines, warehousing, National Highways, roads and stadiums, among others. “The Prime Minister and the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) used to say that the Congress Party has done nothing in 70 years. There is a list here of all the assets that the Congress Party helped build. These assets have been built using public money, thousands and thousands of crores of rupees, over the last 70 years. Now, the Prime Minister is in the process of selling the crown jewels of this country,” Mr. Gandhi told reporters. ‘No consultation’ Mr. Chidambaram said that raising funds cannot be the sole aim for selling assets built over 70 years. “You don’t embark upon this exercise without consultation with stakeholders. Have the Railway unions and employees been consulted? Have the port workers been consulted? Have those employed in warehouses been consulted? Have farmers been consulted? This is all hatched in secrecy in this wonderful organisation call NITI Aayog,” the former Finance Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-selling-crown-jewels-rahul/article36091009.ece
25 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Treat colleagues with respect, Rahul tells Baghel||After Punjab and Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh is the latest Congress-ruled State that is witnessing a bitter factional war playing out in the media. Tensions have been simmering since June when supporters of Health Minister T.S. Singh Deo began reminding the Congress’s top leadership of the agreement to rotate the position of chief minister. However, Chief Minister Bhupesh Bhagel has said the Chief Minister's post is rotated only in a coalition government, even as he maintained that he will resign whenever the Congress leadership asked him to. Mr. Bhagel and Mr. Singh Deo met former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday. Though both the Chhattisgarh leaders arrived simultaneously, Mr. Gandhi is learnt to have met them separately. General secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal and All-India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge P.L. Punia were present at these meetings that went on for nearly three hours. No changes “Venugopal ji has been entrusted the work of resolving some of the issues that came up in the meeting,” a source told The Hindu . Speaking to a news agency, Mr.Punia claimed that “there was no discussion on a change in leadership in Chhattisgarh”. “We met Rahul ji and discussed in detail the various schemes undertaken by the Chhattisgarh Government,” Mr. Baghel told reporters outside Mr. Gandhi's residence. Mr. Deo is said to be unhappy and sources say he may not continue in Mr. Baghel’s Cabinet. The Health Minister is reported to have raised the issue of split tenure as well as the manner in which he was treated by the Chief Minister and Mr. Gandhi is said to have expressed his displeasure over this in his meeting with Mr. Baghel. Despite a clean sweep in Chhattisgarh in the December 2018 Assembly elections, the Congress had problems in naming its Chief Minister, as the top post was intensely contested by Mr. Baghel and Mr. Deo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/treat-colleagues-with-respect-rahul-tells-baghel/article36090981.ece
25 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||India evacuates 77 stranded persons from Afghanistan||A special Air India flight arrived here on Tuesday morning carrying 77 persons from Kabul, including 46 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus. The passengers brought Sri Guru Granth Sahib from three gurdwaras. They were evacuated on Monday by an Indian Air Force flight and spent the night at Dushanbe before being airlifted on the special Air India flight. Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan and the Union Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri received the Sikh holy books at the Delhi airport. “Blessed to receive and pay obeisance to the three holy Swaroop of Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji from Kabul to Delhi,” said Mr. Puri after receiving the holy books. Puneet Singh Chandhoke, one of the civil society activists who has been coordinating with the Ministry of External Affairs, said the persons bringing the Sikh holy books would be taken in a procession to the Guru Arjan Dev ji Gurdwara in the capital’s Mahavir Nagar. “Prominent New York-based entrepreneur Mandeep Singh Sobti and Paramjeet Singh Anand, through their Sobti Foundation, have undertaken the lifetime rehabilitation of these displaced Afghan nationals in coordination and guidance of the Government of India,” Mr. Chandhoke said. As a cautionary measure, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, all the passengers of the flight have been sent for mandatory quarantine for a fortnight at Chhawla camp in Najafgarh. India is likely to operate a few more flights to evacuate Afghan and stranded Indian citizens in the coming days, Mr. Chandhoke noted. Kabul continued to remain tense with hundreds pouring in from various parts of Afghanistan at the airport, which remains under the control of the U.S. forces. India has maintained focus on evacuating Sikhs and Hindus while also helping some of the lawmakers and officials associated with the government of President Ashraf Ghani.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-evacuates-77-stranded-persons-from-afghanistan/article36090989.ece
25 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||In a first, Army receives hand grenades from private sector||Marking a first in ammunition supply by the private sector to the Army, Nagpur-based Economic Explosives Limited (EEL) handed over the first batch of Multi-Mode Hand Grenades (MMHG) on Tuesday. “The first batch of MMHG manufactured by EEL following Transfer of Technology from Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory of Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO), was handed over to the Army in the presence of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in Nagpur,” a Defence Ministry statement said. The EEL had taken the technology from DRDO in 2016, the statement said. “Extensive trials were successfully undertaken by the Army and Directorate General of Quality Assurance (DGQA) in 2017-18 in plains, deserts and high altitudes over summer and winter,” it stated. The MMHG grenades will replace Grenade No. 36 of World War I vintage design still in service. The EEL had signed a contract with the Ministry of Defence on October 1, 2020 to supply 10 lakh modern hand grenades to the Army and Air Force. The deliveries will be spread over two years from the bulk production clearance, which was accorded to EEL in March 2021, the statement added. Talking of the initiative of technology transfer to Industries by DRDO, Mr. Singh said that this was being undertaken free of cost, while providing access to testing facilities and over 450 patents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-a-first-army-receives-hand-grenades-from-private-sector/article36091005.ece
25 August 2021||MOSCOW,||S-400 air defence deal on track: Rostec||In the last three years, since 2018, the defence trade between India and Russia was $15 billion because of some big ticket defence deals, said Victor N. Kladov, Head of International Cooperation and Regional Policy of Rostec state corporation. The S-400 air defence systems deal, for which deliveries are scheduled to begin in a few months, was on schedule, Mr. Kladov said, while downplaying the threat of U.S. sanctions under CAATSA (Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act). “Indian government stands very firm in protecting national interests… Since getting S-400 is very important to enhance national air defence, definitely India will continue implementing this contract,” Mr. Kladov said in a conversation with The Hindu at the ongoing Army 2021 exhibition. Stating that CAATSA was not targeted against Russia but against third countries cooperating with Russia, Mr. Kladov said it was for the Indian side to decide “how to protect itself”. “When it comes to our side, we are very helpful. For instance, we protect our banking systems by doing payments in national currencies,” he said. Mr. Kladov said they had no problems as far as payments are concerned. “At every stage of the contract, there is an instalment payment. We are moving smoothly because we are getting instalment payments.” As reported by The Hindu earlier, deliveries of S-400 long range air defence systems are scheduled to begin by November. Air Force trained “One team of Indian Air Force (IAF) officials has been trained in Russia to operate the system and a second team is being trained now,” said Vyacheslav K. Dzirkaln, Deputy Director General for foreign economic activities of Almaz Antey, which manufactures the S-400, on the sidelines of Army 2021. In October 2018, India and Russia signed a $5.43 billion deal for five S-400 regiments despite objections from the United States. U.S. officials have on several occasions raised concerns over the deal as India deepens its defence cooperation with the U.S. and has acquired several frontline military platforms like transport aircraft, helicopters, artillery and drones. A few JVs were set up long before the Government of India announced the Make in India initiative like BrahMos, and more were being set up for the manufacture of Ka-226T helicopters and Ak-203 assault rifles, Mr. Kladov said. Russia was ready to kick start production once the deal for Ka-226T utility helicopters was signed, he said. “We lost a few years on localisation issues… By concluding this deal we can further supply to third countries.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-russia-defence-trade-worth-15bn-in-3-years/article36091003.ece
25 August 2021||Mumbai,||Rane-Uddhav Thackeray rivalry spills over||From a surprise choice as Shiv Sena’s second Chief Minister of Maharashtra in 1999 to becoming a first serving Union Cabinet minister in the last 20 years to get arrested by a State government , Narayan Rane’s political journey is closely intertwined with that of his former party, so much so that his present political existence depends on his ability to counter Sena president and Maharashtra Chief Minister — and his arch-rival — Uddhav Thackeray. In 2005, Mr. Rane led a coup within the Sena against Uddhav Thackeray and his coterie. He had a reputation of being a muscle-man ingrained in the Sena’s political culture, an Opposition leader whom the ministers in the then Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) feared and a close confidante of Sena founder, the late Balasaheb Thackeray. His rebellion against the Sena, unheard of since the time of NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal in 1990s, was followed by sharp criticism of Uddhav. Over the years, criticism turned into bitterness, with both sides leaving no opportunity to berate each other. The bitterness has also percolated to the next generation. Personal attacks Uddhav Thackeray became party president in 2012 after the death of Bal Thackeray. In all these years, Mr. Rane continued and intensified his acerbic attacks on Mr. Thackeray even while expressing utmost loyalty towards Bal Thackeray. The Swabhimani Sanghatana, an outfit ran by his younger son Nitesh Rane countered the Sena in Mumbai. Mr. Thackeray meanwhile has maintained a stoic silence all through even as Mr Rane continued personal attacks . In the 2014 Assembly polls, however, Mr. Rane tasted his first defeat at his home turf Kudal by Sena’s rookie Vaibhav Naik. Two years later, Mr. Rane decided to contest by-poll at Bandra east where Mr. Thackeray's residence is located. He was defeated again, by the Sena’s Trupti Sawant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rane-uddhav-thackeray-rivalry-spills-over/article36091505.ece
25 August 2021||New Delhi,||77 Muzaffarnagar riot cases withdrawn||Seventy-seven cases relating to the Muzaffarnagar communal riots were withdrawn by the Uttar Pradesh government without assigning any reasons, a report alerted the Supreme Court. “The government orders do not give any reasons for withdrawal of the case under Section 321 of Code of Criminal Procedure. They merely state that the administration, after full consideration, has taken a decision to withdraw the particular case. Many such cases relate to offences of dacoity punishable with imprisonment for life,” the Supreme Court’s amicus curiae , senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, assisted by advocate Sneha Kalita, said in a report on Tuesday. Mr. Hansaria said the information is part of a letter sent to him by the Uttar Pradesh State counsel on August 20. The letter said 510 cases relating to the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013 were registered in five districts of the Meerut zone against 6,869 accused. Of this, chargesheets were filed in 175 cases, final reports were submitted in 165 cases, and 170 cases were “expunged”. “Thereafter, 77 cases were withdrawn by the Uttar Pradesh State Government under Section 321 of the CrPC,” Mr. Hansaria informed the Supreme Court in the report. ‘Examine withdrawals’ The amicus curiae urged the Supreme Court to have the Allahabad High Court examine the withdrawal of these 77 cases by the State government. Mr. Hansaria recalled that the Supreme Court, on August 10, had specifically ordered that no prosecution against sitting or former legislators should be withdrawn without the permission of the High Court. “Withdrawal from prosecution is permissible in public interest and cannot be done for political consideration,” the report said. “Such application can be made in good faith, in the interest of public policy and justice and not to thwart or stifle the process of law,” the report added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/77-muzaffarnagar-riot-cases-withdrawn/article36090972.ece

This preparatory module should be used for all Class 1 students across the country even after the pandemic, according to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) professors who prepared the ‘Vidya Pravesh’ module. “COVID or no COVID, it’s a fact that there is a huge variety of children coming to join Class 1 in any given year. Children come with different levels of learning and those who are behind continue to lag behind,” said one of the NCERT professors, who did not wish to be named. “This situation is exacerbated as well as equalised by the COVID-19 school closures,” said another NCERT professor. “Because of the pandemic, none of the children arriving in Class 1 this year have been in any sort of physical classes,” the professor added. The ‘Vidya Pravesh’ module is meant to bridge the gaps for these students. . The module lays out detailed plans, using activities, games, art integration and storytelling tools to achieve three developmental goals. For children to maintain good health and well-being, it includes a focus on physical and motor development, socio-emotional development, nutrition, safety, hygiene and sanitation. The other two goals aim to build the foundations for literacy and numeracy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/12-week-play-based-teaching-module-for-class-1-students/article36090978.ece
25 August 2021||New Delhi,||‘Hope Afghan crisis does not pose challenge to neighbours’||India on Tuesday hoped that the situation in Afghanistan did not pose a challenge to its neighbours and the Afghan territory was not used by terrorist groups such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) to threaten other countries, as it pitched for an inclusive and broad-based dispensation in Kabul that represented all sections of Afghan society. In his address at a special session of the UN Human Rights Council on the situation in Afghanistan, Indian Ambassador to the UN in Geneva Indra Mani Pandey said a “grave” humanitarian crisis was unfolding in the country and everyone was concerned about the increasing violations of fundamental rights of the Afghan people. He said India hoped that the situation stabilised soon, and the parties concerned addressed the humanitarian and security issues. “We also hope that there is an inclusive and broad-based dispensation that represents all sections of Afghan society. Voices of Afghan women, aspirations of Afghan children and the rights of minorities must be respected,” he said. “A broad-based representation would help the arrangement gain more acceptability and legitimacy,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hope-afghan-crisis-does-not-pose-challenge-to-neighbours/article36090990.ece
25 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||EPFO appeal goes to larger SC Bench||A Division Bench of the Supreme Court on Tuesday referred to a larger Bench an appeal filed by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) challenging a decision of the Kerala High Court, which set aside amendments to “determination of pensionable salary” under the Employees Pension Scheme (EPS) of 1995 as “ultra vires”. A Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and Ajay Rastogi found that an authoritative decision on the question of law concerning the amendments should be made in consideration with a 2016 decision of another two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court in the R.C. Gupta case. Justice Lalit’s Bench said a larger Bench of at least three judges should consider the appeal against the background of the “governing principles” laid down in the R.C. Gupta case, which “go to the root of the matter” in this appeal. The appeal was referred to the Chief Justice of India for forming a larger Bench. The dispute revolves around the controversial amendments made to Clause 11(3) of the EPS-1995. Challenges to the EPS amendments said they were skewed. The people who challenged the amendments came from all walks of life and work. They sought a more secure life with decent pension. In the earlier version of EPS-1995, the maximum pensionable salary cap was Rs. 6,500. However, members whose salaries exceeded this cap could opt, along with their employers, to contribute up to 8.33% of their actual salaries. Raising of cap The amendments raised the cap from Rs. 6,500 to Rs. 15,000. But the amendments said only employees, who were existing EPS members as on September 1, 2014, could continue to contribute to the pension fund in accordance with their actual salaries. They were given a window of six months to opt for the new pension regime. However, the changed pension regime introduced through the amendments meant that someone who became an EPS member after September 1, 2014 would not get pension on a par with his or her actual salary. “That is, even if your salary is Rs. 1 lakh, you will get pension only for a salary Rs. 15000,” advocate Nishe Rajen Shonker, for the main respondents, explained. The case concerns thousands of employees and pensioners who draw merely Rs. 2,000 or Rs. ,3000 as pension. The EPFO has argued in favour of the amendments, saying the High Court had not only defeated the “object and purpose of EPS-1995 but will also prejudice the interests of the lower waged employees”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/epfo-appeal-goes-to-larger-sc-bench/article36091007.ece
25 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||BJP plans to play OBC card in Chhattisgarh||Among the three States that the BJP lost in the 2018 set of Assembly polls, the loss of Chhattisgarh rankled the most, as the defeat there, unlike Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, was more of a rout. Ever since then, the party has been on the lookout for a way back into electoral favour, including the search for a new leader in the State, which this time around appears to be revolving around candidates from the Other Backward Classes (OBC) community. Radical measures According to senior sources in the party, the loss to the Congress has led to a radical set of measures being taken in terms of organisational thinking. “Immediately after the loss of 2018, we had the general election in 2019, where the BJP changed all 11 of its candidates and managed to win nine out of the 11. This also led to some rethink on the question of leadership going up to the next Assembly polls,” said the source. BJP’s national general secretary in charge of Chhattisgarh, D. Purandareshwari, and joint general secretary (organisation) Shiv Prakash have made multiple visits to Chhattisgarh, with senior party leaders in the State noticing that leaders of the OBC community being given attention. Ajay Chandrakar, MLA, is one of the leaders being paid close attention to as he is active in the Assembly and outspoken. Former IAS officer O.P. Chaudhary, who took premature retirement from the civil services to fight and lose the 2018 polls on a BJP ticket, is also active in the interiors of the State, and is being groomed for an important role going ahead. In Chhattisgarh, OBCs make up nearly 50% of the vote, with Mr. Chaudhary belonging to the dominant Aghariya community among them. Mr. Chandrakar has been a Minister in former Chief Minister Raman Singh’s government. Leader of the opposition Dharam Lal Kaushik, belonging to the Kurmi community, forms the third part of this triumvirate of leadership being pushed by Delhi. In fact, the senior leadership of the party made it clear that the next polls may not be fought around one face, a development that many have taken to mean that it is the end of the road for Mr. Raman Singh. Rout analysed Senior party leaders in Chhattisgarh said its rout in the State was analysed, and while anti-incumbency was considered one of the main reasons for the loss, the fact that the party drew a blank on OBC support to the Congress due to its promise of bonus payment on grain procurement and the leadership of Bhupesh Baghel belonging to an OBC group was also an important factor. The recent Cabinet reshuffle with emphasis on inclusion of many faces from the OBC communities, coupled with the demand for a caste census and the lifting of the cap for reservation, seem to have converged with the BJP’s reading in Chhattisgarh, with the party hoping that one of its OBC faces may click with people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-plans-to-play-obc-card-in-chhattisgarh/article36090976.ece

The party said it would hit the streets to garner people’s support on the issue. The BJD also criticised the BJP for remaining ‘silent’ on the issue at a time when its partners in the National Democratic Alliance were demanding caste-based census.  “In the absence of reliable and authentic data about the exact numbers of Socially and Educationally Backward Class or Other Backward Class population, focused programme for welfare of the backward caste cannot be formulated. The federal system and legal concerns have come in the way of the State government to address the issue,” said Ranendra Pratap Swain, senior BJD leader and Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjd-reiterates-demand-for-caste-based-census/article36091239.ece
25 August 2021||LUCKNOW,||‘Akhilesh didn’t offer final respects to Kalyan Singh’||Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has come under the fire from the BJP for not physically paying his final respects to former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Kalyan Singh. Singh, who was the Chief Minister during the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992, died aged 89 on Saturday evening and was cremated on Monday in Bulandshahr by the Ganga. On Tuesday, senior BJP OBC leaders accused Mr. Yadav of trying to appease Muslims by not paying his respects to Singh, who was a Lodh Rajput (OBC) and a key face of the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple movement. Swatantra Dev Singh, BJP State president, said Mr. Yadav did not come to pay tribute to Kalyan Singh, who lived barely 1 km from his residence. “Did the charm of Muslim vote bank prevent him from paying tribute to the biggest leader of the backward castes,” he asked in a tweet. Keshav Prasad Maurya, Deputy CM, said Mr. Yadav lost the “moral right” to talk about OBCs by not turning up to pay his final respects to Kalyan Singh. Sachidanand Hari alias Sakshi Maharaj, MP Unnao and himself a Lodh, accused Mr. Yadav of avoiding the last rites of Kalyan Singh just to “appease” a “particular community” for votes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/akhilesh-didnt-offer-final-respects-to-kalyan-singh/article36091240.ece

To raise this demand and convey our sentiments, we have sought time from the high command. We are going to meet AICC (All India Congress Committee) in charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat tomorrow in Dehradun and then decide further,” Mr Channi said. After the meeting, Mr. Sidhu tweeted: “Got a call from Tripat Bajwa ji asking for an emergency meeting... Met him along with other colleagues at the PPCC office. Will apprise the high command of the situation.” Sidhu’s aides slammed Meanwhile, hitting out at Mr. Sidhu’s aides, Mr. Mali and Mr. Garg, State Ministers Brahm Mohindra, Vijay Inder Singla, Bharat Bhushan Ashu, Balbir Singh Sidhu and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, along with MLA Raj Kumar Verka, said: “Statements by both these newly appointed advisors are clearly against India’s interests and detrimental to national security.” Besides stringent legal action against Mr. Mali and Mr. Garg, these leaders also urged the Congress national leadership to direct Mr. Sidhu to immediately rein-in his aides in the interest of the party as well as the country. ‘Massive damage’ Congress leaders also questioned Mr. Sidhu’s failure to put his foot down on the diatribe by his close aides, despite the “justified uproar it has triggered across party lines”. Mr. Sidhu’s omission in this regard had given ammunition to Opposition parties, which were quick to recall the PPCC’s chief’s personal bonhomie with the Pakistan Prime Minister and Army chief, they pointed out, warning against the “massive damage this could cause to the Congress in the run-up to the 2022 Punjab Assembly polls”, which are due in less than six months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amarinder-ministry-reels-under-cong-feud-again/article36090982.ece

Mr. Tarigami accused the LG (Lieutenant Governor) administration of depriving local officers of top positions in the government. He questioned the Centre’s claims on development, investment and employment. “They stand exposed. Even people in Jammu have started feeling lack of governance and development now,” he noted. The Gupkar alliance also criticised the move not to issue security clearance to people involved in pelting of stones for passports and jobs. “Nobody can be deprived of their rights until proved guilty by the court.” Referring to their demand made during the all-party meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 24, Mr. Tarigami said: “We want to ask the government how many people have been released. There are cases where people have been released by courts after a decade saying they were innocent.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/end-humiliation-says-gupkar-alliance/article36090983.ece

Party activists vandalised the BJP’s office in Nashik. Baramati, Nagpur and Sangli too witnessed protests. Appearing before a Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and N.J. Jamadar in the High Court, Mr. Nikam said the offences under which Mr. Rane had been charged attracted less that seven years in prison and no notice was issued to him under Section 41A (notice of appearance before police officer) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court told him to follow the procedure and get the petition numbered by the registry first. In his Raigad speech, Mr. Rane said, “The State’s economy and all businesses are in turmoil owing to this man’s [Mr. Thackeray] pathetic management of affairs…more than 1.5 lakh persons have lost their lives due to the State’s mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a shortage of vaccines, no medical staff, no doctors. The State’s health infrastructure was in a shambolic state… Does he [Mr. Thackeray] even have the right to speak on anything… He ought to keep a secretary as he did not even know it was the 75th anniversary of India’s Independence and was asking someone backstage [on Independence Day]. I would have given him a tight slap had I been there for forgetting the number of years of India’s Independence”. The FIRs were registered against Mr. Rane in Pune by the Yuva Sena (the Shiv Sena’s youth wing), one in Nashik and two at Mahad in Raigad district. High drama High drama was seen in Ratnagiri when the Sangameshwar police went to arrest him, triggering heated altercations between his aides and the authorities. His custody was later handed over to the Raigad police. While BJP Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis admitted that Mr. Rane ought to have shown restraint in his statements, State BJP president Chandrakant Patil said it was “against protocol” for a State government to arrest a Union Minister. “All this arrest drama has been contrived by the Maha Vikas Aghadi government to divert the public’s attention from the fact that Mr. Rane has been receiving overwhelming support in the Konkan region during his ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’,” Mr. Patil claimed. The induction of Mr. Rane in the Union Cabinet last month is being viewed as an aggressive move on the BJP’s part to neutralise the Sena in the Konkan. Himself a former Shiv Sainik, Mr. Rane’s ‘Sena baiting’ has grown even more strident since he exited the Congress in 2017.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/union-minister-arrested-for-remark-on-cm/article36090984.ece

25 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Economic criterion not sole basis for creamy layer’||The Supreme Court on Tuesday held that economic criterion should not be the sole basis to identify sections of backward communities as 'creamy layer'. Social advancement, higher employment in government services, etc., played an equal role in deciding whether a person belonged to the creamy layer and could be denied quota benefits, it said. “The basis of exclusion of ‘creamy layer’ cannot be merely economic,” a Bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose observed in their judgment, while referring to the Supreme Court’s Indra Sawhney verdict of 1992, which declared that ‘creamy layer’ in a backward community should be excluded from reservation so that the more deserving were able to come up. The court had illustrated that ‘creamy layer’ would include “persons from backward classes who occupied posts in higher services like IAS, IPS and All India Services had reached a higher level of social advancement and economic status, and therefore, were not entitled to be treated as backward”. Two notifications The court was hearing a petition challenging two notifications issued on August 17, 2016 and August 28, 2018 by the Haryana government sub-classifying backward classes solely on economic basis while fixing the criteria for creamy layer. The notifications, issued under the Haryana Backward Classes (Reservation in Services and Admission in Educational Institutions) Act of 2016, said backward community members who earn above Rs. 6 lakh annually would be treated as 'creamy layer'. The Supreme Court held that the Haryana’s notifications have violated the law declared in the Indra Sawhney judgment by identifying creamy layer only on the basis of income. Fresh guidelines “In spite of Section 5(2) of the 2016 Act making it mandatory for identification and exclusion of ‘creamy layer’ to be on the basis of social, economic and other relevant factors, the State of Haryana has sought to determine ‘creamy layer’ from backward classes solely on the basis of economic criterion and has committed a grave error in doing so,” the court held, quashing both the notifications. The Supreme Court directed the State to issue fresh notifications in three months. It did not, however, disturb admissions to educational institutions and appointments to State government services made on the basis of the two notifications.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/economic-criterion-not-sole-basis-for-creamy-layer/article36090970.ece

25 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||A-G slams acquittal in POCSO case||Attorney General K.K. Venugopal in the Supreme Court on Tuesday slammed the Bombay High Court’s decision to acquit a man charged with assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) solely on the ground that he had groped the child over her clothes without ‘skin-to-skin’ contact. “Someone can wear a surgical glove and exploit a child and get away scot-free... This is an outrageous order,” Mr. Venugopal exclaimed. Mr. Venugopal had approached the Supreme Court in his constitutional capacity as the Attorney General. He had argued that the order would set a “very dangerous precedent” and cripple the intention of POCSO to punish sexual offenders. Mr. Venugopal said the order has a deleterious effect when the number of POCSO cases have reached 43,000 in one year. The court scheduled the case for hearing on September 14 on learning that the accused was not represented by a lawyer. It directed the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee to provide him a lawyer. Senior advocate Siddharth Dave has been appointed amicus curiae in the case. On January 19, a single judge of the Bombay High Court’s Nagpur Bench sparked a furore after acquitting a man charged under POCSO and holding that an act against a minor would amount to groping or sexual assault only if there was “skin-to-skin” contact. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) had earlier asked the Maharashtra government to appeal the High Court judgment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-g-slams-acquittal-in-pocso-case/article36091054.ece

Senthilbalaji since all 13 victims had compromised the issue and wanted the case to be quashed. The case pertained to alleged irregularities in recruitment when Mr. Senthilbalaji was Transport Minister in the erstwhile AIADMK government headed by Jayalalithaa. Justice M. Nirmal Kumar quashed the case against the Minister, his brother Ashok Kumar, personal assistant Shanmugam and Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) employee Rajkumar after the victims appeared before court and said the matter had been settled. In a judgment delivered on July 30, but available in public domain only now, the judge said the Minister and his brother were not directly involved in collection of Rs. 40 lakh which had been paid only to other accused. However, in 2019, the victims reportedly got back their money. Though only Shanmugam had filed a petition to quash the proceedings on the basis of the compromise reached with the victims, the judge quashed the entire proceedings pending before a special court for trying cases booked against the past and present legislators.

Arulmani, a technical staff in MTC, had lodged the complaint in 2018 stating that he collected Rs. 40 lakh from the 13 individuals and paid them to the accused after they promised to secure driver and conductor jobs when Mr. Balaji was Transport Minister in 2014. Claiming that they neither got jobs nor the money back, he claimed to have taken four years to lodge the complaint because the accused was a Minister. On the other hand, the quash petitioner claimed that the complaint was lodged after the Minister left AIADMK and joined DMK. It was also claimed that the petitioner was actually running a manpower agency and that the money was collected towards consultation charges for securing jobs if the applicants fulfil required eligibility. However, they were not eligible and hence they could not get the jobs. Though the money was repaid in 2019 and all 13 victims were not interested in prosecuting the case, the police went ahead and filed a charge sheet due to political reasons, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-purpose-in-holding-trial-against-senthilbalaji-says-madras-high-court/article36091185.ece
25 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Extra track to boost suburban train services beyond Tambaram||Thousands of residents beyond Tambaram are set to get affordable and dependable public transport in the form of suburban train services by this year-end. Southern Railway will complete the third line between Tambaram and Chengalpattu by August-end. The project, similar to the fifth and sixth lines developed near the Moore Market suburban complex, will pave the way for putting express trains and suburban trains on dedicated lines, thus facilitating the speedy movement of express trains and the operation of more suburban trains in the fast-developing residential localities beyond Tambaram. A. Elumalai, Public Relations Officer of Southern Railway’s Chennai Division, said the work on the 30-km third line from Tambaram to Chengalpattu was carried out in three phases. Two phases covering nearly 20 km have been completed. The work on 10 km from Guduvanchery to Tambaram is progressing well, and will be completed by this month-end. Once the new track is commissioned and the Commissioner of Railway Safety inspects it and gives the green signal for train operation, the third line will be opened. Mr. Elumalai said the Commissioner of Railway Safety had completed the inspection of the new tracks in the Guduvanchery-Singaperumal Koil and Singaperumal Koil-Chengalpattu sections on March 3 this year and September 29 last year. The cost of the third line was Rs. 60.54 crore. The need for suburban train services arises from the boom in the housing sector beyond Tambaram (though it remains the transport hub). The presence of several information technology companies, factories and Mahindra World City means affordable public transport is required. J. Ranganathan, secretary, Kancheepuram-Chennai Rail Commuters’ Association, said the third line would help in mass movement of thousands of commuters and easing congestion at the Tambaram station, which was running to its capacity. The third line would also help to make Chengalpattu a railway terminal from where some long-distance trains can be operated, as it is being done in Tambaram, thus giving a breathing space to the Egmore station from where almost all the long-distance trains bound for the south parts of Tamil Nadu are being operated. Sensing the need for improving amenities because of the likely increase in passengers with the operation of more suburban and long-distance services, Southern Railway has fitted the Chengalpattu station with modern amenities such as a multi-level two-wheeler parking lot, new street lights and battery-operated cars at the station. The station has recently commissioned an overhead equipment depot, an electronic interlocking system and a train protection and warning system. The third line is part of the doubling, along with electrification, from Chengalpattu to Villupuram (103 km). The cost was initially pegged at Rs. 132 crore. However, it was increased to accommodate modifications, and an outlay of Rs. 340 crore was fixed. The Commercial Department of Southern Railway has put the number of commuters in the Chengalpattu-Tambaram section at 50,000. But it expects the number to double once more suburban services are operated.  The work on 10 km from Guduvanchery to Tambaram is progressing well, and will be completed by this month-end A.

We wholeheartedly and unanimously welcome it,” Mr. Panneerselvam said in the presence of the Leader of the Opposition, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, and AIADMK whip S.P. Velumani (Thondamuthur). PMK floor leader G.K. Mani (Pennagaram) welcomed the plan, saying, “one cannot separate the life of Kalaignar from that of Tamil, Tamils and Tamil Nadu.” Though there were many leaders, only a few will remain etched in history, Mr. Mani added. Welcoming the announcement, BJP floor leader Nainar Nagendran (Tirunelveli) said Karunanidhi was on the list of the greatest leaders of the country. Speaker M.

Nehru informed the State Assembly on Tuesday. Joining a debate with AIADMK whip S.P.

There were about 500 lakes around the city, which were not being used for irrigation, and the government was planning to store rainwater in them and use them for future consumption. “Some of them are under the control of the Public Works Department and some others are under the Greater Chennai Corporation. We will deepen them and use them for storing water,” he said. The Minister also pointed out that the Centre was yet to announce the projects under the Jal Jeevan Mission and once they were announced, the State government would insist on water supply for all. He also said the State government was preparing a detailed project report for water projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plans-on-anvil-to-use-500-lakes-in-city-for-storing-water-minister/article36091167.ece

25 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Commuters in the lurch in the absence of parking contractor||Thousands of commuters find it tough to park their vehicles safely at the parking yard on the eastern side of the Tambaram railway station. With Tambaram becoming a transport hub for those visiting the city from the other parts of Tamil Nadu for official and personal work, the two parking yards of the station overflow with vehicles. After the lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 was announced and the suburban train services were stopped, the parking yards remained inactive. The parking contractors and workers vacated from the yards. However, as the Tamil Nadu government has allowed all commercial activities and all modes of public transport, there has been a huge demand for suburban train services (the cheapest public transport facility). The success of the suburban train services depends, in part, on the availability of parking space. The parking yard on the eastern side of the Tambaram station was more spacious than the one on the western side. However, thousands of commuters find it difficult to park their vehicles safely in the yard on the eastern side because of the absence of the parking contractor. R. Selvam, a resident of Rajakilpakkam and a regular commuter, said several vehicles, especially two-wheelers, had been stolen from the parking yard in the past few months as there was no one to guard the yard. Personnel of the Railway Protection Force visited the yard occasionally, but vehicles were being stolen in bunches, he said, urging Southern Railway to appoint a contractor immediately. A senior official of Southern Railway said the tender for appointing a contractor for the parking yard on the eastern side of the station was finalised and a contract was awarded for two years. The letter of acceptance was issued last week, and the contractor would start working by this month-end.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/commuters-in-the-lurch-in-the-absence-of-parking-contractor/article36091172.ece

Raghavan on Tuesday resigned from his post, following a ‘sting operation’ purporting to show him in a sleazy video call with a female party member. The video was recorded and uploaded on YouTube by a party member and YouTuber, Madhan Ravichandran, in the morning. Mr. Ravichandran said he had such sting videos of at least 15 more BJP leaders in the State. He said that when he approached BJP president K. Annamalai with Mr. Raghavan’s video, Mr. Annamalai asked him to go ahead and release it in the interest of providing justice to the woman, a screenshot of which was shared as part of the sting operation. The Hindu could not independently verify the veracity of the conversation. Announcing his resignation on Facebook and Twitter, Mr. Raghavan said the people of Tamil Nadu and those around him knew who he was. “For 30 years, I have worked [for the party] without seeking benefits. I came to know of a video about me in the morning. It has been done with an intent to malign me and the party,” he said. He said he held consultations with Mr. Annamalai after the video was released. “I deny the allegations. I will face it legally...,” he said. The BJP president announced that a committee, headed by State secretary Malarkodi, would probe the charges. While Mr. Ravichandran’s video showed a screenshot of the purported WhatsApp conversation with Mr. Annamalai, in which the latter is asking him to release the video if he wanted justice for the woman, he said in his statement that Mr. Ravichandran had not showed him any video. He said he had asked the YouTuber twice for the video but was not provided the same. He said Mr. Ravichandran’s claim that he had such videos of 15 other leaders raised doubts over his motives.

25 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||No useful purpose in conducting trial against Senthil Balaji: HC||The Madras High Court has held that no useful purpose will be served in conducting trial in a 2014 job racket case against Electricity Minister V. Senthil Balaji since all 13 victims had compromised the issue and wanted the case to be quashed. The case pertained to alleged irregularities in recruitment when Mr. Senthil Balaji was Transport Minister in the erstwhile AIADMK government headed by Jayalalithaa. Justice M. Nirmal Kumar quashed the case against the Minister, his brother Ashok Kumar, personal assistant Shanmugam and Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) employee Rajkumar after the victims appeared before court and said the matter had been settled. In a judgement delivered on July 30, but available in public domain only now, the judge said the Minister and his brother were not directly involved in collection of Rs. 40 lakh which had been paid only to other accused. However, in 2019, the victims reportedly got back their money. Though only Shanmugam had filed a petition to quash the proceedings on the basis of the compromise reached with the victims, the judge quashed the entire proceedings pending before a special court for trying cases booked against the past and present legislators. K. Arulmani, a technical staff with the MTC, had lodged the complaint in 2018 stating that he collected Rs. 40 lakh from the 13 individuals and paid it to the accused after they promised to secure driver and conductor jobs when Mr. Balaji was Transport Minister in 2014. Claiming that they got neither jobs nor the money back, he claimed to have taken four years to lodge the complaint because the accused was a Minister. On the other hand, the quash petitioner claimed that the complaint was lodged after the Minister left the AIADMK and joined the DMK. It was also claimed that the petitioner was actually running a manpower agency and that the money was collected towards consultation charges for securing jobs if the applicants fulfil required eligibility. However, they were not eligible and hence they could not get the jobs. Though the money was repaid in 2019 and all 13 victims were not interested in prosecuting the case, the police went ahead and filed a charge sheet due to political reasons, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-useful-purpose-in-conducting-trial-against-senthil-balaji-hc/article36091293.ece

Appearing before Justice M. Nirmal Kumar, Advocate-General R. Shunmugasundaram and State public prosecutor Hasan Mohammed Jinnah said the police had now received certain confidential information. Further investigation was absolutely necessary as there was an attempt to screen evidence in a serious case related to a murder and robbery on the premises of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. The SPP also informed the court that personnel attached to the Sholurmattam police station in the Kothagiri circle of the Nilgiris district had issued summons to the wife and brother of C. Kanagaraj, the prime accused who died in an accident, and called them for inquiry after three days. He stated that no prejudice would be caused to the present petitioner, “Anubhav” Ravi alias N. Ravi of the AIADMK’s Amma Makkal Peravai, in appearing before the police, along with his lawyer, in response to police summons and answering a questionnaire. On his part, the A-G assured the court that the investigating agency was interested only in unravelling the truth behind the murder and its intention was not to harass or defame anyone. Answering a question from the judge, he said the police would require only eight weeks to wind up the further investigation. However, senior counsel I. Subramanian and A.L. Somayaji, representing the petitioner, referred to a Supreme Court verdict and said even the trial court could not grant permission for further investigation after commencement of trial.

25 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Spurious fuel can damage vehicles: IOCL||State-level coordinator for the oil industry and Executive Director of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. P. Jayadevan has said that spurious automotive fuel sold as biodiesel can damage vehicles and pollute the environment. “It has recently been observed that some suppliers of an automotive fuel of dubious quality, purported to be ‘BioDiesel’ are mushrooming in the market and are involved in clandestine marketing of this spurious product. Such suppliers are stealthily operating out of covered nondescript godowns without name boards,” he said. Genuine biodiesel with specifications of BIS 15607/2016 (B-100) can be marketed only with the approval of the State government. The premises selling biodiesel should have valid statutory licences meeting Class B petroleum safety standards. In markets like Salem, Namakkal, Sankari, Tuticorin, Erode and Coimbatore, the unauthorised sales of this spurious product had been polluting the environment and damaging vehicles, Mr. Jayadevan said. Meanwhile, Namakkal Lorry Owners’ Association has said that it would seek licence to sell biodiesel since its members were demanding it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/spurious-fuel-can-damage-vehicles-iocl/article36091204.ece

Paarivendhar, the founder of SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST). On the occasion, the Dr. T.R. Paarivendhar Scholarship was given to two meritorious students.

Around 10% of the students in our institutions are already being given scholarships,” Mr. Paarivendhar said. He also wished success to the students who had been selected for the scholarship. C. Muthamizhchelvan, vice-chancellor, SRMIST, said the day marked a new chapter in the history of the SRM Group. Speaking about the career guidance series, he said with the array of options available to pursue higher education, it was natural for students and parents to be confused about what to choose. Crucial role “This is where the webinar series played a crucial role. We also firmly believe that career guidance should be a continuous process, and we have a separate department in our institutions tasked with nurturing young minds,” he said. “The underlying message of this momentous occasion is that nobody deserves to be left behind. Every young mind deserves to dream, and we will provide an avenue for them to chase those dreams,” Prof. Muthamizhchelvan added. Over 1 lakh students had registered for the 15-part webinar series held over the last few months, which gave students and their parents the opportunity to engage with experts across various streams. The series was moderated by experts from The Hindu ’s editorial team. “Our purpose was to enable students to make the right career choices and to improve access to education for students who are not able to afford it. Available on YouTube The webinars covered a wide gamut of career options, and were made available on YouTube as well for reference and a wider reach,” said L.V. Navaneeth, CEO, The Hindu Group, and added that they hoped to continue these consistent efforts and make an impact.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/srm-university-observes-career-guidance-day/article36091180.ece

Panneerselvam and co-coordinator Edappadi K.Palaniswami to appear before it on September 14 in connection with a defamation case by former party spokesperson Va. Pugazhendi. The case was filed by Mr. Pugazhendhi after his expulsion from the party on June 14. In his petition, he alleged that the news about his expulsion was circulated in electronic, print and social media, and the content of the letter tarnished his reputation among party cadre. He accused the two leaders of committing an offence punishable under sections 499 (Defamation) and 500(Punishment for defamation) of the IPC. He said the imputations were without justifications. In the first week of this month, the court, after taking the complaint on file, had ordered the issuance of summons for their appearance on August 24. When the matter came up on Tuesday before special judge N. Alicia, the counsel for the AIADMK leaders filed petitions seeking to dispense with their personal appearance since they were preoccupied in the Assembly session. The judge then directed the leaders to appear for the next hearing on September 14, and adjourned the matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/court-asks-ops-eps-to-appear-in-defamation-case/article36091158.ece

25 August 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Nanjundapuram STP nearing completion||Finally, the Coimbatore Corporation will complete the Nanjundapuram sewage treatment plant (STP) project by this October. The Corporation had started the project more than 10 years ago under the then Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. It was one of the four sewage treatment plants that the Corporation had proposed while taking up the Rs. 120-crore underground drainage project in the city. Of the four plants, the Corporation dropped one, completed construction in Ukkadam and was proceeding on two other plants, Nanjundapuram and Ondipudur, when a case filed by people living in and around Nanjundapuram stopped the progress. After a legal battle in various fora, the Corporation resumed the project based on recommendation from a team of experts, who had suggested that the Corporation rise the height of compound wall on the north and east of the 6.24- acre plant site, shift a couple of tanks used to store and treat waste, install diesel generators to ensure continuous functioning of the plant and install a system to continuously relay data from the plant to the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. At the time of resuming the project, the Corporation had already invested Rs. 17 crore of the planned Rs. 33.79 crore. And, before restarting the work, the Corporation reassessed the plant and decided that it needed to float a fresh tender as the original contractor was not available, a few of the infrastructure had become redundant and it needed a new contractor to make changes to the plant design, as suggested by the experts. The Corporation then floated a fresh tender for Rs. 43.60 crore and issued work order in 2019 for the plant with a capacity to treat 60 million litres sewage a day. At the time of resuming the project, the Corporation had estimated that it would complete the work by December 2020. But due to delay that included the COVID-19 lockdown, it had to extend the deadline, the Corporation said and added that it had completed the civil work and was engaged in erecting the machinery. By October, it hoped to complete the work for trial run. House service connection Even as it operated the plant on trial basis, the Corporation would start issuing house service connection to around 20,000 residents in Ramanathapuram, Pappanaickenpudur, Avarampalayam, Ganapathy, Gandhipuram and a few other areas, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nanjundapuram-stp-nearing-completion/article36091211.ece

Official sources said the fishermen who had set out in 10 boats cast purse seine nets around five nautical miles off Devanampattinam coast in Cuddalore. On information, a team of officials from Cuddalore, accompanied by the Coastal Security Group police, tried to impound the trawlers and seize the nets. However, another group of fishermen from the Union Territory who were using fibre glass boats formed a cordon, triggering tension. They reportedly threatened the officials and prevented them from discharging their duties. The official team were easily outnumbered and they later issued a stern warning through a public address system to the fishermen to leave the area immediately. A senior official said that most of the big boats were unlicensed and mainly used purse seine nets. “We have taken photographs of the fishermen and will be sharing them with our counterparts in Puducherry to take action against them,” he said. While purse seine fishing was banned in both Tamil Nadu and the Union Territory, fishermen from Puducherry continued the activity saying the authorities had approved it, the official said.

Stalin, said that millets were widely cultivated in the rainfed areas of the hill areas in the district and expressed shock over excluding the district from the scheme. “Since farmers are not getting the right price for their produce, many have moved to alternative crops and are losing their livelihood,” he said. He wanted the district included under the scheme. S. Mohan Kumar, State Committee Member, Communist Party of India, said that increasing the cultivation and marketing of millets would ensure regular income for the people, particularly the tribal community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-include-erode-under-siruthaniya-iyakkam-scheme/article36091347.ece

25 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||B.Com and science courses preferred in arts colleges||As admissions for arts and science colleges in the city are in progress, B.Com continues to be the most preferred course among students applying for undergraduate courses. The American College Principal M. Davamani Christober said, “This year, we received more than 32,000 applications for 3,000 plus seats. More than 4,000 of these applications are for various streams in B.Com like B.Com (Computer Applications), B.Com (Professional Accounting) and B.Com (Information Technology). The demand for such courses is evergreen as plenty of the students end up pursuing CA (Chartered Accountant) course later on.” Courses like B.Sc Computer Science and BCA were next in line when it came to demand. More than 1,000 students had applied for them in the college. A surprising trend that the college had noted was an increase in the number of applicants for B.Sc., Microbiology and B.Sc., Biochemistry, he said, adding, “Maybe due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people are showing interest in such courses.” Principal of Thiagarajar College D. Pandiaraja is also of the opinion that students show a higher interest than usual towards B.Sc Biotechnology and B.Sc Microbiology courses. “This is most likely due to the employment opportunities in laboratories that are increasing due to the COVID-19 situation,” he said. Mr. Pandiaraja further said, “In our college, apart from B.com and B.Sc IT, students usually preferred maths and science departments. Many students opted for B.Sc Mathematics, B.Sc Physics and B.Sc Chemistry. Though the college has been offering B.Sc Psychology for the past six years, this year the demand seemed to be higher. Though it is a self-financed course with a higher fee structure, hundreds of them had applied for it.” Principal and Secretary of Lady Doak College Christianna Singh believes that the general increase in the number of students applying for arts and science colleges is due to the fact that their courses focus on development of specific skill sets. “Employers are not looking for just degrees now, they are looking for individuals with specific skills and a wider exposure. We bring that expertise to students. Also, students prefer 3-year courses as they are valuable and affordable at the same time,” she said. When it came to admission for PG courses, English Literature and Mathematics were the most-wanted courses in the college. Their double-major UG degree in Psychology and Sociology also had a higher demand, Ms. Christianna said. G. Celine Sahaya Mary, Principal, Fatima College, said, “Last year, we received 9,000 plus applications. This year, since the admissions are still going on, it stands at above 8,000. Apart from Commerce, students showed interest towards Chemistry and Computer Science courses.” She, however, said as no board exams were conducted for Class XII and marks were consolidated on the basis of previous performances, many students had scored high marks which might have motivated them to apply for engineering colleges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bcom-and-science-courses-preferred-in-arts-colleges/article36091531.ece

Tasmac employees from the Madurai region, who belonged to Madurai, Dindigul, Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli districts, took part in the protest. The union’s state deputy president M. Maragatha Lingam said, “There are about 1,200 employees under the union, in the region. In the past one to two years, some of the employees who worked at Tasmac outlets were transferred to work for godowns, as a form of punishment for involvement in selling bottles at a price higher than the MRP. The punishment period for this is usually only three months, but, at present, so many of them are still working in the godowns and have not been assigned back to duty in outlets.” They alleged that some punished employees, by bribing and using recommendations, have managed to get transferred to outlets. “Some are stuck in the godown jobs for 1-2 years while some others are back at the outlets in no time, he said. We want all employees who have completed 3 months at the godown to be put back to duty at the outlets,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tasmac-employees-allege-partiality-in-transfers/article36091533.ece

A. Deivakani, wife of N. Annadurai, filed a habeas corpus petition in 2020 claiming that her husband had gone missing. A Division Bench of Justices V. Bharathidasan and J. Nisha Banu sought the response from the CBI after the State told the court that there was no breakthrough in the case. The court directed the Central agency to file a counter affidavit in two weeks. In her petition, Ms. Deivakani said her husband was working with the paramilitary force as a head constable. He was transferred from Gadchiroli in Maharashtra to Chandigarh. She said before reporting to Chandigarh station, he had taken a 20-day leave and visited them in Palayamkottai. On June 29, 2018, he boarded Delhi-bound Thirukkural Express and told them that he would contact them once he reached Delhi. But, he did not contact her and whenever she tried calling him the phone remained switched off, Ms. Deivakani said. She enquired with a CRPF officer in Chandigarh and on July 2, 2018, she received information that her husband’s luggage had reached Delhi. But, she was told that her husband was missing. A few days later she received an anonymous phone call informing her that her husband was safe and he would visit the family soon. The caller refused to give details of her husband’s whereabouts, she said. She said she petitioned the Tirunelveli Collector and the Commissioner of Police. The case was referred to Palayamkottai police. The petitioner sought a direction to police authorities to secure her husband. The CBI was added as a respondent in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-seeks-cbi-response-in-2018-crpf-jawan-missing-case/article36091207.ece

Appreciating that the number of passengers using the airport has doubled to 1.16 lakh in the last one year compared to the previous year, the MPs, however, expressed concern over Madurai Airport being in the list of airports to be privatised by 2023. “The Centre should give up the privatization plan. Or else, Tamil Nadu Government should take over Madurai Airport,” Mr. Venkatesan said. The meeting also appealed to AAI to augment the cold storage capacity at the airport. Renewing the demand for declaring Madurai Airport as an international terminal, Mr. Venkatesan said that MPs of southern districts would impress upon the Centre on this demand during the ensuing winter session of the Parliament.

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice M. Duraiswamy ordered notice to the State government and adjourned the hearing by six weeks. The petitioner, B. Antony of Erayumanthurai, said the land was originally meenavar poramboke . Its classification as fishing harbour went against the welfare of the fishermen. A meenavar poramboke land was for the use of the fishermen and it could not be used for fishing harbour activities . The change in the classification was carried out by the authorities without giving an opportunity to the local fishermen, he said. The petitioner pointed out that Thengaipattanam was located on the eastern side of the village. The government had constructed a fishing harbour at Thengaipattanam. But, as the harbour was not constructed properly, the fishermen faced difficulties. The constructional deficiencies in the harbour led to the death of many fishermen. The occurrence of high tides was not taken into account, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/classification-of-land-is-against-welfare-of-fishermen/article36091314.ece
25 August 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Maintain temples: HC||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has observed that properties of religious institutions, temples in particular, must be maintained properly so as to generate more income to spend for their betterment. The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department had started implementing the same, but at a snail’s pace, said a Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran (since retired) and B. Pugalendhi. The courts had time and again observed that temples in Tamil Nadu were not only sources of identification of the ancient culture, but also testimony to the pride and talent in the field of arts, science, sculpture and a conduit for spiritual activities, the judges said. Taking note of the report submitted by the HR and CE Commissioner, the judges said it appeared that approximately 5.17 lakh acres of immovable properties belonged to temples as per data available. But the extent of available temple properties disclosed was 4.78 lakh acres. This means 39,000 acres of land were in the hands of encroachers. Therefore, the authorities must take steps to maintain temple lands, the judges said. The court was hearing a petition filed by A. Radhakrishnan. The petitioner sought a direction to the authorities to secure and safeguard properties of Sankara Rameswarar and Vaikunda Pathi Perumal Temple in Thoothukudi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/maintain-temples-hc/article36091313.ece

Rangasamy will chair a cabinet meeting on Wednesday to finalise the customary address of the Lt. Governor and Budget speech. “The finance clearance for the draft of the Budget has come and the cabinet will meet on Wednesday to finalise the address of L-G and Budget speech,” a government source told The Hindu . The Chief Minister on Tuesday met Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan to formally invite her. The National Democratic Alliance, led by the All-India NR Congress, had sought approval for presenting a Budget outlay of Rs. 10,100 crore, the source said. “There could be some shortage but the exact amount will be known only after Union Ministry of Home Affairs formally communicates to us. We are expecting an intimation from MHA anytime,” said an official. But the source said the outlay for the current financial year would be substantially higher than the Budget size of Rs. 9,000 for2020-21. The administration had been running on the expenditure sanction given by Parliament for the last five months. In March, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented a vote on account for Rs. 3,934 crore for April-August. Mr. Rangasamy would present his Budget on Thursday evening after Lt. Governor’s address and the election for the post of Deputy Speaker, the source said. The session is expected to last for around 10 days. The AINRC would keep Deputy Speaker's post and Government Whip while its alliance partner BJP would keep the post of Parliamentary Secretary to the Chief Minister. Plea on live telecast Meanwhile, president of the People’s Pulse P. Devanathan wrote a letter to the Assembly Secretary to telecast the proceedings live on social media and also put up a screen near Bharathi Park for the public to watch the proceedings.

25 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Lt. Governor to address Budget session in Tamil||Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Tuesday said that it would be a rare privilege to be delivering her customary address on the opening day of the NDA government’s first Budget session on Thursday in Tamil. Addressing reporters after inspecting the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination programme at the Primary Health Centre in Muthialpet, Ms. Soundararajan said though the Tamil language had always echoed in the Assembly, it would be a historic occasion in the annals of the legislature for the Lt. Governor to be addressing the Budget session in Tamil. “I am extremely happy and privileged at this opportunity to present customary address in the Assembly on August 26 in Tamil, especially after taking the oath of office and administering the oath to others in the mother tongue. This is certainly an unprecedented and historic moment in the annals of the Legislative Assembly,” she said. Ms. Soundararajan, who is also the Governor of Telangana, said she would go to Telangana on Wednesday morning to attend to some important tasks and return in the evening for the Assembly session. She said the Centre had given approval for the Puducherry budget for the fiscal 2021-2022 and added that it would have a bigger allocation of funds than ever before. During her recent meetings in Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah had assured her that a host of development projects would be rolled out for the Union Territory. Both the Prime Minister and Home Minister were all praise for the performance of Puducherry, especially on the vaccination front, she said. The Lt. Governor said so far 7.85 lakh people in the Union Territory had been inoculated and they included 6.18 lakh people who received the first dose against the pandemic and 1.67 lakh completed second dose. The total population of the Union Territory is around 14 lakh and an estimated 10 lakh are eligible to get vaccinated. “We have covered 60% of the people so far under vaccination programme,” she said. Though the Union Territory had set a target of 100% vaccination by August 15, it could not be achieved due to various factors such as lingering vaccine hesitancy. “It is notable that no one had to wait for vaccination due to shortage of vaccines,” she said. The Lt. Governor pointed out that vaccination by adults and senior citizens would benefit not only them but also young children. Puducherry was already geared up to face a possible third wave of the pandemic projected by experts to begin around October, she added. She appealed to everyone who had not yet taken the vaccine to do so. Staff in schools had been instructed to get vaccinated ahead of September 1 when the institutions reopened. “The reason why the reopening of schools was aligned with the decision in Tamil Nadu was because the Union Territory followed the State Board in that State,” Ms. Soundararajan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lt-governor-to-address-budget-session-in-tamil/article36091615.ece
25 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Consolidation of Opposition unity against BJP is certain, says Narayanasamy||Former Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Tuesday said the consolidation of Opposition unity against the Bharatiya Janata Party is certain after some initiatives taken by the Congress party. In a virtual press conference, the former Chief Minister said the unity was borne out by the fact that 19 political parties had come together at a meeting convened by Congress president Sonia Gandhi. “The participation of representatives from 19 political parties, including former Union Minister Sharad Pawar, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, in the August 20 meeting convened by Ms. Gandhi shows that the Opposition parties are united against the BJP,” the senior Congress leader said. The recent initiatives by Ms.Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi showed that there was a united opposition against the BJP, he added. During the recent Parliament session, the parties opposed to the policies of the BJP raised issues such as alleged snooping, fuel price hike, unemployment and undemocratic style of functioning of the government. Criticising the announcement of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman regarding the privatisation of 13 sectors, the former Chief Minister said the Centre had planned to sell the assets of the public sector undertakings to the private sector. The move would render hundreds of people jobless and cripple the economy. Stating that the scheme went against the interest of the country, he said the scheme would favour only big corporate entities such as Reliance and Adani. Mr. Narayanasamy also said he was in favour of a caste-based census.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/consolidation-of-opposition-unity-against-bjp-is-certain-says-narayanasamy/article36091611.ece

25 August 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Clamour for extension of insurance cover to kuruvai paddy gets stronger||Delta farmers have urged the State government to extend insurance cover to kuruvai paddy cultivated on a larger area this season expecting the required support from the government. Opening of Stanley Reservoir for irrigation on scheduled date and execution of desilting and rejuvenation of irrigation network resulted in cultivation of kuruvai paddy on a larger acreage surpassing the target set by Agriculture Department. The announcement and implementation of a kuruvai package imbibed confidence in farmers who felt that they could see through the season positively in spite of hiccups in realisation of water for irrigation in tail-end areas and in other pockets of the delta region. However, the moderate to heavy rain recorded in recent days had caused worries among farmers of realising a good harvest and compliance with moisture content regulation at direct purchase centres. At this juncture, the government’s decision to exclude kuruvai crop from the crop insurance scheme had compounded the problem, said V. Jeevakumar, a progressive farmer from Budalur, who claimed that premium had already been deducted from the loan taken by some farmers. However, the allegation was refuted by bank officials in Thanjavur district. Stating that the compensation or relief amount assured by the State government — if the excluded crop was affected due to natural calamities — from Disaster Relief Fund would be insufficient, Mr. Jeevakumar said and urged the State government to extend the insurance cover for kuruvai paddy also. Expressing a similar view, Sundara Vimalanathan, secretary, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, and G. Srinivasan of Ganapathi Agraharam, a progressive farmer, said that while the scale of finance for paddy cultivation had been fixed at Rs. 34,500 per acre as maximum, pegging the compensation for loss suffered due to natural calamities at Rs. 20,000 per hectare would not be of much help to them. ence, the government should throw open the crop insurance cover to the standing kuruvai crop also.

With the rise in the number of vehicles, there was a need to use the latest techniques in laying of roads. With a little visionary approach, the engineers could bring about a marvel in road engineering. Avoidable curves, sudden turns and twists and major potholes may lead to accidents and claim many lives. The engineers should equip themselves with the latest technologies to avoid laying such roads. He was speaking at a seminar organised to disseminate the features of PM Gramin Sadak Yojana as a part of the 75th Independence Day celebrations in which senior officials from the district rural development agency, technocrats from private and public sector and Block Development Officers and Panchayat Union presidents participated. He told reporters that there are 403 village panchayats in Thoothukudi district and 2,682 village roads. The district has 418 panchayat union roads and 2,264 panchayat roads extending up to 3,022 km. In 2020-21, the district had taken up 14 road projects worth Rs. 30.31 crore and so far, 59 km of road has been laid. He appealed to the BDOs and village presidents and Panchayat Union office-bearers to engage themselves actively in road laying process and its maintenance. Schools to reopen on Sept 1 The Collector said that multi-department teams have been formed in view of reopening of educational institutions on September 1. The authorities should oversee cleaning of class rooms, verandahs, over head tanks and other places in the premises before the children turn up. The School Education Department has been entrusted with the task of ensuring that all the teaching and non-teaching staff members are inoculated. In the event of any individual who failed to take the vaccine for some reason or the other, a special camp would be organised on August 28 across the 12 blocks in the district, he said and asked the teachers to cooperate in making the process complete in a smooth manner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/need-to-lay-better-roads-stressed/article36091329.ece

25 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Move to build two barrages across Cauvery brings cheer||The State government has planned to build two new barrages across the Cauvery river near Mardhur in Karur district and between Nerur in Karur district and Mohanur in Namakkal district. As per the policy note of the Water Resources Department, presented by Minister Duraimurugan on Monday, a barrage is planned to be built across the Cauvery between Marudhur North village in Kulithalai taluk in Karur district and Umaiyalpuram village in Musiri taluk in Tiruchi district. Explaining the rationale behind the plan, the policy note says villages in Musiri and Thuraiyur taluks on the left bank of the Cauvery and villages in Kulithalai taluk on the right bank of the river in Tiruchi district have been facing acute water crisis due to shortage of surface as well as ground water. Hence, it has been proposed to construct a barrage across the Cauvery to store excess flood water, which will otherwise flow into sea during the monsoon, with plans to store about 1 tmc (thousand million cubic feet) of water at the barrage. Ayacuts irrigated by the South bank canal (2,940 acres), the Uyyakondan channel (32,742 acres), New Ayyan channel (1,790 acre), Nangam channel (1,598 acres) and North bank Canal and its branches (5,022 acre), will stand to benefit by the project. Besides, ground water table will also be augmented and drinking water needs of the people in the area will be fulfilled. Administrative sanction has been accorded to take up surveying and levelling operation including sub soil investigation at an estimate of Rs. 23 lakh and investigation work has been completed. The Detailed Project Report has been prepared at an estimate of Rs. 750 crore and is under consideration of the government, the policy note said. Another barrage has also been planned across the Cauvery between Nerur in Manmangalam taluk in Karur district and Mohanur in Namakkal district as villages in the two taluks were facing acute water crisis due to shortage of surface as well as ground water. The barrage will have a capacity to store about 1.06 tmc of excess flood waters. About 6,680 acres of ayacut under Nerur and Kattuputhur channel will benefit through implementation of the scheme. Administrative sanction has been accorded for surveying and levelling operation, including sub soil investigation, at an estimate of Rs. 23 lakh and investigations have been completed. This project will also cost about Rs. 700 crore as per the DPR which is under the consideration of the government. The announcements have brought cheer to farmers of the region. Minister for Electricity V. Senthil Balaji, who represents Karur, distributed sweets to the public to celebrate the announcement. “The plan to construct two barrages across the Cauvery in Karur district is a welcome move as it would help farmers and also recharge ground water in the region,” said Koundampatti R. Subramanian, deputy secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/move-to-build-two-barrages-across-cauvery-brings-cheer/article36091309.ece
25 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||‘MGR Bungalow’ languishes in neglect||Two rusted iron gates swing inward on to a rough sloping track, opening out to what would once have been an imposing view of a stately country residence set in a tree-lined estate. A. Arumugham, the watchman, is hanging up his laundry, casting a wary eye on the phone-fixated children seated on a fallen log near the parapet, while cuckoos and crows hold a singing contest. This is what is known locally as ‘MGR Bangala’, though many residents cannot seem to direct visitors to the spot when asked. Built on the banks of the Kudamurutti on the road that leads on to Vayalur in Tiruchi, the estate was bought by former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and founder of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), M.G. Ramachandran (1917-1987), in 1984 reportedly for Rs. 4 lakh. But Mr. Ramachandran’s prolonged illness in 1984 made it impossible for the leader to spend his retirement years on the verdant estate. Thirty-four years later, the property has become a sad shadow of its former edifice, frequented by stray cattle, litterbugs and liquor drinkers partying on the sly. 33 years as watchman Mr. Arumugham, who will soon be starting his 33rd year as the watchman of the derelict estate, is among the few people holding on to the memory of a bygone era. “I was 37 years old when I joined duty in 1989; I will be 69 in a few weeks. Safeguarding MGR Bungalow has been my only job all these years,” he told The Hindu . The spry watchman walks easily through the grounds, crowded with thorn trees and a dense undergrowth of grass and weeds. Here and there, frond-less coconut palms rear up, sentinels of an invisible corridor. “We used to harvest at least 2,000 coconuts regularly in the 1990s,” said Mr. Arumugham. “But it all stopped when a drought struck these parts for five to six years. Now, the coconut palms have dried out,” he rued. The watchman and his family were allowed to use the ground floor when their own living quarters became decrepit. “Luckily the flooring is coated with red oxide, so these rooms are quite cool in the summer,” said Mr. Arumugham. While snakes and rats are known to root around on the ground floor, monkeys have ripped out many of the clay tiles on the roofs, leaving them open to the elements. “I have locked up the hall doors because the walls are beginning to crumble and are a safety hazard,” he said. The first floor is in bad shape, with some rooms completely overgrown with wild plants. “This was meant to be a grand balcony for MGR Ayya to greet the public. These shelves would have held files,” said Mr. Arumugham, as he cleared some fallen leaves from the hall. A number of outbuildings, including a guest wing, a mini bio-gas plant for the kitchen and a suite of toilet facilities, can be seen from the vantage point of the external staircase. “This is a beautiful estate, but it needs urgent refurbishment, and a fence to keep encroachers out. This would be the best way to honour MGR Ayya ’s memory,” said Mr. Arumugham.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mgr-bungalow-languishes-in-neglect/article36091302.ece

25 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||IIIT-Tiruchi sets its sights on establishing incubation centre||The Indian Institute of Information Technology - Tiruchi (IIIT-Tiruchi) has on its agenda establishment of an incubation centre on its permanent campus in Sethurapatti. A Gujarat-based IT company is in talks with the institute for initiating its development centre on the campus. The institute, according to its Director N.V.S. Narasimha Sarma, is looking forward to creating an ideal eco-system for start-ups in the campus involving industries. The utility of ample space on the campus on a 56-acre expanse will be optimised, Mr. Sarma said. Industry partners Having industry partners as stake-holders will stand the institution in good stead to establish a vibrant incubation centre, the faculty believe. The industry partners of IIIT-Tiruchi include Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS), Infosys, Ramco Systems, ELCOT, and Navitas (TAKE Solutions). Policy makers have recommended that incubation cum technology commercialisation unit (ITCU) in higher educational institutions must be a separate entity preferably registered under Section-8 of Company Act 2013 or a society registered under the Society Registration Act with independent governance structure. This is to allow more freedom to Incubators in decision-making with less administrative hassles for executing programmes related to innovation, IPR and Startups. Moreover, they will have better accountability towards investors supporting the incubation facility.  Kottayam model IIIT-Kottayam in Kerala has already started one such incubation centre: AIC (An Incubation Centre) IIITKottayam Foundation, as a non-profit Section 8 company, sanctioned under the Atal Innovation Mission scheme of the Union government. The centre’s focus is to increase the utility of technology relating to IoT and Cloud solutions for societal benefits. The product prototype is to be initially designed with a 3D printer, the software prototype is to be designed at the computing space available at AIC-IIITKottayam and the real implementation will follow at the hardware level. Earlier this year, the Ministry of Education, Innovation Cell, called for online nominations of senior faculty from higher educational institutions for adoption and implementation of National Innovation and Start-up Policy. NISP 2021 encourages students and faculty to work on new ideas and convert them into successful enterprises by promoting initiatives like Boot up camps, competitions and workshops on capacity building. The MOE's Innovation Cell has created a dynamic NISP portal for HEIs (https://nisp.mic.gov.in) to facilitate knowledge and resource exchange.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/iiit-tiruchi-sets-its-sights-on-establishing-incubation-centre/article36091672.ece

25 August 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||BJP fields 56 candidates, Congress 49 for Belagavi Corporation polls||Elections to the Belagavi City Corporation council, being fought on party ticket for the first time, have turned on the heat among political parties, candidates and their supporters. Polling is scheduled on September 3. As many as 519 candidates have filed nomination papers for the 58 wards in the city, an average of nine nominees per ward. No party, however, has been able to field candidates in every ward. While the BJP chose 58 candidates, it could not get the symbol in two wards due to delay on the part of the party to submit the requisite documents. Now, the BJP has 56 candidates, the Congress has 49, the AAP has 28, the Janata Dal(S) 12 and the AIMIM has fielded its nominees in six wards. Independents form the highest number of candidates at 364. The Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti does not have a fixed symbol as it is not a recognised party. Its nominees file nomination papers as independents. There were some disappointed candidates in the BJP and the Congress. Some women members who were denied ticket went to the office of MP Mangala Angadi and expressed their displeasure. They vowed to write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party leaders Amit Shah and J.P. Nadda that local leaders had given ticket to some who were not even primary members of the BJP. Minister Umesh Katti and Member of Legislative Assembly Abhay Patil played down the discontent saying that it was natural before any election. “However, we are talking to all those who are not very happy and making them work for the official candidates,’’ he said. KPCC working president Satish Jarkiholi said that the Congress will sweep the polls. He admitted that there was some discontent among some local leaders who could not get ticket in their preferred wards. “But that is normal in a democracy. We will work to bring all of them together,” he said. The police took out a route march in some vulnerable areas on Tuesday, as a confidence building measure among the residents. A team led by Deputy Commissioner of Police Vikram Amathe led the route march in the old city area from Chavat Galli to Kacheri Road. There are 47 vulnerable areas in the city. They will be covered in due course, he said. Meanwhile, District Electoral Officer and Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath said that polling will end by 6 p.m. as polling hours have been extended by an hour. This applies to the corporation and the vacant wards of Raibag and Saundatti Yallamma. Two senior officers have been appointed as observers for the polls. Special Deputy Commissioner Geeta Koulagi has been appointed as observer for wards 1-29. Her mobile number is 9448933533. Joint Director of Agriculture Jilani Mokashi has been appointed as observer for wards 30-58.

Layout police cracked the murder of an elderly couple and arrested four persons, including a former tenant, who killed the couple with the intention of looting their valuables on Varamahalakshmi festival on Friday. The accused, identified as Narayanaswamy, 48, from Hindupur was a tenant and had vacated the house a few years ago .However, he used to visit the couple once in a while to check on them. Kantharaju, a mechanic with BMTC, was living with his wife Premalatha in a two storey house in Kashinagar after retirement. The couple had no children and had rented out portions of the house. Investigations found that Narayanaswamy, who owns a petty shop, had financial troubles and had borrowed Rs. 3 lakh. As he could not repay the same, he hatched a plan to kill the couple and rob their gold. As per the plan, he visited them in the second week of August and learned that they were going to attend the wedding of a relative. He roped in his associates — Ramaswamy, Asif and Gangadhar — and visited the couple on Friday, attacked and killed them, and made away with valuables and cash of Rs. 2,000 .Footage from 300 CCTV cameras, and questioning of over 100 people led the police to Narayanaswamy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/four-arrested-for-killing-elderly-couple/article36091110.ece
25 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Metro work to impact bus lane between Iblur and Silk Board||With Namma Metro work on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) under way, allowing other vehicles on the Bus Priority Lane (BPL) between Silk Board to Iblur will become inevitable. However, on the rest of the ORR - from Iblur to Lowry School - city buses will continue to use the lane. The Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) is studying the impact of metro work on the movement of traffic on the 19 km stretch of the ORR by involving stakeholders like BMTC, BMRCL, the Traffic police and the BBMP. Commissioner of DULT V. Manjula said that from Silk Board to Iblur, due to the narrow stretch, the construction of piers will impact the BPL. She said that on a stretch of 5 km, DULT is contemplating allowing other types of vehicles, including passenger ones, private buses carrying company employees, and cars on the BPL. Allowing other types of vehicles on BPL may be required for a period of four to five months. BMRCL is barricading 8.7 meters of land on the median of the road. However, she added, “From Iblur to Lowry School, there are absolutely no issues. Buses will using BPL and mixed traffic will use other lanes on this stretch.” The DULT asked the BMRCL not to take up construction at one go; instead it has been asked to construct piers on the median and then take up construction of metro stations. As per the plan, the BMRCL will build more than 700 piers on the stretch from Silk Board to K.R. Puram. Ms. Manjula said that the BMRCL is building the stations at seven to eight locations between Iblur and Lowry School. In those locations, temporary changes will be made to make the BPL functional and everything will be reinstated after the completion of the work. To decongest the road, the DULT has asked the companies located on the ORR to arrange for buses for transportation of employees and discourage use of personal cars. The BMTC has been asked to run buses with higher frequency. She also maintained that the cycle lane located on the ORR will not get impacted by metro work. Incidentally, recently, E.V. Ramana Reddy, Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Electronics, IT&BT, issued an advisory from the State government asking IT companies, especially those located on ORR, to extend the work-from-home option for most of the employees till December, 2022. “The metro work has begun on the median of the ORR. On some stretches, there will be an impact on the movement of vehicles. At present, only buses are being allowed to ply on the priority lane. Allowing autorickshaws and taxis would help in the easy flow of traffic wherever there is constraint.” said Joint Commissioner (traffic) B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda. He also said that local traffic police are working on traffic diversion to facilitate the metro work. The metro construction will create bottlenecks near the flyover. BMRCL has been asked to provide marshals to man traffic on the stretch to work along with the traffic police. Commuters divided Ravishankar P., a commuter, said, “It is high time the BPL should be allowed for other vehicles so that bikes and cars can move on the other lanes. The authorities concerned should come out with a comprehensive plan before the large-scale constructions happen on this busy stretch.” On the other hand, many also say allowing other types of vehicles on BPL will defeat the purpose of building the lane. Vijaykumar, who regularly uses city buses on the stretch, said, “The BMTC must increase the frequency of the buses so that more people shift to public transport. During the construction of the road, the BMRCL should make sure that roads are maintained in good condition.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/metro-work-to-impact-bus-lane-between-iblur-and-silk-board/article36091115.ece
25 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Students and colleges unable to open new admission portal||A day after the State government launched the Unified University and College Management System (UUCM), college managements and students were left perplexed as they were unable to open the portal to complete the admission for academic year 2021-22. All admission processes will have to be done on the lines of the National Education Policy (NEP), and Karnataka became the first state to launch it on Monday. No response Degree college managements said they made frantic calls to their respective universities, the technical helpline for UUCM related queries, but have not got any response. Many college managements have been flooded with applications which are more than two to three times the number of seats available. The number of applications for degree colleges increased as all II PU students were deemed as pass and the examinations were cancelled. Although the second year pre-university (PU) results were announced on July 20, the admission process has not started more than a month later. The admissions were supposed to begin on August 4, but were postponed due to technical glitches in the portal. The principal of a city-based government first grade college said they were unable to log in to the UUCM’s admission module. For the time being, a government college lecturer said, details of students have been collected by colleges, which would later be uploaded by the managements. “We have received applications one-and-a-half times the number of seats. The manual for conducting admission on this portal states that after principals verify the application, a student’s registration number is generated and is allotted seats. After that, the university needs to approve the admission,” said the principal The colleges have time to complete admissions till September end and classes are scheduled to commence in October. Process tweaked The Higher Education department has now decided to tweak the admission process. P. Pradeep, Commissioner, Department of Collegiate and Technical Education said, that as this is the first year that they are implementing this admission process, college managements will be asked to conduct the admission process as conducted in the past years and they will have to enter details of students and get their admissions approved by the respective university. Sources in the department said that they had decided to tweak the admission process as many colleges had already completed it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/students-and-colleges-unable-to-open-new-admission-portal/article36091120.ece
25 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Despite decline, active COVID-19 cases hover around 20,000||With a steady decline in the number of new COVID-19 cases in the State, active cases too have plummeted significantly, going below the 25,000 mark in the past one month. However, they have stagnated and are hovering around 20,000 since August 10, despite a robust recovery rate of 98%. As on Tuesday, the number of active cases reduced marginally and fell below the 20,000 mark. Of the 19,784 active cases, 7,582 were from Bengaluru Urban. The State has been consistently reporting around 2,000 new cases and around 1,500 recoveries since July 10. From 2,62,162 active cases on April 25, the number crossed four lakh and touched 4,05,068 on May 1, registering an over three-fold rise from the highest active cases (1,20,270) reported in October 2020, during the first wave of infections. In mid-May, the State’s activecaseload peaked and exploded beyond expectations, touching 6,05,494. However, the number of cases started falling after that and had reduced by nearly half by May 31. By June 30, it plummeted to 76,505, before further dipping by half by July 15. Thereafter, it reduced and has been hovering around22,000 since July 27. Inaccuracies While the dip in active cases is an encouraging sign and it is important that the State sustains the same momentum, sources say that the number of active cases as reported in the media bulletin may not be accurate. “There are some reporting issues and we have found that some districts report discharges late. Also, many hospitals do not follow the discharge and home isolation guidelines properly. Sometimes, although mildly infected persons are released from home isolation, the number is not shown. Many hospitalised cases take a long time to recover. The number has stagnated because of all this,” a source said. M.K. Sudarshan, chairman of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said it is important that hospital discharge and home isolation protocols are strictly followed. TAC member Giridhar R. Babu, who also heads Lifecourse Epidemiology at the Indian Institute of Public Health in Bengaluru, said that case detection is a reflection of how good the surveillance system is. “If this system is functional and effective, this is how things will continue — cases detected at a minimum endemic level,” he said. “As long as we detect cases, it suggests that the sensitivity to pick up ongoing circulation is there. I would be worried about places where thereare no cases.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/despite-decline-active-covid-19-cases-hover-around-20000/article36091133.ece
25 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Half of the schools have not reopened||About half of the high schools have not reopened for physical classes for students. According to the Department of Public Instruction’s data, out of 14,956 high schools across the State that were set to reopen, only 7,447 schools reopened and have keyed in data of their attendance. The department has said that 50.21 % of the schools have not started. Classes IX, X, and second year pre-university classes reopened on Monday after a gap of more than five months.

While most of the government and budget private schools have reopened, many top central board schools in urban areas did not reopen as parents have decided against giving consent for their children to attend physical classes. A section of parents have said that they would send their children to school only once their children are vaccinated. In five districts, Chikkamagaluru, Kodagu, Hassan, Udupi, and Dakshina Kannada, schools did not reopen as the test positivity rate was not less than 2 % a few days ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/half-of-the-schools-have-not-reopened/article36091121.ece

A Division bench, comprising Justice B.V. Nagarathna and Justice P. Krishna Bhat issued direction, while hearing a PIL petition filed by A.A. Sanjeev Narrain and two others last year seeking direction to ensure continuity of education to the children through online mode. Expressing dissatisfaction on the government’s submission that textbooks would be supplied in phased manner by the end of September, the Bench said that opening of schools or commencing of classes, and supply of textbooks to the students should go hand-in-hand. The Bench also directed the government to ensure that textbooks of classes XI and XII be made available in the open market as classes have already started. Meanwhile, the Bench orally asked the government that education officers at taluk level should ensure that textbooks as pdfs can be sent to the students with access to electronic gadgets and efforts to be made to provide printout of pdf copies to those without access. The Bench adjourned further hearing till August 30 while directing the government to submit status report on the textbooks supplied to the government and aided schools till then. On the issue of supplying electronic gadgets, the government has said that certain sections of the students were provided with the gadgets through private organisations, and the Bench said that it would consider this issue during next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/conducting-classes-without-textbooks-is-meaningless-hc/article36091119.ece

Anand Singh, who was dissatisfied with the “low-profile” portfolios allotted to him, on Tuesday assumed charge of the departments of Environment, Ecology and Tourism, following assurance from Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai that he would look into his demand for a “better portfolio”. Mr. Singh had been sulking ever since the portfolios of Environment, Ecology and Tourism were allocated to him on August 7. He skipped the Cabinet meeting held last Thursday. In what was seen as “blackmail” politics, Mr. Singh had, earlier this month, shut his MLA’s office at Hosapete. He had also hinted on August 11 that he might resign. He deferred his plans of resigning following a meeting with Mr. Bommai, Revenue Minister R. Ashok, and MLA for Shorapur Raju Gouda. He had also met State BJP strongman and former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. “I have brought to the notice of the party State president my appeals and discussed with him a few things. He asked me to first take charge of the portfolios I have been allotted and begin work, and said that my appeals would be considered and necessary action taken,” Mr. Singh said. Before taking charge, he said, “On the assurance that my appeals will be considered and soon a solution will be found to my issues, abiding by the directions of the party and the Chief Minister, I have come to assume office.” Earlier in the day, Mr. Singh met Mr. Bommai and BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel. A four-time MLA, he was among the 17 legislators who quit theCongress-JD(S) coalition and joined the BJP in 2019. Following his demand, the Yediyurappa government carved out the new Vijayanagara district out ofBallari district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sulking-minister-assumes-charge/article36091137.ece
25 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC terms 18-year delay in allotting site to former cricketer ‘shocking’||The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday termed as ‘shocking’ the ‘lame excuse’ of a misplaced file cited by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) for 18 years of delay in allotting a site to former cricketer Smitha Harikrishna and demanding a whopping Rs. 77.22 lakh from her as against the price at which BDA allotted sites to a few other sportspersons, whose names were chosen by BDA in its 2008 resolution along with her name. A Division Bench comprising Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum made these observations while rejecting an appeal filed by the BDA challenging a single judge’s order of October 2020. The single judge order had set aside the demand of Rs. 77.22 lakh made by the BDA after allotting her a site in March 2020 while directing the authority to collect only the price that was prevailing in 2008. It also directed the authority to allot her a site of dimension of 50 ft x 80 ft as was allotted to other persons along with her, as per a resolution passed by the BDA in February 2008, and consider allotting in a well-developed layout, on the lines of sites allotted to others, and at the price prevailing in 2008. Stating that the BDA could not have asked her to pay an exorbitant price for its lapse of misplacing the file, the Division Bench said that it had no reason to interfere in the earlier order. During the pendency of this appeal, the BDA had executed a lease-cum-sale deed in her favour for a price of Rs. 7.79 lakh after she filed a contempt of court petition against BDA for not registering sale deed within two months as directed by the single bench. In the sale deed, the BDA had incorporated a condition that the execution of deed was subject to outcome of the appeal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-terms-18-year-delay-in-allotting-site-to-former-cricketer-shocking/article36091112.ece

A Division Bench comprising Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum issued the directions while disposing of a PIL petition by Samaja Parivarthana Samithi, Bengaluru, complaining about illegal quarrying and stone crushing activities in areas close to the reservoir.

25 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Groups call for repeal of anti-cow slaughter law||Ahead of the legislature session, the first after Basavaraj Bommai took over as Chief Minister, a host of organisations have demanded repeal of the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Act, 2020, passed in February 2021. Organisations of Dalits, minorities, farmers, and nutrition experts, at a press conference on Tuesday, came down heavily on the law and argued that it had adversely impacted food rights, nutrition, and livelihoods in an already stressed situation due to the pandemic in the State.“We could not protest the passage of this regressive Bill because of the raging second wave of the pandemic,” said Mohanraj of Dalit Sangharsha Samiti (Bheemavada). Karnataka Rajya Raita Sangha is set to hold a protest against the law next week. The law has imposed a complete ban on the slaughter of cows, bulls, bullocks, and male and female buffaloes, below the age of 13 and has enhanced penalties and punishments. The Act has hit vulnerable communities who trade in cattle and also consume beef. They also often become targets of vigilante groups, a statement released by a coalition of organisations on Tuesday stated. Taking away a cheap nutritious food such as beef was not scientific, argued public health and nutrition expert Sylvia Karpagam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/groups-call-for-repeal-of-anti-cow-slaughter-law/article36091128.ece
25 August 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Parties should evolve code of conduct for MPs’||Stating that he was saddened by the recent unruly behaviour by some members in Parliament, Rajya Sabha Chairman andVice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday suggested that political parties should evolve a code of conduct for their members both inside Parliament and in public life. “Such a code of conduct should be made public in the form of an affidavit so that people can observe whether the party members are sticking to it or not,” Mr. Naidu said in an informal interaction with mediapersons at the Raj Bhavan here. He described the behaviour of some members in the Rajya Sabha as “a new low” in Parliament. “Some members threw the rule book on the Deputy Chairman. Some even climbed the table and started dancing. They have got their act video recorded through mobile phones and circulated it,” he said. Public opinion about politicians was going down because of such a behaviour, he observed. At the same time, he took exception to some people generalising the unruly behaviour by saying that the entire Parliament was involved in it. “Not even 10% of people are involved in such things,” he said. He suggested that people and the media should analyse the performance of parliamentarians from time to time so that there would be public accountability on the part of members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/parties-should-evolve-code-of-conduct-for-mps/article36091129.ece

25 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Malaria, dengue still a concern||Though there has been a decrease in malaria and dengue cases reported in Mangaluru and other parts of Dakshina Kannada this year, these two and other vector-borne diseases caused by mosquitoes continue to be a cause of concern. From January 1 to July 31, 2021, the district recorded 476 cases of malaria, which is caused by fresh water breading female Anapholes mosquito, against the 700 cases reported during the period in 2020. Of the 476 cases, 384 are of malarial infection from Plasmodium Vivax parasite, while 92 are serious malaria infection caused by Plasmodium Falciparum parasite. Mangaluru taluk leads the list with 436 cases of malaria of which most are from Mangaluru city. District Vector Borne Disease Control Officer Naveenchandra Kulal said that the number of malaria cases reported so far is less than that reported last year. In the case of dengue, which is caused by fresh water breeding Aedes Aegypti mosquito, Dakshina Kannada reported 168 cases from January 1 to August 16, 2021. This is 20% lesser than the cases reported during the same period in 2020. Of the cases reported this year, 51 are from Bantwal taluk, 29 each from Mangaluru and Puttur taluks, 25 from Sullia taluk, 18 from Belthangady and 16 from Manglauru City Corporation area, Dr. Kulal said. Though cases of malaria and dengue are low, Dr. Kulal said, the cause of concern are cases in Maharashtra and Kerala of Zika virus, which is spread by Aedes Aegypti mosquito. “We have intensified our visits for removal of fresh water deposits within houses where this mosquito breeds,” he said. The former senior scientist of National Institute of Malaria Research of Indian Council for Medical Research S.K. Ghosh, who has extensively studied malaria and dengue, said that a drastic reduction in construction activity during the lockdown is among the reasons for the low number of cases. The systematic way of surveillance of dengue and malaria cases in the district in the last couple of years is also yielding result, he added. Mangaluru City Corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar said that the Health Department is using the services of college students to visit houses for tracking and destroying mosquito breeding sites. This is in addition to visits by multi-purpose workers who are also involved in COVID-19 tracking and other municipal duties, he said. Senior physician Srinivas Kakkilaya expressed the need for more community participation in surveillance activities. “People need to be made aware of places where mosquitoes breed and they should be involved in eradicating it. It is difficult for municipal bodies to do this,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/malaria-dengue-still-a-concern/article36091549.ece
25 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Shuchi Mitra to help manage solid waste in Puttur city||With solid waste management posing a challenge to every civic body, Puttur City Municipality has come out with a novel initiative called Shuchi Mitra to make people more involved in managing garbage generated in the city. Under this initiative, two members from civil society in each ward will help the municipality in convincing people of the need to segregate waste at source, not to throw garbage in public places and identify such people who do so, create awareness on Solid Waste Management Rules and enlighten and motivate people to opt for different types of wet waste composting. Commissioner of the municipality Madhu S. Manohar said that the two members who will help the municipality in this will be volunteers from each one of the 31 wards. The municipality will not pay them any honorarium or fee. It has invited applications from such volunteers who should be residents of particular wards. The volunteers will be selected by this month-end and Shuchi Mitra teams will be formed. Once the volunteers are selected, they will be enlightened on the laws related to solid waste management, technologies available for converting wet waste into compost, how to segregate waste and the like. Those volunteers will have to interact with people locally either by meeting or holding meetings under the auspices of the municipality to create awareness on the entire solid waste management process. The volunteers selected can also give suggestions to the municipality on improving solid waste management. Once they mingled with people, they can collect their feedback, identify loopholes and suggest remedial measures. The municipality will take them with a positive spirit to ensure that solid waste management becomes a success. Mr. Manohar said that the details of Shuchi Mitras will be uploaded on the website once the list is ready. The Commissioner said that Puttur city generated between 15 tonnes and 20 tonnes of garbage daily. Segregation of waste at source is yet to pick up fully. The volunteers can file applications by downloading them from the website of the municipality,www.putturciy.mrc.gov.in, or they can collect them from the health section, till Wednesday. The applications will be scrunitised and the volunteers will be selected on August 30 and their names will be announced on the website on August 31. Shuchi Mitras will be issued a badge and a certificate from the municipality. The Commissioner said that the initiative is to make people understand that if solid waste management is to become effective, it needed the cooperation and involvement of all residing in the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/shuchi-mitra-to-help-manage-solid-waste-in-puttur-city/article36091543.ece

25 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Police announce Rs. 5 lakh reward for information on armed gang||The Mysuru city police on Tuesday announced a reward of Rs. 5 lakh for information on armed robbers who looted a jewellery shop in Vidyaranyapuram in the city on Monday and fired and killed a bystander. The police said in a statement that “a reward of Rs. 5 lakh will be given to anyone who gives information leading to arresting the accused”. The details will be kept confidential and the information can be shared on mobile number 94808-02200, the statement added. Different teams comprising 25 officers and 80 staff members have been constituted to pursue the case. Earlier in the day, Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Pratap Reddy arrived in the city to take stock of the law and order situation in Mysuru, a day after four armed robbers looted the jewellery shop. They opened fire on the 24-year-old bystander. Mr. Reddy, who visited Amruth Gold and Silver Palace, also held a meeting with senior police officials including city Police Commissioner Chandragupta, Deputy Commissioners of Police Pradeep Gunti and M.S. Geetha. The police have already released images of the armed miscreants from the CCTV recording in the jewellery shop. The gang entered the shop around 5 p.m. on Monday and pulled down the shutter before assaulting, tying up, and gagging owner Dharmendra, who was alone in the shop. The gangsters then gathered the gold jewellery. Dharmendra’s relative Sharath Chandra Jain, who was near the shop, was surprised to find the shutters down. He rolled up the shutter, which led to panic among the gangsters. One of the robbers fired at Sharath Chandra Jain, but it instead hit Chandru, a youth from Dadadahalli village. The robbers fled the shop. It is not clear whether the gang had a getaway vehicle parked nearby. The police is also gathering images from the CCTVs installed in nearby areas. Fingerprint experts and sniffer dogs were also pressed into service. A case has been registered in the Vidyaranyapuram police station. Chandru was declared brought dead by K.R. Hospital. Dharmendra, who was also taken to the hospital for treatment, is recovering. Mr. Chandragupta said the value of the stolen jewellery is yet to be assessed. The body of Chandru, a construction worker, was handed over to his parents after post-mortem on Tuesday. S.A. Ramdas, MLA, who also visited the shop on Tuesday, said the Chief Minister has agreed to provide a compensation of Rs. 5 lakh to the family of Chandru. He appealed to the police to take steps to bring the guilty to book.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/police-announce-rs-5-lakh-reward-for-information-on-armed-gang/article36091563.ece

25 August 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Renovated swimming pool to open soon||After an inordinate delay, the renovated Raja Kesavadas swimming pool of the Kerala State Sports Council is likely to be opened in November. Pending works Minister for Fisheries, Culture, and Youth Affairs Saji Cherian said the pool would be opened in connection with the ‘Kerala Piravi’ after completing the pending works. Mr. Cherian was inaugurating a reception accorded to National chief athletics coach P. Radhakrishnan Nair and assistant coach M.K. Raj Mohan here on Monday. Although the renovation of the pool near the Lighthouse was completed a year ago, its opening has been delayed after Aquatic Association pointed out some serious defects including a lack of depth at the shallow end of the pool. “The swimming pool was renovated spending a good sum but is nowhere near international standards. The water level at the pool is 80 cm, which is below the minimum recommended level of 1.10 metres. There is every chance that youngsters diving into the pool will get injured. We have suggested increasing the water height by setting up a new overflow facility. We hope our recommendations will be considered and improvements are made before the opening of the pool,” said an official of the Aquatic Association. District Sports Council vice president V.G. Vishnu said that a meeting of the high power committee held to discuss the issues pertaining to the pool had decided to carry out the rectification works, which would be completed before November. The pool was renovated at a cost of Rs. 2.6 crore after remaining in a dilapidated state for more than a decade. It has eight lanes and is expected to give a major boost for practising swimming. The foundation stone for the swimming pool in the name of Raja Kesavadas, the architect of modern-day Alappuzha, was laid in 1995. After its opening in 1997, it became a popular swimming centre having facilities for 60 people to practice at a time. However, six months into its launch, the coach-cum-lifeguard quit as the Sports Council failed to pay him a salary. A fall in the number of students attending classes diminished the revenue. Two youths In 2001, the pool was closed and the Sports Council later handed it over to a private firm on lease. It was again closed in 2006 after two youths lost their lives while swimming in the pool. The decision to reopen the pool was taken following a lack of facilities forcing young and talented swimmers in Alappuzha, Kuttanad, and nearby areas to practice in canals and rivers. Although the renovation of the pool had begun in 2017, the work got delayed on various accounts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/renovated-swimming-pool-to-open-soon/article36091517.ece

There are only a few books regarding the plantation history of Peerumade and the newly released Trailblazers of the Travancore Plantations. Cheers to Unsung Heroes by Ms. Sreenivasan is a reference book. Ms. Sreenivasan did wide research on how the early planters took the challenge to convert Peerumade into the present landscape of tea plantations. Since 1860s It all started in the 1860s when the Maharaja of erstwhile Travancore awarded the Baker family the right to begin the tea plantations in Peerumade. Many British/Scottish planters were part of the evolution of plantations to the present level. Foreword for the book is written by Gouri Parvathi Bayi of the royal family of erstwhile Travancore, who describes her sojourn to Peerumade. Two summer palaces of the rulers of erstwhile Travancore are situated in the place. Ms. Sreenivasan introdues some incidents related to the pioneering planters like Col. Andy Spence, J.A. Richardson, John Hutchison Aspinwall, J.S. Wilkie, William Armstrong and many others. Peerumade Club She weaves the story of the lively Peerumade Club, a meeting place of planters and senior managers, where they unwinded after the day’s hard work. The plantations were then miniature villages with schools, hospitals, tea factories, places of worship, well-stocked shops and resorts and homestays for guests. The author has incorporated the story of the life of the workers when pandemics like Malaria hit them and the development of a well equipped hospital system based at Mundakkayam in the late Raj era. The history of the tea plantation is initially described through the life in the two divisions, Cheenthalar and Lone Tree of the now defunct Peerumade Tea Company. The book is published by Current Books.

25 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||KEIL to treat medical waste from 5 districts||The government has permitted Kerala Enviro Infrastructure Limited (KEIL) at Ambalamedu here to collect and process biomedical waste generated in government and private health-care institutions in five districts — Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Pathanamthitta and Idukki. The Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facility at Ambalamedu was processing the biomedical waste generated in government hospitals in Ernakulam, Malappuram and Pathanamthitta. The company had pointed out that the operation of the plant, having the capacity to treat 16 tonnes daily, was not viable with the reduced quantity of waste obtained from the government health-care institutions in three districts. From Sept. 1 An order issued by the chairman of the State Pollution Control Board on August 13 stated that KEIL would collect and process biomedical waste from Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Pathanamthitta and Idukki from September 1. All government and private health-care institutions in the State have to comply with this order. The biomedical waste generated in government and private health-care institutions in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Thrissur, Malappuram, Palakkad, Wayanad, Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasaragod will be collected and processed at the common facility of the Indian Medical Association Goes Eco Friendly (IMAGE) in Palakkad. The plant managed by IMAGE was the only common facility in the State until KEIL’s plant received the consent to operate on May 11. The data uploaded on the Central Pollution Control Board’s tracking app for COVID-19 biomedical waste showed that the Ambalamedu plant was getting only three to four tonnes of COVID and non-COVID biomedical waste from the government hospitals allocated in Ernakulam, Pathanamthitta and Malappuram. Palakkad facility The Palakkad facility of IMAGE was found to be operating with full capacity and still accumulating waste of around eight tonnes daily. This system of distribution of biomedical waste was resulting in shortage of waste for processing in one unit and accumulation of waste in another unit. Hence, a balance needed to be worked out for the effective management of biomedical waste, according to the order issued on August 13. The Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal had asked the government to examine whether more hospitals could be connected with the KEIL facility.  Palakkad facility of IMAGE was found to be operating with full capacity and still accumulating waste of around eight tonnes daily.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/keil-to-process-biomedical-waste-from-five-districts/article36091468.ece

25 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Malabar rebellion movie projects hit by pandemic||Malayalam cinema projects on the controversial 1921 Malabar rebellion and its leader Variankunnath Kunhamad Haji have been hit by the pandemic-induced economic slowdown. While the financial crisis has forced some of the producers to reconsider investing in the mega film project, the restrictions on assembly of people, too, have affected the filmmaking efforts. As many as four major projects, including one featuring actor Prithviraj as Variankunnan,were announced last year to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the rebellion. The Prithviraj movie announced by filmmaker Ashique Abu had triggered a political controversy with the Sangh Parivar outfits vehemently opposing it. Despite repeated attempts, a response from Mr. Abu could not be obtained.  The Hindu had reported that a sub-committee of the Indian Council for Historical Research had suggested dropping the names of martyrs of the rebellion, including Haji and Ali Musliyar, from the list of Indian freedom fighters. Crowd-funding Ali Akbar, a pro-Sangh Parivar filmmaker, said the shooting of the second schedule of his film, Puzha muthal puzha vare, on the theme,  will begin in the first week of September. The project has already received Rs. 1.30 crore aid through crowd-funding and requires an additional Rs. 1 crore for completion, Mr. Ali said. The shooting of some scenes, involving around 1,000 artistes, could not be carried out due to COVID-19 restrictions. The cinema is likely to be released in December, he added. Waiting for producer Noted filmmaker P.T. Kunjumuhammad is waiting for a producer to take up the sensitive project. The script of the movie has been completed and few actors identified. The financial crisis forced a producer, who had earlier agreed to fund the project, to backtrack. However, the project has not been shelved. A producer with a strong political conviction is needed for such projects, he said. Playwright Ibrahim Vengara also has a script ready and is waiting for a producer for the project.

25 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||PCB moots treating sewage from MCH at stadium facility||The State Pollution Control Board has suggested utilising the sewage treatment plant at the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium at Kaloor to treat the sewage generated at the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Ernakulam. The recommendation has been made as a temporary arrangement till the sewage treatment plant at the hospital turns functional. The hospital had come under the radar of the National Green Tribunal for not having a proper plant to treat the sewage. The board has asked the authorities to complete the augmentation work by August 31. GCDA’s role Senior board officials pointed out that the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) had agreed to treat the sewage generated from the medical college at the plant installed in the stadium. It has a capacity to treat 750 kilo litres of sewage daily. The secretary of the authority told a recent meeting convened by the board that an agreement could be executed with the hospital authorities. Trial run  The cost for processing the waste would be based on the quantity of sewage generated at the hospital. A trial run would be held to check the adequacy of the plant. The board would monitor the plant operation during the trial run period. It would collect samples to check whether the treated sewage conformed to the standards prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board. The board has asked Infrastructure Kerala Ltd (Inkel), entrusted with the construction of the sewage treatment plant in the hospital, to expedite the augmentation work and complete it before August 31. The company authorities said that the work was delayed in view of the pandemic situation. Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), which is supporting the project, had raised some queries related to the structural stability of the tanks. The stability test is complete and the tanks and motors would be installed soon, it said.  The State Pollution Control Board has asked Inkel, entrusted with the construction of the sewage treatment plant in the hospital, to expedite the augmentation work and complete it before August 31||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pcb-moots-treating-sewage-from-mch-at-stadium-facility/article36091467.ece
25 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||U.N. meet to discuss Kerala start-up’s idea||‘Net Sink Credit For Climate Equity’, an idea that aims to give carbon credit to farmers as well as individuals, households, institutions and communities, has been included in the items to be considered for discussion at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) which is scheduled to be held in Glasgow, the U.K., between October 31 and November 12. “The COP26 presidency has recognised the suggestion” on making carbon credit accessible to entities that are now out of the carbon trading network, according to a spokesman for the Kerala-based start-up Equator Geo, which is registered with Kerala Startup Mission. K.D. Prasenan, MLA, said on Tuesday that the idea that carbon credit could be accessible to farmers and smaller communities had been well-received by the State government and, as part of the government’s efforts to encourage start-ups, the idea would be presented before the Union government. The ‘Net Sink Credit’ idea was an ambitious one and could be spread across the country, said Vineeta Hariharan, a national-level policy expert in New Delhi. She said scaling up was needed to spread the idea across India. Trading in carbon credit and monetisation of carbon credit is still at a nascent stage in the country. While there has been significant advances in generation of energy using renewable sources, carbon trading has not picked up momentum. The Net Sink Credit was a good idea that could lead the way, she said. The spokesman for Equator Geo said a pilot study on net carbon emission by a household at Attappady in Palakkad district revealed that the household carbon emission was about six tonnes a year while carbon sequestration was around 450 tonnes. The household, situated in about a hectare of land, and engaged in farming activities without using chemicals, stands to gain from an active carbon trading market because of its capacity to neutralise carbon emissions. Carbon emission is calculated on the basis of the energy consumption by an entity. For instance, electricity and cooking gas consumption, use of vehicles or deployment of fertilizers in fields, etc., are considered. Carbon sequestration is calculated on the basis of the plants and trees in a field and the soil types and their capacity to absorb carbon. The COP26 is expected to finalise the rules for successful implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change called the ‘Paris Rulebook’. One of the major objectives of the Paris Rulebook was to create a robust system of carbon credits, the spokesman added.

25 August 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Row over fee for water lily fete||Even as people continue to throng the polder banks of Malarikkal to view the water lilies in full bloom, the tourism festival organised in connection with the annual season appears to have run into rough weather following protests over the imposition of fee for visitors. The event, which took off on August 14, stipulates a fee of Rs. 30 per head for entering the Malarikkal village, venue of the festival, besides a parking fee of Rs. 50. The organisers have also imposed a fee of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 for wedding and commercial shoots at the flowering locations. The move, however, drew criticism from a section of visitors, who have launched an online campaign questioning the rationale behind the imposition of fee for a mere wayside view of flowers. Criticisms are also being levelled against the fee of Rs. 100, set per head for a boat ride among these flowers, by comparing it with the cost of a boat cruise along Vembanad Lake. As the protests continued to rage, the organisers have decided to withhold the imposition of fees on weekdays. Confirming the decision, K. Anil Kumar, Coordinator of the Meenachil-Meenanthara- Kodoor river re-linking programme, said the visitors would be exempted from the fee only during the lean, weekdays. Crowd control “The fee package, which seeks to regulate the tourists descending on the venue, will be applicable during the weekends and holidays. Of the entry fee of Rs. 30 per head, Rs. 20 goes towards the committees that own these polders while plans are also afoot to develop tourist infrastructure in the village,” he said. According to him, efforts are also in place for making the State government declare Malarikkal as a tourism zone during the flowering season. “This will help us put in place a system for crowd-management as well as revenue sharing model with the farmers as an incentive for not destroying these water lilies using pesticides,” he added. The tourism festival, organised also in association with the District Tourism Promotion Council, Malarikkal Tourism society and the Thiruvarpp panchayat, is being held in about 1,000 acres of paddy fields in the interiors of Malarikkal, where the lily bulbs have begun to bloom since the onset of the monsoon. As many as 120 boats have been made available for ferrying the tourists to the flowering locations here. The permitted time of visit is between 6 a.m and 10 a.m The flowering season in Malarikkal became a rage on social media in 2019 with visitors making a beeline for a walk through the flowers and capture photos. Last year, the flowering locations were made off-limits to non-locals owing to the COVID-19 restrictions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/row-over-fee-for-waterlily-fete/article36091515.ece

Many who sustained serious injuries say that it will double the financial burden on their families and violate their basic right for quality treatment. Family members of some of the survivors said they received an official communication from the Air India Express authorities about the decision to stop the treatment aid which had been covering all eligible persons for over a year. They also complained that the previously announced compensation for the victims and those killed in the crash was delayed for unknown reasons. A close relative of one of the seriously injured passengers said the discontinuation of treatment aid without even granting the eligible compensation would double their financial burden. He also pointed out that the injured persons were even finding it hard to resume their jobs. Some of the relatives also urged State and Union governments to take up the issue and continue the treatment benefits for at least one more year. They said the issue would be taken up with the support of people’s representatives and ministers. One of the main reasons to seek the continuation of treatment aid was that it would not be deducted from the eligible compensation amount. Meanwhile, Air India Express sources said it was part of the usual procedures following all existing legal terms and conditions related to the rights of flight crash victims. They also claimed that the offer letter regarding the compensation had already been sent to all eligible persons, but only 84 persons had accepted it. They said those who accepted the letter would get their compensation amount without any delay. According to official sources, Air India Express has already spent Rs. 7 crore for the treatment of the injured persons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/karipur-flight-crash-survivors-upset-over-withdrawal-of-treatment-aid/article36091449.ece

Satheesh has said that the Syndicate will urge the Lakshadweep Administration to continue its BA (Arabic) course considering the high number of students. In a release on Tuesday, he said that the course was also part of the university's UNESCO chair on regional studies. Mr. Satheesh said it was the education officer, representing the administrator during an online meet on July 12 to renew the tie-up with the university, who sought cancellation of the postgraduate degree courses and BA (Arabic). The officer had said that very few students had been seeking admissions for the PG courses and the pass percentage had been low as well. There were no students in the MA (Arabic) course in 2020-22 academic year. Only nine and two students, respectively, had joined the PG courses in English and Economics. There is only one student in M.Sc.(Maths) and eight in the 12-seat MSc (Aquaculture). Last year, the number of students for English, Economics, and Mathematics were one, three and two, respectively, though all these PG course have 15 seats. The education officer had pointed out that the one student in MA (Arabic) in 2019-21 had failed. There were no students in MSc (Aquaculture) in 2018-20. Only seven students had joined for the M.Com course in 2020-22 though it had 20 seats. The number was 11 in the previous year. The officer claimed that the students prefer to study either in Kerala or anywhere outside the island. Thus, all these courses and undergraduate courses in Arabic and Political Science were proposed to be discontinued. Mr. Satheesh said that it was the Lakshadweep Administration which sought setting up of university study centres, which were established in Kadamat, Kavaratti, and Andrott in 2005. Salary for the staff and the infrastructure is borne out by the island administration. The university’s role is confined to appointment of the staff and conduct of courses and exams. The university cannot overrule the proposal of the administration to discontinue the courses, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/calicut-varsity-puts-the-blame-on-lakshadweep-administration/article36091442.ece

Action committees constituted against the project are also cooperating with mediation attempts.  Consent letters A local body member from Koodaranhi said many landowners village handed over consent letters to Thiruvambady MLA Linto Joseph on Monday. The main reason behind the opposition to the project was the decision of the government to take over wayside properties without any compensation package.

The police deployment has been intensified in areas where local residents had reportedly met them at different times. “The investigation teams have taken up the complaints seriously as the armed men had also raised death threats against me. For us, this is the first experience,” said Chakkittappara panchayat president Sunil Kallunkal. He said the statement of the two local residents whom the armed Maoists met showed that they were very much scared after the incident. Though there were unconfirmed reports earlier from interior areas of Chakkittappara about the visit of Maoists, it was the first time that they approached residents directly, on August 17. They had also taken away groceries from a local shop. In the wake of the latest incidents, the local panchayat called upon the police and the State government to immediately open a police outpost in Chakkittappara to keep an eye on illegal activities and the movement of unknown persons through the forest land. It also pointed out that the Peruvannamuzhi and Koorachundu police stations were finding it difficult to set up a permanent surveillance mechanism in the areas. Noticing an increase in the number of complaints on the presence of Maoists in Kozhikode’s rural areas, there were proposals to build two new police stations — one at Vilangad and another at Kakkayam — nearly five years ago. However, the lack of funds is delaying the project execution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/search-on-for-suspected-maoists-at-chakkittappara/article36091447.ece

Even when the party had considered shaking up the MSF State leadership, the press briefing made by MSF vice president Fathima Thahliya a week ago in Kozhikode backing up the MSF women’s wing called Haritha embarrassed the leaders. A section within the party demanded that disciplinary action be initiated against Ms. Thahliya for speaking to the media even when the leadership had proscribed the MSF and Haritha leaders from doing it. Factional divide Ms. Thahliya’s words supporting the State leadership of the Haritha, which had been frozen by the IUML State committee, brought to the fore the existing factional divide in the MSF. MSF president Ashraf Ali and Ms. Thahliya had distanced themselves from the State leadership led by State president P.K. Navas. A recent report submitted to the party leadership by Mr. Ali in the wake of a meeting of the MSF national and State leaders was being condemned by the State leaders as flawed and ingenuine. MSF leaders said that Mr. Ali had made the report without consulting anyone in the national committee. MSF leadership here alleged that a Kozhikode-based section within the party was planting stories in the media with the purpose of igniting factionalism. Although it has been months since differences emerged between the leaderships of the MSF and the Haritha, it was a recent complaint by the Haritha to the Women’s Commission that brought about a showdown. Sex harassment charges Ten Haritha State committee members, led by general secretary Najma Thabsheera, complained to the Women’s Commission alleging sexual harassment against MSF leaders, including Mr. Navas. A section in the IUML leadership believes that it was a lie made by Ms. Thabsheera that triggered the standoff. The IUML leadership suspects that since nine other women had signed on the petition that Ms. Thabsheera prepared, she found herself in a position beyond correction or retrieval.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/msf-haritha-stand-off-iuml-mulling-options/article36091479.ece

The move has riled wildlife activists and environmentalists because the sub-committee on framing guidelines for roads in protected areas recommended in 2013 that the status quo of the roads passing through national parks and core critical tiger habitats “shall remain the same” and should be maintained or repaired in their “current form and width”. As per the ESZ notification for Bandipur dated October 4, 2012, widening of roads comes under regulated category and can be done provided there was a proper Environment Impact Assessment besides mitigatory measures. Guruprasad Timmapur of Wildlife Matters said the project will further fragment Bandipur, which is one of the best protected tiger habitats in the country. “Two highways pass through Bandipur Tiger Reserve (NH-181 and NH-766) and the one proposed to be widened mostly caters to tourists travelling to Ooty and other areas. This highway already has a huge impact on wildlife by obstructing movement of animals, mortality of wildlife due to vehicular accidents, impact on wildlife behaviour, and pollution due to waste and noise,” said Mr. Timmapur. The highway cutting through Bandipur also passes through Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and hence, wildlife activists suspect that the project was being split to smaller bits and NHAI was bound to seek expansion of the stretch passing through Mudumalai in future. Drawing attention to the frequent accidents that led to the deaths of several wildlife species including tiger, elephant, leopard, chital, sambar, barking deer, langur, rusty-spotted cat, etc. on the highways that pass through Bandipur, Mr. Timmapur said the High Court of Karnataka had ordered closure of roads at night for vehicular movement barring emergency vehicles and 16 public transport buses. Places like Bandipur merely form 1% of the country’s geographical area and this proposed high expansion should not be permitted at any cost and the current laws and guidelines also do not allow for widening of this highway, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nhai-seeks-diversion-of-forestland-in-bandipur/article36091469.ece

They are slated to reach the temple ghats at Aranmula by 10.45 a.m. and will be accorded a grand reception. No persons without the identification card provided by the PSS will be permitted to embark the boat, while the oarsmen will not be permitted to go ashore during the event. In three legs The race will be held in three legs respectively from the temple ghats to Sathrakadavu, from Sathrakadavu to Parappuzhakadavu and from Parappuzhakadavu to the temple ghats again. The races will be held along with the rendition of the traditional vanchipattu (boat songs) in praise of the presiding deity at the Aranmula temple. A decision to hold the annual regatta symbolically with just three palliyodams was made during a meeting convened by the State government last month. Notably missing from the event will be the festive atmosphere as the participation of public has been restricted for the second year in a row. Prior to the pandemic, up to 5,000 persons on board 52 snakeboats had attended the event, which also drew a huge number of tourists to the banks of the Pampa.

The lab is a significant step by the Department of Museums and Zoos in cultural heritage conservation. Paintings at the Sree Chithra Art Gallery and the KCS Panicker Art Gallery here and the Krishna Menon Art Gallery and Museum, Kozhikode, and other cultural materials that are at risk in the hot and humid conditions of the State will be conserved at this modern facility. As the demand for the services of the National Research Laboratory for Conservation of Cultural Property, a premier organisation involved in conservation of cultural property, is very high and there are not enough experts around, there was an acute need for a conservation lab in the State itself. Even when experts came, only a limited number of materials or paintings could be conserved at a time, Museum Director S. Abu said. As per the vision of Venu V., Additional Chief Secretary, Cultural Affairs, the full-fledged lab, said to be the third with such advanced facilities after those in Udaipur and New Delhi, has been designed flexibly with movable furniture and equipment for treating all kinds of objects. Fume extractors, stereo microscopes, UV light panel, DSLR camera, and studio lights for detailed examination and photographic documentation of the paintings and other cultural materials have been provided at the lab. A low-pressure suction table that has been imported from Italy and enables treatment of variety of objects such as paintings, manuscripts, and documents under controlled heating, humidification, and low-vacuum conditions is a highlight of the lab. International standards All materials such as chemicals and techniques used for the treatment and post-treatment also meet international conservation standards. The lab will help storage and display of objects under optimum light, temperature, and relative humidity to prevent future deterioration. Besides procurement of equipment and setting up of the lab, the first phase work involves preservation of 16 paintings, including those by Raja Ravi Varma and Raja Raja Varma. New gallery The conserved paintings would be exhibited in a new gallery for Raja Ravi Varma that worked in a temperature-controlled ambience, Mr. Abu said. Even the gallery store would be temperature-controlled. The gallery was expected to be ready by the year-end. A technical committee with art conservator S. Girikumar as chairperson and comprising K.C. Chithrabhanu and Delhi-based conservator Sunil Kumar Menon has been in charge of setting up the lab and restoration work. The conservation lab, which cost Rs. 1.4 crore, will be inaugurated by Minister for Museums Ahammad Devarkovil on September 2.  Preservation of nearly 1,100 paintings, including those by the renowned painter Raja Ravi Varma, will be done||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lab-to-preserve-paintings-coming-up-at-capital-museum/article36091647.ece

A week after demonstrations at the toll plaza erected at Thiruvallam forced authorities to keep its operations in abeyance, the NHAI faced another hindrance despite instructing the user fee collection agency to recommence its activities and informing the district administration and local police of the same. Demonstrations broke out nearly 45 minutes into the collection of toll from motorists that commenced by 8.30 a.m. By then, the agency had collected user fees from at least a hundred motorists, local residents claimed. However, the NHAI maintained only around five drivers were charged by the time the protests threw a spanner in the works. The Congress led by Kovalam MLA M. Vincent, the CPI (M), as well as a group of people who resided nearby, held separate demonstrations and blocked two toll gates. Oncoming vehicles were allowed to pass through the two toll gates on either end as the tensed situation unfolded. A large posse of police led by Assistant Commissioner, Fort, S. Shaji was also present to prevent a possible escalation of the protests. Firm on demands The protestors remained firm on their demands to permit nearby residents to pass through the toll plaza free of charge and to collect the user fees only after the completion of the bypass construction until Karode. The NHAI has currently permitted traffic only until Kovalam, despite the construction until Mukkola complete. Mahesh, who ran a stationary shop close to the toll plaza, said many residents like him often travelled to the other side of the booth to go to the nearest government hospital, the Thiruvallam village office as well as the Thiruvallam police station. While the NHAI has offered to issue monthly passes for residents within 20 km at a rate of Rs. 285, the protesters felt it was unreasonable to charge them. While the demonstrators refused to relent to the pleas made by the police, they finally decided to call off their protests around 12 p.m. after NHAI officials offered to hold a meeting later in the day. During the discussions, Mr. Vincent called for steps to permit the free movement of people residing in nine villages in the region. He also reiterated the protestors demand to defer toll collection until the completion of the project. Final decision The representatives of NHAI said a final decision could be taken only after consultation with their superiors. While it is unclear whether toll collection would resume on Wednesday, the agitators have threatened to prevent the activity if their demands are not met.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/toll-collection-along-bypass-sparks-stir/article36091664.ece

25 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Relaxed curbs prove costly as cases spike||The lessening of the curbs that were necessitated by the pandemic and the growing rush in public places during the recent festivities have seemingly begun to reflect on the COVID-19 caseload in Thiruvananthapuram district. On a day when its test positivity rate shot up to 12.9%, the district authorities have gone to the extent of urging festival-goers to get themselves tested. As many as 1,435 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on Tuesday to register the highest single-day spike since June 30. While 1,087 people recovered from the illness during the last 24 hours, the active caseload stood at 9,677. The district’s death toll also rose to 3,487 after nine recent deaths were attributed to the disease. Among the fresh cases, local transmission of the infection is said to become a cause for 1,346 cases. Three health care workers have also tested positive. As many as 1,959 people were ordered to go into quarantine. Consequent to the steady rise in COVID-19 cases, District Medical Officer K.S. Shinu appealed to those who participated in gatherings during Muharram and Onam to go in for testing. In addition, those experiencing fatigue, headache, cough, fever, body ache and throat pain must remain in room quarantine without fail after subjecting themselves for tests. Exhorting them to consider testing as their responsibility, the official urged them to contact health workers close to their homes for the purpose. Dr. Shinu said the early detection of the infection would enable timely medical intervention and also prevent the possibility of viral transmission. Those who had taken part in gatherings must adhere to the relevant COVID-19 norms within their homes. Special care must be ensured for elderly people, children, and pregnant women. Additional District Magistrate E. Muhammed Safeer, who has been officiating as District Collector in Navjot Khosa’s absence, declared Nanniyode ward in Nanniyode grama panchayat as a containment zone. The existing containment zone restrictions in Valiyathura ward in Thiruvananthapuram Corporation and Pullayil ward in Pulimath grama panchayat have been withdrawn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/relaxed-curbs-prove-costly-as-cases-spike/article36091666.ece

25 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||With ramped-up testing, cases mark huge jump||An increase in COVID-19 testing in the State, post Onam festivities, has resulted in a huge jump in new cases, setting the test positivity rate (TPR) soaring. Kerala reported 24,296 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, a significantly higher number than that of the previous days, when 1,34,706 samples were tested over the past 24 hours. Despite the increase in testing, TPR is soaring, registering 18.04% on Tuesday. Bracing for surge The Health Department appears to be resigned to the fact that a major surge in cases is inevitable after the Onam festivities and is now bracing to see how high the graph will rise. The State’s active case pool on Tuesday had 1,59,335 patients, with a good number of recoveries reported in the past two days. The number of patients reported to have recovered on the day was 19,349. There is also no let-up in deaths even when the State continues to report a cumulative case fatality rate of 0.5%. The official cumulative case fatalities in the State now stands at 19,757, with Kerala adding 173 deaths, most of which occurred in the past few days, to the official list of COVID-19 deaths on Tuesday. However, ICU occupancy and hospitalisations have not seen a major fluctuation since the past two weeks. ICU occupancy of COVID patients in both public and private hospitals in the State is stable at 2,057, while the number of patients requiring ventilator support has dipped to 761. On Tuesday, the number of patients newly admitted to hospitals was 2,078. Much to the relief of the Health Department, total hospitalisations of those with moderate or severe COVID-19 does not show a significant increase. Case burden The cumulative case burden of the State ever since the pandemic began now stands at 38,51,984 cases. Among the districts, Ernakulam reported the highest number of new cases with 3,149 cases, Thrissur 3,046, Kozhikode 2,875, Malappuram 2,778, Palakkad 2,212, Kollam 1,762, Kottayam 1,474, Thiruvananthapuram 1,435, Kannur 1,418, Alappuzha 1,107, Pathanamthitta 1,031, Wayanad 879, Idukki 612 and Kasaragod 518 cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/with-ramped-up-testing-cases-mark-huge-jump/article36091492.ece

However, thousands of Pulikkali fans got to watch Thrissur’s own tiger dance, which brought the curtains down on the Onam celebrations, live on Facebook on Tuesday. Ayyanthole Desham Pulikkali team staged the online performance in the afternoon. The team had organised a virtual Pulikkali performance last year as well. This time, there were seven members in the team. Painting their bodies in bright yellow and black, they performed the tiger dance to the beats of the rustic drum. Thrissur Mayor M.K. Varghese inaugurated the one-hour programme that was held at a private place in Ayyanthole. Perhaps sidelined as a street event at one point in time, Pulikkali has since been recognised as one of the main events of Onam celebrations after a set of rules were introduced for its performance. In a unique move, all the team members had signed a willingness for organ donation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pulikkali-performed-live-on-fb/article36091022.ece

Perhaps, history was rewritten again this year when a ‘transgender tiger’ danced along with other male counterparts during a Pulikkali performance organised in Thrissur on Tuesday. Praveen Nadh, a trans man from Nenmara, Palakkad, performed the tiger dance for the Ayyanthole Desam team, which staged an online performance this time that was streamed live on Facebook. Unlike the customary pot-bellied tigers, Praveen Nadh is a body builder. He was named Mr. Kerala 2021 in the transgender category. With his ‘muscular’ show on Tuesday, he has quickly earned a nickname — ‘Jimman Puli’ — from his fellow tigers.  In another unique move this time, all the team members had signed a willingness for organ donation. “I was really happy to become a member of such a unique team,” said Praveen Nadh, who said he had earlier not even watched a Pulikkali performance in person, except on television. “This has been a new experience. I enjoyed it,” he said. He is now training for Mr. South India Body Building Championship.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/transgender-puli-enters-a-male-bastion/article36091023.ece

25 August 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Ragini, Sanjjanaa took drugs, test confirms||After 10 months, two actors are in the dock again in the case that put the spotlight on drug use in the Kannada film industry. The Central Crime Branch (CCB) officials have said they have come up with stronger evidence against the accused as the hair follicle test conducted by the central FSL lab in Hyderabad confirmed drug consumption by actors Ragini Dwivedi and Sanjjanaa Galrani. According to officials, as the urine and blood sample tests were not conclusive, the CCB collected hair follicles from the actors and sent them to FSL in October 2020. For the first time in a drug case investigation, hair samples were sent for tests as drug traces can be found in hair for up to one year, officials said. With the new evidence, the CCB may summon the duo again. At present, the actors are out on bail. “I am proud of the CCB for their relentless effort in gathering scientific evidence in drug cases,” Kamal Pant, city Police Commissioner, said. At first, the lab rejected the hair samples, and the samples were then resent. Generally, blood and urine samples are sent as drugs can be detected within 24 to 48 hours, but many times, the results are inconclusive because of the delay in collecting samples and finding the accused. However, in hair samples, drug traces can be found in the follicle for up to one year, Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police, said. Inspector Puneeth, the investigating officer of the case, has submitted the reports before the 33rd CCH court. The reports will be added to the chargesheet against the actors and others. The CCB had arrested Ms. Galrani and Ms. Dwivedi in September 2020. While Ms. Galrani was granted bail in December 2020, Ms. Dwivedi obtained bail in January 2021 from the Supreme Court. The CCB had arrested 12 persons, including socialite Viren Khanna, who was allegedly organising drug parties. The other arrested include Aditya Alva, son of former minister Jeevaraj Alva and relative of Bollywood actor Vivek Oberoi, RTO officer Ravishankar, and Rahul Tonse and Lume Pepper, who were allegedly supplying drugs to the parties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ragini-sanjjanaa-took-drugs-test-confirms/article36091016.ece

Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday urged the medical fraternity in general and the Indian Medical Association in particular to take up special awareness campaigns to educate people about the importance of getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Inaugurating the ‘Vaccinate India Programme’, an initiative of the Sustainable Goals Coordination Centre of the State government, in collaboration with the Give India Foundation, he said there appeared to be hesitancy in some quarters to get vaccinated. It is absolutely essential to create awareness among those who still harbouring doubts, he said. Mr. Naidu also asked youngsters to avoid junk food and eat properly cooked traditional Indian food which was more suited to “our bodily and climatic conditions”. Calling for turning the vaccination drive into a ‘Jan Andolan’, Mr. Naidu exhorted all people’s representatives to ensure that everyone is vaccinated in their constituencies. The COVID-19 recovery rate in the country has reached 97.6%, he said. “We are still not totally out of the woods and there is every need for each one of us to continue with COVID-related protocols and precautions,” he said. The Vice-President said the pandemic had brought into sharp focus the need to fill the gaps in the health infrastructure from urban centres to rural hinterlands on a priority. He urged the private sector to join hands with the government to give a major boost to the health infrastructure. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said it was the responsibility of the government to provide vaccination to lower sections of society. He called upon donors and entrepreneurs to donate funds under CSR in the fight against the pandemic. 25% additional doses Speaking later, Mr. Naidu said that Karnataka was going to get an additional 25% of its vaccine allocation. “Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai requested me to help the State in getting more allocation of vaccine. I have spoken to the Union Health Minister, who has agreed to provide 25% additional allocation,” said Mr. Naidu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/create-awareness-on-covid-19/article36091019.ece

Nehru said in the Assembly on Tuesday. “In the current year, it will be implemented in two zones in the Greater Chennai Corporation, one zone each in other Municipal Corporations, one municipality each in under the seven Regional Directorate of Municipal Administration and one town panchayat each in 37 districts,” the Minister said while replying to the debate on demands for grants for his department. Mr. Nehru said, unlike other States, the urban population in Tamil Nadu was growing fast and it would reach 60% of the total population by 2036. A total of four crore people are now living in urban areas, accounting for 53% of the total population. Mr. Nehru added that as announced in the State budget, the government would implement the Kalaignar Urban Development Scheme at a cost of Rs. 1,000 crore. “Infrastructure including community hall, markets, modern libraries will be created in municipalities and town panchayats,” he said. Pilot scheme Government sources told The Hindu that this was a pilot scheme and the government would soon come out with guidelines for providing wages under the scheme. The objective of the programme was to provide employment to urban poor, who had lost their jobs because of the COVID-19 pandemic as recommended by the committee headed by former RBI Governor C Rangarajan. “Thousands of jobs were lost and the government discussed ways to create jobs for them. Under the scheme, workers will be used for activities such as desilting of water bodies and maintenance of public parks and other places,” a senior official said.

25 August 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Why 84-day gap between vaccine doses: Kerala HC||The Kerala High Court on Tuesday asked the Centre to clarify the basis on which the 84-day gap between two doses of the Covishield vaccine had been prescribed. The court said that it wanted to know whether the stipulation of the 84-day interval between the two doses of Covishield was based on the availability of the vaccine or its efficacy. Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar sought the clarification when a writ petition by Kitex Garments Ltd., Kochi, seeking a directive to the State government to allow it to administer the second dose of the Covishield vaccine to its workers without following the 84-day gap, came up for hearing. The court said if the gap was set based on the availability of vaccines, those willing to buy it could be allowed to take the second shot before the completion of the prescribed days of gap. In fact, hundreds of persons who were ready to pay for vaccines were waiting for completion of the gap days. Centre’s policy The State government submitted that it followed the Central government’s vaccine policy, and unless the Centre altered its policy, it could not allow narrowing down the gap.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/why-84-day-gap-between-vaccine-doses-kerala-hc/article36091020.ece
25 August 2021||KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Building weir at Siddeswaram will reduce siltation at Srisailam’||The Rayalaseema Saaguneeti Samrakshana Samithi has demanded the construction of a weir-cum-bridge at Siddeswaram, 26 km upstream Srisailam dam, to increase the lifespan of the project and stop further siltation. Samithi president Bojja Dasaratharami Reddy said that while the work initiated by the Union Water Resources Ministry on Tuesday for assessing the total quantum of water that can be stored in the Srisailam reservoir and the quantum of silting in the past 10 years was a welcome step, experts must find a solution for reducing the quantum of silt that reaches the Srisailam dam. During the first-ever survey of water-holding capacity of the Srisailam dam in 1984, it was assessed that the project could hold 308 tmcft, but in the second survey conducted in 2011 it was found that only 215 tmcft was the holding capacity. “Going by these surveys, it is clear that every year the project was losing 3.4 tmcft of storage capacity and probably the current capacity would be only 185 tmcft,” Mr. Dasaratharami Reddy added. Ever since the project was constructed, except for five years, there was more than 500 tmcft water reaching the Srisailam dam. Constructing a weir at Siddeswaram will allow silt to be checked at that point 26 km upstream and farmers can take the fertile silt for their fields when the water recedes in the summer, Mr. Reddy pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/building-weir-at-siddeswaram-will-reduce-siltation-at-srisailam/article36091077.ece

25 August 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Retain A.P. Assigned Lands Act in its original form, demands union||A roundtable hosted by the Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Workers Union(APAWU) on Tuesday urged the YSR Congress Party government to continue with the Andhra Pradesh Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfers) Act in its original form. The amendments to the Act carried out by the previous Telugu Desam Party government allowed sale of such lands 20 years after the date of assignment to Dalits. But the Jagan Mohan Reddy government proposes to allow sale of such lands 10 years after they were assigned to landless poor. The proposal dilutes the very purpose of the Act, which prohibited transfers of assigned lands given to Dalits. Hence the Act should be retained in its original form, felt APAWU Prakasam District Secretary K. Anjaneyulu while briefing on the resolutions adopted at the meeting. The Act was enacted only following a long struggle by Dalit organisations for protection to the landless poor in the year 1977 as influential persons at the grassroots level usurped the lands by various “dubious means”, recalled Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Workers Union district president Jala Anjaiah. At least half of the over 55 lakh acres distributed to Dalits in undivided Andhra Pradesh had gone out of the hands of the beneficiaries, lamented Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Union district secretary K.Venkata Rao. The amendment to the Act to allow sale of lands assigned to Dalits after 10 years now, would go against the interests of the Dalits, he opined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/retain-ap-assigned-lands-act-in-its-original-form/article36091576.ece

Lathkar has said that the district administration is geared to handle the possible third wave of COVID-19 by taking a series of measures to handle the crisis. He said that treatment for children will be a big challenge as medical and health experts anticipated the pandemic’s affect on children in third wave. Mr. Shrikesh told The Hindu here that an exclusive children ward with 25 beds was being readied in the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences. “We have given notification for the appointment of 22 paediatricians whose services are needed for other parts of the district also. Apart from children, the administration is now capable of providing hassle-free medical aid quickly to elderly people also with the availability of sufficient quantity of oxygen both in government and private hospitals. We could make the private hospitals to improve the infrastructure for keeping more medical oxygen which may help other patients too,” he added. Vaccination Mr. Shrikesh expressed happiness over the good response for the vaccination programme in remote areas, including tribal regions of Palakonda, Sithampet, Patapatnam, Hiramandalam and other places. “We have completed admistering the first dose of vaccine to 10.38 lakh people. And second dose was administered to 3.47 lakh people. We will complete second dose also in a couple of months as many of them are yet to wait for statutory period of 84 days as far as Covishield is concerned. As far as Covaxin is concerned the minimum waiting period is 28 days. The medical and health department has been giving wide publicity about the importance of second dose of vaccine also to the people,” the Collector said. Mr. Shrikesh said that vaccination drive for the persons aged between 18 and 44 years had been started with the nod from the government. He said the vaccines including Sputnik V were available with the district administration.  Appropriate behaviour He urged the people to follow COVID appropriate behaviour, including wearing mask and social distancing in spite of completion of second dose of vaccination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/srikakulam-district-gearing-up-to-handle-third-wave-collector/article36091626.ece
25 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala to ensure one jab for all above 18||With COVID-19 transmission relentlessly going on in the State, Kerala will aim at vaccinating as many people and as fast as possible and keep them safe from serious disease and death. Health Minister Veena George, who called an emergency meeting of senior Health officials here on Tuesday to review the State’s preparations for meeting a possible third wave, has directed that at least one dose of vaccine be administered to all persons above 18 years in the State by end of September. Plan of action All districts should thus strengthen vaccination campaigns by preparing a clear plan of action and ensure that there are no delays in vaccine distribution. The State will take all steps to prevent the shortage of syringes, something that has been affecting the pace of COVID-19 vaccination. The Centre has promised to deliver 1.11 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccine to the State, said Ms. George. The Minister said that as all indications pointed to a surge in cases after Onam, hospitals needed to be prepared to meet likely increased caseload. Stressing that the COVID-19 mortality rate needed to be brought down, she said it must be ensured that those who have tested positive for COVID and are in home isolation are following all directives of the Health Department. The department should be able to locate all COVID-positive persons in home isolation who might have developed serious disease and ensure that they are given proper medical treatment, she added. Ms. George has directed that COVID-19 testing be increased as much as possible. If anyone who participates in a public event tests positive, then all persons who had attended the said event should undergo testing compulsorily. Third wave The meeting also reviewed the preparations in hospitals in view of a likely third wave. District medical officers informed the meeting about how hospital beds, oxygen beds, ICUs and ventilators were being readied and how paediatric care facilities, including wards and ICUs, were being augmented. Oxygen availability has been ensured and non-COVID care was also not being ignored.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-to-ensure-one-jab-for-all-above-18/article36091025.ece
25 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||ICHR’s recommendation touches a raw nerve in Kerala||The recommendation by the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) to exclude those who participated in the 1921 Malabar Rebellion against colonial rule from the list of freedom fighters appeared to have touched a raw nerve in the State. Except for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), political parties across the spectrum condemned the move to eclipse the role of the 387 mutineers, an overwhelming number of them Muslims, in the armed insurrection against the British. Among those “earmarked for delisting” by the ICHR are iconic rebel leaders Variankunnath Kunhamad Haji and Ali Musaliar. The row over the Malabar Rebellion spilt onto the street on Tuesday. BJP workers marched to the residence of Speaker M.B. Rajesh in Kozhikode to protest against the latter’s “bid to compare Variankunnath to Bhagat Singh.” CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said that people viewed the life stories of Variankunnath and Bhagat Singh differently. Nevertheless, E.M.S. Namboodirpad had written that the Malabar Rebellion was essentially an armed struggle against the British. However, some rebels had tried to “change the course of the mutiny midstream” to suit their narrow political ends. Hence, E.M.S. had thoughtfully named his book on the armed insurrection as Exhortation and Caution . The history of the 1921 rebellion also held a tale of caution for society, Mr. Kodiyeri added. CPI(M) acting State secretary A. Vijayaraghavan said the BJP had attempted to saffronise the freedom struggle by using ICHR as a cover. The move to blot out the Malabar Rebellion from the annals of the Indian freedom struggle was part of the devious bid. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K. Sudhakaran has slammed the ICHR’s move. So have Congress leaders V.M. Sudheeran, Ramesh Chennithala and Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan. The Congress also saw a saffron bid to distort history. BJP’s view BJP leader P.K. Krishnadas said the CPI(M) and the Congress had attempted to whitewash “the ethnic cleansing of Hindus” in Malabar as a freedom struggle. The Congress and the CPI(M) were lionising Variankunnath with an eye on minority voters. Meanwhile, Malappuram district witnessed a wave of protests against the ICHR’s move. The Youth Congress organised a programme in front of the Variankunnath Kunhamad Haji Memorial Town Hall. Former MLA V.T. Balram said the Sangh Parivar’s move to contort history should be resisted at any cost. The CPI(M) district secretariat too condemned the ICHR move, terming it “a denial of history.” The Malabar Rebellion was in consequence to the agrarian revolts that took place in Malabar, it said. IUML response IUML national secretary E.T. Mohammed Basheer, MP, said that move was “shocking”, terming the ICHR findings baseless. “They are distorting history without any conscience or qualms,” he said. Mr. Basheer said the move validated the fears raised by secular forces against appointing communally spirited people to head the ICHR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ichrs-recommendation-touches-a-raw-nerve-in-kerala/article36091026.ece
25 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Anticipatory bail in ISRO case for Siby Mathews||A district court here granted anticipatory bail to retired ranking police officer Siby Mathews against possible arrest by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as part of its probe into the “police frame-up” that resulted in the infamous Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) spy case in 1994. Mr. Mathew’s counsel told the court that the Special Investigation Team (SIT) that probed ISRO scientist Nambi Narayanan and others for suspected espionage had arrested the suspects at the behest of Central agencies. Mr. Mathews headed the SIT. The Intelligence Bureau and the the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) had reportedly felt then that the arrest of the scientist and others was imperative to understand the presumed national security implications. Moreover, Mr. Mathews had no circumstance to question Mr. Narayanan because the CBI took over the case within 48 hours of the latter’s arrest. The CBI had come into the picture on Mr. Mathew’s recommendation given the international dimensions of the case. Mr. Mathew’s counsel argued that the CBI, which probed the case, had not detected a conspiracy by the Kerala Police to foist fake charges on the ISRO scientist. The CBI’s current line of inquiry seemed to be an afterthought. FIR filed Last month, the CBI filed an FIR (classified) in the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) court here accusing four former law enforcers, including Mr. Mathews, of “wrongful arrest, custodial torture, and unjustified incarceration” of Mr. Narayanan and others. It had named Mr. Mathews, his then deputies K.K. Joshua, S. Vijayan, and Thampi S. Durgadutt, and the then Deputy Director, Intelligence Bureau, R.B. Sreekumar, as accused in the FIR. The grim chapter in the annals of Kerala’s police investigation has its provenance in a case registered at Vanchiyoor station on November 13, 1994. Based on a Special Branch report, the police had booked two Maldivian women for overstay and violation of the provisions of the Official Secrets Act. The charging officers accused the women of enticing ISRO scientists involved in the cryogenic engine procurement project. In addition, they alleged the women had spirited out high-end space secrets out of India for a foreign power. The CBI had registered the current case at the behest of the Supreme Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/anticipatory-bail-in-isro-case-for-siby-mathews/article36091027.ece

In rest of the districts, extensive testing would be done. Mr. Vijayan directed that the districts which, had achieved a 70% coverage with the first dose of vaccine, to complete the exercise (first dose) in the next two weeks. He directed the Local Self-Government Department to submit a report as to the vaccination coverage achieved by each local body. Breakthrough infection Vaccine breakthrough infections have been reported to be over 5% in the districts of Idukki, Palakkad and Kasaragod. The Health Department will conduct genomic surveillance studies in these districts.

25 August 2021||ULUMURU (EAST GODAVARI),ANDHRA PRADESH||Koyas’ mud-walled houses soon to become a painful memory||The iconic mud-walled house of the Koyas is on the verge of becoming a painful memory for its inhabitants once they are relocated by the State government to make way for the Polavaram irrigation project. Kella Vijaya had recently realised her dream of building her own mud-walled house — a legacy that has come to define the tribe for generations — after toiling for a year. “We have spent Rs. 10,000, our savings of one year earned from toddy tapping, to build our house. Now, it is inevitable that it will be deserted to be later dismantled by the government,” rues Ms. Vijaya. Thousands of Koyas will have to be rehabilitated from their ancestral habitations in which they had built their houses, as it falls under the submergence area of the Polavaram irrigation project. In Chintoor Agency, the Koya habitation of Ulumuru has nearly 150 mud-walled houses including one owned by Ms. Vijaya’s family. Emotional connect Another Koya woman, Gorre Achamma, told this reporter, “We built our mud-walled house a decade ago. It still stands strong, without any need for repairs. No repairs are needed as long as the walls are painted with cow dung. The longevity of the house also depends on the quality of wood being used to make the roof and pillars.” “No architectural style or material can match the beauty of the mud-walled house. For generations, the mud-walled house has been nothing short of a luxury. In the new settlements, the government builds the houses according to its choice. We know that some day in the near future, it is going to become a thing of the past for us,” Ms. Achamma says. Ms. Achamma’s house has two bedrooms, a kitchen, a hall, and an attic in which the family stores grains and minor forest produce. “Women share a deep emotional connection with their house as they spend a long time collecting the mud, building the walls and painting the house with cow dung often,” says Ms. Achamma’s daughter Meena. The roof of the house is usually erected by men. The low cost is the main factor behind the Koya tribals’ decision to stick to the mud houses instead of going for concrete ones. “The mud-walled house represents many aspects of our life. We know that leaving all this behind is inevitable but it will be very painful nonetheless,” said Ms. Meena. In the forest, the tribe enjoys the freedom of collecting precious wood, bamboo, and other materials. Once rehabilitated from the forest, they would lose such luxuries. “What is even more heartbreaking for us is that there won’t be any trace of our habitations for us to come and visit occasionally, as they will all be submerged,” Ms. Meena told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/koyas-mud-walled-houses-soon-to-become-a-painful-memory/article36091581.ece

The State government issued orders for reopening of government schools from August 16. With the government giving orders for reopening of schools and conducting classes from Class I to Class X, the managements sent text messages and informed the parents regarding the reopening of schools. “The teachers informed us over phone and asked us to start sending our son to school. The government directed the school managements to conduct classes in strict adherence to COVID norms, but no such precautions were seen at the school,” said V. Vamsi Krishna, a parent. “As a COVID vaccine is yet to be developed for children, parents are worried about sending them to school. In a class with a strength of 35, not even 15 children are coming for classes,” said J. Nirmala, a teacher at a private school. Many parents have said they are noticing behavioural changes in their children as they have been forced to remain indoors for the last eighteen months. However, many of them are still worried about sending them to school due to fears of a third wave of COVID-19. “As there were fewer students, teachers are maintaining social distancing in classrooms with only two students being allowed to sit on each bench. But no sanitisers are available on the campus. We are wearing masks throughout the duration of the classes,” said S. Jyothi, a Class VII student.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/schools-reopen-to-half-empty-classes/article36091680.ece

25 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Govt. gears up to implement integrated registration system||The Andhra Pradesh government is gearing up to implement an integrated registration system which is being implemented in 12 other States as part of the national generic documentation registration project. The new system, National Generic Document Registration System (NGDRS) is likely to be implemented in three months. According to information, the Stamps and Registration Department is focussing on the NGDRS as it has nearly succeeded in shifting the database from Hyderabad. The new system is aimed at ease of doing business. The system is said to be useful for for making investments. The NGDRS represents a major shift from the existing manual registration system to an online one for all types of transactions, including sale, purchase and transfer of land. Pilot project Under the NGDRS, property registration facilities would be available online. The software has been designed by the NIC, Pune, with a view to bring uniformity in the process pertaining to registration of properties, lease agreements and etc. The NGDRS is being implemented as a pilot project in Kankipadu Sub-Registrar Office (SRO) in Krishna district, sources say. Computerisation of registrations was taken up in combined Andhra Pradesh in 1999 under the project Computer-aided Administration of Registration Department (CARD). Since then, issuance of ECs, registrations and etc have been done online. After the advent of village secretariats, necessary documents are being issued through the CARD Centre Architecture only. Now, the idea is to take a leap further and implement the NGDRS, officials say. Inspector General of Stamps and Registration M. V. Seshagiri Babu says that registration process would come under a single platform with the NGDRS. “About eight modules are being prepared for the new system and customisation is being done. It will take about three months to analyse the functioning of the NGDRS, which is being implemented at Kankipadu SRO now. Steps will be taken up to implement the project across the State thereafter,” he says. Andhra Pradesh is ahead of other States with regard to computerisation of registrations as the registration process has been linked with the webland portal of the Revenue Department. The existing software doesn’t allow registration unless the data in webland portal matches with the forms filled by the applicants. There are some differences in registration processes between Andhra Pradesh and other States like Maharashtra, which have already implemented the NGDRS. These issues are being looked into, sources say. The officials say that implementation of the new system is delayed as the Stamps and Registration Department has taken up steps to shift the database from Hyderabad server to the Pi Data Centre at Mangalagiri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-gears-up-to-implement-integrated-registration-system/article36091592.ece

25 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Police repair medians on NH-16 to mitigate accidents||A few days ago, a 22-year old youth from Visakhapatnam was heading towards Tuni on the NH on a two-wheeler. When he reached Nakkapalle, a 50-year-old on a two-wheeler coming from the other side suddenly entered the side on which the youth was driving through an opening in the median. According to the police, locals had removed the grills on the median and levelled it up unauthorisedly, so that they need not drive till the gap between medians to take an ‘U’ turn. The youth collided with the biker and received severe head injuries and is in coma in a city hospital. According to the local police, at least five to six accidents are being reported every month on NH-16 in Nakkapalle area reportedly due to vehicles crossing from one side to the other through the unauthorised road openings. Most of such accidents turn to be fatal, as per the police. With an aim to reduce to such accidents, the Nakkapalle police with the help of the NHAI authorities have taken up the job to close all such unauthorised openings by repairing the medians. In the 18 km-stretch of NH-16 passing along Nakkapalle police station limits, the police have identified 14 such road openings. Most of the road openings were created by the locals to avoid long U-turns, it was learnt. On Tuesday, the police have blocked eight such road opening points and again on Wednesday, rest of the points were also closed. According to Sub-Inspector of Nakkapalle police station D Venkanna, who has taken up the initiative, the road openings have been posing a severe threat to the commuters on NH-16. There are small road openings through which a two-wheeler can enter other side and also bigger ones, through which a tractor can pass. “Tractors carrying dried grass, local businessmen, traders, people going for bank purposes and for agricultural purposes cross the roads through medians despite creating awareness over the danger behind. This is been a very severe problem, especially during nights,” said Mr Venkanna. He said that Uddandapuram and Goducharla have been identified as accident-prone areas among the others in the limits, where they have taken up the works first. Police said that there are many instances when people from several villages of Nakkapalle mandal were injured. The local police have been conducting meetings and creating awareness. Around 70-km stretch between Anakapalle to Payakaraopeta stretch in Visakhapatnam district limits is considered as one of the most dangerous stretches. Statistics from the district police suggest that in the year 2021, Nakkapalle police station limits have reported 21 accident cases based on FIRs registered. However, around 30 cases have been compromised or settled. According to the police, there are a few areas where there are no grills on the medians. Due to which on August 4, two persons died and two others were injured, after one vehicle after hitting the divider toppled to the other side and an incoming vehicle rammed it. The district police have also sought NHAI to arrange medians in those points.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-repair-medians-on-nh-16-to-mitigate-accidents/article36091690.ece
25 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Earthquake due to sediment accumulation, says expert||The earthquake of 5.1 magnitude on the Richter scale that hit the Bay of Bengal around 12:35 p.m., about 296 km south-southeast of Kakinada, was due to differential compaction, as per an expert in earth sciences. Explaining it in simple words, Prof. K.S. Krishna from the University of Hyderabad, who had earlier written a research paper along with M. Ismaiel titled ‘presence of fracture line in off-shore of Krishna-Godavari basin’ said, “There are a number of fracture lines or fault lines under Bay of Bengal and the accumulation of sediment from various river systems might trigger a slip in the fault line, which can lead to an earthquake, further resulting into a Tsunami, depending on the intensity of the earthquake.” According to Prof. Krishna, apart from the presence of a 300-km-long fracture line in the offshore region of north A.P., about 100 km away from the coastline off Visakhapatnam, there are a number of fault lines in the deep water region in the Bay of Bengal and all of them can experience differential compaction. The one that happened on Tuesday off the coast of Kakinada, can be attributed to this. A number of rivers such as Krishna, Godavari and Brahmaputra flow into the Bay of Bengal carrying a huge amount of sediment, which increases the load on the fault lines and may result in underwater earthquakes. The eastern margin of India broke apart from the East Antarctica 130 million years ago and the continental collision that occurred between India and Asia around 40 million years ago led to the formation of the highest mountain range in the world, the Himalayas. “This was responsible for major changes in regional and global climatic conditions. Interactions between the Himalayan mountain range and Asian climate initiated erosional process in the Himalayan and Tibetan regions, and the river systems of the sub-continent carried copious amount of terrigenous material to the Bay of Bengal with a thickness reaching up to 22 km in Bengal offshore basin,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/earthquake-in-bay-of-bengal-due-to-sediment-accumulation-says-expert/article36091591.ece

She called upon women, who were in higher positions, to educate them in this regard. Ms. Padma was speaking at a roundtable on “A.P. Government towards empowerment of women”, organised by the commission here on Tuesday. Representatives of women’s organisations, ICDS beneficiaries and women from different walks of life attended the meeting. Addressing the participants, she said that the representation of women in various sectors has increased with the government giving 50% reservation to them. Though women were making giant strides of progress in education and employment, they were sometimes being targeted by men either verbally or physically, she added. The Disha app was brought out for timely assistance to women in times of need and to punish the perpetrators of such crimes, Ms. Padma said. While educated women were in a position to seek help, those in the unorganised sector were suffering humiliation in silence, she said. She underlined the need to created awareness among them on the availability of Disha app and other remedial measures. Describing women in the State as ‘Mahila Shakti’, she said that the large number of DWCRA group women and those working in government and private organisations should network and educate the underprivileged women. They should also discuss among themselves and come out with suggestions on curbing cyber crimes against women. She said that efforts should be made to motivate all women to download the Disha app on their mobiles. Mayor G. Venkata Hari Kumari, Corporator G.

Pushpa Srivani has directed Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) Project Officer Ronanki Gopalakrishna to initiate measures for the issue of Aadhaar cards to the tribal people of Neredubandha, which is on the border of G. Madugula and Ravikamatham mandals in the Agency area of Visakhapatnam district. The details of the 25 families living in the tribal village, have not been registered in government records. As many as 18 children, who were born in that village, do not even have birth certificates as they were born at their homes as the mothers were not admitted to a hospital for delivery. In the absence of hospital records, the birth certificates were not issued and hence Aadhaar cards could not be issued.

25 August 2021||August 25 2021 00:00 IST,ANDHRA PRADESH||Koganti Satyam held for ‘murder’ of industrialist||The Central Zone police probing the murder of industrialist Karanam Rahul produced Koganti Satyam, one of the accused in the case, in the court here on Tuesday. He was remanded in judicial custody. A special team constituted to probe the case took him into custody in Bengaluru, while he was reportedly trying to escape, and produced him in a local court in Karnataka on Monday. Satyam was shifted to Vijayawada on Prisoner Transit Warrant. The young businessman and industrialist, Rahul (30) was found murdered in his car, in the city on August 18. He started Zixin Cylinders Private Limited at G. Konduru mandal in Krishna district with a few partners. Police who altered the missing case into Section 302 IPC (murder) took a few suspects, including Rahul’s partner, Korada Vijaya Kumar, vehicle driver and others into custody. They registered a case against five persons, including Korada Vijay Kumar, Koganti Satyam and three women. Investigation officers suspect that Rahul was killed due to financial disputes, and are probing the case in other angles. They collected the call data of the mobile phones of the suspects. Korada Vijay Kumar and Koganti Satyam reportedly held discussions with Rahul and pressurised him to sell the company at a lesser price. Police are investigating the role of other suspects in the case. “We questioned more than 15 persons in the case so far. Financial matters are said to be the reason for the killing. However, we are trying to find out why the industrialist was murdered and are trying to collect scientific and technical evidences,” an officer probing the case said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ap-industrialist-murder-case-accused-arrested/article36091013.ece

25 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Health dept. checklist to support school reopening||The State government’s decision to reopen educational institutions from September 1 seems to be giving jitters to parents of school-going children They have been left wondering if adequate measures would be taken to keep their wards safe from COVID-19. Health officials have passed on a few suggestions to their counterparts in the Education department, and that includes ensuring all teaching and non-teaching staff are vaccinated against coronavirus. Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao said that 95% of the nearly 5 lakh teaching and non-teaching staff at educational institutions across the State are vaccinated. The remaining have been advised to get inoculated at their nearest government vaccination centre. Dr Srinivasa Rao said that all of them should receive at least their first dose before the institutions reopen. When schools were reopened in February this year after a gap of almost a year due to the pandemic outbreak, infection clusters started surfacing in schools and hostels. Officials suggest that if any student develops coronavirus symptoms, the principal and warden concerned have to take immediately take him/her to the nearest government health facility for testing. If the test turns up positive, the student’s close contacts have to be tested, too. “If more than five students in any educational institution test positive for coronavirus, the DPH has to be immediately alerted about the cluster for further course of action,” officials said. In March 2021, schools were shuttered after a cluster of COVID cases was detected. Health officials said they would be conduct regular surveillance. If anyone complaints of the symptoms, tests would be conducted and Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) kits might be used to determine the status. Parents feel reopening of educational institutions might trigger the third wave of COVID-19. Dr Srinivasa Rao, however, said that until a new and strong variant of coronavirus does not emerge, the third wave will not be seen. Earlier, he had said that new variants of coronavirus are seen when a large section of people are not vaccinated, or do not have antibodies to fight the virus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/health-dept-checklist-to-support-school-reopening/article36091392.ece
25 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||KTR: TRS focus on Dalit Bandhu success, not Huzurabad bypolls||TRS is not worried about the outcome of the Huzurabad bypoll. It is more concerned about the larger picture of ensuring the success of the Dalit Bandhu scheme in the constituency that is bound to change the very narrative of Dalit development in the country, TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao said on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters after the TRS Executive Committee meeting here, he said that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has guided them on the historic necessity of making the scheme a success. “The CM’s focus in the meeting was on the need for the scheme and how the country would see it as a project worth emulating if it was successfully implemented. So he asked us to spread the intentions of the scheme widely,” he said. Dismissing Huzurabad election as a minor issue for the TRS, he said that the constituency name was not even uttered once in the meeting presided by the CM. “We have been winning elections in Huzurabad and the erstwhile Kamalapur constituency since 2001. It may be a huge election for some but not for us. We will discuss about it once the notification is issued. Till then our focus is on better things.” The working president, who is also the Municipal and IT Minister, advised the Opposition parties to make constructive contribution to the scheme by guiding Dalits on using the money in a productive way. Referring to similar demands for others, he said Dalits were at the bottom of the social and economical pyramid and they deserve the support first. TRS office in New Delhi Foundation for the new TRS office in New Delhi would be laid on September 2 by the Chief Minister in the presence of all Ministers, MPs, MLAs, MLCs and other public representatives. It would be built on 1,200 sq. mts. and the permission has already been granted. Mr. KTR said the constitution of TRS village committees will also start on the same day while the mandal, municipal, city and district committees will be formed in the same month. The 20th anniversary of the party establishment will be conducted in October or November.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ktr-trs-focus-on-dalit-bandhu-success-not-huzurabad-bypolls/article36091426.ece
25 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC asks whether govt. is planning to revoke GO 111||Telangana High Court on Tuesday sought to know from the State government if it had any plans to revoke GO 111 which was issued in 1996 prohibiting erection of high-rise structures in the catchment areas of Himayathsagar and Osmansagar. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy instructed Additional Advocate General J. Ramchander Rao to clarify with the government if the latter contemplated revoking of the GO. During the hearing of a couple of writ petitions and a PIL plea on matters relating to GO 111, Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy cited a Telugu daily report which said the Chief Minister reportedly mooted the proposal of revoking the said GO. The bench hinted that the precious time of the court would be wasted if contentions pertaining to the GO were heard if the government eventually decides to revoke the GO. AAG J. Ramchander Rao said he was not sure of the veracity of the report but would secure a specific clarification from the Chief Minister on the matter by Wednesday. The said news item appeared in Telugu daily Namasthe Telangana , Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said. The bench wanted senior officers from the State government and HMDA to be present for the virtual proceedings on Wednesday to assist the court in adjudication of the matters. Earlier, the bench took serious exception to a voluminous report filed by the AAG pertaining to details of the parcels of land not coming under catchment area in Kokapet. The 87 parcels of lands owned by 377 individuals were spread over 948 acres, the AAG stated. However, the reports comprising copies of ‘pahani’ were in Telugu. The CJ said since she was not familiar with Telugu it would be difficult to understand what the records were all about. The AAG assured to place before the court the records in English by Wednesday. “There is no point in adjudicating the PIL plea and writ petitions when the government is thinking of revoking GO 11,” the CJ remarked. Lawyer Vivek Reddy, appearing for one of the petitioners, informed the court that State government had accorded permission to high-rise buildings in nearly 50 acres of lands abutting Kokapet lake which were recently auctioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-asks-whether-govt-is-planning-to-revoke-go-111/article36091400.ece
25 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Plans afoot for higher procurement of paddy||With the cultivation of paddy in the ongoing kharif (vanakalam) season in Telangana set to go beyond the extent proposed, the State government has started its efforts to convince the Food Corporation of India (FCI) to lift more rice grown this season. As the farming community have gone by their intuition and preferred paddy and maize over cotton and redgram, the extent of major cereal crop is now estimated to go up to 55 lakh acres against nearly 42 lakh acres proposed. With a view to handle the higher production, Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy held a meeting with the officials of Civil Supplies, Marketing and FCI here on Tuesday and discussed the issue. As per the revised estimates of paddy extent, the production is likely to be about 1.48 crore tonnes at the rate of 27 quintals yield per acre. The Minister stated that the FCI had already agreed to lift 60 lakh tonnes of paddy (rice milled from it). The government would seek an additional procurement of 15-20 lakh tonnes. “The matter will be taken to the Chief Minister’s notice first and through him, a request would be made to the Centre,” the Minister said. He explained that about 20 lakh tonnes paddy would be lifted/purchased by traders from neighbouring States and another 56 lakh tonnes would be required for local consumption in Telangana. Reasoning that farmers have preferred paddy over cotton due to delay in rains this season, he suggested them to go for fine varieties of paddy instead of common varieties as the former had good demand in the market. The Minister further explained that production of paddy in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, which procure rice from Telangana for their needs, was increasing and there was no consumption in Punjab where production too was high. He requested the FCI authorities to shift the stocks in their godowns in time. He also suggested the Civil Supplies Department to examine the possibility of storing paddy/rice in open areas with necessary arrangements as being done in the North. He also asked the farmers to raise alternative crops to paddy such as groundnut, sesamum, mustard, sunflower and others during the rabi/yasangi season. CGM of FCI Deepak Sharma stated that they would not procure common variety rice this season as its consumption in Karnataka, TN and Kerala was coming down. Chairman of Civil Supplies Corporation M. Srinivas Reddy, Commissioner V. Anil Kumar, Director of Marketing G. Lakshmi Bai, Additional Director of Agriculture K. Vijay Kumar, Rice Millers Association president G. Nagender, general secretary Mohan Reddy participated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/plans-afoot-for-higher-procurement-of-paddy/article36091413.ece
25 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Padayatra to expose TRS, propagate Centre’s schemes||The ‘Praja Sangrama Yatra’ to begin later this week will focus on “largescale corruption and single family rule of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS)” and make people aware of the Centre’s welfare and development schemes, says Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party (TSBJP) president Bandi Sanjay Kumar in an exclusive interview. Everyone seems to be taking out ‘padayatras’, what is the objective behind yours? In a democracy, everyone has the right to take it up but there are no polls in the vicinity. So, mine cleared by the top leadership after deliberations is to sensitise people about TRS government’s treachery in failing to fulfil the basic promises for which the separate sSate was formed — water, employment and funds. So much so, it is like an insult to the martyrs. We have also realised that despite the Centre funding most welfare and infrastructure schemes, the TS government has not been giving any credit - not even for the free vaccine. We want to take this to the people. After being part of spectacular wins in Dubbak and GHMC along with defeats in Huzurnagar, Nagarjunasagar and MLC polls, do you think people are ready to look beyond TRS? Yes . It is clear in the way the TRS has spent so much money in byelections and desperation of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao in personally getting involved. He had successfully fooled people with his dialect, false narratives and unkempt promises all these years, but they have had enough and are looking for a strong alternative in us. In fact, Mr. Rao is the number one betrayer of the Telangana cause and he is the only CM who does not meet people or has a regular schedule.  The BJP seems to be having a ‘blow hot or blow cold’ relationship with TRS. We have our own strategies, however, one thing is for sure, our Central leadership has backed our campaign against this government. We are collecting evidence of corruption and land grabbing of the first family, MLAs and others. We will present it before the court and once proven, we will send KCR to jail.  How are you going to convince people riled about high fuel and cooking gas prices? Citizens are aware that during these COVID turbulent times, the Modi government has to step in to protect vulnerable sections with free rations and free vaccines. People understand the Modi government’s compulsion, but what has the State government done for the needy? What stops them from reducing their tax share to give some relief? What are the party prospects in the Huzurabad bypoll? Eatala Rajendra is our candidate and he has done some wonderful work there. TRS leaders themselves have given up and by openly accepting that ‘Dalit Bandhu’ is a political game plan, Mr. Rao has lost all credibility. We are not against the scheme, we want it to be implemented in reserved constituencies, for BCs and poor among forward castes too. How will your first phase of the ‘mahapadayatra’ be? We will start from Bhagyalakshmi Temple at Charminar and propose to cover 10-12 km a day with one public meeting daily and will continue till October 2 covering Sangareddy, Vikarabad, and Medak. There has been overwhelming response from the cadre with 3,000 applicants but we will limit it to about 200 participants. Already well-wishers have donated 30 pairs of shoes!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/padayatra-to-expose-trs-propagate-centres-schemes/article36091419.ece
25 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Revanth sleeps in a Dalit’s house||Giving a further serious tone to its Dalita Girijana Deeksha programmes, Congress has decided to visit Dalit colonies in the State that started from Mudu Chintalapally village, which was adopted by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. Telangana Congress president Revanth Reddy on Tuesday night slept in the house of Burugu Sailu, a resident of the Dalit colony in the village. Interestingly, the house was allotted to him under the Indiramma housing scheme launched during the Congress regime. The Congress leader visited the Dalit colony to interact with people. The two-day deeksha, apparently to ‘expose’ the failed promises of the State government, started on Tuesday and will end on Wednesday evening. This is the third programme in the Dalit Girijana Dandora taken up by the Congress from August 13 to September 17. The large gathering in the small village responded with claps and whistles whenever the government was targeted. The PCC president asked the CM on the development promises made to the village with Rs. 28 crore. Instead of constructing houses, the government has razed several houses of Dalits in the nearby villages like Chinna Mulkanur. He was ready to apologise if the government proved that all the schemes were being implemented at least in the villages adopted by the CM. He announced that he would visit CM’s constituency Gajwel despite the threats from TRS leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cong-to-visit-dalit-colonies-in-state/article36091428.ece

25 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Govt. ‘misleading’ people on State finances: Kodandaram||Telangana Jana Samiti (TJS) president M. Kodandaram, on Tuesday, criticised the State government for ‘misleading’ people with false reports on the economic growth since TRS government took over the reins. “The State has ignored core sectors and indulged in wasteful expenditure like enhancing estimates of the irrigation projects, which in turn benefited contractors and the influential. Contractors, not common man, benefited the most with rise in revenues,” he alleged. Prof. Kodandaram faulted Finance Minister Harish Rao for the report on State finances he released on Monday and said that the report was ‘unsatisfactory’. He questioned as to why there was rampant unemployment and instances of suicides if the State had indeed achieved the development as projected by the government. “The State government did not mend ways in spite of being snubbed by CAG more than once. The State’s finances would not have reached such a stage had fiscal prudence been adopted in the expenditure on the irrigation projects,” he said. “Mr. Harish Rao resorted to jugglery of figures in his report while the ground situation is totally different. Farmers on their part are not receiving any benefits announced by the government as middlemen have their say. Notwithstanding the claims of the government, almost 98% farmers are in debt,” he lamented.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/people-misled-on-ts-finances/article36091421.ece

25 August 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||‘Bhagavad Gita can contribute to psychology, says IITH researcher||Do the Bhagavad Gita and the ancient musical instruments have tremendous potential which can contribute to the existing knowledge in the field of psychology? Yes, was the answer from a Ph.D. student of psychology from the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IITH). Vineet Gairola, raised in the Uttarakhand Himalayas, seeing the trance, divine embodiment, and ecstatic experiences of the people of Uttarakhand, was fascinated to take up the subject and to look deep into it. He says that music that is played in the Uttarakhand Himalayas through the regional rhythmic instruments named dhol-damaun can result in invocation of the deities and the scriptures like Vedas and Upanishads are profoundly psychological in nature. “I was able to bring this area to the field of academic psychological research by reading Carl Jung’s Man and His Symbols in 2016. In my extensive field work in the central Himalayas in my master’s, I explored perspectives from analytical psychology and developed fresh psycho-musical perspectives by studying two rhythmic instruments named dhol-damaun. I wrote a paper based on my master’s thesis titled Significance of Archetypal Sounds: Exploring the Mystical Practices of the Uttarakhand Himalayas , which is selected for presentation at the upcoming congress of the International Association for Analytical Psychology (IAAP) in Buenos Aires in 2022,” Mr. Vineet told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bhagavad-gita-can-contribute-to-psychology-says-iith-researcher/article36091636.ece
25 August 2021||JAIPUR,||Muslim family assaulted in Ajmer||Barely 24 hours after the attack on a Muslim bangle seller by a frenzied mob in Madhya Pradesh’s Indore city, a family of destitute Muslims, seeking alms, was brutally thrashed by some persons in a residential colony in Rajasthan’s pilgrim town of Ajmer and told to “go to Pakistan”. A video clip of the incident, which went viral on social media, showed a man slapping and kicking the members of the family multiple times and humiliating them because of their religious identity. “This is not the place for you. Go to Pakistan. You will get alms only there,” an assailant is heard telling the victims in the video footage. The incident led to widespread outrage across the State and caused a major embarrassment to the ruling Congress. The group of youths, who caught hold of the destitute persons, were enraged by their entry into the Hindu dominated neighbourhood. One of the assailants repeatedly kicked a boy on his head as he crouched on the street. The family of victims shown in the video, including a woman, are yet to be identified. Five persons arrested after their identification in the video were released on bail by the court, as they were charged under a lesser provision of Section 151 of CrPC. Following the demand raised by Ajmer city’s Muslim community, the police on Tuesday registered a case under the provisions of Indian Penal Code and launched investigation. While the police said the victims, who apparently belonged to Uttar Pradesh, were being traced, Muslim social activists took exception to the initial laxity of police which resulted in the accused getting bail. Police registered the case under the stringent provisions only after the community members approached the senior officers with the plea that their religious sentiments had been hurt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/muslim-family-assaulted-in-ajmer/article36091286.ece

25 August 2021||London,||Taliban must guarantee safe passage: G7||The Taliban must “guarantee” safe passage for those fleeing Afghanistan beyond the current August 31 evacuation deadline, the G7 agreed on Tuesday, according to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr. Johnson, who convened the emergency meeting, said that he and his colleagues had agreed to “a road map for the way in which we’re going to engage with the Taliban” in future. But he added that the “number one condition” was “to guarantee... through August 31 and beyond, a safe passage for those who want to come out”. The U.K. chaired the emergency talks among the group of wealthy countries on Tuesday, saying it would urge Mr. Biden to extend his August 31 deadline to pull American forces out of Afghanistan. France also called on Washington to push back the timeline. However, Mr. Biden decided after the G7 talks that he would stick to the deadline, U.S. media reported. Britain’s Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said earlier on Tuesday it was “unlikely” evacuations from Afghanistan would be extended beyond August 31. The G7 leaders also agreed that the Taliban would be “held accountable for their actions on preventing terrorism, on human rights in particular those of women, girls and minorities and on pursuing an inclusive political settlement in Afghanistan”, according to a statement issued by Mr. Johnson’s Downing Street office.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taliban-must-guarantee-safe-passage-g7/article36091049.ece
25 August 2021||Kabul,||Stop airlifting skilled Afghans: Taliban||The Taliban on Tuesday urged skilled Afghans not to flee the country, as the new rulers of Afghanistan warned the United States and its NATO allies they would not accept an extension to a looming evacuation deadline — even as Western countries said time was running out. A spokesman for the Islamist group told America to stop taking “Afghan experts” such as engineers and doctors out of the country. “This country needs their expertise. They should not be taken to other countries,” Zabihullah Mujahid told a press conference in the capital Kabul. “They should not encourage the Afghan people to flee Afghanistan.” European nations have said they would not be able to airlift at-risk Afghans before the August 31 cut-off, and United States President Joe Biden has faced calls from all corners to extend the evacuation window. But speaking at a press conference in the capital Kabul, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the Islamist group opposes an extension. “They have planes, they have the airport, they should get their citizens and contractors out of here,” said Mujahid. The U.S.-led troops have ramped up operations to get thousands of people out of Kabul by August 31 — a deadline set by the U.S. before the fall of the country for all foreign troops to have pulled out of Afghanistan. President Biden has said he will stick to the schedule but has faced growing pressure to negotiate more time for the evacuations. Germany said Western allies simply cannot fly every Afghan who needs protection out of Kabul before the cut-off date. Britain, meanwhile, has said it will lobby for an extension at a virtual G7 summit later on Tuesday. About 50,000 foreigners and Afghans have fled the country from Kabul’s airport since the Taliban swept into power nine days ago, according to the U.S. government. Many Afghans fear a repeat of the brutal interpretation of Islamic law that the Taliban implemented when first in power from 1996-2001, or retribution for working with the U.S.-backed government over the past two decades. On Tuesday, Mujahid said female Afghan government workers should stay home until security conditions in the country improve.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/stop-airlifting-skilled-afghans-taliban/article36090961.ece
25 August 2021||August 25 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Situation under control of Taliban’||Chairman and chief executive of the media conglomerate MOBY GROUP, which operates in South Asia, Central Asia, West Asia and Africa, Saad Mohseni is Afghanistan’s topmost media entrepreneur. Named by Time Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world, by Foreign Policy magazine as among 100 Global Thinkers, and by the BBC as one of the 10 men globally championing gender equality, Mohseni has modernised the media scene in Afghanistan over the past 20 years. Excerpts:  How is the situation outside Kabul? Panjshir Valley has seen some clashes. The opposition forces there seem to have helicopters flying in and out of the Kabul airport. They are not totally surrounded by the Taliban and can get ammunition and supplies via helicopters. There have also been clashes in the east of the country, involving the Islamic State. There have been some civil disturbances, people protesting and coming out onto the streets. But generally speaking, the situation seems to be pretty much under the control of the Taliban. Have you been speaking to any major political players in the past couple of weeks, particularly the Taliban? We talk to everyone regularly — former President Hamid Karzai, Abdullah Abdullah, other government officials. We also speak to the Taliban obviously. We are trying to figure out what are the best ways of engaging with this new movement that is going to take charge. You own and run a lion’s share of media in Afghanistan. What are your concerns right now, as an entrepreneur who has invested heavily in the media in Afghanistan? I think continuity of what we have been doing for 20 years in the same way is our main concern. The lives and well-being of our staff are very important for us. A lot of our staff members are leaving or have left. In terms of continuity, it is important for us to keep broadcasting and reporting on facts as we have done so far. We would like to remain the truth tellers that we have been, championing the narratives and values that are important to us, such as women’s rights, freedom of expression and minority rights. Have you received any clear assurance from the Taliban that they would not interfere with the way you run your media outlets? Yes. They have visited us, were interviewed by us. As a matter of fact, their deputy cultural commissioner was on our morning programme. They came to our station two days ago (Saturday) and gave us verbal assurances. Are you seeing any signs that Taliban 2.0 will be more benign, inclusive, and tolerant? It is mixed, but overall the signs are good. This could be just a strategy to win over support both domestically and internationally. But the signs are more positive because there is a realisation among the senior members of the Taliban that the country has changed. You have to remember that the Afghan population, which was 21 million, is now 35 million, an increase of 70%. Sixty-five per cent of the population is under the age of 20, and these people never experienced a Taliban-type rule. They use social media, and are techno-savvy, including young foot soldiers of the Taliban. How inclusive can a Taliban establishment get? They have a constituency that will demand a more conservative approach. They have to balance that with a world that expects more moderate, more liberal policies. I think one of the reasons why it is important for people to engage, including your government, is because there is this window to work with them so that they do have an inclusive approach. Who are the Taliban in terms of demographics? The senior leadership has always been predominantly from the greater Kandahar area. What they have attempted to do of late is to include others. They made inroads into the Tajiks and the Uzbeks. The result of that was a total collapse of the North in their favour. The Kandahar Taliban are still the dominant ones, and they are seen as more conservative, and perhaps more independent of Pakistan, unlike, say, the Haqqani network. So we will perhaps see this tug of war within the Taliban as to which group will prevail ultimately. India is nowhere in the picture as far as Afghanistan is concerned. How do you look at it? India’s blunder was that it supported individuals rather than Afghanistan. They doubled down on a few individuals and backed them to the hilt. The Indian government has to be pragmatic, and it has to deal with things on the ground. India can play a crucial role. India is a funder of big projects in Afghanistan. The Indians ought to reassess the way they tackle this and become a little bit more aggressive in terms of their outreach with the folks in Kabul today. It is important for India to think long-term.

25 August 2021||Singapore,||Kamala Harris accuses China of ‘intimidation’ in disputed seas||Vice-President Kamala Harris accused China on Tuesday of intimidation in disputed Asian waters, seeking to rally regional allies as the United States’ superpower status takes a hit over Afghanistan. Her comments in Singapore came as Washington seeks to reset relations in Asia after the turbulent Donald Trump era and build a bulwark against the rising might of Beijing. But her trip to the region, which also includes a stop in Vietnam, comes as Washington faces fresh questions over its dependability amid the U.S. pull-out from Afghanistan. In a speech laying out her administration’s foreign policy goals, Ms. Harris reiterated that Washington had “enduring commitments” in Asia — and took aim at China. “Beijing continues to coerce, to intimidate and to make claims to the vast majority of the South China Sea,” she said. “Beijing’s actions continue to undermine the rules-based order and threaten the sovereignty of nations.” Beijing hits back But Beijing hit back, holding up the Afghan debacle as an example of Washington’s “selfish” foreign policy, and accusing Washington of “bullying, hegemonic behaviour”. “The current events in Afghanistan clearly tell us what the rules and order the U.S. speaks of are,” China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said. China claims almost all of the resource-rich South China Sea, through which trillions of dollars in shipping trade passes annually, with competing claims from four Southeast Asian states as well as Taiwan.  Ms. Harris also sought to allay fears that growing U.S.-China tensions could force countries that have strong ties with both of the world’s top economies to choose sides. “Our engagement in Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific is not against any one country, nor is it designed to make anyone choose between countries,” she said.  In Tuesday’s speech, she defended Biden’s decision to push ahead with the U.S. pull-out from Afghanistan as “courageous and right” and reiterated that the U.S. officials were “laser-focused” on the chaotic evacuation from Kabul airport.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/kamala-harris-accuses-china-of-intimidation-in-disputed-seas/article36090958.ece
25 August 2021||August 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Samaraweera, an advocate of liberalism, dies||Mangala Samaraweera, a former Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka and a notable advocate of liberalism from the country’s dominant Sinhala-Buddhist polity, passed away at a private hospital in Colombo after treatment for COVID-19-related complications failed. He was 65.  Raised in capital Colombo, Mr. Samaraweera hailed from the southern Matara district where he began his political career as a chief organiser for the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). From the late 1980s, Mr. Samaraweera campaigned for women whose sons or husbands who disappeared or were killed in the government’s crackdown against the leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) that led two armed insurrections against the State. He was a co-convener of the ‘Mothers’ Front’ movement, along with Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, his party colleague then, raising human rights violations during former President Ranasinghe Premadasa’s time in office. Having built his political career in the SLFP, mainly under former Presidents Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa, Mr. Samaraweera defected to the rival United National Party (UNP) in 2010, after he fell out with Mr. Rajapaksa. Mr. Samaraweera rose to Cabinet rank during different dispensations, making a mark in key Ministries at challenging times for the country. He served as Foreign Minister twice, from 2005 to 2007 in former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s first term in office, and from 2015 to 2017 in the Maithripala Sirisena-Ranil Wickremesinghe ‘national unity’ government, when he engaged closely with the international community, with Sri Lanka promising to fulfil several commitments towards post-war accountability and transitional justice. Despite his efforts, the ‘national unity’ government is widely criticised for failing to fulfil its commitments, especially those made to the war-affected Tamil community. He shared a special friendship with former External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj. Call for U-turn Mr. Samaraweera stayed out of the August 2020 parliamentary elections that saw the Rajapaksas consolidate power in the legislature. Slamming the culture of militarisation, ethnic and religious polarisation in Sri Lanka, Mr. Samaraweera called for “a radical centre”, with a “commitment to liberalism and centrist values”. He remained a bold voice over the last few years, critical of the Rajapaksa administration’s domestic and foreign policy. He stood out, challenging the Buddhist clergy who wield great influence in politics, and consistently speaking for minority rights. In a social media post last month, Mr. Samaraweera indicated he was disillusioned with the country’s two main political parties — SLFP and UNP — of which he was part of at different times. Their latest versions — the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP or People’s Front) of the Rajapaksas and the main Opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB, or United People’s Front) — were “two sides of the same coin”, he said. Sri Lanka is “desperately gasping for a total U-turn” in policy direction, he wrote on July 28.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/samaraweera-an-advocate-of-liberalism-dies/article36090965.ece
25 August 2021||Hong Kong,||Hong Kong to check old films for security breaches||Hong Kong will scrutinise past films for national security breaches under a tough new censorship law announced on Tuesday in the latest blow to the financial hub’s political and artistic freedoms. Authorities have embarked on a sweeping crackdown to root out Beijing’s critics after democracy protests convulsed the city two years ago. A new China-imposed security law and an official campaign dubbed “Patriots rule Hong Kong” has since criminalised much dissent and strangled the democracy movement. Authorities in June said the city’s censorship board would check any future films for content that breached the security law. But on Tuesday they unveiled a new censorship law which would also cover any titles that had previously been given a green light. “Any film for public exhibition, past, present and future, will need to get approval,” Commerce Secretary Edward Yau told reporters. The maximum sentence for showing illegal films will be increased to up to three years jail and a HK$1 million ($130,000) fine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hong-kong-to-check-old-films-for-security-breaches/article36090959.ece

The enemy sides this week have engaged in their heaviest cross-border fighting since an 11-day war in May. In the occupied West Bank, meanwhile, officials said a Palestinian teen was killed in a clash with the Israeli military. The May war between Israel and Hamas militants ended with an inconclusive Egyptian-brokered cease-fire. Since then, Gaza’s Hamas rulers have grown increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress in efforts to cement the truce. Hamas wants Israel to lift a stifling blockade on Gaza, while Israel has demanded the return of the remains of two soldiers, in addition to two captive Israeli civilians, Hamas is believed to be holding. Hamas-backed activists have launched incendiary balloons into southern Israel several times in recent weeks, setting fires on the other side of the border.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israel-strikes-gaza-over-incendiary-balloons/article36090962.ece

25 August 2021||August 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The ugly face of a crime-fighting move||In the monsoon session of Parliament, no meaningful debate could take place due to the controversy over Pegasus, the spyware. Some Indian journalists, civil society activists and political leaders, and a top election strategist were possibly under surveillance. There has been no categorical denial by the Government and that the Israeli software was not purchased. But above this, there is a much bigger issue of the privacy of the entire citizenry which has not received much public attention. On June 23, 2021, the Joint Committee examining the Personal Data Protection Bill (2019) was granted a fifth extension by Parliament (https://bit.ly/388uk4Z). While informational privacy is not the Government’s priority, it has been simultaneously exploring the potential of facial recognition technology. A prying technology To empower the Indian police with information technology, India approved implementation of the National Automated Facial Recognition System (NAFRS) to “facilitate investigation of crime and detection of criminals” in a quick and timely manner. On its implementation, it will function as a national-level search platform that will use facial recognition technology: to facilitate investigation of crime or for identifying a person of interest (e.g., a criminal) regardless of face mask, makeup, plastic surgery, beard or hair extension. The technology is absolutely intrusive: computer algorithms map unique facial-landmarks (biometric data) such as shape of the cheekbones, contours of the lips, distance from forehead to chin, and convert these into a numerical code — termed a faceprint. Thus, for the purposes of ‘verification’ or ‘identification’, the system compares the faceprint generated with a large existing database of faceprints (typically available to law enforcement agencies) through a database on driver’s licence or police mugshots). But the real problem is that facial recognition does not return a definitive result — it ‘identifies’ or ‘verifies’ only in probabilities (e.g., a 70% likelihood that the person shown on an image is the same person on a watch list). Though the accuracy of facial recognition has improved over the years due to modern machine-learning algorithms, the risk of error and bias still exists. For instance, there is a possibility of producing ‘false positives’ — a situation where the algorithm finds an incorrect match, even when there is none — resulting in wrongful arrest. Moreover, much research suggests facial recognition software is based on pre-trained models. Therefore, if certain types of faces (such as female, children, ethnic minorities) are under-represented in training datasets, then this bias will negatively impact its performance. As NAFRS will collect, process, and store sensitive private information: facial biometrics for long periods; if not permanently — it will impact the right to privacy. Accordingly, it is crucial to examine whether its implementation is arbitrary and thus unconstitutional, i.e., is it ‘legitimate’, ‘proportionate to its need’ and ‘least restrictive’? What is its potential for abuse and misuse with the pending-status of the Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB), and the absence of clear guidelines for its deployment? How does it impact other fundamental rights such as the right to dissent? Should NAFRS be banned or simply regulated?  The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States uses facial recognition technology for potential investigative leads; police forces in England use facial recognition to tackle serious violence. In other cases, countries such as China use facial recognition for racial profiling and mass surveillance — to track Uighur Muslims. Policing and law and order being State subjects, some Indian States have started the use of new technologies without fully appreciating the dangers involved. Test of ‘proportionality’ Facial recognition being an intrusive technology has an impact on the right to privacy. The Constitution of India does not explicitly mention the right to privacy. However, a nine-judge Bench of the Supreme Court, in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017) recognised it as a precious fundamental right. Since no fundamental right can be absolute and thus even in respect of privacy, the state may impose reasonable restrictions on the grounds of national integrity, security of the state, public order, etc. The Supreme Court, in the K.S. Puttaswamy judgment provided a three-fold requirement (which was reiterated in Anuradha Bhasin while examining denial of the ‘right to Internet’ to the people of Kashmir) to safeguard against any arbitrary state action. Accordingly, any encroachment on the right to privacy requires the existence of ‘law’ (to satisfy legality of action); there must exist a ‘need’, in terms of a ‘legitimate state interest’; and, the measure adopted must be ‘proportionate’ (there should be a rational nexus between the means adopted and the objective pursued) and it should be ‘least intrusive.’ Unfortunately, NAFRS fails each one of these tests. First, NAFRS lacks ‘legitimacy’. It does not stem from any statutory enactment (such as the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill 2018 proposed to identify offenders or an executive order of the Central Government. Rather, it was merely approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in 2009 during United Progressive Alliance rule. Second, and more importantly, even if we assume that there exists a need for NAFRS to tackle modern day crimes, this measure is grossly disproportionate. This is because to satisfy the test of ‘proportionality’, benefits for the deployment of this technology have to be sufficiently great, and must outweigh the harm. For NAFRS to achieve the objective of ‘crime prevention’ or ‘identification’ will require the system to track people on a mass scale — avoiding a CCTV in a public place is fiendishly difficult — resulting in everyone becoming a subject of surveillance: a disproportionate measure. In the absence of a strong data protection law or clear guidelines on where this technology can be used or who can be put on a watch list? And, how long the system will retain sensitive personal data of those the surveilled people, NAFRS will indeed do more harm than good. Impact on rights From a technical angle, facial recognition technology can be tasked to ‘identify’, among other uses, cases. In doing so, one faceprint is compared to many other faceprints stored in a database (known as 1:N matching). In some cases, it is known that the person to be identified exists in the database, whereas, in other scenarios, it is not (for e.g., when persons are checked against watch lists). This is where its deployment becomes hugely worrisome. With the element of error and bias, facial recognition can result in profiling of some overrepresented groups (such as Dalits and minorities) in the criminal justice system. Further, as anonymity is key to functioning of a liberal democracy, unregulated use of facial recognition technology will dis-incentivise independent journalism or the right to assemble peaceably without arms, or any other form of civic society activism. Due to its adverse impact on civil liberties, some countries have been cautious with the use of facial recognition technology. The Court of Appeal in the United Kingdom ruled the use of facial recognition technology by South Wales as unlawful in the absence of clear guidelines. In the United States, the Facial Recognition and Biometric Technology Moratorium Act of 2020 was introduced in the Senate to prohibit biometric surveillance without statutory authorisation. Similarly, privacy watchdogs in the European Union have called for a ban on facial recognition. Unchecked pathway At present, the Information Technology Act 2000, and the Rules framed thereunder offer broad powers to the Central government to infringe privacy in the name of the sovereignty, integrity or the security of the state. The Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 is not much different. It gives the central government unchecked power for the purposes of surveillance — it can exempt any agency of the Government from the application of the proposed law in the name of legitimate state interest. Without adequate safeguards such as penalties that are dissuasive and sufficiently deterrent, police personnel may routinely use facial recognition technology. In sum, even if facial recognition technology is needed to tackle modern-day criminality in India, without accountability and oversight, facial recognition technology has strong potential for misuse and abuse. In the interest of civil liberties and to save democracy from turning authoritarian, it is important to impose a moratorium on the use of facial recognition technology till we enact a strong and meaningful data protection law, in addition to statutory authorisation of NAFRS and guidelines for deployment. If the Government has the will, it can get any law passed with god speed just like the recently passed 20 Bills including the OBC Bill or three Farm Bills.

25 August 2021||August 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Climate change, a catalyst for Arctic cooperation||It is tempting to view the current geopolitics of the Arctic through the lenses of the ‘great power competition’ and inevitable conflict of interests. Interestingly, the current geopolitical scenario is, to a certain extent, mirrored in the Arctic region as well. This is mainly about the growing tensions between North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies and Russia. There are eight countries that have direct access to the Arctic resources, i.e., Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden and the United States. In 2013, six Observers joined the Council, including China, Japan, India, Italy, South Korea, and Singapore, bringing their total number to 13. Security concerns By the end of the Cold War, the geopolitical tensions and security concerns in the Arctic were almost forgotten. In October 1987, during a visit to the Kola Peninsula, Mikhail Gorbachev, then Secretary-General of the Soviet Communist Party, acknowledged the end of the Cold War era and promoted a ‘zone of peace’ in the Arctic. The perceived ‘harmony’ was broken in 2007, when the Russian explorers planted their flag on the seabed 4,200m (13,779ft) below the North Pole to articulate Moscow’s claims in the Arctic. This move was certainly viewed as provocative by other Arctic States, and the Canadian Foreign Minister, Peter MacKay, said “this is not the 15th century”, and “countries cannot just go around, plant their flags, and claim the territories”. The regional tension increased after the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2014. Consequently, relations between the U.S. and Russia reached their lowest point again. The rhetoric of the bilateral mistrust was transferred ‘up to the North’ and created anxiety among other stakeholders in the Arctic. After the events in Ukraine in 2014, Russia has been increasingly viewed as a ‘rule-breaker’, ‘revisionist power’ and an ‘untrustworthy player’. Besides, Russia’s intention to re-establish the military might of its Northern Fleet also creates the security concerns and features prominently in the Norwegian foreign policy. On the other hand, some Russian military experts believe that the Barents Sea can serve as the launching area for a western seaborne attack; therefore, the Russian Navy should ensure the readiness of its anti-submarine forces in the Arctic Ocean. The eco-dimension In the last decades, we have been confronted with the multiple ‘wake-up calls’ that are related to climate change; and these calls are getting louder. The summer of 2021 would be recorded in history as one of the most devastating seasons of our times, when ferocious floods and wildfires were destroying communities in many parts of the world. Due to the environmental transformations, natural catastrophes occur unexpectedly — on an unprecedented scale, and in unusual geographic locations. For example, the extreme heat in North America or wildfires in Russian Siberia (Yakutia), where the winter temperature can be below minus 40°  . The Arctic region also bears the brunt of climate change. At the same time, it provides a platform for scientific research that can help to get to the bottom of natural calamities around the world. Keeping in mind the existential threats, the environmental challenges should be an absolute priority for all players in the Arctic region. These considerations should outweigh military and economic issues and unite countries for the sake of eliminating the potential (and real) dangers attributed to climate change. According to The World Climate and Security Report 2020 (https://bit.ly/3mrTmo5; the first report of the Expert Group of the International Military Council on Climate and Security, or the IMCCS), ‘the Arctic is warming nearly twice as fast as the rest of the planet with consecutive record-breaking warm years since 2014... The Arctic is likely to begin experiencing ice-free summers within the next decade, with summers likely to be completely free of sea ice by mid-century’. There should be concerted efforts to minimise the adverse effects on the fragile Arctic ecosystem. A good example to be highlighted is the recent case of a Norwegian drilling project; it was taken to the European court by the group of environmentalists. Their main argument is that the negative impact of mining activities can spread beyond the continental shelf of Norway. The geopolitical vs strategic The environmental transformation and rapid ice melting have also opened up new opportunities in the region, which includes trans-Arctic shipping routes. These opportunities have inevitably attracted all stakeholders in the region, both the Arctic and non-Arctic states. China, for example, with its self-proclaimed status of a ‘near Arctic state’, has been actively engaged in various projects across the region. The importance of the Arctic region for China mostly stems from its energy security issues and the need to diversify shipping lanes. Transport routes from China to Europe through the Arctic are not only much shorter but also free from the challenges associated with the Malacca Strait and South China Sea. In the latter case, China will continue facing a backlash from many Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members, supported by U.S. forces. Given the significance of the region, the Arctic will continue to draw increased attention. Apart from pursuing national interests, participating nations should also be concerned about the future developments in the region and their larger implications for humanity. Hence, they should refrain from mutual provocations, excessive militarisation, and quid pro quo tactics. All the Arctic actors should have a long-term vision and strategic goals as compared to immediate short-term gains. Instead of creating a potential battleground that is reminiscent of the Cold War, the parties concerned should utilise their expertise and create the required synergy to achieve shared goals. Climate change and its dramatic consequences must be a catalyst for Arctic cooperation. Tatiana Belousova is Assistant Professor, Jindal School of International Affairs (JSIA), O.P.

25 August 2021||August 25 2021 00:00 IST,||The legal challenges in recognising the Taliban||The Taliban’s horrific takeover of Afghanistan has triggered a new debate in international law on the issue of recognising an entity that claims to be the new government of a state. This debate assumes significance because China and Russia, two of the five permanent United Nations Security Council members, have seemingly shown readiness to recognise a Taliban-led government whereas countries like Canada have opposed it. Questions of recognition do not arise when change of government within a state occurs when political power is transferred through legal means. However, things are different when the change of government happens through extra-legal methods like ousting the sitting government using unconstitutional means. The Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan squarely falls in this category. Recognition of governments under international law is vital for several reasons. It is important to know who the governing authority of the state is, who has the responsibility for effectually carrying out domestic and international legal obligations ranging from pursuing diplomatic relations to the protection of human rights, and so on. Government versus state A salient point to remember is that recognition of the government should not be confused with recognition of the state under international law. As Malcolm Shaw, the celebrated international lawyer, writes, “a change in government, however accomplished, does not affect the identity of the State itself.” Thus, in the current debate, the issue is not about the recognition of Afghanistan, whose legal personality remains intact. Whether countries recognise the Taliban regime or not will depend on their political considerations and geo-strategic interests, as evident from the Chinese and Russian overtures. However, certain criteria have evolved in international law on deciding the issue of recognition of governments and these need to be prudently looked at. Tests in international law Traditionally, the test used in international law to make a decision about the recognition of a new government is that of ‘effectiveness’. According to this principle, to recognise a government means to determine whether it effectively controls the state it claims to govern. In other words, it means to determine whether the government has effective control over the state’s territory (or a part of it), a majority of the population, national institutions, the banking and monetary system, etc. with a reasonable possibility of permanence. The inherent assumption is that effective control means the people of the country accept, or at least acquiesce to, the new regime; if they did not, they would overthrow it. Under this doctrine, it is immaterial how the new government occupied office (whether through civil war, revolution, or a military coup). Since there is hardly any doubt that the Taliban now effectively controls Afghanistan, as per this test, it would be recognised as Afghanistan’s government for international law and thus, international relations. A doctrine competing with the effective control theory is that of democratic legitimacy. According to this doctrine, recognition of a government also depends on whether it is the legitimate representative of the people it claims to govern. So, governments that capture power through non-democratic means — notwithstanding their exercising de facto control over the country — should not be recognised by states. The end of the Cold War, the subsequent spread of democracy in the world, and the growing demand for universal respect for human rights gave an impetus to this doctrine in the last three decades. This doctrine has led many countries to bestow de jure recognition (legal recognition) on governments in exile in place of governments exercising effective control. Two recent examples can be offered. First, many countries recognised Yemen’s Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi government in exile since 2015 on the ground that the rebellious separatists acquired power in Yemen through illegal means. Second, the Nicolás Maduro government in Venezuela is not recognised by several countries due to the alleged lack of democratic legitimacy. The Taliban regime, despite exercising effective control over Afghanistan, lacks democratic legitimacy. Thus, it would fail to be recognised as the legitimate representative of Afghanistan if the doctrine of democratic legitimacy is applied. Things would become even more complicated if the Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani, who fled the country when the Taliban entered Kabul, were to announce a government in exile. However, some international lawyers like Erika de Wet doubt whether the doctrine of democratic legitimacy, notwithstanding its worth and instinctive appeal to the champions of liberal democracy, has become a binding part of customary international law when it comes to the recognition of governments. In other words, governments may rely on the doctrine of democratic legitimacy to refuse de jure recognition of the Taliban. Nevertheless, there is no binding legal obligation on countries to withhold recognition of the Taliban on the ground that it does not enjoy democratic legitimacy. Thus, if Russia and China were to formally recognise the Taliban regime due to its effective control of Afghanistan, it would be consistent with international law. Options for India Given the Taliban’s brutal past, its extremist ideology, and profound absence of democratic legitimacy, India is within its right to withhold de jure recognition of the Taliban regime. Nonetheless, it will have to find a way to engage with the Taliban given India’s huge investments in Afghanistan and stakes in the South Asian region. India should adopt a clear policy that it will deal with the Taliban simply because it is the de facto government, not because it is a legitimate one. This principle should be followed for bilateral relations and also for multilateral dealings such as within the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.

25 August 2021||August 25 2021 00:00 IST,||A surfeit of sero surveys||A sero surveillance survey ascertains the prevalence of a past infectious disease in a population. In the case of COVID-19, it helps to detect whether antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are present in a population. The antibodies are like evidence in a crime scene and the virus is like a criminal. But to prevent the criminal from repeating the crime, we need to conduct RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT). With this information, we can isolate the individual and prevent further infection and also manage complications of the infection if they arise. Benefits of sero surveys If anyone has had a severe case of COVID-19, can they walk around freely believing that they won’t get the infection again as they have developed adequate natural antibodies? No. They can still be asymptomatic carriers of the virus. They cannot be exempted from COVID-19-appropriate behaviour. And they must get vaccinated too. In other words, all sero positive individuals have to observe COVID-19-appropriate behaviour and get fully vaccinated. This means that sero surveys don’t personally benefit individuals. For public health authorities, sero surveys are of varying use at different phases of the pandemic. Such surveys are widely used by the media and by epidemiologists to show under-reporting of cases and deaths due to COVID-19. Independent sero surveillance data can expose the level of data suppression. After releasing the fourth sero survey results, the ICMR recommended acceleration of vaccination of the vulnerable population, especially yet-to-be-vaccinated health staff; tracking COVID-19 infection in SARI cases in hospitals; and identifying clusters of current cases and cases of clinical severity for genome sequencing which would help track mutations of the virus. But these are valid irrespective of the sero conversion levels. The second use of sero surveys is to find out whether community transmission has taken place or not. The ICMR was right in refuting some accounts by the media in mid-2020 that community transmission had taken place without the system knowing about it. Many demanded RAT or RT-PCR tests on a large scale. That would have been a wrong public health action. The first sero prevalence survey in May-June 2020 showed that overall infection was 0.73%. The relevant public health actions to be taken then were rapid case detection, isolation and containment measures as vaccines were not ready then. In August 2020, the second survey showed that sero prevalence had increased to 7.1%. Even after the first wave, when evidence of rapid transmission was emerging, we needed an additional weapon to fight the virus apart from observing COVID-19-appropriate behaviour and that was vaccination. The third use of sero surveys is to assess how far or close we are to herd immunity. Many virologists said that 60% of the population should be immune to COVID-19 for us to reach herd immunity. We were nowhere near a herd immunity level at that time. Though there were claims that parts of the urban poor population in Mumbai and Pune had 70% developing antibodies, the third survey found that after the first wave, only 21.4% Indians had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The degree of change was highest in rural areas at 19.1%. In non-slum urban areas, it was 26.2%, while in urban slums the prevalence had increased to 31.7%. The fourth survey showed that 67.6% of the population had developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 meeting the earlier prophesied threshold for herd immunity. Now, we have to change the goalpost to 80-90%. There are breakthrough infections everywhere. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has reported that over 81% have developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Ahmedabad, but there continue to be cases. Cost-benefit analysis Under these circumstances, it is not rational for public health experts to advise governments to embark upon city-wise seroprevalence surveys to detect the presence of COVID-19 antibodies. Those surveys are no more useful than our COVID-19-appropriate behaviour and vaccinations to control the pandemic. For an academic documentation of the trend of the pandemic spread and penetration among communities, one national-level ICMR survey is good enough. A survey of 5,000 people per city costs around Rs. 25 lakh. This is not a good investment for a country still grappling with the pandemic. If we do a cost-benefit analysis, frequent sero surveys are a poor use of staff time, technology and funds and divert attention from the core activities of screening, testing and other containment measures. The genome analysis of breakthrough cases in spite of vaccination is more beneficial for evidence-based policy changes. K.R. Antony is a pediatrician and public health consultant based in Kochi.

25 August 2021||August 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Rethinking a perk for players||After winning seven medals at the Tokyo Olympics, the Indian contingent was felicitated by the sports federations, the Sports Ministry and even the Prime Minister. They were invited as special guests to the Independence Day function at the Red Fort in New Delhi. They were also given monetary awards by various State governments, sports bodies and others. Neeraj Chopra, a junior commissioned officer in the Army who won a gold medal in javelin, received Rs. 6 crore from the Haryana government, a Class-I government job, and a plot of land at a concessional rate. He was also offered Rs. 2 crore by the Punjab government, Rs. 1 crore by the BCCI, Rs. 1 crore by the Chennai Super Kings, Rs. 2 crore by BYJU’S and Rs. 1 crore by the JSW Group. Ravi Dahiya and Mirabai Chanu, both silver medallists, were also richer by crores after their performance. The bronze winners were awarded in lakhs. Jobs and promotions In addition to cash incentives, States also offer government jobs. The Railways is the biggest employer of sportspersons. It provides a secure job for athletes. Chanu was working in the Railways. In a departure from the usual mode of appointment, she was appointed as Additional Superintendent of Police, a rank above that of Deputy Superintendent of Police, after winning the silver medal. Chopra is expected to get a promotion in the Army. The problem begins when sportspersons are appointed to a certain rank after which the floodgates are thrown open for further promotions. It may not really be deleterious to an organisation if sportspersons are promoted in non-gazetted ranks. But promotion to gazetted ranks have a malefic impact not just on the organisation but also on the sportspersons. Even after they are promoted to gazetted ranks, they naturally continue to play sports and participate in tournaments up to a certain age and have no exposure whatsoever to their professional requirements. On attaining higher ranks like Superintendent of Police, they come back to their jobs without any training, exposure or experience. They prove to be misfits. Nobody other than the system stands to be blamed for this sad state of affairs. While others slog to get into government jobs as gazetted officers, these posts are offered to sportspersons on a silver platter. Going by the monetary incentives offered to eminent sportspersons, there is a definite need to reconsider whether promotions need to be doled out to them irrespective of their professional competence to hold higher posts and ranks. This is especially the case in the security forces, where competence of a high order is called for. Contributing to their sport Alternatively, with crores of rupees in their accounts, such eminent sportspersons can venture into business and employ more sportspersons and do a world of good to their respective sports. They can set up academies to train sportspersons in their field of specialisation and thus promote their sport. The Sports Ministry and the Sports Authority of India could recruit them in various capacities and utilise their experience not only at the Central level but also in the States. Universities, colleges and schools could better utilise their services. Many of them could turn out to be good coaches. For gazetted posts, the only channel should be competitive examinations. Recent reports stated that the number of employment offers given through job fairs organised by the Labour and Employment Ministry has fallen but applicants have increased. In these days of acute unemployment, it would be better if the needy got into government service on merit. M.P.

25 August 2021||August 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Caste counts||The clamour for a fresh caste census is getting louder in the country. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar led a delegation of 10 political parties of the State to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday. No political party in the country has publicly opposed the demand as yet, and most have supported the call. Mr. Modi listened to the delegation but did not open his mind on the topic. Predictably, there will be more political mobilisation on the issue. The Bharatiya Janata Party has the advantage of being in the saddle and could time an announcement best suited for itself. The last time India’s population was enumerated on the basis of caste was in 1931, when it was under colonial rule. There is a strong argument that the colonial census was about creating and reinforcing caste and religious categories in India rather than recording them in a benign manner. Effective governance requires robust data on the governed. The creation of categories is itself a political act. Indian politics and the governance structure are all premised on categories that were firmed up during colonialism. But the salience of caste as the fundamental marker of identity for an Indian has only grown since Independence. As the democratisation of society deepens, questions are being raised regarding the status of Dalits, tribal communities and a large section of the population that is characterised in the Constitution as Socially and Educationally Backward Classes. Political representation of these communities has increased and their participation in government jobs has risen. It is assumed that particular groups within each category have benefited disproportionately from political and job reservations, and there are demands for sub-quotas. Many communities are demanding inclusion in one category or the other. Some communities are feeling short-changed by the affirmative action steps of the state. With the role of the Government as a big employer diminishing, there is a demand for affirmative action in the private sector. All these questions are being debated without adequate and reliable data, leading to conflicting and often misleading claims. Supporters of a caste census cite these reasons, while sceptics fear it will only widen social rifts. They also point to the multitude of practical problems such an exercise will encounter. What is not debatable, however, is the fact that inequitable distribution of power and wealth endangers the stability of any society. Partisan political gains should not be the motivation for a fresh census. A renewed vision for a just and united India, where all divides are reduced must guide the discussion on a caste census.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/caste-counts/article36090939.ece
25 August 2021||August 25 2021 00:00 IST,||In free fall||Lebanon, which has been battling multiple crises for the last couple of years, is on the brink of an economic collapse. The meltdown that forced the country to default on its bonds in 2019 for the first time since its independence in 1943 was aggravated by last year’s Beirut port blast. The explosion that killed over 200 people and wounded about 7,000 others on August 4, 2020 is estimated to have caused damage worth $15 billion. The blast has also deepened the country’s political crisis as Lebanon has been ruled by a caretaker government ever since. The Mediterranean country is now reeling under a severe economic downturn, medicine, food and fuel shortages and rising crimes. Recently, its central bank stated that it could no longer finance fuel imports at subsidised rates citing depleted reserves. Fuel shortages have led to chaotic scenes across the country. Last week, at least 28 people were killed in the country’s north when a fuel tank exploded while locals were scrambling for its fuel. UNICEF has warned that millions of Lebanese are facing a severe water shortage. The economic crisis has pushed more than half the population into poverty, while the currency value has fallen by 90%. According to the World Bank, Lebanon’s GDP per capita fell by 40% in dollar terms between 2018 and 2020, while real GDP contracted by 20.3% in 2020. The Bank assesses that even with quick reforms, it will take years before the economy gets back to its pre-crisis size. Since the Beirut blast, President Michel Aoun appointed three Prime Minister-designates. Two of them stepped down after having failed to form a government. According to Lebanon’s Constitution, the President should be a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister a Sunni, and the Parliament Speaker a Shia. Political parties are divided largely along sectarian lines. The PM-designates, who were Sunni politicians or technocrats, often failed to bring together the country’s different political factions, including that of President Aoun. In late July, former Prime Minister Najib Mikati was tasked with forming the next government. He is yet to conclude talks with other political blocs. With the country facing a severe fuel shortage, Hezbollah, the powerful Shia militia-cum-political party, has moved to import fuel directly from Iran. Hezbollah says it is trying to ease the country’s fuel situation while its opponents say the move is aimed at drawing Lebanon further into the Iranian orbit and could be counterproductive as oil deals with Iran could attract sanctions from the U.S. Lebanon’s politicians have sought fresh loans from the IMF, but the fund will release money only if the government commits itself to reforms. For that, Lebanon has to form a government first. Lebanon’s political elites should realise that the country is facing a once-in-a-century crisis, set aside their sectarian politics, and come together to form a stable government. If not, nothing can stop the country’s free fall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-free-fall/article36090940.ece

With one Test won and the other two drawn, India has won the series to reach a mile-stone in its cricket history. It was the first ever win for India against England on English soil. It was India’s superb fielding as typified by Solkar’s spectacular catch that sent back Knott and splendid spin-bowling exemplified by Chandrasekhar’s match-winning spell (six for 38) which sent England crashing to a paltry total of 101 in the second innings, England’s lowest against India, which tilted the scales in India’s favour. The series proved most exciting with fortunes fluctuating from one side to the other. At Lord’s India let slip a golden opportunity of getting off to a flying start and eventually struggling for a draw, rain after tea helping in no small measure. The second Test at Old Trafford belonged to England and it was the weather that definitely came to India’s rescue. At the Oval the game was unpredictable till the end. England, which appeared to hold the initiative with a first innings lead of 71 runs, was skittled out for 101. India made the requisite runs for the loss of six wickets shortly after lunch on the final day with Abid Ali making the winning stroke with a four when it required three runs for a victory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/indian-crickets-finest-hour/article36090949.ece
25 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Need protection from sudden MNC exits: auto dealers to govt.||The Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) on Tuesday urged the Centre to set up a framework to help protect the rights of auto dealers in cases of sudden exits of manufacturers from the market. Participating in the Auto Retail Conclave, attended by the Union Minister of Heavy Industries Mahendra Nath Pandey and SIAM President Kenichi Ayukawa, FADA also sought industry status for the auto retail sector to aid in better financing options. Stressing the need for OEMs and dealers to work together as partners in order to ensure a “win-win for all”, Mr. Ayukawa called for dealer workshops to be allowed to function as inspection and certification centres under the vehicle scrappage policy. He said SIAM was also requesting the government to start the fitness testing process much earlier in the life of a car, noting that the current 15-year or 20-year period appeared too long. Addressing the minister, FADA President Vinkesh Gulati observed that his ministry gave permissions to MNCs such as OEMs to set up businesses in India, and with the government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative many new players were likely to come to India. ‘High and dry’ "Once they begin their journey, they appoint dealers as their long term partners. It is their sudden exits which hamper both, an entrepreneur's zeal to do business with them and the customers who are left high and dry with no proper support for after sales," he said. Mr. Gulati said these exits not only tarnished the dealers' names, as they were the face of the brand, but also Brand India's value.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/need-protection-from-sudden-mnc-exits-auto-dealers-to-govt/article36090932.ece

Indian platforms Three of the largest public digital platforms in the world — Aadhaar, UPI, and CoWIN — were from India, which had significantly fast-tracked the country’s pivot to digitalisation and become integral to its $5-trillion dollar economy aspiration, the report titled Digital India: The Platformisation Play, said. “As we move from products to platforms, it is commendable to see how these platforms are now taking over the world,” said Ajay Sawhney, Secretary, MeitY. “We aim to witness a sea change from making the government services available to people in a more efficient yet convenient manner,” Mr. Sawhney added. “Such platforms can not only bridge the silos we work in, but also help us organise our data with the help of technology, creating tremendous value for all stakeholders,” he said at the Nasscom Cloud Summit, where the report was unveiled. “Digital platforms help in the systematic creation of value generation,” said Nandan Nilekani, founding chairman, UIDAI, and co-founder and chairman, Infosys. “The collaborative way of getting AI, data empowerment, and digital lending are some areas where we will be focusing on in the near future,” he added.

Videocon had sold its mobile spectrum to the Bharti group. A three-judge Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao provided the temporary relief to the Bharti group (represented by senior advocate Shyam Divan) which had moved the apex court challenging the notice issued by DoT on August 17 for payment of AGR dues of Videocon. DoT had asked Bharti to pay within a week of the date of the notice, failing which the bank guarantees were to be invoked. Mr. Divan, in the course of the hearing, agreed to withdraw from the Supreme Court to approach the “appropriate forum” for redressal against the notice. Granting it liberty to do so, the Bench in turn noted that the DoT was “at liberty to raise all contentions”. The Bharti group has paid Rs. 18,004 crore in AGR-related dues to DoT till March 31, 2021, which is much more than 10% of its total AGR dues of more than Rs. 43,000 crore, Mr. Divan argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/dont-invoke-bharti-guarantees-for-3-weeks/article36090783.ece

25 August 2021||Kolkata,||ATKMB enters knockout semifinals||ATK Mohun Bagan (ATKMB)made it to the inter-zonal semifinals of the AFC Cup as it held its final Group-D opponent Bashundhara Kings of Bangladesh to a 1-1 draw in Male on Tuesday. Bashundhara Kings took the lead around the half-hour mark through its Brazilian midfielder Jonathan Fernandes. ATK MB equalised just past the hour-mark through Australian forward David Williams. Sushanto gets red The Kings were reduced to 10 men in the stoppage time of the first half when right-winger Sushanto Tripura was given a red card. ATKMB looked disorganised at the start. Needing a win to make it to the next round, the Bangladesh side did well to stick to a pressing game to unsettle the rhythm of the ATK MB, which needed a draw to advance. Fernandes put Kings in the lead in the 28th minute, firing a sharp grounder from the edge of the box that beat ATKMB goalkeeper Amrinder Singh all ends up.  Faced with the prospect of an imminent exit, ATKMB tried to regroup after conceding the goal. The equaliser The equaliser came after change of ends when Kings appeared on the defensive mode. In the 62nd minute Liston Colaco did the hard work on the flanks and set up Williams with a nice cross. The Australian forward had no problem in placing the ball home. ATKMB will now play the winner of the Central Zone final which is scheduled on Wednesday between Uzbekistan Club FC Nasaf and Turkmenistan club Ahal FC. The inter-zonal semifinal will be played on Sept. 22.  The result: Group-D: ATKMB 1 (David Williams 62) drew with Bashundhara Kings 1 (Jonathan Fernandes 28); BFC 6 (Udanta 6, Cleiton 19, Leon 36, Sivasakthi 70, Bidyashagar 85, 90+2) bt Maziya 2 (Hamza 67, Asadhulla 82).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/atkmb-enters-knockout-semifinals/article36091083.ece
25 August 2021||August 25 2021 00:00 IST,||A tale of two of the finest off-spinners, fifty years apart||Team balance usually scores over the record of individuals in selection. Fifty years ago when India won a series in England for the first time, their most successful bowler didn’t play a single Test. This was off-spinner Erapalli Prasanna, who in 25 Tests earlier had claimed 124 wickets including 49 in eight Tests in Australia and New Zealand. He was the best in the world. Ian Chappell, one of the finest players of spin, called him ‘maestro’ (he continues to do so). Even the English media were shocked at the omission. And now history seems to be repeating itself. Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, with 413 wickets, this Indian side’s most successful bowler, found himself excess to requirements in the first two Tests. That must be difficult to accept for someone who has played 79 Tests and was once spoken of as a potential captain. Like Prasanna (also spoken of as a captain but who never led), he is an engineer; the former had to give up cricket for five years while he completed the course to keep a promise to his father. Prasanna’s main rival was Srinivas Venkatraghavan, whose tighter off-spin and sharper fielding (he was a great catcher at gully) meant that he fit best into skipper Ajit Wadekar’s plans. He was the better batter too, but didn’t live up to potential at the international level. Tribute to pace attack It is a tribute to India’s pace attack today that one spinner is considered sufficient for away Tests. Thus Ravindra Jadeja, the better fielder and the more restrictive spinner, is the better option, especially if giving the fast bowlers some rest is an important role. Indian cricket falls into convenient axioms quite easily. The received wisdom is: Ashwin the lead spinner for home matches, Jadeja when playing away. Wadekar never fully articulated why he preferred Venkatraghavan to Prasanna who had been his predecessor Tiger Pataudi’s go-to bowler at every turn. Pataudi’s theory was that the four best bowlers should play regardless of whether they were spinners or seamers. Perhaps Wadekar figured that with the match-winner Bhagwat Chandrasekhar at one end and the relatively restrictive and accurate Venkatraghavan at the other, the choice ought to be between Prasanna and Bishan Bedi, attacking bowlers both, who flighted the ball and did not shy away from ‘buying’ their wickets by giving away runs. It kept out the bowler who had been India’s spearhead on the tours preceding. Modern teams don’t buy into the ‘best available’ theory but look for better balance. In the first Test in England it meant that two bowlers — Ishant Sharma being the other — who between them had over 700 Test wickets were not selected. That is India’s reserve strength! It has been a while now since India have had an all-rounder who makes the team on the strength of his batting or bowling alone. This has affected balance, but then again, not if victories in Australia and England are any indication. Hardik Pandya showed some promise before injuries disrupted his career. Two-out-of-three theory Test teams now follow the two-out-of-three theory in selection. This is borrowed from white-ball cricket where a player is expected to contribute substantially in two of the three crafts — batting, bowling, fielding. The pure specialist (who might be a great bowler or the best wicket-keeper) thus misses out. There was a time when Ashwin was fielded in the slips, and he responded by taking some fine catches. But it was felt that the threat of finger injury was not worth the risk (Shane Warne was an exception in that position). Jadeja fits into the scheme of things well. He has over two thousand runs and two hundred wickets in Tests and his limitations are his strength since he will not experiment too much. He knows his role, and is under no pressure bowling even on the fifth day of a Test, as he showed at Lord’s where he bowled just six overs. That was all he was needed to do. Teams tend not to change a winning combination, and if India stay with the one that won at Lord’s, it will mean that Ashwin will have to wait a bit longer. At Headingley, where they play next, India pulled off one of their great wins in 2002. Skipper Sourav Ganguly won the toss, and in overcast conditions on a wicket with a tinge of green favouring the seamers, he chose to bat. It was a brave decision, and it paid off handsomely with the skipper himself, Sachin Tendulkar, and Rahul Dravid all making centuries. India went in with two spinners, Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh, and won by an innings. They followed the ‘best bowling attack’ theory then. In sport, victory is the ultimate justification. Whether in 1971 or in 2021.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-tale-of-two-of-the-finest-off-spinners-fifty-years-apart/article36090934.ece
25 August 2021||CHENNAI,||Abhishek Pradhan knocks out top seed Abhay Singh||Playing in his first tournament since COVID-19 struck the country, Abhishek Pradhan made short work of top-seeded Abhay Singh 11-8, 11-6, 11-6 in just 24 minutes to progress to the semifinals of the HCL-SRFI Indian Tour squash tournament, a PSA Challenger Tour-10 event, at the ISA courts here on Tuesday. Smooth sailing However, it was smooth sailing for the top seed in the women’s section with Sunayna Kuruvilla overcoming Urwashi Joshi, the fifth seed, 17-15, 11-6, 11-3 in the quarterfinals. Harinderpal Singh Sandhu, the second seed, conceded complaining of groin pain, while trailing 4-9 in the first game against S. Velavan, in the men’s quarterfinals.  Abhishek, seeded sixth, was solid from the backcourt, seldom making any unforced errors. Though he didn’t come up with many drop shots, his double boasts fetched him quite a few points, especially in the third game. “Abhay was not the player one knows about. He was subdued for the most part, lacking in intensity and fighting spirit. “I was expecting a tougher battle, and in fact, the last time we met at the Maharashtra Open State closed Satellite tournament in 2018, I beat him in five games,” said Abhishek, who was found COVID-19 positive when he came to play in the PSA Challenger tournament here in March-April this year. Dream run Akshaya Sri continued her dream run, with an authoritative 11-9, 11-8, 11-2 win over Sachika Balvani, the third seed.  The results (quarterfinals):   Men: S. Velavan bt Harinderpal Singh Sandhu 9-4 (concd.); Abhishek Agarwal bt Kanhav Nanavati 11-7, 11-5, 11-5.   Rahul Baitha bt Aadit Zaveri 11-7, 11-6, 11-1; Abhishek Pradhan bt Abhay Singh 11-8, 11-6, 11-6.

25 August 2021||August 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Prick us at your peril: Kohli||The Englishmen will do well to avoid riling the Indians. As seen in the second Test, any aggression is met with fierce resistance. Ahead of the third Test, commencing at Leeds on Wednesday, India skipper Virat Kohli stated that provocation from the opposition only sharpens his men’s focus. Motivation “I cannot give you details of the words spoken (during the second Test). It is for the cameras and the stump mics to pick up. What’s said on the field gives you extra motivation to get together as a team even more strongly. “It gives you absolute clarity on what you need to do. When you are playing competitive sport these things happen, but what matters is how you react to that situation,” Kohli said at a media interaction on Tuesday. Kohli said there was no reason to change the playing eleven which got the job done at Lord’s in style. The skipper, however, mentioned that off-spinner R. Ashwin — yet to get a game this series — could be considered. “You don’t want to disturb or interrupt a winning combination, especially when the team has achieved such an incredible win. The players are even more excited to take the field again, and do the things that we really enjoyed doing,” Kohli said. The pitch may not be as seamer-friendly as expected, Kohli said, giving rise to the possibility of Ashwin getting a game. “We were quite surprised on seeing the pitch. I thought there would be more grass on the pitch, and that it would be more spicy and lively. Anything is possible. We will have a look at the pitch, and what it could become on day three, day four, and accordingly we will go with the right combination,” Kohli said, when asked about Ashwin’s chances. Praise for Siraj Kohli was all praise for fast bowler Mohammed Siraj, who bowled with fire to claim eight wickets at Lord’s. “I was not surprised at all with his growth because I have seen him from close quarters (Siraj and Kohli are RCB teammates). He always had the skill. You need the confidence to back that skill, and the Australia series provided him with that boost. “Siraj is walking around knowing he can get anyone out at any stage. The belief in his game has been elevated to another level,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/prick-us-at-your-peril-kohli/article36091044.ece
25 August 2021||TOKYO,||Pared-down ceremony in a nearly empty stadium ushers in the Games||Japanese emperor Naruhito declared the Tokyo Paralympics open in a nearly empty 68,000-capacity Olympic Stadium on Tuesday, with athletes ready to defy stereotypes and shatter records despite a year-long pandemic delay. The pared-down ceremony took place in front of around 800 VIPs and officials, but there was a celebratory mood as 162 teams enjoyed their long-awaited moment in the global spotlight. The ceremony took “We Have Wings” as its concept, creating a mini “airport” on the stadium field and telling the story of a one-winged plane that takes to the skies. Reduced parade A reduced parade of roughly 3,400 Paralympians and team officials entered the stadium, wearing masks but waving and dancing after the disappointment of the postponement and worries about a potential cancellation. Javelin thrower Tek Chand carried the Indian tricolour after Thangavelu Mariyappan was quarantined following close contact with a COVID-19 positive person on the flight to Tokyo. Mariyappan and five other members of the Indian contingent have been placed in quarantine. A volunteer carried Afghanistan’s flag into the stadium as a “sign of solidarity” with athletes from the country, which is one of 21 nations unable to compete at the Games. The 13-day Games, with 539 gold medals up for grabs across 22 sports, arrives two weeks after the close of an Olympics that also took place almost entirely behind closed doors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pared-down-ceremony-in-a-nearly-empty-stadium-ushers-in-the-games/article36091042.ece
25 August 2021||KOCHI,||O. Chandrasekharan passes away||O. Chandrasekharan, a defender in one of India’s finest football teams, passed away here on Tuesday. He was 86 and is survived by wife, two sons and a daughter. Chandrasekharan was a member of the Indian team at the 1960 Rome Olympics and also a star of the team that won gold at the 1962 Jakarta Asian Games, the country’s last triumph at the Asiad. Just before India’s match against Hungary at the Rome Olympics, the Indian hockey players had a warning for the footballers. “Don’t concede more than 10 goals, our hockey players told us, for Hungary was the European champion then,” Chandrasekharan had told this writer during a chat a few years ago. But India surprised everybody by giving Hungary a scare, losing narrowly 1-2. It also held France 1-1 and then lost its last league match to Peru 1-3. Top-notch squad Though India finished fourth in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, where Neville D’souza scored a hat-trick against host Australia, legendary coach S.A. Rahim felt that the 1960 team was the best. “Our coach S.A. Rahim always used to say that the Rome team was the best he had coached. And it had around six players who had played in the 1956 Olympics but not Neville, he was not in form then,” Chandrasekharan, who played alongside Neville in Mumbai’s Caltex team at the WIFA Harwood League, had once said. Santosh Trophy success Chandrasekharan who hailed from Irinjalakuda later moved to Mumbai and was the captain of the Maharashtra team that won the Santosh Trophy in the sixties. A genial man, Chandrasekharan was with the State Bank of India and retired as its zonal manager. After S.S. Narayan and S.S. Hakim, who both played in the Rome Olympics team and passed away recently, the country has lost three of its finest football stars in the space of 20 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/o-chandrasekharan-passes-away/article36091088.ece
25 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||It’s a surreal feeling, says Vivek||The Indian men’s hockey team midfielder Vivek Sagar Prasad said it felt surreal to be nominated for the FIH Rising Star of the Year Award for the second time in his career, having already claimed the honour in the 2019-20 season. Vivek was part of the team’s bronze medal winning feat at the Tokyo Olympics earlier this month. “I never imagined this would happen again. It’s a surreal feeling to have been nominated for the second time in the same category (FIH Rising Star of the Year Awards),” Vivek, who is one of the six nominated players, said in a release issued by Hockey India. “I got to know this late in the night when I saw texts from my friends congratulating me. “To be honest, it’s really overwhelming.” The Indian hockey contingent made the shortlist of all the categories of FIH Awards 2020-21. The 21-year-old, who played a vital role in the campaign, credited the seniors. “It’s the result of teamwork and the support of senior players. “Since my debut, the seniors have been the biggest source of motivation,” he said.  “They have helped me play my natural game without any fear or pressure. “That is the biggest reason why I could win the 2019 FIH Rising Star of the Year Award and also stand a chance to win the accolade for the second time.” Vivek added that the feeling of winning an Olympic bronze “hasn’t really sunk in yet”. “I still can’t believe I was part of the Olympic medal-winning team. “It’s a dream of every athlete and I am really blessed to be able to live this dream at the age of 21. Room for improvement    “However, we also need to realise that this is just the beginning and there’s still a lot of room for improvement. We have raised the bar and we have to do even better. “There will be more challenges ahead and we need to be fully prepared for whatever comes our way.”  I still can’t believe I was part of the Olympic medal-winning team   The Indian hockey contingent made the shortlist of all categories of FIH Awards 2020-21||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/its-a-surreal-feeling-says-vivek/article36091228.ece
25 August 2021||LEEDS,||‘Bumrah wasn’t trying to get me out’||Senior England pacer James Anderson felt that Jasprit Bumrah was not trying to get him out during the Lord's Test after the Indian rattled him with a barrage of bouncers. “I got caught off-guard a little because all the batters coming in were saying how slow the pitch was. Bang it in short and it was really slow. When I came out to bat, Root said Bumrah was not bowling as quick as he normally does,” said Anderson on the BBC Tailenders Podcast. “And then, the first ball was 90 miles an hour and on the money. I haven’t felt like this in my career, but I felt he wasn’t trying to get me out. “He bowled an over, maybe 10, 11, 12 balls [sic 10]. He was bowling no-ball after no-ball, bowling short... I think he bowled two on the stumps which I managed to dig out.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/anderson-on-the-bumrah-barrage-that-left-him-shaken-and-stirred/article36091035.ece
25 August 2021||August 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Malan excited to be back in the mix||England batsman Dawid Malan is excited about facing the red ball again after a spree of limited-overs cricket. Malan, the world’s No. 1 T20 batsman, played the last of his 15 Tests in August, 2018. The 33-year-old has 725 Test runs in 15 matches with one century and six fifties. Asked about his surprise call up, Malan said: “I’d always wanted another crack at it (Tests). Realistically, did I think it would happen? Probably not. To get that call was fantastic... I’m a bit worried about how I’d face up against the red ball, but it’s always exciting getting a call to play for your country.” Malan acknowledged that constant exposure to international cricket would help ease the pressure. “White-ball and red-ball cricket have their own unique set of challenges. But playing white-ball cricket at that level and pressure does help you to stay in the mix. It doesn’t guarantee you runs in a different format, but it helps to prepare mentally for the pressures that come with it,” Malan said. Malan conceded that lack of game time in First Class cricket would be a concern. “We all know how tough English conditions can be. It’s also a great place to bat once you get in — as Joe Root has shown in all these Tests. He gets in and scores big, and that’s the challenge for all of us,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/malan-excited-to-be-back-in-the-mix/article36091045.ece

25 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Very special to be national champion’||Chirag Duhan is a special talent. The newly-crowned National junior champion had a nice interaction with Olympian Vishnu Vardhan on putting his tennis career in perspective. The 17-year-old Chirag credited coach Gaurav Sharma with an “equally important role” along with his parents in shaping his tennis career for the last five years. Chiraj, who has won two ITF junior titles earlier this season and taken his international junior rank to 132, was planning to focus in the men’s international circuit, but had to cool his heels at home. In trying to make use of the time, he entered the tournaments in Chennai. “We have been preparing for this for a long time. It is very special for me to be the national champion,” Chirag told Vishnu, who pointed out that the country’s best players Prajnesh Gunneswaran and Ramkumar Ramanathan had won the event in the past. Rawat’s help When queried, Chirag accepted that Sidharth Rawat, fellow trainee at the Pro Tennis Academy in the Capital, a disciplined and dedicated player was quite helpful “on and off the court” in mentoring him. A big fan of Tokyo Olympics champion Alexander Zverev of Germany, the tall Chirag said that his focus would be to play the men’s tournaments in Egypt and Tunisia in the coming weeks to take his professional career forward. Chirag had got a taste of the men’s international circuit in the qualifying events of two tournaments at home this season, before the second wave of COVID-19 put a pause to the proceedings. He likes badminton and swimming, but with long hours of tennis and fitness training he has no time to think about other games or activities. Vishnu, a stakeholder in Tennishub which sponsored the national junior championship, congratulated Chirag for his double triumph, and said that it was commendable considering the humid conditions and rain delays in the tournament.

25 August 2021||KARACHI,||Pakistan- Afghanistan series postponed||The first-ever bilateral series between Pakistan and Afghanistan has been postponed until next year owing to multiple issues. The three-match series was part of one-day Super League, a qualification process for the 2023 World Cup (50 overs) to be held in India. Since the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan there has been flight disruption. A 10-day lockdown in Sri Lanka, where the series — Afghanistan’s home series — was to be held, has also contributed to the postponement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pakistan-afghanistan-series-postponed/article36090935.ece

25 August 2021||Leeds,||India looks to take a stranglehold on series||A confident India will look to tighten the noose around England when the third match of the five-Test series begins here on Wednesday. Skipper Virat Kohli will also like to end a prolonged lean patch. His last international hundred came in November, 2019. In this series he has managed just a couple of 40s. Concerns about Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane’s form were mitigated to some extent on the fourth day of the Lord’s Test. Strong opening pair The performance of openers Rohit Sharma and K.L. Rahul has been a big plus. Both have showed remarkable temperament and technique in testing conditions. Rishabh Pant has played his natural game and Ravindra Jadeja has also done a decent job at number seven, playing the role of a batsman more than that of a left-arm spinner. Headingley has traditionally been seamer-friendly and it remains to be seen if India moves away from its four-pronged pace attack. Shardul Thakur is fully fit but it is unlikely Kohli will make any changes. Malan back England will be hoping to restore some stability to its batting with the inclusion of Dawid Malan. The southpaw last played a Test three years ago but is expected to deliver considering his rich First Class experience. Malan will bat at number three, moving Haseeb Hameed to open alongside Rory Burns.  The England batsmen have to find a way to score and help skipper Joe Root, who has made the bulk of the team's runs. Mark Wood’s injury puts Saqib Mahmood in a good position to make his Test debut. No verbal battles Root confirmed that barring Wood, the team was not facing any fitness issues, with lead pacer James Anderson also in good shape. The England skipper also hinted that his players would not be drawn into needless verbal exchanges after things heated up at Lord's.  The teams (from):   India: Virat Kohli (Capt.), Rohit Sharma, Cheteshwar Pujara, Mayank Agarwal, Ajinkya Rahane, Hanuma Vihari, Rishabh Pant (wk), R. Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, Umesh Yadav, K.L. Rahul, Wriddhiman Saha, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Prithvi Shaw and Suryakumar Yadav.   England: Joe Root (Capt.), Moeen Ali, James Anderson, Jonathan Bairstow, Rory Burns, Jos Buttler (wk), Sam Curran, Haseeb Hameed, Dan Lawrence, Saqib Mahmood, Dawid Malan, Craig Overton, Ollie Pope and Ollie Robinson.   Match starts 3.30 p.m. IST.

25 August 2021||August 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Conquering rajas, tamas||In Srimad Bhagavatam, Lord Krishna explains the three gunas to Uddhava, said P.T. Seshadri in a discourse. A person who has sattva guna is always awake. Even when it seems as if he is asleep, he is actually meditating on the Lord. One with rajas has many dreams when he sleeps. The one with tamas has deep sleep. Uddhava wants to know what he should do to reach the feet of Lord Krishna. Krishna replies that those with sattva guna will reach a higher loka. Those with rajas will be reborn as humans. If the guna of tamas is predominant in a man, naraka is guaranteed for him, and once he has paid for his karma in naraka, he will be reborn as an animal, bird or plant. Krishna says that if a person thinks of the Lord at the time of death, he will reach His feet. We see how the story of Jadabharata illustrates that worldly affections undo the good effects of tapas. Jadabharata knew the value of detachment and moved to a forest to do penance. One day, he happened to rescue a newborn deer. He took it to his ashram and cared for it. In course of time, the deer became the centre of his life, and he could not concentrate on his tapas. Even when he died, his thoughts were about the deer. Because his last thoughts were not about the Supreme One, all his penance went to waste and he did not attain liberation. Krishna says even food habits can be classified as sattvic, rajasic and tamasic. That which has been offered to the Lord, and that which is good for our health is sattvic food. Eating what the tongue likes is rajasic. Eating what is bad for one's health and eating that which is not offered to God is tamasic. He who conquers rajas and tamas, who worships the Lord in archa form and spends his entire life meditating on the Lord will attain moksha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/conquering-rajas-tamas/article36090995.ece

25 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Traders wait with bated breath for Nizamuddin centre to reopen||A day after the Delhi High Court ordered the police to hand over the keys of Nizamuddin Markaz residential area to Maulana Saad Kandhalvi’s mother, the premises remained locked from the outside. The police handed over the keys late on Tuesday. Maulana Saad’s family refused to speak to the media because of the “negative portrayal” when the Markaz was told to close last year after a case was registered in connection with a Tablighi Jamaat congregation held in violation of COVID-19 rules. Already hit by lockdown At the religious centre, a few people who were inside refused to open the door or respond to repeated calls. Locals, however, said they cannot wait for the Markaz to reopen because their businesses have been heavily impacted and the COVID-19 induced lockdown made matters worse. Zulfiqar Alam, 52, who has an ittar stall outside the Markaz, said he used to sell biscuits and other edibles. As there was no sale of the products after the Markaz shutdown, he switched to selling perfume. “I used to make Rs. 400-Rs. 500 a day but now I barely make Rs. 200. I will switch back to selling biscuits as soon as the Markaz reopens,” he said, adding that scores of people who used to visit the Markaz were his customers. “This place ensured income for over 3,500 people. Now, not even 350 are making money.” Sarfaraz, 24, who sells apparel on a wooden cart, said he is barely able to make ends meet. “ Markaz khule.. Jamaatein aaye jaaye… pehle jaisa mahaul ho… Usi ka intezar hai [The Markaz should open. People should start coming in. I am waiting for a day when it’s just like before],” he said. On the blame that the Tablighi Jamaat received at the time of the incident, Mr. Sarfaraz said they did what they were told. “They stayed where they were as the public services messages at the time were saying”. Rizwan, a 33-year-old seller of Islamic books, has been running a shop for over 10 years after taking over from his father and grandfather who ran it for 50 years. He said the money he used to make is nowhere close to what he is earning now. “I used to open at 7 a.m. and get done by 10 a.m. I used to make a good amount. Now, I sit all day, but can’t make the same money,” he said, adding that as soon as the Markaz reopens, the congregation episode will have no bearing and people will flock back. Due to last year’s incident as well as COVID-19, the crowds at Nizamuddin Auliya Dargah has also fallen. Mohammed Ashiq, 18, who works at a tea stall in the area said that he is also waiting for the Markaz to reopen because he is “not used to the empty streets”. The High Court had taken the police to task on Monday, stating: “What is Section 60 [of Evidence Act on oral evidence], Section 310 [Code of Criminal Procedure on local inspection]? What sections have you registered? Preserving a site does not mean you lock it. Take photos and move from the site. What was recovered? Case was only that people were residing there.” Justice Yogesh Khanna had also directed the police to hand over the keys of the residential area within two days. The court additionally clarified that the occupants cannot enter any non-residential portion of the property till further orders.  I used to make Rs. 400-Rs. 500 a day but now I barely make Rs. 200. I will switch back to selling biscuits as soon as the Markaz reopens. This place ensured income for over 3,500 people. Now, not even 350 are making money Zulfiqar Alam Trader in the area||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/traders-wait-with-bated-breath-for-nizamuddin-centre-to-reopen/article36091267.ece
25 August 2021||New Delhi,||Going faceless: Transport Dept. moves to tackle old complaints||The Transport Department has begun working on transforming its 13 existing Motor Licencing Offices (MLOs) into centres meant exclusively to facilitate and assist citizens who cannot avail of its online services. As part of its bid to go “completely faceless” as soon as possible, the department has zeroed-in on what it views as the sole hurdle in this direction by focussing on detection and resolution of “legacy complaints” via inter-MLO interface. The system, which a senior government official said is being put in place under the direct supervision of Transport Secretary and Commissioner Ashish Kundra, will allow citizens with pending service requests to lodge complaints, be tracked from scratch and resolved as soon as possible. Mr. Kundra is said to be visiting each MLO for the purpose. “Complaints can be regarding a service request pending due to the pandemic and especially those which do not completely fall under any specific category for quick resolution,” Mr. Kundra said, confirming the development. “The interface will attach a particular complaint with the application number of the pending request which will then be tracked, processed and delivered by the MLO concerned. Citizens can lodge such grievances through 1076, the transport department website or via our Whatsapp chatbot,” Mr. Kundra added. A significant majority of services offered by the department can now be accessed online with only two services requiring physical presence at an MLO: giving a driving test and checking fitness of a vehicle. 10,000 learners’ licences Sources said as many as 10,000 learners’ licences have been issued to citizens who applied for it from the comfort of their homes since the launch of the initiative by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on August 11. Currently, the Delhi government’s Faceless Services programme includes 33 major transport-related services, which account for 95% of the total services which citizens can avail: driving licence and related services, vehicle registration and related services and permit related services. The remaining smaller services will soon be added to the faceless basket in the coming months, according to the government. Physical interaction will be limited to the driving skill test conducted at 13 fully Automated Driving Test Tracks and fitness tests of vehicles. Pre-pandemic, the government stated, approximately 30 lakh services were being provided to citizens online annually. As of August this year, according to the government, Delhi was the first State in the country to go ‘faceless’ replete with e-sign and Aadhaar-based authentication, and the first State to provide e-learners’ licence test through Artificial Intelligence-based facial recognition or feature mapping.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/going-faceless-transport-dept-moves-to-tackle-old-complaints/article36091276.ece
25 August 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Sugarcane farmers in Punjab end stir after hike in SAP announced||Sugarcane farmers in Punjab on Tuesday withdrew their protest in response to Chief Minister Amarinder Singh’s announcement of a Rs. 35 per quintal hike in the State Agreed Price (SAP) for the cane crushing season 2021-22, taking the SAP to Rs. 360 per quintal. Poor finances The matter was resolved during a meeting of farmers’ union leaders with the Chief Minister here this afternoon, during which Capt. Amarinder, while agreeing to the SAP hike, said the State’s fiscal situation had prevented an adequate increase in the SAP for the past three to four years. The farmers’ union leaders had earlier pointed out that Punjab had failed to hike sugarcane SAP in proportion to Haryana’s over the same period, causing fiscal losses to them. The Chief Minister said the farmers were not to be blamed for the problem, which had been caused by Punjab’s poor finances. While he was always with the farmers and wanted to do his best for their welfare, the State’s fiscal crisis had prevented him for increasing the SAP earlier, he said, adding that balancing the needs of the farmers with those of the cooperative and private sugar mill owners was tough, given the prevailing fiscal situation. The farmers’ union leaders, representing the Sanjha Kisan Morcha that has been spearheading the sugarcane farmers’ agitation for the past several days, thanked the Chief Minister for addressing their problem and announcing the hike.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sugarcane-farmers-in-punjab-end-stir-after-hike-in-sap-announced/article36091244.ece
25 August 2021||New Delhi,||All positive samples of COVID to go for genome sequencing||In a first of its kind move in the city, the Delhi government has asked districts to send all positive samples of COVID-19 for genome sequencing, said officials. On August 18, The Hindu had reported that there was a 93% fall in the number of samples for which COVID-19 genome sequencing was done in June, compared to April. The current decision was taken by the government on the same day. “All districts have been told to send all positive COVID-19 samples for genome sequencing. Right now, our daily new cases are in single digits and we have started sending all such samples directly to the lab assigned to us,” a district official said. The districts have been asked to send the samples to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Lok Nayak Hospital, and Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, the official said. “Right now, a new wave is possible only with a new variant and this will help us identify the new variants,” the official added. The development was confirmed by a second official who said they received the communication on August 18 and started sending samples from last week. “Since the cases are less now, this is a good move and will help us discover new variants early and help to fight the virus,” said Jugal Kishore, head of Community Medicine Department at Safdarjung Hospital. He added that before the second wave, the government took a lot of time to figure out the Delta variant and that contributed to the chaos. Like other viruses, COVID-19 is constantly changing and genetic variations occur over time, which can lead to new variants.

25 August 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi will soon get freedom from waterlogging: Kejriwal||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday reviewed the progress of the Delhi Drainage Master Plan following which he stated that the Capital would soon “get freedom from waterlogging” as work related to the policy was being expedited. He added that necessary changes suggested by IIT-Delhi will be implemented to bolster the city’s drainage system and that it will be further enhanced to deal with heavy rainfall. According to the government, Mr. Kejriwal instructed officers to implement solutions on the ground level in order to make the drainage system foolproof. He also directed them to take up specific projects to implement solutions for fixing slopes of drains, connecting storm drains to larger drainage system and similar problems, adding that consultants will be roped in to plan and present project reports for all drainage lines to expedite implementation of the projects. “The drainage system will be further bolstered and made foolproof. Officers should conduct studies and find solutions for each and every storm drain and sewer system. Every gap in the drainage system of Delhi has to be plugged,” the CM said. “If there is a fault in the slope of a drain, it needs to be fixed. If any drain is a dead end, it needs to be corrected. A proper plan should be chalked out for connecting smaller drains with the large drainage lines,” he added. Heavy rainfall According to the government, officials have been instructed to implement changes keeping in mind heavy rainfall, so that any instances of waterlogging can be dealt with. A majority of the estimated 2,846 drains in Delhi, with a combined length of about 3,692 km, fall under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department (PWD). The objectives of the drainage plan include formulation of a policy for the city for about 30-35 years compatible with the Master Plan of Delhi-2021 for improvement of its drainage within a fixed time frame. A technical expert committee has been working to decide design parameters and technical inputs such as rainfall intensity, return period, run-off coefficient, retention period for the drainage plan, while experts from IIT-Delhi have been roped in to analyse the drainage systems and suggest solutions. To enhance the drainage system, studies were also conducted using digital modelling of the physical drainage systems of the city. The recommendations for the plan include ensuring no encroachments, sewage, solid or construction waste is allowed into storm drains; effectiveness of desilting of drains with public display of desilting schedules; rejuvenation of water bodies; and flood monitoring using sensors to improve flood management.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-will-soon-get-freedom-from-waterlogging-kejriwal/article36091274.ece
25 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Day 2: Afghans continue stir outside UNHCR||People from Afghanistan on Tuesday continued their protest outside the Vasant Kunj office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for the second day. The protest slogans and cries for help got louder as said they will not budge from near the venue. They are also considering a hunger strike in case the UNHCR does not recognise those seeking refugee statuses, provide them with resettlement options and ensure their security. Visas expiring, no jobs The protesters said they have no option but to stay put outside the UNHCR office as returning to Afghanistan is not an option now. With no job opportunities and their visas expiring soon, the protesters are a worried lot. Sauraya, a single mother who came to India 10 years ago, said she earned a living in Delhi working as a translator. Currently, she is left without a job and is worried about how she will get through the next few months as there is no help from back home as well. “My refugee card provided by the UNHCR expires next month. I am unsure of what I am going to do. There are no job opportunities here and the chances of going to another country at this moment look slim. I am worried for my child’s education and future,” Ms. Sauraya said. Ahmar Zia Ghani, the head of the Afghan Solidarity Committee, said the protesters are asking the UNHCR to let them in to process their refugee status or provide them with documentation to travel to another country. Seeking protection “We want protection from the UNHCR. Even if you receive a refugee card, you cannot find employment here. You have to apply for a long term Visa, which is not easy. We want a refugee status for all Afghanis, a support letter from UNHCR that we can take to the Embassy of other countries here who are willing to welcome us,” Mr. Ghani said. Another protester Zehra, who also worked as a translator in Delhi, said for her family in Afghanistan have exhausted all sources of income as businesses have been shut under the Taliban regime. “If the Taliban gets to know that their daughter is in India, they will attack my family and destroy my house. There is no employment at home and there is no employment here as well. We don't know how to get on with our lives,” Ms. Zehra said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/afghans-continue-stir-outside-unhcr-office/article36091256.ece
25 August 2021||Ghaziabad,||Uttam Upadhyay’s family in a shock over hate speech||In the Jhandapur colony of Ghaziabad, the name of Uttam Upadhyay is on everybody’s lips. The dance teacher-turned-local right-wing leader is absconding since the video of his hate speech against Muslims at Jantar Mantar became viral on August 8. The hearing on his anticipatory bail is scheduled for August 25. Advocate Ashish Jogi said he had applied for anticipatory bail because his client suffered from episodes of epileptic seizures leading to bipolar disorder. “No man in his senses could say such things. He was under the care of an AIIMS doctor in 2019. We have submitted the papers.” Interestingly, last Sunday, in an interaction with this correspondent, Uttam’s elder brother Anuj didn’t mention the medical condition. He had said the family members kept telling Uttam that one day he would get into trouble because of his ‘rant against Muslims’. “It slipped out of my mind,” said Anuj. He informed Uttam last visited his house on August 9. “The family has no idea where he is and the Delhi Police teams have checked our house and questioned us multiple times.” Anuj said he has Muslim friends and didn’t know how he would face them. “Uttam used to attend RSS shakhas from a young age. He had attended a Bajrang Dal camp and had been the zonal deputy president of the BJP’s Kisan Morcha. But this aggressive side has developed in the last couple of years since he started following Narsinghanand Saraswati (controversial priest of Dasna temple), right-wing political commentator Pushpendra Kulshreshta and Pinky Chaudhary of the Hindu Raksha Dal,” he said. Sanjeev Sharma, BJP’s district president, denied that Uttam was a party member or held any post in sister organisation. Death in family Uttam’s father Dinesh Kumar, who runs a stationery shop named after his absconding son, was also in a shock as the family was already mourning the death of their second son in a road accident last August. “We had been extra protective towards Uttam but he would not listen. He didn’t tell us about the Jantar Mantar event. We came to know when relatives sent us videos.” Anuj remembered one incident. “Some years ago, a cow had died in an accident and was being taken away by the residents of the neighbouring Peer Colony. As the news spread, it enraged Uttam. He conducted its burial with the help of local police. Soon he started taking out ‘Tiranga Yatras’. He had this belief that where Muslims are in minority, they preach brotherhood, but where they are in majority they try to dominate Hindus.” The family hailed from Muradnagar town of Ghaziabad and Mr. Kumar’s father shifted to Jhandapur in the 1970s. One of his elder brothers is a member of the local BJP unit. “None of the party members has come in our support,” he said. Situated in Sahibabad’s industrial area, Uttam’s residence is not far from the spot where theatre icon Safdar Hashmi was killed by a mob comprising Congress workers on January 1, 1989, when Jhandapur was a village.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/uttam-upadhyays-family-in-a-shock-over-hate-speech/article36091246.ece
25 August 2021||New Delhi,||Plea in HC seeks mechanism to check age in liquor shops, bars||The High Court on Wednesday issued notice to the Delhi government on a petition seeking to put in place a robust mechanism for mandatory checking of age at liquor shops, bars and restaurants serving alcohol with government identity cards. An HC Bench posted the case for further hearing on September 17. The plea filed by Community Against Drunken Driving, through activist Prince Singhal, also sought direction to the Delhi government to restrain it from giving effect to the recent amendment made in the Excise Rules, which permit the doorstep delivery of liquor, until a robust age verification mechanism is put in place. Mr. Singhal further urged the court to restrain the Delhi government from giving effect to another amendment in the excise policy, which reduced the drinking age from 25 to 21 until a robust age verification mechanism is instituted. Mr. Singhal said that he filed the current petition as the Delhi government has failed to take action on the previous petition filed by him in 2017 where the court had directed the government to form a policy on age checking at alcohol points of sale. “Since the Delhi government introduced the new excise policy and liberalized the alcohol policy bringing down the legal drinking age and increasing alcohol availability making the alcohol policy almost at par with countries in the west, it has become even more pertinent to strictly monitor the age of consumer as is done in the western nations,” Mr. Singhal said. The petition has urged that only government-issued documents such as Aadhaar card, Election I-card and a valid passport for foreign nationals should be used to verify age at points of sale. “Tools such as portable age verifier and a bio metrix age check can be placed at points of sale to check buyers below the age of 30 years,” the plea said. Senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, contended that this plea was an attempt to stall the policy under one pretext or the other. Underage drinking Mr. Singhal said that underage drinking has been consistently rising at 28% annually and one in every five people in AIIMS de-addiction centre are below 21 years. The petition said was filed to address the serious need for a legislative enactment to combat excessive underage drinking, which often results in unruly and careless behavior by young people.  Tools such as portable age verifier and a bio metrix age check can be placed at points of sale to check buyers below the age of 30 years Plea in HC||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/plea-in-hc-seeks-mechanism-to-check-age-in-liquor-shops-bars/article36091250.ece

During a bail hearing, Mr. Shifa’s lawyer, Abhishek Singh, showed Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat a complaint filed by him on January 30, 2020, seeking registration of FIR against Mr. Thakur, Mr. Mishra, BJP leader Parvesh Sharma, and Jamia shooter Ram Bhakt Gopal for allegedly “instigating riots”. ‘Incendiary slogan’ According to the complaint, Mr. Shifa mentioned that Mr. Mishra took out a rally in which slogans to shoot people were raised, following which Mr. Thakur, on January 28, 2020, also raised a similar incendiary slogan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/why-no-fir-filed-against-anurag-thakur-mishra/article36091271.ece

Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar said Mr. Kejriwal should take strong steps such as improving public transport to improve air quality instead of installing a “white elephant”, the effectiveness of which is “unknown, even to those who erected the structure”. “The main reason for pollution levels crossing danger marks is the large number of private vehicles on roads in the absence of a robust public transport system,” Mr. Kumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-congress-calls-smog-tower-a-gimmick/article36091272.ece

The A.P. State Commission for Women had on Monday said it has submitted the draft proposal for the Arunachal Pradesh Marriage and Inheritance of Property Bill, 2021. “We have received memorandums from various organisations to scrap two sections of the draft proposal,” the Commission said. The clauses pertain to the movable and immovable property enjoyed by an Arunachal Pradesh Scheduled Tribe (APST) woman married to a non-APST man. While pressure mounted on the Commission to remove the clauses, the All Arunachal Pradesh Students’ Union resented the “inordinate delay” by the government in publishing the draft proposal related to the existing system of issuing APST certificates to the offspring of non-APST men and APST women. The AAPSU and other students’ bodies demanded the early tabling of the Bill.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/arunachal-students-body-demands-policy-to-protect-native-groups/article36091241.ece

The petition said in response to queries posted under the RTIhas revealed that the copy of balance sheet for the year 2015-16 and onward is under preparation. Senior Advocate Sanjoy Ghose, appearing for DJB, contended that the plea has been filed by an office-bearer of the rival party with political motives and submitted that the auditing was going on. “It is mandatory to maintain financial accounts and conduct an annual audit of the accounts, in order to ascertain effective functioning of the state and local bodies. Maintaining financial accounts and conducting an annual audit of the accounts, help to secure accountability...,”the plea said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/govt-cag-told-to-respond-to-plea-for-audit-of-djb-accounts/article36091247.ece

25 August 2021||August 25 2021 00:00 IST,||Art lists and the questions that arise||The third edition of the Hurun India Art List was released last week. Technically, the artist who topped it this year as well, Anish Kapoor, with sales worth Rs. 20.64 crore at public auctions last year, doesn’t even live in India. The London-based sculptor’s conceptual work has made it to the Venice Biennale and the Royal Academy of Arts (the first living artist to be given a solo there), and he has won renown with landmarks such as the Cloud Gate in Chicago and Britain’s ArcelorMittal Orbit. Interestingly, there’s no mention of Hurun on his social media. One wonders if it matters to him or if he is even aware of it. Many artists are not. When I reached out to Vasundhara Tewari-Broota, whose husband Rameshwar Broota is number three on the list, she was surprised. “He is not someone who looks at these lists,” she tells me. How about the news that she has clocked in at number eight on Hurun’s Women Artists’ list? “It is a pleasant surprise,” smiles the artist, whose figurative paintings explore the psycho-political existence of the female body. But she quickly adds that “it brings me back to the old argument: the artist never gets a share in these astronomical sales [that puts them on these lists in the first place]. They have usually sold the artwork long ago for a sum that looks meagre when placed next to the current auctioned price, which is usually in crores of rupees.” This is just one of the uncomfortable questions that lists such as Hurun’s (which draws its data from online resource artprice.com) bring up. Do rankings affect how galleries showcase artists or how collectors invest in artwork? Does knowing where the artists are from — West Bengal contributed the most number in the list (10 entrants), followed by Kerala and Maharashtra — help, beyond making good headlines? Most often, it’s a no. “Anish Kapoor is represented in our international Post War and Contemporary auctions across the globe,” says Deepanjana Klein, International Head, Department for Contemporary Indian & Southeast Asian Art at Christie’s Auction House. “His price points are very different and do not reflect the Indian art market or have an impact on it, as the majority of his works are bought mainly by international collectors.”  Let’s talk money  But before we get to the questions... do these lists matter? Many come out each year, from Forbes to Time to Business Standard . Internationally, Shanghai-based Hurun Report, the wealth research firm, puts out several — from rich lists and top philanthropists to global art top 50s. But do artists and collectors care about them? “I don’t know who actually looks at them,” says Ashvin E Rajagopalan, co-founder of Chennai-based Ashvita gallery, stating that Hurun India’s numbers are off. “I don’t know what their source of data is. If it is public auctions, then Krishen Khanna sold more than Rs. 6.87 crores last year!” Meanwhile, Sharan Apparao, of Apparao Galleries, says, “Seasoned collectors don’t refer to lists when buying high-end art, and it’s not important to artists either because their prices aren’t controlled by these.” One of the few she looks at is ArtReview ’s Power 100 in the Art World (and that too, occasionally). What such lists can do, however, is be conversation starters. For example, about the need for royalties in the art world. “Artists don’t really benefit from auction sales, not directly at least,” says Anjolie Ela Menon over the phone from her studio in Nizamuddin. Incidentally, the 81-year-old contemporary artist, whose solo show, By The River , is on at the AICON Gallery in New York, is number eight on the Hurun list. “Just before the pandemic, we were proposing the formation of a board that would oversee issues of 7% royalties to the artist of every auction sale, authentication and other such matters. But because everything shut down, it got halted and I doubt it will be formed any time soon.” Menon points out that an artist like Tyeb Mehta never made any direct earnings from the auction sales, though it has raked in crores (in 2018, his painting, Kali , was purchased anonymously for over Rs. 26 crore) and put him on innumerable records. “A percentage should come to the artist every time their work is sold,” she says, along the lines of what Artist Resale Rights has achieved in Europe, the UK and California. “But, currently, there’s a sense of helplessness; we must form at least an artists’ union.” Anas Rahman Junaid, who heads Hurun India, the organisation that brings out the annual list, says he’s been closely observing the transitioning of India’s entrepreneurial landscape from being largely run by family businesses, to the era of new-age entrepreneurs and their revolutionary business ideas. “Rapid advancements in technology have enabled the ‘millennial entrepreneur’ to show great enthusiasm towards this new economic culture,” he says, adding that auction prices follow the ‘trickle down theory’ and affect gallery prices as it indicates global acclaim of the artworks. “I believe that the next decade presents a great opportunity for India to reposition herself. My continuing mission for the Hurun report is to find these synergies and contribute value to the entrepreneurial landscape.”  The NFT debate  Technology is one of the ways open to artists to keep track of their work and get just rewards. Mumbai-based artist Santanu Hazarika believes blockchain will dismantle the culture of gatekeeping in a bid to empower artists. If the authentication of artworks can be digitised — with blockchain keeping track of sales automatically — it would be easier to ensure a percentage goes to the artist as royalty. At present, several international NFT platforms, such as SuperRare, offer this. Artists get 5%-15% royalty every time their artwork is resold. However, he says, it’s still early days in India. “We will have to wait and watch, as it is a growing market that needs many kinks to be ironed out. For instance, the difficulties around obtaining authentication certificates when the artist is no more. Or tracing the provenance of artworks that have been resold more than once.” Auction houses, however, are more cautious. “It is true that an NFT is inscribed on a blockchain and so the provenance history is forever publicly accessible. But to date auction houses cannot offer NFTs all around the world, as there are no general guidelines in place, which would include the question of copyright,” says Klein. Christie’s pioneered NFTs in the global auction market and is leading this category with $93.2 million in sales this year.  “My father Krishen Khanna [number 3 on the list] was happy to hear he was featured. His words were: ‘Technically I am number one because Anish Kapoor is not living in India!’ I would say that such lists help us get an aggregate notion of the art market. Auction prices do filter down to affect gallery prices” — Karan Khanna , the artist’s son||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/art-lists-and-the-questions-that-arise/article36091498.ece
