02 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||Assam, Mizoram agree to ease border tension||The Chief Ministers of Assam and Mizoram have sought to ease tensions along their troubled inter-State border following a discussion with Union Home Minister Amit Shah. An exchange of fire between the police forces of both States on July 26 left six Assam policemen and a civilian dead and 60 others, including Superintendent of Police of Cachar district Nimbalkar Vaibhav Chandrakant, injured. Assam claimed the firing was one-sided and unprovoked, while Mizoram said they retaliated to the aggression by the Assam police. Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga on Sunday took to Twitter to say that he had a telephonic discussion with Mr. Shah and his Assam counterpart, Himanta Biswa Sarma. “We agreed to resolve the border issue amicably through meaningful dialogue,” he tweeted. He also asked the people of Mizoram to “avoid posting sensitive messages and make judicious use of their social media platform” to prevent any possible escalation of the situation. He later deleted the tweet but retweeted a post by Dr. Sarma. “Our main focus is on keeping the spirit of northeast alive. What happened along the Assam-Mizoram border is unacceptable to the people of both States,” Dr. Sarma said. “Border disputes can only be resolved through discussion.” Dr. Sarma later told presspersons in Guwahati that his government would approach the Supreme Court in 15 days for an amicable solution to the boundary row for both States to follow. The two States share a 164.6 km volatile border, with each government accusing the other of not maintaining the status quo and encouraging its people to encroach. The border conflict is decades-old but things started getting violent from October 2020.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/assam-mizoram-agree-to-ease-border-tension/article35673129.ece
02 August 2021||Chennai,||Sindhu bags bronze, scripts history||P.V. Sindhu wrote her name into the history books with a bronze at the Tokyo Olympics on Sunday. The badminton star became the first Indian woman to win two Olympics medals, with her latest effort being a follow-up to the silver at the previous Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. In the third-place play-off, the 26-year-old defeated He Bingjiao of China 21-13, 21-15. It was a clash that the Hyderbadi pocketed with ease. Sindhu set the tempo, dictated the angles and toyed with her rival. And during those brief moments when she seemed over-eager, her coach Park Tae-Sang hinted to her that she should calm down. Having lost to Tai Tzu-Ying of Chinese Taipei in the semifinal on Saturday, Sindhu was even more driven to seize the one medal at stake. And it showed as she crafted the contest’s template, a trait that she maintained right through her Olympics’ campaign except in the semifinals against a splendid Tzu-Ying. Sindhu’s Olympic encore, even if the medal shades are different, has ensured that she would be considered one of the greatest ever Indian sportspersons. P.V.

02 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||GST revenues hit Rs. 1.16 lakh crore in July||The gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues in July recovered sharply to Rs. 1,16,393 crore, after slipping below the Rs. 1 lakh crore mark for the first time in eight months in June. The Union government called the collections a sign of a rapid economic recovery from the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, though economists said they indicated an “incomplete” rebound. “With the easing out of COVID restrictions, GST collection for July 2021 has again crossed Rs. 1 lakh crore, which clearly indicates that the economy is recovering at a fast pace. The robust GST revenues are likely to continue in the coming months too,” the Finance Ministry said in a statement on Sunday. The July numbers include returns filed between July 1 and 5, amounting to Rs. 4,937 crore, as taxpayers were given relief on delayed return filing for June in the wake of the second wave. The July collections were 33% higher than a year ago, with the GST collected on the import of goods rising 36% and domestic transactions, including import of services, growing by 32%. “There is a heartening sequential increase, as well as a substantial year-on-year growth, but GST collections remain well below the all-time high recorded in April of Rs. 1.41 lakh crore. In our view, this is further evidence that the graduated unlocking in June 2021 has triggered an incomplete recovery that is expected to strengthen in July,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA. Significant variations While most States reported positive growth in tax collections compared with July 2020, there were significant variations — Odisha and Jharkhand reported a 54% uptick, followed by Haryana (53%) and Maharashtra (51%), while Tamil Nadu and Gujarat clocked 36% growth. Kerala reported a 27% surge in GST revenues, despite having stricter COVID-19 restrictions in place than States such as Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan, which recorded a growth of 18%, 15% and 12%, respectively. “The pace of growth across the States was highly uneven in July 2021, with some industrial heavyweights recording a sharp expansion,” Ms. Nayar said. The Ministry attributed June’s blip in GST revenues at Rs. 92,849 crore, after posting above the Rs. 1 lakh crore mark for eight successive months, to the complete or partial lockdowns in most States and Union territories in May.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gst-collections-recover-to-rs-116-lakh-crore-in-july/article35673134.ece
02 August 2021||MANGALURU,||Draft list of members for ward committees today||Taking a leap in the formation of ward committees, Mangaluru City Corporation has prepared the draft list of nominated/qualified members. It will be uploaded in the website of the civic body. It will also be displayed on its notice board on Monday. Commissioner of the corporation Akshy Sridhar has in a statement said that citizens can file their objections and suggestions, if any, within 15 days from Monday. They will have to be addressed to the zonal commissioners and submitted to them. In addition, they can be submitted to the inventory officers at the central office of the corporation at Lalbagh or e-mailed tomccwardcommittee- @gmail.com. Decision kept pending The council of the city corporation had been systematically avoiding the constitution of the committees for over two decades now. A decision on constituting the committees had been pending before the council since 1997-98. It was due to the apprehension of the councillors that the ward committees will undermine their importance. Though the law mandated the constitution of the committees, the then Mayor Mahabala Marla had in 2014 even constituted a three-member committee of the councillors to study the pros and cons of the ward committees. The report of the three-member committee was, however, never placed before the council. The council even defied a directive from the then Urban Development Minister Vinay Kumar Sorake to constitute the committees. Mr. Sorake, in a meeting had, on October 7, 2014, directed the civic body to form the committees within a month from thereon. He had also asked it to form citizens forums, deliberation committees and area sabhas. On July 14, 2011, a voluntary organisation, Namma Mane Namma Ooru of Pachchanady, wrote to the then Commissioner of the civic body that it will petition the High Court of Karnataka about the failure of the corporation to constitute the committees. Following this, an agenda was again placed before the council in the same month but the council postponed it. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led council was forced to adopt a resolution on constituting the committees on August 13, 2020 following a High Court directive. The High Court, on August 8, 2019, while hearing a public interest writ petition filed by Karnataka Ward Samithi Vedike, MCC Civic Group and others, directed that the ward committees be formed. The BJP had in its manifesto for the corporation council elections in 2007 promised to constitute the committees. Though the party was elected to power for the first time to the civic body, it did not constitute the committees during its five-year stint. The party again promised to form the committees in the last elections to the council in 2019. The constitution of the committees was required under Section 13 (A) of Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act 1976 which said that cities having a population of three lakh and above shall constitute the ward committees. Later, the Karnataka Municipal Corporations (Amendment) Act 2011 made it mandatory for city corporations to form the committees. In addition, the Lok Adalat, had, on January 4, 2014, also directed the city corporation to take steps to constitute the committees.  A decision on constituting the committees had been pending before the city corporation council since 1997-98||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/draft-list-of-members-for-ward-committees-today/article35673572.ece
02 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||High Court directs SBI to pay Rs. 215 crore GST to A.P. govt.||A Division Bench of the A.P. High Court comprising Justices U. Durga Prasad Rao and B. Krishna Mohan refused to entertain a writ petition filed by the State Bank of India against an obligation to pay Rs. 215.11 crore towards under-declared GST to the State government on an exempted turnover and asked it to seek an alternate remedy from the appellate forum concerned. The SBI had filed the petition challenging an order of assessment issued by the Deputy Commissioner of State Tax (Audit, No.1 Division, Vijayawada), wherein the bank was held liable to pay GST to the tune of Rs. 215,10,75,375. The bank had primarily contended that it was not liable to pay any tax since it was not rendering any service while levying penal interest on defaulters. The Commercial Taxes Department had on the other hand relied on the agreements it entered into with various borrowers and determined that the levy of penal interest was actually an act of forbearance and a service for which the bank was charging amounts and hence was liable to pay GST. Y.N. Vivekananda, government pleader for commercial taxes, argued that the SBI was liable to pay the State tax but it could file an appeal by paying 10% of the tax assessed. Further, the department said it found many discrepancies in claiming of Input Tax Credit (ITC) through the relevant GSTR forms and monthly returns. Among other things, the bank might have claimed ITC on certain items that fell under the negative list. The department informed the High Court that it could not scrutinise such things as the bank did not provide invoices and other records for verification.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/court-asks-sbi-to-pay-rs-215-cr-gst-to-ap-govt/article35672988.ece
02 August 2021||BELAGAVI/ MYSURU/ BENGALURU,||Travellers to Karnataka hit by new norms||The enforcement of new COVID-19 guidelines, requiring a negative RT-PCR report for travellers from Kerala and Maharashtra, by the Karnataka government resulted in confusion at the inter-State checkposts, particularly the ones along the border with Maharashtra, leading to traffic snarls. The revised guidelines were issued in the wake of a surge in cases in the neighbouring States. The new guidelines, announced on Friday night, mandate that travellers to the State should carry a fresh RT-PCR negative report unlike the earlier system when a vaccination certificate was an option. As per the new rules, only negative test reports not older than 72 hours are valid entry documents. The police and the health workers at the inter-State checkposts refused entry to vehicles carrying passengers without the required RT-PCR negative reports. The move caused chaos as several travellers were not aware of the new norm. Even those having COVID-19 negative report found it difficult to enter the State from Maharashtra as a long queue of vehicles delayed the process of checking their reports. Though some travellers said they had received two doses of vaccines and should be allowed to enter, the police insisted that the rules had changed and that a RT-PCR test report was compulsory. Sahil Sheikh, a regular traveller between Maharashtra and Karnataka, remarked: “I have to shuttle three times a week. How can I keep getting tested twice a week?’’  ‘Streamlining soon’ Belgavi Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath and Superintendent of Police Lakshman Nimbaragi visited the Kuganoli checkpost on Sunday to take stock of the situation. Some passengers complained to Mr. Hiremath that the checking process was delaying their journey. Mr. Hiremath told The Hindu that the system would be streamlined in a few days. A similar situation prevailed along the border with Kerala. The Kodagu district administration, which has stepped up surveillance along the border, has also decided to carry out rapid antigen tests at all the checkposts from Monday. Similarly, more surveillance staff are likely to be deployed at the checkposts from Monday for quick screening of travellers. At the Attibele check post near Bengaluru, bordering Tamil Nadu, government officials were screening vehicles bearing registration numbers of Kerala and Maharashtra which were coming from both Kerala and Tamil Nadu. People who failed to show negative RT-PCR reports were asked to go back.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/visitors-to-karnataka-hit-by-new-norms/article35673119.ece

02 August 2021||HYDERABAD,||Dalit Bandhu scheme to have legal backing||The Cabinet on Sunday decided to give statutory backing to Dalit Bandhu programme of the government by enacting a legislation. The programme will be launched on a pilot basis in Huzurabad on August 16. Just as a legislation was passed for SC Development Fund in the past and budget allotted for it with a provision that the balance of money will not lapse but carried forward to the next year, the Cabinet felt the need for a similar Act for Dalit Bandhu. Speaking at the meeting, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said the economic backwardness of SCs was worse than STs with land holding of only 13 lakh acres throughout the State. Therefore, the government decided to empower SCs by sanctioning entrepreneurship units of Rs. 10 lakh each. There was no bank linkage to money sanctioned as it would amount to repayment burden to beneficiaries. The government would train the beneficiaries in the chosen models of entrepreneurship. Centres for Dalit Enterprise would be set up in all districts to encourage SC entrepreneurs. A release said the Cabinet resolved to set up a mechanism to continuously monitor the business enterprises of beneficiaries. It authorised the Principal Finance Secretary to identify surplus employees in all government departments to form a programme implementation team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dalit-bandhu-scheme-to-have-legal-backing/article35673465.ece

02 August 2021||CHENNAI,||RT-PCR negative report must for Kerala travellers||Passengers travelling from Kerala to Tamil Nadu from August 5 can enter only if they produce a RT-PCR test negative certificate, Minister for Health and Family Welfare Ma. Subramanian has said. Passengers coming by any mode of transport should carry the RT-PCR negative report. Revenue, medical and police department will check the movement of people and ensure that only those with negative report of RT-PCR test enter the State from Kerala, according to a press release. The certificates will be verified at 13 border check posts. In the wake of an increase in the case count over the last few days, this decision had been taken to curb the spread of COVID-19 early. The reason for initiating this measure from August 5 is to give people time to get tested and get a negative certificate to enter the State. Meanwhile, Mr. Subramanian conducted an inspection at the Chennai airport on Sunday. He said the visit was to oversee how the passengers, both international and domestic, were screened and tested. Kerala had been witnessing a spike in cases and while that government had been taking steps to control the spread, the State government had said it was crucial to check those who entered Tamil Nadu, the release said. Vaccine certificate People who had taken both doses of vaccine, with the second dose being taken 14 days prior to the day of their entry, should show the vaccination certificate. At present, international passengers arriving from London, Brazil, South Africa, Europe and West Asia have to go through thermal screening and RT-PCR test on arrival and the lab at the airport provides results in about four hours. For the international passengers from other countries, thermal scanning was done. There are plans to set up a facility for carrying out rapid RT-PCR test as well at Chennai airport this week.

02 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Govt. decision on Onam allowance, bonus soon||The strain on State finances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has put a question mark over the festival allowance and bonus given to government employees for Onam. Amid reports that the State government might give the ‘Onam tradition’ a miss this year, Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal said the government would finalise a decision on festival advance, allowance and bonus over Monday and Tuesday. The government would need to spend close to Rs. 300 crore for issuing the festival allowance and bonus and a slightly higher amount for the festival advance, Mr. Balagopal said. Thiruvonam falls on August 21 this year. Last year, the State government had paid Rs. 15,000 to employees as festival advance which was deductible from their subsequent salaries in installments. Employees with salaries up to Rs. 27,360 were paid Rs. 4,000 as bonus and those drawing higher salaries were given a festival allowance of Rs. 2,750. Advance salary unlikely This year, the government is unlikely to issue the salary for the month of August, the Onam month, in advance, a measure meant to energise the Onam markets. Mr. Balagopal pointed out that such a step was taken in previous years only when Onam occurred towards the end of a month, which is not the case this year. “We have never had to do it since 2018,” he pointed out. On the other hand, the government had announced that the distribution of welfare pensions for July and August will begin in the first week of August. For meeting the two-month payment to 55 lakh people, the government would need to shell out Rs. 1,600 crore. The government had also announced special Onam kits, containing 16 essential food items, to ration card holders. The State government is spending Rs. 526 crore on the food kits. Last week, the Finance Minister had also announced a Rs. 5,650-crore relief package in the Assembly for small traders and industries hit by pandemic-induced financial crisis.  The government will need to spend close to Rs. 300 crore for issuing the festival allowance and bonus. K.N.

02 August 2021||CHENNAI,||Auto LPG prices at all-time high||Auto LPG price touched an all time high of Rs. 55.51 a litre in Chennai with oil companies revising rates from Sunday. In Madurai, a litre was sold at Rs. 54.41 and in Coimbatore it was Rs. 52.97/litre. It went up by Rs. 5.41 from Rs. 50.10 a litre on July 1 in Chennai. It was Rs. 32.02 a litre in May 2020, and Rs. 44.55 in January 2021. The price did go up to Rs. 53.17 a litre in April but went down to Rs. 47.53 a litre in June. “It is putting an unnecessary burden on us. We cannot demand higher rates since customers are also not in a position to pay much. We have just about started getting trips with the lockdown being lifted,” said Selvam, an autorickshaw driver, who urged the government to revise meter fares. It has been eight years since the last revision. A source in the industry said a large section of call taxies that bought BS VI petrol vehicles have converted them to LPG vehicles. “Though it is still not legal, this conversion has been done without permission. Conversion to LPG is allowed only in the case of private vehicles and not for passenger vehicles. These car owners had to opt for this since diesel variants were not available for BS VI vehicles. They cannot afford to drive using petrol,” he said. Tamil Nadu Independent Rental Vehicle Association, general secretary, S. Jude Mathew, said compressed natural gas (CNG) is available at Rs. 51. Push for CNG “We want government to provide permits for cars and even semi-trailers that use CNG. Under the Centre’s Mudra Scheme we only get a loan up to Rs. 10 lakh, we want that to be increased to Rs. 20 lakh so that we can shift to CNG. Nearly two lakh vehicle owners will benefit from this,” he said. A fuel dealer in Coimbatore said auto LPG was doing quite well since it was just half the price of petrol and diesel. “Cars too have converted to auto LPG. People who bought new vehicles have LPG variants,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/auto-lpg-prices-at-all-time-high/article35673277.ece

02 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||As monsoon recovers, Kharif sowing lag drops below 5%||With the monsoon picking up pace again and covering the whole country, sowing of kharif crops is also showing signs of recovery. The lag in the sown crop area is now less than 5% in comparison with last year’s, an improvement from almost 12% two weeks ago. The biggest continuing lags are in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, where the three-week hiatus in the rains has resulted in lower sown area for rain-fed crops such as coarse cereals, oilseeds and pulses. This gains importance in view of the fact that rising prices of edible oils and pulses have been major contributors to recent inflation trends. Uneven spread Though the monsoon rainfall is now just 2% below normal, the overall figures hide both geographical and temporal unevenness. In the third week of June, the monsoon halted its progress across central India, resulting in a three-week delay in rain during a crucial sowing season. According to the India Meteorological Department, Madhya Pradesh, parts of Maharashtra, interior Karnataka and Telangana received excess rainfall in the last week of July, bringing their cumulative rainfall for the season up to normal. Gujarat, however, remains in the deficient category, along with eastern Rajasthan. Overall, a third of the districts across the country have seen deficits so far. According to Agriculture Ministry data, the total sown area across all crops as of July 30 was 848 lakh hectares, 4.7% lower than the 890 lakh hectares sown at the same time last year. A week ago, the lag was almost 9%. In mid July, the lag was 11.6%. The main kharif crop is paddy, which is seeing a 4% drop in acreage in comparison with last year’s, mostly from eastern India where the sowing window is still open. Millet area down Coarse cereals and oilseeds are both showing a lag of about 5.6% with shortfalls in Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. Ragi sowing is down by a third, with a 31% fall in crop area from last year’s. The area sown with jowar is down by 11%, bajra 9% and small millets 81%. Maize is the only cereal which is holding steady with no difference from last year’s. Groundnut coverage is down by 10% and soybean still lags 3.4%. Among pulses, the area sown with moong dal is 10% lower than last year’s, while urad lags 9%. Arhar dal sowing, on the other hand, is proceeding briskly, with a 4% gain in crop area so far.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/as-monsoon-recovers-kharif-sowing-lag-drops-below-5/article35672933.ece
02 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||UNSC Presidency: Jaishankar lays out policy perspective||India will always be a supporter of international law, said External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar laying out the policy perspective that the Indian team at the U.N. will pursue during the Security Council Presidency in August. The Minister’s comment came as India took charge on Sunday against the backdrop of intensifying conflicts in Afghanistan and Myanmar. “As we take over UNSC Presidency for August, look forward to working productively with other members. India will always be a voice of moderation, an advocate of dialogue and a proponent of international law,” said Mr. Jaishankar in a social media message. The comment indicates that maritime security, which is of significance in dealing with freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, is likely to receive bulk of Indian attention. However, four major Asian conflicts are raging and diplomatic analysts say India should focus on resolving the conflicts in Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Yemen and find a lasting solution to troubles in Syria. On Sunday, The Hindu reported that India will on August 9 organise a virtual Open Debate for heads of state and government titled “Maintenance of international pace and security: Enhancing maritime security — A case for international cooperation.” It was also reported that meetings related to the Asian conflicts could be convened during August. India’s past role in using the UNSC as a tool for conflict resolution was highlighted by Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri, who served as the Permanent Representative of India at the Security Council in 2011. “Ten years ago this day, India had last assumed presidency of the UNSC. I was privileged to preside over the horseshoe. We specifically cautioned against the ‘use of force’ in Libya and failure to act in Syria. Results are staring us in the face and continue to haunt the UNSC,” said Mr. Puri in a social media post on Sunday. The developments in Afghanistan and Myanmar especially are of immediate importance to India and the broader Asian region. India is an elected non-permanent member of the Security Council and had received support of the Asia-Pacific countries in the election.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/unsc-presidency-jaishankar-lays-out-policy-perspective/article35672944.ece
02 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||CIC flays govt.’s denial of details on oxygen panel||The Central Information Commission (CIC) has slammed the Union government’s blanket denial of information related to a committee overseeing medical oxygen supplies during the pandemic, stating that its rationale was “far-fetched” and “unjustified”. In its order on Saturday, Information Commissioner Vanaja Sarna directed the government to respond to the Right to Information (RTI) request within 10 days. The RTI request, filed by activist and freelance journalist Saurav Das in April 2021, sought information on a nine-member Empowered Group set up a year earlier under the Chairmanship of the Secretary, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade. When the first wave of the pandemic began, it was responsible for coordinating the supply of PPE kits, RT-PCR test kits, N-95 masks and gloves. It subsequently became responsible for the supply of medical oxygen as well. Mr. Das requested information on the dates, agenda and minutes of the committee’s meetings till date, and presentations made to the committee. The government denied the request, citing Sections of the RTI law that allow exemptions on the grounds of national security, strategic interests, commercial confidences, intellectual property and Cabinet papers. In a hearing on Saturday, the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) argued that the Empowered Group was set up in a time of crisis to cut across the several arms of the government and ensure that bureaucratic hassles did not impede decision-making. “These proposals and deliberations contain highly sensitive information,” he said. The CIC dismissed the government’s defence, saying that the citing of exemption on the grounds of Cabinet discussions “appears to be an afterthought, which seems far-fetched also”. The exemption cited related to national security was “also not justified.” The CIC further directed the CPIO to provide a reply within 10 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cic-flays-govts-denial-of-details-on-oxygen-panel/article35672966.ece
02 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Exercise held to fine-tune integrated theatre commands||As part of the process of evolving a consensus among the three services on the reorganisation of the forces into integrated tri-service theatre commands and fine-tune the model, a table-top war-gaming exercise was held on July 22 for the first time, in which all scenarios, including a collusive threat of a two-front war from China and Pakistan, were war-gamed, according to a Defence official. “At the meeting held on July 22, for the first time ever, a table-top exercise was war-gamed with operational settings, which was played across all theatres simultaneously, multi-domain and cross theatre. This was large in extent from the Northern Command to the Andaman and Nicobar islands, and catered to the collusive threat we expect from two of our neighbours,” the official said. This was played for a full day and was attended by around 40 officers, including the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS), General Bipin Rawat, three Service Chiefs, Vice Chiefs and Director-General of Military Operations equivalent from the three services. ‘Frank exchange’ There was a frank and freewheeling exchange to evolve the best process on theatrisation and many of the concerns put forward by various sides over the creation of the commands were addressed, including that of the Air Force, the official said. Explaining the consultations, the official said when Defence Minister Rajnath Singh was briefed in June, he had advised two things — to form a consultative committee to address the concerns of the stakeholders outside the services and hold consultations to resolve service issues one more time. The committee headed by the CDS, with the three Vice Chiefs and representatives from other Ministries concerned, had met and resolved most of the issues related to the functions, rotational nature of all commanders, need for a unified maritime structure, including the Coast Guard, and having the paramilitary in border commands, the official said. Broad consensus emerged on the need to take forward the theatrisation process expeditiously and the Air Force, too, is on board, the official said. “Various views were heard and would be taken on board. It was made aware that sufficient time would be given for the structures to be formed, reviewed and stabilised.” “The creation of integrated theatre commands West, East, Maritime Theatre Command [MTC] and Integrated Air Defence Command are accordingly being progressed,” officials said. As stated by Gen. Rawat earlier, the Northern Command would be left out of the ambit of the process for now and integrated at a later stage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/exercise-held-to-fine-tune-integrated-theatre-commands/article35672939.ece
02 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Clinical trials of ‘Ashwagandha’ soon||The Ministry of Ayush has collaborated with the U.K.’s London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) to conduct a study on ‘Ashwagandha’ for promoting recovery from COVID-19. A Ministry release said the All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA), an autonomous body under the Ministry of Ayush, and the LSHTM recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to conduct clinical trials of ‘Ashwagandha’ on 2,000 participants in three U.K. cities — Leicester, Birmingham and London (Southall and Wembley). ‘Indian winter cherry’ ‘Ashwagandha’ ( Withania somnifera ), commonly known as ‘Indian winter cherry’, is a traditional Indian herb that boosts energy, reduces stress and makes the immune system stronger. It is an easily accessible, over-the-counter nutritional supplement in the U.K. and has a proven safety profile. The positive effects of ‘Ashwagandha’ have been observed in long COVID-19, which is a multi-system disease with no evidence of its effective treatment or management. It added that the successful completion of the trial could be a major breakthrough and could give scientific validity to India’s traditional medicinal system. “While there have been several studies on ‘Ashwagandha’ to understand its benefits in various ailments, this is the first time the Ministry of Ayush has collaborated with a foreign institution to investigate its efficacy on COVID-19 patients,” the Ministry said. According to AIIA director Tanuja Manoj Nesari, who is also a co-investigator in the project along with Rajgopalan, coordinator (international projects), the participants have been randomly selected. Sanjay Kinra of the LSHTM is the principal investigator of the study. “For three months, one group of 1,000 participants will be administered ‘Ashwagandha’ [AG] tablets, while the second group of 1,000 participants will be assigned a placebo, which is indistinguishable from AG in looks and taste. Both patients and the doctors will be unaware of the group’s treatment in a double-blind trial,” Dr. Nesari said. The participants would have to take the 500 mg tablets twice a day. A monthly follow-up of self-reported quality of life, impairment to activities of daily living, mental and physical health symptoms, supplement use and adverse events would be carried out. It took over 100 meetings spanning about 16 months through both diplomatic as well as regulatory channels to sign the MoU, Dr. Nesari said. She added that the study had been approved by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and certified by the World Health Organizartion-Good Manufacturing Practices (WHO-GMP). Reducing anxiety Recently, a number of randomised placebo-controlled trials of AG in humans in India had demonstrated its efficacy in reducing anxiety and stress, improving muscle strength and reducing symptoms of fatigue in patients treated for chronic conditions. “After the trial’s success, ‘Ashwagandha’ will be a proven medicinal treatment to prevent infection and be recognised by the scientific community worldwide,” the Ministry noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/clinical-trials-of-ashwagandha-soon/article35672962.ece
02 August 2021||Srinagar,||Adverse police report to cause hurdles in J&K||The J&K police move to deny security clearance to those “involved in crimes prejudicial to the security of the State, including stone-pelting” is likely to affect hundreds of families in Kashmir, where the official list of street protesters swelled significantly between 2008 and 2017 to nearly 20,000. “All the field units of the CID SB-Kashmir are hereby directed to ensure that during verification related to passport service and any other verification related to government services, schemes, the subject’s involvement in law and order, stone pelting cases and other crime prejudicial to the security of the State be specifically looked into and same must be corroborated from local police station records,” the fresh order reads. It called for collecting digital evidence such as CCTV footage, photographs, videos, audio clips and quadcopter images available in the records of the police, security forces and agencies as references. “Any subject found involved in any such cases must be denied the security clearances,” it said. Top sources said the list of persons — including lawyers, journalists, politicians, civil society members — with “adverse background reports” had been growing longer in the past one year. Many mainstream leaders, even from the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party, were denied passport and travel documents. Former Chief Minister and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti was denied a passport in March after an “adverse” report by the CID. She approached the High Court but the judge observed that “the scope of this court in the matter of grant or otherwise of passport in favour of an individual is very limited”. Cycles of protests The fresh order is likely to leave hundreds of local people ineligible for passport and jobs in the Valley, which saw major upheavals and prolonged cycles of street protests and civilian killings during the 2008 Amarnath land row, the 2009 Shopian “murder” case, the 2013 hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, the 2016 Burhan Wani killing and the protests after the Centre’s move to end J&K’s special status on August 5, 2019. According to the official figures, 3,773 cases of law and order were registered in 2016 and 2017, and resulted in the arrest of 11,290 people. As many as 9,730 people faced charges between 2008 and 2017 for participating in the protests. The Omar Abdullah and the Mehbooba Mufti governments announced amnesty. Official figures suggest that between 2016 and 2017, 2,330 people were arrested in Srinagar, 2,046 in Baramulla, 1,385 in Pulwama, 1,123 in Kupwara, 1,118 in Anantnag, 783 in Budgam, 714 in Ganderbal, 694 in Shopian, 548 in Bandipora, 547 in Kulgam and two in Doda districts during 2016 and 2017. Around 56 government employees were among the 4,949 found involved in stone-pelting incidents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/adverse-police-report-to-cause-hurdles-in-jk/article35672931.ece
02 August 2021||New Delhi,||Unnao accident: Delhi court upholds CBI finding||A Delhi court has upheld the finding of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) which ruled out any foul play in the 2019 car accident involving the survivor of the Unnao gang rape. The CBI concluded that there was no evidence regarding criminal conspiracy hatched among the accused persons, including expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, who is serving a life imprisonment for raping the girl in 2017, with the driver of the truck, which collided with the car carrying the victims. On July 28, 2019, the survivor, along with her two aunts and a lawyer, were on their way to meet her uncle Mahesh Singh, who was lodged in a Rae Bareilly jail, when their car collided with a truck. The survivor’s two aunts and the lawyer were killed in the accident. Mr. Mahesh Singh, in his complaint, alleged that the accident was the result of a conspiracy hatched by Sengar along with his associates. He also alleged that in order to execute the conspiracy, the Personal Security Officers (PSOs) who were deployed with the rape victim and her family members were withdrawn which was why they were not accompanying the victims in the car. District and Sessions Judge Dharmesh Sharma noted, “There was indeed a very diabolical background of the events that had taken place prior to the incident in question, but at the stage of considering taking of cognisance of offences allegedly committed by the accused persons, this court cannot be swayed by public sentiments, media reports nor the aspect of the conviction of Kuldeep Singh Sengar”. “I have no hesitation in holding the findings of the CBI in the final report/charge sheet that there is no case against the accused persons so as to take cognisance and proceed against them under Section 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC r/w Section 120 B of IPC can not be faulted,” the judge said. The court said that merely because Sengar had been provided with a mobile phone “surreptitiously by the jail authority at Sitapur Jail would not invite an inference that he was involved in the planning the accident”. The court, however, framed charges against the truck driver for causing death by rash and negligent driving, besides framing charges of criminal intimidation against Sengar and his associates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/unnao-accident-delhi-court-upholds-cbi-finding/article35672950.ece
02 August 2021||Kolkata,||Trinamool eyes Tripura to gain national footprint||During the high-pitched election campaign in the 2021 West Bengal Assembly polls, Trinamool Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee did not attack the Left parties particularly the CPI(M). However, the only leader whose name the West Bengal Chief Minister referred to again and again during her campaign was former Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar. “Ask Manik Babu what the BJP has done in Tripura,” Ms. Banerjee would often refer in her speeches. Much to the advantage of the Trinamool, Mr. Sarkar campaigned in West Bengal largely stressing on the alleged excesses of police and administration on the economically weaker sections in Tripura after the BJP came to power in 2018. After the sweeping victory in West Bengal, it came as no surprise that the Trinamool Congress has set its eyes on the Tripura Assembly elections which are scheduled to be held in 2023. The recent controversy over I-PAC representatives being booked by the BJP government in Tripura and not being allowed to leave the hotel has come as on opportunity to it. Trinamool Congress general secretary and MP Abhishek Banerjee will on Monday be visiting Tripura.

02 August 2021||New Delhi,||Survivor alleges harassment by personal security officers||The Unnao rape survivor has approached a Delhi court alleging harassment by the personal security officers (PSO) deputed on the direction of the Supreme Court for her protection. District and Sessions Judge Dharmesh Sharma directed the Investigating Officer of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to submit an impact assessment report in this regard with the assistance of the local police. “Application has been moved on the behalf of the complainant that she and her family members were harassed by the PSOs who are deputed as per the direction of the Supreme Court, in a sense that they are not allowing her to enjoy her liberties,” the court said. The court said that a sealed envelope was also received from the police in which certain allegations were levelled against the complainant and her family members. “It is directed that this application be taken up for consideration, the court said. The woman was kidnapped and raped by expelled Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in 2017 when she was a minor. The case was transferred from Unnao to Delhi and was probed by the CBI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/survivor-alleges-harassment-by-personal-security-officers/article35672940.ece
02 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘States too must ensure cases are not filed under Sec. 66A’||States and their agencies share an “equal responsibility” to ensure that people are not booked under Section 66A of the Information Technology Act for expressing themselves freely on social media, the Centre has submitted in an affidavit to the Supreme Court.. Section 66A was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in a judgment in 2015. On July 5 this year, an apex court Bench led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman said it was “distressing,” “shocking” and “terrible” that people are still booked and tried under Section 66A even six years after the apex court struck down the provision as unconstitutional and a violation of free speech. The People’s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL), an NGO represented by senior advocate Sanjay Parikh and advocate Aparna Bhat, had drawn the court’s attention to the violations. Justice Nariman had authored the judgment trashing Section 66A in a petition filed by law student Shreya Singhal, who highlighted cases of young people being arrested and charged under the ambiguous provision for their social media posts. In its response, the Centre said the police and public order were “State subjects” under the Constitution. “Prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of crimes and capacity-building of the police are primarily the responsibility of the States,” the Centre submitted in the affidavit. It said law enforcement agencies share equal responsibility to comply with the apex court judgment. They take action against cyber crime offenders as per the law. The Centre said the Ministries of Information and Technology and Home Affairs had done their best to disseminate knowledge about the Supreme Court judgment in Shreya Singhal case. Section 66A had prescribed three years’ imprisonment if a social media message caused “annoyance” or was found “grossly offensive”. The Supreme Court had concluded the provision to be vague and worded arbitrarily. Justice Nariman had agreed with Mr. Parikh on July 7 that the “state of affairs is shocking”. Mr. Parikh had urged the court to intervene and work out a mechanism to disseminate the Shreya Singhal judgment to every police station and trial court in the country. “Section 66A of the IT Act has continued to be in use not only within police stations but also in cases before trial courts across India,” the PUCL has submitted. The NGO has urged the apex court to direct the government to collect all the data/information regarding investigations under Section 66A and pending cases in district and High Courts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/states-too-must-ensure-cases-are-not-filed-under-sec-66a/article35672947.ece
02 August 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra Raj Bhavan has become BJP’s office: Patole||Launching a broadside against the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole on Sunday charged the BJP with distorting history while accusing Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari of being a “BJP stooge” and his official residence, the Raj Bhavan, a “virtual office for the party”. He further lashed out at the Modi regime for severely curtailing the press, claiming that the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had extended a lot of freedom towards the fourth estate despite getting flak from it in the alleged Bofors Gun scandal. “Recently, the State’s Governor Koshyari commented that it was Jawaharlal Nehru who was responsible for Partition in 1947… ordinarily, if one were to talk of Pandit Nehru’s towering contributions in building the modern Indian nation, even 10 days would be less. But when the Governor of a State, who is supposed to be the holder of an impartial office, says such a thing, it is truly shameful…the Governor is behaving like a BJP agent and his residence is functioning like a veritable BJP office,” Mr. Patole said. He was speaking in Pune at the historic Kesari Wada building on occasion of the launch of a series of programmes to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee year of Independence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-raj-bhavan-has-become-bjps-office-patole/article35672952.ece
02 August 2021||BELAGAVI/ MYSURU/ BENGALURU,||Travellers to Karnataka hit by new norms||The enforcement of new COVID-19 guidelines, requiring a negative RT-PCR report for travellers, by the Karnataka government resulted in confusion at the inter-State checkposts, particularly the ones along the border with Maharashtra, leading to traffic snarls. The revised guidelines were issued in the wake of a surge in cases in the neighbouring States. The new guidelines, announced on Friday night, mandate that travellers to the State should carry a fresh RT-PCR negative report unlike the earlier system when a vaccination certificate was an option. As per the new rules, only negative test reports not older than 72 hours are valid entry documents. The police and the health workers refused entry to vehicles carrying passengers without the required RT-PCR negative reports. The move caused chaos as several travellers were not aware of the new norm. Even those having COVID-19 negative report found it difficult to enter the State from Maharashtra as a long queue of vehicles delayed the process. Though some travellers said they had received two doses of vaccines and should be allowed to enter, the police insisted that the rules had changed and that a RT-PCR test report was compulsory. Sahil Sheikh, a regular traveller between Maharashtra and Karnataka, remarked: “I have to shuttle three times a week. How can I keep getting tested twice a week?’’ ‘Streamlining soon’ Belgavi Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath and Superintendent of Police Lakshman Nimbaragi visited the Kuganoli checkpost on Sunday to take stock of the situation. Some passengers complained to Mr. Hiremath that the checking process was delaying their journey. Mr. Hiremath told The Hindu that the system would be streamlined in a few days. A similar situation prevailed along the border with Kerala. The Kodagu district administration, which has stepped up surveillance along the border, has also decided to carry out rapid antigen tests at all the checkposts from Monday. Similarly, more surveillance staff are likely to be deployed at the checkposts from Monday. At the Attibele check post near Bengaluru, bordering Tamil Nadu, government officials were screening vehicles bearing registration numbers of Kerala and Maharashtra which were coming from both Kerala and Tamil Nadu. People who failed to show negative RT-CPR reports were asked to go back.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/travellers-to-karnataka-hit-by-new-norms/article35673618.ece
02 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||Road to boxer’s home being repaired in Assam||The Public Works Department (PWD) has started repairing the road to boxer Lovlina Borgohain’s home in Golaghat district, eastern Assam. The work was undertaken soon after she reached the welterweight category semi-finals in women’s boxing at the Tokyo Olympics, assuring at least a bronze medal for India. The 23-year-old pugilist’s home in Baromukhia village under the Sarupathar Assembly constituency has had a partly-metalled road for years. The village is about 3 km from Barpathar, the nearest town. ‘Before she returns’ “We are trying to repair the road with sand and gravel before she returns from Tokyo. The road will be metalled after the monsoon season,” Sarupathar’s BJP MLA Biswajit Phukan said, adding that Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had wanted the road to be usable for vehicles within a few days. PWD officials said about 600 metres of the road leading to Ms. Borgohain’s home would be repaired for now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/road-to-boxers-home-being-repaired-in-assam/article35672964.ece

The event coincided with PLA Day on August 1, it stated. Peace measure Stating that the armed forces of the two countries had well-established mechanisms for communication at the ground commanders’ level, the Army said these hotlines in various sectors went a long way in enhancing the same, and in maintaining peace and tranquillity on the borders. India and China have two military hotlines in eastern Ladakh, among others at Chushul and Daulat Beg Oldi. The two sides held the 12th round of Corps Commander talks on Saturday at Moldo on the Chinese side. The details of the outcome are awaited. As reported by The Hindu earlier, since the stand-off began in eastern Ladakh in May 2020, in addition to the Corps Commander-level talks, the two sides have also held ten Major General-level talks, 55 Brigadier-level talks, and 1,450 calls over the two hotlines. In February, during a telephonic conversation, the Foreign Ministers of India and China agreed to establish a new hotline between the Foreign Ministries as a step to ensure “timely communication” against the backdrop of the Ladakh stand-off. This will be in addition to the long-delayed hotline between the Indian Army’s Director-General of Military Operations and China’s Western Theatre Command, which is expected to be established soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-china-establish-hotline-in-north-sikkim/article35672927.ece
02 August 2021||Mumbai,||Dhoot moves NCLAT to set aside Videocon order||Venugopal Dhoot, former promoter and chairman of the Videocon Group, has moved the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) against the June 8, 2021 order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai, approving the bid of Vedanta Group company Twinstar Technologies Ltd. to acquire the bankrupt Videocon Industries Ltd. for Rs. 2,962 crore. Mr. Dhoot has petitioned NCLAT to set aside the ‘Resolution Plan’ approved by the NCLT and to direct the Committee of Creditors to consider the ‘Resolution Plan’ submitted by him under Section 12A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) that entails a “zero haircut” (involving no loss to the banks or creditors). Accusing the resolution professional of withholding information in the tender form and eroding the value of the company by closing it down, Mr. Dhoot said in his petition that the resolution professional had violated Sections 30(2) and 61(3)(ii) of the IBC. He said the decision to separate the oil assets and the consumer durable assets of the company had led to minuscule price realisation from the bidding process, which he now wants scrapped.  The NCLT had in June, in a verbal order, accepted the bid of Twin Star Technologies Ltd. for Videocon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dhoot-moves-nclat-to-set-aside-videocon-order/article35672929.ece
02 August 2021||August 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Satellite maps to be used to resolve row||Two top officials, however, told The Hindu that the government had no plans to hold a “neutral probe” into the July 26 firing incident. Return of normalcy and confidence building is necessary in the area and that is why CRPF forces are patrolling the areas under the direct supervision of the Union government, the officials said. “Both the State governments are cooperating and the Central government is assured that there will be no more border flare-up,” one of the officials quoted above said. For a more permanent solution to dealing with inter-State border issues, the North Eastern Space Application Centre (NESAC) has been asked to map and demarcate the State boundaries using satellite imaging. The idea of using satellite imagery for settling border disputes was mooted by Union Home Minister Amit Shah a few months ago, said one of the officials. A joint initiative of the Department of Space (DoS) and the North Eastern Council (NEC), the Shillong-based NESAC is already being used for flood management in the region. In January this year, the Ministry for Development of the North East Region (DONER) gave the satellite imagery project to NESAC. “Since there will be scientific methods in the demarcation of borders, there will little scope for discrepancy and there shall be better acceptability of the boundary solutions by the States,” one of the officials said. However, an Assam government official, who didn’t want to come on record, contested such a claim. “Disputes arise mainly because there is a difference in perception regarding what constitutes our area and what constitutes their area. For example, Mizoram wants to follow the 1875 notification regarding Lushai Hills but it’s not acceptable to us,” the official said. The Mizoram government claimed that a 509 square-mile stretch of the inner-line reserve forest notified in 1875 — under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation of 1873 — belongs to it. The Assam government, on the other hand, maintained that the constitutional map and boundary drawn by Survey of India in 1933 was acceptable to it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/satellite-maps-to-be-used-to-resolve-row/article35672935.ece

Transportation of people and goods to and from Mizoram has thus been affected. Withdrawal of FIR likely The Mizoram government is likely to withdraw the FIR filed against Dr. Sarma, the State’s Chief Secretary, Lalnunmawia Chuaungo, told presspersons in Aizawl on Sunday. “Our Chief Minister has suggested that I should look into the inclusion of the Assam Chief Minister’s name in the FIR,” he said, pointing out that naming Dr. Sarma in the FIR did not have the approval of Mr. Zoramthanga. The Chief Secretary did not specify if the cases against six Assam officials and 200 other unidentified police personnel would be withdrawn.

Venkaiah Naidu objecting to the Chair’s decision not to admit adjournment notices under Rule 267 to discuss the Pegasus snooping controversy, a source said on Sunday. Though there is no official word on the letter, either from the Congress or Mr. Kharge's office, a senior leader confirmed to The Hindu that a letter was sent a few days ago. For over a week now, Opposition members have been giving notices under Rule 267 on the Pegasus issue but they have not been accepted. Mr. Kharge has raised the issue in the letter and is said to have pointed out that “Opposition is being denied an opportunity to raise issues even under the rule book”. When Mr. Naidu had pointed out that Opposition was preventing other members from raising important issues, Deputy Leader of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma had argued that Opposition should also be allowed to raise issues under the rule book. As the monsoon session enters its third week, the Opposition is all set to step up its demand for a debate on the Pegasus issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kharge-writes-to-venkaiah-on-denial-of-debate/article35673114.ece
02 August 2021||New Delhi,||Give details of vacancies for disabled in CSE: HC||The Delhi High Court has asked the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) to give the details of the total number of vacancies notified and reservations given in accordance with the Right of Persons with Disabilities Act for the Civil Services Exam (CSE), 2020. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh gave the direction while hearing two petitions which alleged that seats for the visually challenged and persons with multiple disabilities had not been reserved in accordance with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act of 2016. The High Court asked the DoPT to submit an additional affidavit before August 2, the next date of the hearing. “The DoPT will clearly highlight in the affidavit the total number of vacancies notified and the reservations given in accordance with Section 34(1) of the Right of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 as also the details of 251 vacancies for which it is stated that no reservations can be made,” the court ordered. The Union government’s standing counsel submitted that the final vacancies notified for the CSE, 2020, were 836, out of which there could be no reservation for 251 vacancies. Counsel said as against the remaining 585 vacancies, 24 had been reserved and, thus, the reservation was in accordance with the mandate of Section 34(1) of the Act, that is, 4%. The High Court was dealing with two petitions — one filed by the Evara Foundation and other by NGO Sambhavanam. It had earlier sought responses of the government, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and the DoPT on the petitions seeking quashing of the notice announcing the civil services preliminary and an interim stay on the declaration of the results on the ground that an inadequate number of seats had been reserved for persons with visual and multiple disabilities. The Evara Foundation contended that due to an inadequate number of vacancies for the visually challenged and those with multiple disabilities, fewer candidates belonging to these two categories would qualify for the main examination. The NGO Sambhavana said the UPSC had reserved only 24 vacancies for persons with disabilities out of a total 796 “expected approximate vacancies”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/give-details-of-vacancies-for-disabled-in-cse-hc/article35672955.ece

Mr. Shah said the State had developed in all fields under Mr. Adityanath, and the State government had done well during both waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking at the foundation laying ceremony of the Uttar Pradesh Institute of Forensic Sciences here, Mr. Shah targeted the Opposition parties and said “those dreaming” of coming to power in 2022 should prepare themselves for another rout. “Those dreaming [of coming to power], I want to tell them, bhaiya [brother], once again prepare yourself for a crushing defeat. BJP is going to form the government with a huge majority,” Mr. Shah said. In 2017, the BJP and its allies had won over 320 seats in the 403-member Assembly. Mr. Shah also appealed to voters in the State to not be misled, but to see for themselves the development works in their village and cities along with the change in the law and order situation since 2017. “Riots have come to an end. Look at that. Jativad [casteism] came to an end. BJP has uprooted parivaarvad [dynastic politics],” Mr. Shah said. ‘Not based on caste’ The BJP governments did not function on the basis of castes or families, but for the poorest person in the country and for improving law and order, he added. Mr. Shah attacked Opposition parties and political leaders, claiming that they get active only when elections approach. He said these leaders were nowhere to be seen during floods or COVID-19, or when farmers were dying of hunger. Later, speaking in Mirzapur while laying the foundation stone of the Vindhyavasini Corridor project, Mr. Shah asserted that the BJP did not fear vote bank politics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-on-top-in-terms-of-law-and-order-says-shah/article35673116.ece
02 August 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Paddy farmers in Punjab taking to DSR technique||Punjab Agricultural University’s (PAU) upgraded technology for the direct seeding of rice (DSR), the ‘ tar wattar ’ (good soil moisture) DSR, seems to have caught the fancy of paddy farmers in the State. A rise in the area planted under the novel DSR technique indicate that farmers are moving away from the traditional practice of puddle transplanting. Improved version The Ludhiana-based University introduced the DSR technique in 2020, an improved version of earlier DSR (dry) technique. In the new technique, pre-sowing irrigation is applied in a levelled field and the primed seed is sown immediately. “Last year, the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown had led to an exodus of labour. There was concern among farmers on the timely completion of planting due to a shortage of labour. However, availability of the DSR technology came to their rescue. Rice was directly seeded on about one-fifth of the area in the State. The successful adoption of the technology has even found an echo in Haryana. In 2020, rice was sown through DSR in about five lakh hectares in Punjab, against just 23,450 hectares in 2019,” Makhan Singh Bhullar, principal agronomist at PAU, told The Hindu . “This year, rice cultivation area under DSR has touched about five lakh hectares. We are hopeful that this may increase after the final data is compiled,” he said. Mr. Bhullar said yield levels after a large-scale adoption of the DSR technique in 2020 had convinced farmers about its viability. “The DSR method saves a lot of groundwater because the crop does not need frequent irrigation as in the case of a puddled paddy field. The method is also pocket-friendly as manual transplanting is getting costlier with each passing season. This method also addresses the shortage of farm labour,” Amreet Inder Dhillon from Mehtabgarh in Ludhiana, who uses the DSR technique, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/paddy-farmers-in-punjab-taking-to-dsr-technique/article35672969.ece

02 August 2021||August 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Mantra to protect children||Kamsa sends Putana to kill the baby Krishna, growing up in Gokula. Srimad Bhagavatam says she went as a lovely lady. Why did Putana have to adorn herself and look good? It was the norm in the past for a mother to dress up well and look pleasant, when she picked up her child to feed it, so that the child looking at her would be happy. Nampillai says this practice was observed widely. The importance of breastfeeding is stressed thus, elaborated V.S. Karunakarachariar in a mantra. Also, the first time a mother feeds her child, the father has to utter a mantra. Apsatambha sutra says that soon after the child is born, the mother must feed it from her right breast, while the father recites the mantra. The mantra goes thus: “Let no demons hurt your child. Let there be no danger to this child from ghosts. Let milk yielding cows not hurt this child. Let this child have a lot of affection for you. This child will drink up your old age. This child should get strength through your milk. ” So, the mantra says that neither harmful beings like demons, nor harmless ones like cows should hurt the child in any way. The phrase used in the mantra for the child is “dhanasya priyaa,” meaning the dear child is the mother’s wealth. Thus breastfeeding was given great importance, with a ritual and a mantra dedicated to it. When Putana puts Krishna to her breast, he sucks not only her milk, but her life as well. Later, Krishna recalling the incident, praises Vasudeva’s adherence to prescribed practices as having protected Him. He is referring here to the fact that when He was born, Devaki breastfed Him, and that Vasudeva recited the mantra for His protection at that time. The Lord showed the world the importance of this ritual and how the mantra serves to protect the baby.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mantra-to-protect-children/article35672963.ece

02 August 2021||Pune,||‘Permit import of crushed GM soy seeds’||After facing crushing losses for the last 18 months due to the pandemic, the poultry industry is demanding that the Union government permit the import of crushed genetically-modified (GM) soy seeds for captive consumption of farmers. With the sector bedevilled by increasing production costs, misinformation regarding the link between poultry and avian flu outbreaks, COVID-19-induced restrictions and natural calamities, skyrocketing prices of raw materials like soybean (that constitutes 25% of poultry feed) and maize (that constitutes 60%) in the last one year have only compounded the woes of the poultry farmers. “The outbreak of COVID-19 has created a massive crisis that led to an initial depletion of demand in chicken products due to false news about the link between the virus and poultry products. This created an unwarranted financial crisis and led to the erosion of working capital. For the last several months, high speculation activities in soya contracts on NCDX has been disturbing the sector,” said C. Vasanthkumar, president, Poultry Farmers and Breeders Association, Maharashtra. Relief measures The association urged the Union and the State government for non-fiscal and fiscal relief measures, including the restructuring of term loans and additional working capital. “We urge the governments to reschedule outstanding term loans by providing an extended time (6-12 months) for liquidation of loans to prevent the farmers from turning into non-performing assets. Considering the scale of financial losses, we request governments to grant interest subvention of at least 4% for three years and additional working capital loans to meet the increased production costs,” Mr. Vasanthkumar said. The most important non-fiscal is for the government to allow import of crushed GM soy seeds for captive consumption of end users, poultry farmers. “Given the ratcheting prices of soybean, we request the government to allow the import of crushed GM seed at least for the particular time frame to stabilise raw material market,” he said. Rising prices He said that the rise in soybean process had led to the skyrocketing of prices of eggs and chicken products in the retail market. “Chicken and eggs are the only cheapest non-vegetarian protein sources available in the market. But, owing to the increased raw material prices, retail chicken prices are rising at a whopping rate with chicken being sold at Rs. 250-Rs. 300 per kg in the retail market. This could lead to an inflation in food prices in the country amid the pandemic.” The sector has endured losses of more than Rs. 700 crore in Maharashtra alone since the eruption of the pandemic in March last year. “We had a similar situation in 2006 when there was a first outbreak of avian influenza. During that time, the government of India had announced interest subventions and increased the credit duration to the poultry farming for the limited period,” Mr. Vasanthkumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/permit-import-of-crushed-gm-soy-seeds/article35672967.ece

The July 31 deadline was set by Chief Minister Pramod Sawant with the aim of getting the State prepared to tackle a possible third wave of the infection. “Now, 87% of the eligible population of Goa has been given the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Currently, 23% of beneficiaries have got both doses,” State Vaccination Officer Dr. Rajendra Borkar said. Independent MLA Rohan Khaunte attacked the government for missing the deadline and said the Bharatiya Janata Party was more interested in “trampling democracy” than fighting the pandemic. Goa on Sunday reported 59 fresh cases and one death, taking the tally to 1,71,205 and the toll to 3,148. With 105 patients being discharged, total recoveries rose to 1,67,046.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/goa-misses-deadline-to-give-first-jab/article35673323.ece
02 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Union Ministers meet Muslim women||Union Ministers Smriti Irani, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Bhupendra Yadav held a meeting with a group of Muslim women on Sunday, which was observed as ‘Muslim Women Rights Day’ to mark the second anniversary of the enactment of the law against triple talaq. The Ministers also interacted with several women who were affected by triple talaq. Big reform: Naqvi Minister for Minority Affairs Mr. Naqvi said the law against triple talaq had proven to be a “big reform” to ensure constitutional rights for Muslim women, said a statement by his Ministry. Minister for Labour and Employment Mr. Yadav was quoted as saying that the Centre’s decision to provide quota for OBCs and economically backward sections in medical/dental studies would also benefit the poor sections of Muslims. Meanwhile, Over 650 citizens — Muslim and non-Muslim women, men and transpersons, women rights activists, human rights activists, academics, students and hundreds of citizens — issued a strong statement ‘rejecting’ the gesture of observing Muslim Women Rights Day as mere “optics during an unprecedented onslaught against the rights of the Muslims under the present government”. “This government has remained silent as Muslims have been lynched... The BJP, both at the Centre and through its State governments, has determinedly “gone after” Muslims under myriad laws, both old, new and proposed — beef bans, anti-conversion including the recent Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020, and its proposed U.P. Population Control Bill. Such a government has no moral right to declare any national day in the name of Muslim women,” the statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/union-ministers-meet-muslim-women/article35672942.ece
02 August 2021||Bengaluru,TAMIL NADU||Lack of Karnataka-T.N. bus service irks passengers||The absence of inter-State bus services between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu is proving to be a sore point for passengers at the Attibele checkpost. People with children and luggage in tow have no option but to get off one bus, cross the border on foot, and board another bus in the neighbouring State. More often than not, social distancing norms and other COVID-19 rules are being ignored as people line up to board buses. Regular commuters, frustrated by the lack of proper transport facilities, have questioned the logic behind banning inter-State services but running buses till the border even while auto drivers are making a killing by hiking fares. When contacted, Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) officials blamed the Tamil Nadu government for not allowing inter-State services. “After the peak of the second wave of COVID-19, we resumed services to other States, but the Tamil Nadu government has not yet lifted the ban. We faced a similar situation last year too. In fact, in 2020, Tamil Nadu was the last State to give the green signal to resume services. This time, too, we are yet to receive the go-head. If the Tamil Nadu government allows it, we are ready to provide services,” said a senior KSRTC official. Prior to the pandemic, KSRTC was operating 500 buses to Attibele, of which 250 were from Bengaluru alone. It currently operates just around 70-80 buses from Bengaluru to Attibele check post. Every day hundreds of people travel between Bengaluru and Hosur for work, and they are not happy with the continued ban on inter-State services. “There is no logic in banning the inter-State bus services when people are moving freely. On the other hand, train services between the two States are operational. Allowing bus services and ensuring that COVID-19 protocol is being followed will be safer than this,” said one passenger. Passengers also accused autorickshaw drivers and private van drivers of fleecing them by charging exorbitant fares. Drop in ridership from Kerala The KSRTC is also operating buses to Kerala from Bengaluru. However, the number of people travelling from Kerala to the city also dropped after the State government made it mandatory that they produce negative RT-PCR reports. “Prior to COVID-19, we operated 25 buses to Kerala from Bengaluru. Now, it has come down to two or three, and that too with poor occupancy,” said the official.  There is no logic in banning inter-State bus services when people are moving freely. Trains between the two States are operational. Allowing bus services and ensuring that COVID-19 protocol is being followed will be safer than this.

02 August 2021||BHADRADRI-KOTHAGUDEM,TAMIL NADU||Maoist killed in ‘encounter’||Amid the ongoing CPI (Maoist)’s Martyrs’ Week, the outlawed outfit suffered a blow in Bhadrachalam Agency as one of its armed cadre was killed in an “exchange of fire” with the police in Bodanalli forest area in Charla mandal, bordering Chhattisgarh, on Sunday morning. The encounter took place around 8.15 a.m. in the forest area about 3 km from Bodanalli when a team of special party police personnel was engaged in a combing operation, police said. An unidentified male Maoist was killed in the “exchange of fire” that ensued, police added. Police suspect him to be a key Maoist cadre from Chhattisgarh’s south Bastar region. A combing operation was launched in the forest area of the Agency mandal based on reliable information that Maoists of the Charla Local Organising Squad (LOS) and an action team were moving near Kurnapalli-Bodanalli area to commit offences in connection with the ongoing Maoist Martyrs’ Week, Superintendent of Police Sunil Dutt said. The combing police parties spotted ten armed Maoists during the search operation at about 3 km east of Bodanalli on Sunday morning. An exchange of fire took place between the police and the Maoists. During the subsequent search operation, the combing police parties recovered the body of a male Maoist aged around 23 years. One .303 rifle and two kit bags were recovered from the spot, the SP added. Additional forces have been fanned out to track down the armed Maoists rebels, who retreated into the jungle after the encounter. Local police shifted the body to the mortuary at the Government Area Hospital. One held Meanwhile, Charla police arrested a Chhattisgarh-based Maoist militia member, identified as Madivi Ramesh, 27, during a vehicle-checking drive at Danavaipeta in Charla mandal late on Saturday afternoon. The police said pamphlets relating to Maoist Martyrs’ Week were recovered from his possession.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/maoist-killed-in-encounter/article35672986.ece
02 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Do not force govt. to impose lockdown: CM||Reiterating that the public must comply with all restrictions imposed by the Tamil Nadu government to control the spread of COVID-19, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Sunday urged them not to force the hand of the government to impose strict lockdown restrictions. In a recorded video clipping, the Chief Minister said, “People should not become a reason [for the spread of COVID-19] themselves by crowding [public places]. I strongly request you all not to force the government to impose restrictions.” Since vaccination was the best weapon available against the pandemic, Mr. Stalin reiterated that people take both doses of the vaccine. “We are exhausting the vaccines being given by the Union government. We are also additionally procuring vaccines. The number of vaccines given by the Union government in phases is not sufficient. But we are providing vaccines to the people as they come,” he said. Doctors are saying that the third wave may be worse than the first and second waves, and it may be like the Spanish flu, the Chief Minister said. Pointing to repeated attacks by the Zika virus and the Delta and Delta Plus COVID-19 variants, Mr. Stalin said, “We will win over them. Step out of your house only if it is absolutely necessary. Always wear two masks and do not remove them while in public places.” Recalling the reasons behind allowing the reopening of shops so that the people can get their requirements, he said people are failing to follow norms by not wearing masks or by crowding in public places. “I am pained to see that people do not have awareness,” he said. Explaining the rationale behind allowing authorities across the State, including Chennai, to impose restrictions in crowded areas, Mr. Stalin said people should not violate norms. The pandemic has been affecting people across the country for over 18 months now. Various precautionary measures taken by the government, medical infrastructure in Tamil Nadu and the dedicated service of doctors, nurses and medical staff helped the State government control the pandemic so far, he noted. “We have only controlled the second wave but have not put a full stop to it. Since it is contagious, we could not,” Mr. Stalin said. Even in countries that claimed to have halted the infection, fresh cases were being reported, he said. “In neighbouring States like Kerala and Karnataka, the cases are increasing. In Maharashtra, the cases are increasing. There are various challenges in controlling the spread in crowded areas,” he pointed out. Observing that the government had the responsibility to control the spread of COVID-19, he said a complete lockdown controlled the spread but as relaxations were allowed, the spread resurfaced. “Be it a third wave or any other wave, the Tamil Nadu government has the power to face it,” the Chief Minister said. Though medical infrastructure in the State was available, people should avoid the infection, he said, and added that, “Compared to the first wave, the second was different. The third wave may be different than the second. Since the virus’ character should be studied to be certain, people should not be careless.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/do-not-force-govt-to-impose-lockdown-cm/article35673232.ece
02 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Doctor’s phone hacked, Rs. 2.4 lakh stolen from bank account||In a novel fraud, Rs. 2.4 lakh was stolen from a doctor’s account after she provided her KYC details, to keep her SIM active, through an app sent by the suspect. Not knowing that she was walking into a trap, Dr. Chandini Prabhakar, a dermatologist in Anna Nagar, called what she thought was the customer care number of the mobile phone operator. She was asked to download the “QPay” app and transfer Rs. 10 for confirmation of her identity and continuation of SIM card services. Soon after the money was transferred and receipt issued, Dr. Chandini received SMS messages containing one time password for transfer of Rs. 1 lakh, Rs. 90,000 and Rs. 50,000 within few minutes. “I tried to cut the call but it did not work. The caller seemed to be online and even hacked my phone since he accessed OTP to take away Rs. 2.4 lakh. I could not make any calls from my phone after that and had to raise a complaint with the State Bank of India from a landline phone,” she said. Dr. Chandini lodged a complaint in Anna Nagar police station. The number from which the suspect called appeared to be an internet-enabled voice call. “It is surprising that Rs. 10 got transferred into the account of the service provider and then the caller starts accessing my phone. After securing data from the phone, I discarded the SIM.” The dermatologist said she never shared any identity details, debit card credentials, card verification value (CVV) number and OTP with the suspect. “It is clear that once I transferred Rs. 10 via net banking on QPay, the accused took control of my phone even while I was on the call updating him about the payment details,” Dr. Chandini said. A search on Truecaller app showed one of the numbers to be belonging to “Vi Ekyc Office”. The Ministry of Home Affairs recently launched a Helpline Number 155260 operational 24/7 in eight States, including Tamil Nadu, for reporting cyber crime. The number is operational in all other States between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Police said those handling the helpline desk were equipped with resources to stop payments to suspect accounts if the offence is reported within 24 hours. Victims can access the “Citizen Financial Cyber Frauds Reporting and Management System” by visiting the National Cybercrime Reporting Portalwww.cybercrime.gov.into lodge complaints for immediate action, sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/doctors-phone-hacked-rs-24-lakh-stolen-from-her-bank-account/article35673256.ece
02 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Rehabilitation row delays Cooum project||Residents of five habitations along the Cooum continue to offer stiff resistance to resettlement, disrupting the eco-restoration project. Setting a deadline of December 2021, officials of various line agencies of the State government are planning to offer attractive options for residents who resist resettlement. At least 80% of the work in mitigating sewage pollution in the river has been completed. However, the recent intervention by political leaders in the issue of resettlement along the Cooum has disrupted the plans of the government agencies. On Sunday, the Greater Chennai Corporation announced that it had advised the PWD not to resume demolition before providing alternative houses in a few habitations that report resistance. Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said 93 families had been shifted from Arumbakkam to new houses in Pulianthope. “The new houses are nice actually. We will take care of the families. Our purpose is not to dislocate any family,” said Mr. Bedi. At least seven habitations continue to resist resettlement. Officials have planned to give them better options, including houses in the core city areas such as K.P. Park in Pulianthope, which is 9 km away from the site of demolition. Alternative methods of resettlement with attractive options have been planned for the residents of around 10 of the 60 habitations along the river. “We have completed resettlement of 12,400 families in 50 habitations. People in some habitations continue to resist. We have started persuading them. At least 1,900 families have to be resettled to complete eco-restoration of the Cooum,” said an official. The areas that are resisting include a Bharathipuram, Kathiravan Colony, Manjakollai, Gajalakshmi Colony and Thiruveethiamman Koil street. Once the residents are resettled, the Cooum will become 100% wider as against its present width in such areas. The maximum width of the river has increased to 300 metres as against 100 metres before the removal of encroachments. Officials said the opposition by various political leaders had disrupted the process. VCK’s stand After meeting the affected people in R.K. Nagar in Arumbakkam, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi founder Thol. Thirumavalavan said the Corporation had identified 93 houses on the banks of Cooum in Arumbakkam. “The alternate accommodation has been provided in Pulianthope. Four or five houses of those who agreed to move to Pulianthope had been demolished after they had removed their possessions. People have been slowly removing their possessions. Around 21 people, who have been staying here on rent for a long time, have demanded houses in Pulianthope. This has been rejected by officials. We urge the Corporation to accept this demand,” he said. Mr. Thirumavalavan said families who had been living in the city for generations were consistently being uprooted from their place. “Many of them drive rickshaws and do household work. If they are being removed from this place, it affects their livelihood. Even if they are given a house, they cannot travel 20 km and do their day-to-day work. Though the State government says those living on Cooum river banks are being evicted based on Court order, they should be allotted houses in the same place where they are living,” he said. He said that evicting people would affect the DMK politically. The Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust, formed in 2010, has been coordinating with with various departments and agencies to implement the Cooum eco-restoration project in the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rehabilitation-row-delays-cooum-project/article35673244.ece
02 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||As COVID tests increase, so do daily cases and TPR||The increase in COVID-19 cases in Tamil Nadu since Thursday has been accompanied by a marginal rise in the test positivity rate (TPR). The fact that the TPR has been witnessing an increasing trend, albeit marginally, despite a noticeable increase in the number of tests, has highlighted the need to be alert about the possibility of a rapid increase in cases in the coming days. While the number of people tested per day stayed at an average of around 1.42 lakh the week before, it gradually increased to 1.55 lakh on Wednesday. Since then, the TPR has increased from 1.1% to 1.3% on Sunday, accompanied by an increase in cases from 1,756 on Wednesday to 1,990 on Sunday. A region-wise analysis showed that an increase in cases along with the tests performed was noticeable in the northern, western and delta regions (see infographic). In the delta region, the TPR went up from 1.3% to 1.7% between Wednesday and Saturday. In the same period, the western region witnessed an increase in the TPR from 1.6% to 1.8%, and the northern region from 1% to 1.1%. In terms of daily cases, the delta region saw a spike from 279 cases on Wednesday to 369 on Sunday. In the same period, cases reported in the western region increased from 654 to 758. Cases in the northern region increased from 651 on Wednesday to 707 on Saturday before falling to 686 on Sunday, possibly due to a drop in testing. The southern region appeared to buck the trend, as it did not report a noticeable increase in the number of cases despite an increase in the number of tests. It was the only region to have a TPR of less than 1%. Coimbatore, Thanjavur and Chennai were among the districts that witnessed the highest increase in cases over the past few days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/as-covid-tests-increase-so-do-daily-cases-and-tpr/article35673236.ece
02 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Srivilliputhur sanctuary has high leopard density: report||The Srivilliputhur Grizzled Squirrel Wildlife Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu has the highest leopard density (per 100 sq km), not just in the State but in the entire Western Ghats landscape. The population of leopards in the State is in the range of 828-908. The data is based on the final report on the ‘Status of Leopards, Co-predators and Megaherbivores in India - 2018’, released by the Environment and Forests Ministry on Global Tiger Day 2021. According to the report, 14 sites were camera trapped in Tamil Nadu that yielded 2,017 pictures of 629 leopards. The 2014 report pegged its population at 815 with a range of 587-1,043. An additional number of 100 sq km grids sampled in 2018 was 29, out of which four had leopard presence. The density of leopards in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve was 12.11. In parts of Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve, the number stood at 7.05. Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve supported high density of leopards with 10.18. Surprisingly, Srivilliputhur Grizzled Squirrel Wildlife Sanctuary had the highest leopard density of 20.43 in the entire Western Ghats landscape. The squirrel sanctuary, combined with Meghamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, is now a tiger reserve. The report noted that the growing human population and increasing fragmentation of the landscape had increased human-wildlife interactions. The coffee-tea estates and other commercial plantations surrounded by forests were frequently occupied by leopards and were major hubs for human-leopard conflicts in Tamil Nadu, it pointed out. “It is a surprise to us,” said T.S. Subramaniya Raja of the Wildlife Association of Rajapalayam. “We have often heard villagers in the foothills of the sanctuary saying they spotted leopards now and then,” he recalled. A section of watchers and guards also confirmed that they regularly spotted leopards. “The leopards keep to the boundaries and stroll inside the forests. So there have not been any major conflicts with the human population outside the forests,” said Mr. Raja. “A focused tiger management will help in co-predator balancing. Leopards remain prone to poaching. Protection has to be strategic and strong to sustain the populations,” said Shekhar Kumar Niraj, Chief Wildlife Warden, Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/srivilliputhur-sanctuary-has-high-leopard-density-report/article35673314.ece

The phase II project is for 118.9 km with three corridors — Madhavaram-Shollinganallur, Madhavaram-SIPCOT and Light House-Poonamallee — will be built at an estimated cost of Rs. 61,843 crore over eight years. According to sources in Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL), the piling work has started between Poonamallee and Porur which will be an elevated section and the first part of the phase II project was expected to be opened to public in four years. “A few weeks ago, the contractor — a joint venture between Hindustan Construction Company and KEC International Ltd. — started the test piling work in one location and the piling work has begun along this stretch in places like Porur bypass, Iyyappanthangal and Poonamallee. Barricades have been placed in places for the piling work and some of the equipment and the piling rigs too were brought in last week,” an official said. The work on Porur-Power House stretch would start later this month as the contractor was mobilising resources, manpower and getting the equipment. Until then, there would be no traffic diversion in the area, officials said. Meanwhile, barricades had been put up in some parts of the city and preparation had started for a section of the underground work on the Madhavaram-Taramani stretch.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/metros-phase-ii-project-piling-work-begins-in-porur/article35673248.ece

02 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK against demolition of Pennycuick’s house for library||The AIADMK on Sunday opposed any move to demolish the memorial of Colonel John Pennycuick, the architect behind the construction of the Mullaperiyar dam, for the construction of a library to be named after late DMK leader and former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi. In a joint statement, AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam and co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami warned that their party would join protests with farmers if the government went ahead and demolished the priceless memorial. Any move to demolish the memorial of Colonel John Pennycuick only to construct a library to be named after the late DMK leader was nothing but an attempt to “erase history”, they claimed, and urged the DMK government to rethink the proposal. “The AIADMK urges the Tamil Nadu government to set up the Kalaignar Library in a place where there is no objection,” they said. Colonel John Pennycuick had even contributed money out of his personal funds towards the construction of Mullaperiyar dam, which has been a source of livelihood for people in southern Tamil Nadu, they pointed out.

In a social media post, he said that the State government must give up the plan. “It is a welcome move to build a library that would help in the growth of knowledge in Kalaignar’s name, but it is not right to do that by demolishing the house in which Pennycuick lived,” he said. He said that the State government owns enough land in the Madurai Pandi Koil region and a grander library can be built there. Minister’s reply Public Works Minister E.V. Velu condemned the statement released by the AIADMK, and criticised AIADMK leaders Edappadi K. Palaniswami and O. Panneerselvam.

02 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Govt. plans to observe birth anniversary of Rajendra Chola||For the first time, the Tamil Nadu government is planning to observe the birth anniversary of the legendary Tamil king Rajendra Chola I on Aadi Thiruvathirai at Gangaikonda Cholapuram in Ariyalur district later this week. An official announcement may be made in the next few days, multiple sources told The Hindu . As per the tentative plans, the Archaeology, Tourism, Art and Culture Departments would organise an exhibition and cultural programmes in Gangaikonda Cholapuram, the capital of the Chola Empire during the reign of the celebrated king. “Though the Tamil Nadu government has been observing the birth anniversary of legendary king Rajaraja Chola on Aippasi Sathayam , the birth anniversary of his son Rajendra Chola I has not been observed,” a source pointed out. However, a few history enthusiasts, including retired bureaucrats, have been visiting Gangaikonda Cholapuram every Aadi Thiruvathirai to conduct special prayers. A few inscriptions had indicated details about the birth star of Rajendra Chola I, and Aadi Thiruvathirai is widely believed to be the king’s birthday. “Funds to the tune of about Rs. 6 lakh are likely to be sanctioned for the function,” the source added. It may be recalled that various farmers’ associations and religious organisations have, in the past, demanded that the birth anniversary of Rajendra Chola I be celebrated. The legendary king is credited with the construction of several temples in the Indian sub-continent. In 2014, the Indian Navy commemorated the 1,000th anniversary of the coronation of King Rajendra Chola I, who had a mighty navy that expanded his empire to various parts of Southeast Asia. The State Archaeology Department has an office nearby and is putting together the chart for the event along with district administration in Ariyalur, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-plans-to-observe-birth-anniversary-of-rajendra-chola/article35673238.ece
02 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Court sets aside ESIC’s demand notice on city jewellery trader||Employees Insurance Court (Principal Labour Court), Chennai, has set aside demand notice of the Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) seeking contribution from Vummidi Bangaru Jewellers based on payments made to goldsmiths towards making and polishing charges of gold ornaments and silver wares. In its petition, Vummidi Bangaru Jewellers said ESIC issued an order on May 21, 2007 demanding a contribution of about Rs. 11.72 lakh for the period 1999-2000 and 2003-2004. The company said it did not have any major manufacturing activity and that it handed over gold bars to goldsmiths who were independent contractors. The employees of the independent contractors would complete the work and hand over the finished product to them and it did not have any control and supervision over them. ESIC argued that the goldsmiths concerned came under the supervision of the company which retained the right to rectify, through them, any defect in the product. In order to bring any person within the meaning of the employee under the Employees State Insurance Act, as per Section 2 (9), the said employee should be under the supervision of the principal employer. The court held that the right of the principal employer to reject or accept the work done by the contractor through his employees in itself could not be construed as effective and meaningful, “supervision” as envisaged under the Act. Therefore, the demand for contribution towards the ESI based on the payment made to goldsmiths towards manufacturing and polishing charges was without any basis and liable to be set aside, it added. It directed the company to pay contributions in respect of other activities.  The principal employer’s right to reject or accept work done by the contractor through his employees in itself can’t be construed as effective and meaningful, supervision||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/court-sets-aside-esics-demand-notice-on-city-jewellery-trader/article35673271.ece

The members of the council, which comes under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, have complained that the revenue and police officials of Mamallapuram conducted an “inspection” in the Fishermen Colony all of a sudden and sealed the hotel. They alleged that the police officials abused the group, mostly consisting of homeless and jobless transpersons. Mr. Shankar said a revenue official of the Chengalpattu district, along with a team of police officials, came to their house where a group of transgenders had assembled for dinner and asked them to leave the place immediately. Mr. Shankar complained that the police officials abused the transgenders for assembling without taking permission from the district authorities when the lockdown was in force. The transgender activist said taking up the issue with the Chengalpattu Collector did not help as the latter asked the official to seal the “hotel” without inquiring into the issue. The place where dinner was served was a community kitchen, he said. A senior official of the Chengalpattu district said as lockdown restrictions were in force, they had received information that a group had assembled without taking any permission. “On inspection, we found the group was having food along with drinks and so the place was sealed.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/transgender-activist-alleges-abuse-by-officials/article35673254.ece

02 August 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Diversion of funds delays sewer line work to Ondipudur treatment plant||For over five years, the sewage treatment plant in Ondipudur is lying idle. The plant with a capacity to treat 60 million litres a day is treating only around two million litres a day because the Coimbatore Corporation is yet to lay the underground sewer line to take sewage to the plant. The Corporation began in 2019 the work to lay the main sewer line below the Trichy Road to take sewage from areas east and south of Lakshmi Mills Junction to the treatment plant. But, it has not yet completed the work. Sources in the Corporation said the delay was because there was diversion of funds meant for the sewer line work to other works. The Corporation that had obtained funds from the Central and State governments under the then Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) for the underground sewer line work had diverted it to its general fund to carry out other works. This diversion came to light recently during a meeting senior officers held to review the progress made in various projects and speed up projects in progress, the sources said. The diversion was to the tune of a few crore rupees. The Corporation was now trying to mobilise resources under various heads like property tax to improve its fund position under the ‘general fund’ head to divert it back to the JNNURM fund to carry out the work. The diversion meant that the Corporation could not pay the contractor it had engaged to lay the main sewer line. At the time of starting the sewer line work, the Corporation had estimated the project cost at Rs. 30 crore to lay pipeline for around 5 km. The cost included the money the Corporation had to pay to the National Highways for digging up the road to lay the sewer line. The sources said the Corporation hoped to retransfer the fund to the JNNURM account in the near future as it wanted the work to be completed so that it could start giving underground sewer connections to residents in the east and central part of the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/diversion-of-funds-delays-sewer-line-work-to-ondipudur-treatment-plant/article35673307.ece

The deceased has been identified as M. Manikandan, a resident of Nanjappa Chettiyar Street at Ondipudur. The police said that Manikandan and his friend A. Senthilnathan (29) consumed alcohol on Friday evening and went to the latter’s house. Senthilnathan found five men namely R. Anishkumar (40), R. Ajishkumar (32) of Krishnasamy Naidu Street at Ondipudur, R. Arockiasamy Antony (39) of Kannabiran Nagar at SIHS Colony, R. Sathyanarayanan (28) of Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh, and K. Vivekanandan (36) of Nesavalar Colony at Ondipudur preparing food and consuming alcohol near his farm house. Senthilnathan questioned the five men, who are friends of his brother Raghunathan, why they were cooking and consuming liquor at the place. The men argued with Senthilnathan and questioned his authority to intervene. Sathyanarayanan, Ajishkumar and his brother Anishkumar stabbed Senthinathan. When Manikandan came to his friend’s rescue, Antony and Vivekananthan stabbed him thrice. Manikandan left the place with injuries, said the police. The five men escaped when a person known to Senthilnathan came to the place. He called an ambulance and Senthilnathan was admitted to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH). According to the police, Manikandan was taken to a private hospital after his brother Suresh Kumar noticed the wounds. Though doctors at the private hospital asked Manikandan to get admitted at CMCH, he returned to his house. “Manikandan was taken to the private hospital again on Saturday morning after he complained of severe pain from the stab wound in the abdomen. The private hospital referred the injured to CMCH. However, he died while being rushed to the hospital,” said a police officer here said.

02 August 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Corpn. asked to abide by court order, take possession of reserved site||It has been nearly three years since a Coimbatore court directed the Coimbatore Corporation to take possession of a reserved site in Thiru Nagar but the civic body had done little since. On September 10, 2018, the Third Additional Judicial Magistrate Court ruled that the plaintiff K. Rajesh was in illegal possession of 40.17 cent land in Thiru Nagar that legally and rightfully belonged to the Corporation. Mr. Rajesh had claimed that he had been in possession of the land that was divided into 30 plots and on which the dining hall, kitchen and power room of a wedding hall were constructed. He had told the court that the land was a reserved site when the locality was carved out of a 4.51 acre land. Though at the time of developing the 4.51 acre, dividing into housing sites and getting the approval of the government agency concerned the 40.17 cent land was shown as reserved site, later another plot of around 50 cent was shown as reserved site and this 40.17 cent land was divided into 30 plots and it was those 30 plots that was in his possession. Therefore, it was wrong on the Corporation’s part to claim the 40.17 cent as reserved site. The Corporation contested his claim saying that once the developer had shown the 40.17 cent as reserved site and registered in records, even it did not have the powers to have it changed. Further, the developers showing the 50 cent land as reserved site to take possession of the 40.17 cent reserved site was illegal and it was not informed of it. The Third Additional Judicial Magistrate after going hearing the arguments from both sides and perusing the records dismissed Mr. Rajesh’s petition to rule in the Corporation’s favour. But, the Corporation had done little to take possession of the land and demolish the illegally constructed dining hall, kitchen and power room, said civic activist S.P. Thiyagarajan. It should immediately take possession of the land to develop a park in the area, he added. Corporation officials said they would look into the issue and do the needful as it was keen on protecting reserved sites.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corpn-asked-to-abide-by-court-order-take-possession-of-reserved-site/article35673289.ece

Citizens' Voice Coimbatore said in a letter to Minister for Milk and Dairy Development S.M. Nasar that it was often getting complaints from consumers that vendors were mixing old packets of Aavin milk when they purchase more number of packets. C.M. Jayaraman, president of the consumer body, told The Hindu that the date of packing the milk was printed illegibly in very small fonts so that it was difficult for the buyers to read it.“This can be rectified by increasing the size of the font of the date of packing. They may also print the first two alphabets of the day on which the milk is packed in Tamil and English. Aavin may also consider the possibility of introducing a colour coding system on every packet, printed adjacent to the date of manufacture. Seven different colours may be adopted to indicate the day of packing to help even the illiterate to ensure the freshness of the milk they buy,” he said. Private agents According to him, some of the private agents of Aavin were allegedly collecting prices higher than the maximum retail price printed on the packets, ranging from 50 paise to Rs. 1 per litre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/consumer-body-seeks-colour-coding-for-aavin-milk-packets/article35673312.ece

02 August 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||‘Appoint more teachers at panchayat school’||With the collective steps taken by the school, parents and other stakeholders increasing the strength of students at the Panchayat Union Primary School at Nadupalayam in Shenbagapudur Panchayat in Sathyamangalam block from two to 65, the school management committee has urged the district administration to appoint more teachers. The school was started in 1992 and students from villages of Nadupalayam, Chinnvai Pudur, Chinna Kuttai Pudur, Nadupalayam Colony and Thimma Naicken Pudur are pursuing studies all these years. Over 100 students are studying in the school every year. However, when a private school was started in the area, admissions dropped and only two students, a Class 2 and Class 3, were studying. A headmaster and a noon-meal organiser with an assistant are on the rolls. Coordinated efforts taken by the stakeholders increased the students’ strength to 65. Recently, the committee led by its president Sumithra met at the school and discussed various issues. A resolution urged filling the post of two teachers and also appointing more teachers based on the students’ strength. Another resolution wanted infrastructure improvements on a par with private schools and increase the number of classrooms from the present two to four.

Resolutions Various resolutions were adopted at the party’s meeting held at Thingalur panchayat recently. A resolution said that the 30 hamlets in the Thingalur and Germalam panchayats received power supply from the Rajan Nagar station in Sathyamangalam. Since the lines were erected through forest areas and the hamlets were located far-off from the plains, low voltage was a major problem. Since trees in the forest area frequently fell on the electric lines, power supply gets disrupted and it was restored only after two or three days. “Even people cannot charge their mobile phones during such days,” the resolution said. The resolution added that students were unable to attend online classes due to power fluctuations. Instead of Rajan Nagar station, power should be drawn from Kempanaickenpalayam station, as the distance between the station and the panchayats was less. “It will help the hamlets get power without fluctuations,” the resolution said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/provide-power-supply-to-thingalur-germalam-panchayats-from-kempanaickenpalayam-station/article35673423.ece

02 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Devotees throng Meenakshi temple||Even as Madurai district administration has announced closure of all major temples from Monday, a large number of devotees thronged Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple on Sunday. It was an unusually huge crowd considering that only a moderate number of devotees visited the temple after it reopened once lockdown restrictions were lifted. “I regularly visit the temple. Today, I came for the monthly services. I feel bad that the temple will be closed from tomorrow,” said Eswari, 45, of Munichalai. She felt that more devotees would like to visit the temple in the next one week for the various festivals. Shopkeepers on Chithirai, Avani Moola, Masi and Veli streets are also worried about the closure of the temple as majority of them depend on devotees and tourists for their business. “Mine is a small textile shop and closure of the temple means no business for me,” said K. R. Kannan, 53. For him, the two lockdowns in the last two years has been a nightmare. “I don’t know how I am going to pay salaries to my staff, run the family and pay for my children’s studies,” he said. He wanted the district administration to find alternative ways like regulating the crowd with e-registration for darshan at the temple. “We can restrict the crowd to the optimum level to maintain social distancing. Thereby, devotees will be happy and livelihood of small traders like us will also be taken care of,” Mr. Kannan said. Collector S. Aneesh Sekhar has announced that besides Meenakshi temple, Sundararaja Perumal Temple and Pazhamuthir Solai Murugan Temple in Azhagarkoil and Subramaniyaswamy Temple in Tirupparankundram will also be closed till August 8.

02 August 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||HC directs Passport Officer to re-issue passport to child||Bringing relief to the father of a girl child, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the Regional Passport Officer here to consider the application and re-issue the passport to the child. The authorities had asked the father, residing in Madurai, to surrender the child’s passport and attend an inquiry on the grounds that it was not mentioned that the child was adopted. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh took note of the fact that a proper procedure was followed with regard to adoption of the child. The adoption was made from a recognised adoption agency and the competent court had also passed an order recognising the adoption, and the deed was executed before the Sub-Registrar. Based on the court order and after complying with conditions, an application was submitted to authorities and a birth certificate was issued. By virtue of the birth certificate, the parents would have to be treated almost like natural parents and it was not necessary for them to keep announcing to the world that they were adoptive parents, the judge said. The court also took note of the petitioner’s submission that there was no separate column in the application form to declare whether the child was a natural child or adopted. The judge said that in such a case it could not be said that the fact was suppressed in the earlier application. Under these circumstances, the court was told that some misunderstanding between the parents resulted in dissolution of the marriage. The father was the guardian and the child was in his custody. The court observed that no one had complained that the parents acted against the welfare of the child. The passport officer should not have taken the pain to inquire into the issue of the welfare of the child. It was enough if the officer scrutinised the available records. It was not necessary that for every development that would take place in the future, the parents had to knock at the doors of the court, the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-directs-passport-officer-to-re-issue-passport-to-child/article35673684.ece

02 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||HC suspends sentence imposed on Mexican national in murder case||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has suspended the sentence imposed on Mexican national Martin Manrique Mansoor by Madurai Mahila Court in 2020 for the murder of his ex-girlfriend and compatriot Cecile Denise Acosta. The court directed that he be enlarged on bail. The trial court had convicted and sentenced Mansoor to life for the murder. A Division Bench of Justices K. Kalyanasundaram and B. Pugalendhi allowed the application for suspension of sentence filed by Mansoor. He preferred a criminal appeal against the trial court’s order, and pending appeal he sought the suspension of the sentence imposed on him by the trial court. Mexican nationals Mansoor and Acosta had been partners since 2003. They had a daughter. At the time of the murder in 2012, Mansoor was pursuing a postdoctoral research in Mathematics at Kalasalingam University in Krishnankoil in Virudhunagar district. Acosta was learning Mohiniyattam at Kerala Kalamandalam in Thrissur, Kerala. The couple had quarrelled over custody of their daughter and it was said that following an argument, she was assaulted and grievously injured. Consequently, she died. In order to conceal the body, Mansoor wrapped it in a travel bag and burnt it with the bag in Austinpatti in Madurai district. Following a complaint by the Austinpatti Village Administrative Officer, a case was registered. Spare part of car The police found a spare part of a car at the place that was said to belong to the car used by Mansoor. The counsel representing Mansoor argued the prosecution had not established that the spare part was missing from the car recovered from Mansoor and it was also not established that the spare part recovered from the place belonged to Mansoor’s car. Taking note of the submissions made, the judges observed that a prosecution witness stated that such a spare part was available in all models of the car brand recovered from Mansoor. An expert said that tyre marks impression near the place of crime were analysed and it did not tally with the tyre marks of the car recovered from Mansoor. The court said that this raised certain doubts. Though the investigating agency collected call details, the same was not established before the trial court. Since the petitioner made certain arguable points in his favour, the court was inclined to suspend the substantive sentence of imprisonment imposed on him, the judges said. He was directed to appear before Madurai Mahila Court on the first working day of every month till further orders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-suspends-sentence-imposed-on-mexican-national-in-murder-case/article35673409.ece
02 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||RTO officials told to check meters, overloading in autos||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the Regional Transport Offices in Madurai to issue fitness certificates to taxis and autorickshaws after verifying the fare meters installed in them. A Division Bench of Justices T. S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi also directed the authorities to ensure that autorickshaws collected fares from the passengers by operating the meters and not demand exorbitant amounts. Further, the judges directed the Madurai RTO officials to conduct strict checking of share autos for overloading and violation of the permit conditions. Overloading is a serious problem and action must be taken by the authorities in this regard. Most of the share autos were operated as mini buses and the mini buses are operated as transport corporation buses stopping at all the bus stops, the court observed and directed the Joint Commissioner of Transport, Madurai region, to monitor and call for periodical records from the RTO officials. The court was hearing a public interest litigation petition filed by A. Jahir Hussain of Madurai. The petitioner said that the fare meters are fixed in rental taxis and auto rickshaws in compliance of the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicle Rules. If there was a need to repair or adjust the fare meters, it can only be done by a government-approved licensed technician. Care and caution must be taken while certifying the calibrated meters. But the authorities were issuing fitness certificates without insisting upon the calibration certificates The petitioner said that he had sent a representation to the authorities concerned, but no action was taken. The court observed that calibration of meters in taxis and autorickshaws was important as it was likely that the passengers could be cheated and asked to pay more. Therefore, the authorities must consider the representation and take action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rto-officials-told-to-check-meters-overloading-in-autos/article35673566.ece

High mast lights and streetlights have remained non-functional in several parts of the locality for a long time. The high mast lights erected at Manikoondu (clock tower), the market and Sholai Nagar, and streetlights at Pattinathar Thottam haven’t been functioning for several months, residents allege. “If several streetlights are non-functional, a few that do work are on throughout the day. Sometimes, the lights are on from Friday night till Sunday morning,” said Ashwin Clement, a resident of Muthialpet. “The presence of stray dogs adds to the problem of lack of lighting. Several residents have stepped on stray dogs lying on the road due to darkness.” said Elango, a resident of Vaithikuppam. R. Saravanan, a lawyer and resident of Muthialpet, said even the streetlights damaged during Cyclone Thane at Sholai Nagar were yet to be repaired. There was no clarity on whether the Public Works or the Electricity Department was responsible for maintenance of high masts, he added. “If you drive around the town during the night, you could spot defunct streetlights in several areas. But the problem is acute in Muthialpet. It's pitch dark even on the main road, with high mast lights not functioning near Manikoondu and the market. People fear entering the market after the evening,” M.P. Mathivanan, a CPI(M) functionary, said. The party recently organised a protest at Muthialpet and symbolically placed a wreath at the high mast light at Manikoondu. Mr. Mathivanan said the party took up the issue after people complained of illegal activities happening under the cover of darkness. “Many shady and illegal things happen because of the lack of proper lighting on the streets. The government should immediately take up the issue,” he said. According to a senior official in the Electricity Department, in the last three years, no purchases had been made to repair the streetlights. During a review meeting, the Minister gave an assurance that the purchase of equipment, including bulbs, would be expedited. “We are hopeful of repairing the lights in a few weeks,” the official said.

02 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||L-G highlights importance of breastfeeding||Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Sunday appealed to all mothers to breastfeed their newborns as the mother’s milk had several unique health-promoting and protective properties for the parent and the child. In a public message during the launch of World Breastfeeding Week, Ms. Soundararajan urged mothers to breastfeed the newborn within the first hour of delivery, adopt exclusive breastfeeding for a period of six months and include it in the child’s diet for about two years thence. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), while recommending early initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour of birth and exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months, have advised breastfeeding for up to two years of age or beyond, alongside the introduction of nutritionally adequate and safe complementary solid foods at six months. According to UNICEF, current research suggests that the risk of chronic disease is higher in those who were not breastfed when compared to those who were breastfed at infancy. Breast milk is said to contain an array of natural antibiotics which help protect the infants from infectious illnesses such as gastritis, diarrhoea and pneumonia. The purpose of the week-long celebrations was to raise awareness about the importance of breastfeeding and bust myths, the Lt. Governor said. In fact, the ongoing vaccination drive against COVID-19 is also focused on dispelling misconceptions about the safety of vaccines for pregnant women and lactating mothers. On the basis of the guidelines of WHO and the Union Health Ministry, pregnant women and lactating mothers are being administered the vaccine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/l-g-highlights-importance-of-breastfeeding/article35673651.ece

02 August 2021||RAMANATHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Collector plans steps to upgrade jasmine cultivation in Ramanathapuram district||There is good news for jasmine growers in the district. Collector J.U. Chandrakala has proposed to map the number of jasmine growers in the district and, subsequently, form farmers producers organisation/company. The Collector, accompanied by senior officials from Horticulture department, has visited Thangachimadam panchayat in Mandapam block to take stock of jasmine cultivation. And interacting with farmers has led to a clear understanding of infrastructure facilities needed there. Ideal conditions The total jasmine cultivation in Mandapam block is 78 hectares, and Thangachimadam panchayat alone accounts for 45 ha. According to the farmers, jasmine thrives well in well-drained loamy soil rich in organic matter. The ideal agro-climatic conditions are warm summer with ample water supply and sunny days with humid conditions. Jasmine can be grown in a wide range of soil — from clay to sandy soil with good drainage. For better production, the soil should be rich through addition of organic compost or any farm yard manure, they said. In Mandapam block, about 650 farmers from Nochiyurani, Sathakonvalasai and Thangachimadam panchayats cultivate jasmine mother plant seedling and nursery. It has been proposed to first carry out mapping of the number of farmers engaged in jasmine cultivation. Thangachimadam jasmine seeds and mother plants are so popular that buyers from Bengaluru, Kerala and Koyambedu in Chennai come to procure them, said Seeni Murugan, a farmer. Branding plays a major role and, through self-help-groups, marketing can be done on a better platform, the Collector contended. By avoiding middlemen, the farmers can reap in higher earnings. Also, funding is no problem as apart from NABARD, there is other banklink support that can encourage the farmers’ producers companies, she felt. ‘Value-addition’ According to Horticulture Deputy Director Nagarajan, apart from subsidies, the soil at Thangachimadam is best suited in the coastal district for jasmine cultivation. While the farmers have sought setting up of cold storage facilities ,the government has given its approval for value addition and other promotional activities for jasmine cultivation. In future, the Horticulture department will impart training to farmers on the latest techniques, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/collector-plans-steps-to-upgrade-jasmine-cultivation-in-ramanathapuram-district/article35673398.ece

The objective was to instil confidence among the people of the country that they could travel by following the standard operating procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a need to revive the tourism sector as it had been badly hit due to the pandemic, they said. As a student of tourism, Mr. Dheelepan said domestic tourism brought in much-required synergy and inspiration. Youth and others, who enjoyed travel, had plenty of tourist spots to see for themselves in India. Though there were language barriers at a few places in the northeast, the reception accorded by the people was so warm and cordial that it was easily overcome. The traditional food served in Agartala was delicious and it was the most memorable visit of the whole trip, they added. Recalling their experience in Kolkata, the two said that a senior citizen was overwhelmed upon seeing them. “When we told him that we were from Madras and Pondicherry in south India, he welcomed us with folded hands and said Vanakkam .” Adventure travel D. Venkatesan, Regional Director (South), India Tourism, Sponsors for the programme, said adventure travel was one of the key tools for tourism promotion.

Muralidharan on Sunday said eight vehicles had been exclusively earmarked for health teams to carry out COVID-19 vaccination of differently abled persons and residents in tribal habitations. The objective was to take the vaccine to the doorstep of the differently abled and those living in the remote corners and hillocks in the district. At a recent review meeting, it was pointed out to him that around 8,000 people above 18 years of age belonging to the category were residents of the district, but the percentage of vaccinated population remained low, the Collector said.

Now, close to 4,500 were covered now, he added. Speaking to The Hindu , he said the Differently Abled Welfare Department was keeping a track of the number of people covered and those with multiple complications and permanently disabled were identified for vaccination.

Nehru on Sunday said that the hospital was fully geared up to tackle challenges which may arise due to COVID-19 pandemic. As part of containing and distancing the virus, the State government had directed to conduct awareness-cum-interactive sessions with the public and other stakeholders. Issuing pamphlets about the need to wear face masks properly, need to wash hands regularly, maintain physical distance and to get the double vaccine doses on time were stressed. The Dean said that presently, there were 30 inpatients in the COVID-19 isolation ward in Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital. The number of bed strength had increased fairly well that there need not be any panic. "This is just a preparatory measure from the administration,'' he underlined.

Apart from the enhancement of bed strength, Oxygen facility and Oxygen generation were adequate in hand. The number of bed strength in the paediatric ward too had been increased, he said. The shortage of nurses and doctors in the isolation ward had been addressed, he replied. Collector K.

02 August 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Devotees protest near temple||Following the State government’s order, the district administration, police and HR and CE officials strictly barred the devotees from entering the shrines in the district till August 8. Unaware of the sudden development, the devotees, who had reached Tiruchendur for a darshan at the famous Subramaniya Swamy Temple were agitated. For well over 30 minutes on Sunday morning, the situation in front of the temple was chaotic. People, especially womenfolk with children squatted on the road. They pleaded with the police to at least permit them to have a gopura darshan as they had come all the way from Chennai and other cities. As Sunday was an important day in the Tamil month of Adi , the devotees said they were unaware of the G.O. not allowing devotees inside the major temples. “We had booked tickets on the trains about 10 days ago, as the government had opened the shrines. However, when we reached the temple, the barriers and heavy police worried us,” Deivanai, a woman devotee from Karaikudi, said. After persuasion, they dispersed. Tirunelveli Adi Pooram festival commenced with a holy flag hoisting at the Sri Nellaiappar Temple here on Sunday without the presence of the devotees. The festival, which is usually celebrated in a big way, turned out to be a low-key affair. The temple priests performed the special aarathi for Swami, Ambal and other deities. On August 4, the ‘valaikaapu’ ceremony would be performed at 12 noon for Sri Gandhimathi Ambal and on August 10, the Adi Pooram ‘mulaikattu’ ceremony would be conducted at the Unjal mandapam, the HR and CE officials said. As a precautionary measure, the Tamirabarani riverbed, where the devotees would perform ‘tharpanam’ on account of Adi Amavasai on August 9, too had been banned in a bid to prevent the pandemic from getting spread.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/protest-staged-near-tiruchendur-temple/article35673434.ece
02 August 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Pack up, Collector tells Sterlite||Thoothukudi MP Kanimozhi on Saturday said there was no need for Sterlite Copper’s oxygen plant to continue its operations anymore as the COVID-19 situation in the State had improved due to steps taken by the government. During an informal chat with reporters here, after inaugurating two city buses, she said the plant was allowed to operate by the Supreme Court to meet the huge demand for oxygen for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Thanks to the steps taken by the government, many oxygen plants had been installed in several places across the State now. Moreover, steps had been taken to bring medical-grade oxygen from other States, too, if the situation demanded. As the pandemic situation across the State had improved a lot and influx of fresh cases to hospitals had come down considerably, there was no need for medical oxygen generated by Sterlite Copper’s oxygen plant. “Since this oxygen plant has to be shutdown gradually, power supply to the plant’s cooling section has to be ensured for some more time. Sterlite Copper will not be opened again, as promised by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin,” Ms. Kanimozhi said. Meanwhile, Collector K. Senthil Raj sent a letter to Sterlite Copper on Saturday to wind-up operation of its oxygen plant as the deadline had ended. The Collector said the plant was allowed to operate on standalone basis till July 31 to meet the medical oxygen requirements during the pandemic. Since the period of operation, as allowed by the Supreme Court, had come to an end, operation of the oxygen plant should be stopped with effect from July 31, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pack-up-collector-tells-sterlite/article35673411.ece
02 August 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Tapioca farmers hit by rising cultivation cost and poor yield||The tapioca crop has reached harvest stage on Pachamalai hills. But, it is another matter that the yield is low this year as the rainfall received on the hills was irregular, farmers say. On an average, around 400 bags of tapioca are harvested per acre, each bag weighing between 75 and 77 kg. For each bag, the farmer gets Rs. 150. However, the expenses have been rising. The cost of purchasing and spraying fertilizers is around Rs. 10,000 per acre. Further, the crop has to be pruned at least three times, and the labour charges are at least Rs. 10,000 per acre for harvesting, said Banumathi Krishnamoorthy, village panchayat president, Top Sengattupatti. The yield is sold to sago production units in Salem. The sago units fix the price according to their demand and based on starch content. Often farmers are given a lower price on the ground that starch content was low in their produce. However, the farmers said they do not get a satisfactory price from the industries. They complain that middlemen make away with most earnings through tapioca cultivation. “These brokers will search the field for a weak-looking plant, pull out the tapioca and say that it is of low quality and quote a low price,” a farmer said. The broker coordinates with the factory owner and makes at least Rs. 10 per bag of tapioca, he added. However, since the setting up of a weighing bridge on the hill itself, the farmers are able to demand better prices from the brokers. “We are careful now and argue over the quality and quantity of our produce,” he said. Yet, this year, the yield is unsatisfactory, R. Krishnamoorthy said. “While we did receive some good rains this year, it did not rain when the crop was about to mature. This led to a dip in yield,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tapioca-farmers-hit-by-rising-cultivation-cost-and-poor-yield/article35673375.ece

The cases had been rising in a few other districts as well. “Hence, to check the infection and to bring it under control, it has been decided to do away with celebration of Adi Perukku on the banks of the Cauvery”, he said. Similarly, major temples including Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple and Sri Mariamman Temple in Samayapuram will be shut for public darshan on Monday and Tuesday. Mr. Sivarasu said people should keep in mind that COVID-19 was yet to be controlled fully. “If they failed to follow safety precautions, it will be very difficult to keep a check on the virus,” he said. Out of 21.5 lakh targeted people above 18 years of age, 8.8 lakh people have been vaccinated so far. Out of them, 7.25 lakh people had received the first dose. The Collector said that the district administration would not hesitate to take action against those traders and merchants who fail to follow COVID-19 restrictions. “If people continued to converge in large numbers, closing of crowded business streets was unavoidable”, Mr. Sivarasu added. In Karur, Collector T. Prabhu Shankar said that no one would be allowed to perform puja along the banks of the Cauvery in Kulithalai and other river courses due to the rising cases of COVID-19.

Many scholars from the city had contributed to Tamil, he added. K. Shyam Sundar, Executive Committee member, Tiruchi Intra City Development Endeavour, said that Tiruchi had good air, road and rail connectivity.

Balakrishnan resulted in seizure of contrabands worth over Rs. 32 lakh and arrest of over 280 persons till now. The number of cases booked in this connection so far was more than 170, say police sources. As part of the drive, field-level police officers were instructed to cull out ‘active’ persons from the list of ganja offenders. The drive was launched as the coastal areas in the central zone remained an active conduit route for smuggling of ganja and other narcotic substances through the sea route to neighbouring countries, say police sources. It was also felt that smuggling of ganja and its consumption not only led to addiction but also provided a congenial atmosphere for anti-social activities to thrive. And hence the launch of the Drive Against Drug campaign. Nagapattinam district topped in the central zone in respect of seizure of the contraband while carrying out the drives. A little over 270 kilograms of the contraband was confiscated with the number of those arrested exceeding 30 persons. Thanjavur - another coastal district in the zone saw the seizure of over 83 kilograms of ganja with the police arresting 97 persons and booking 51 cases. Karur district figured third in the list with the quantity of the contraband seized being a little over 45 kilograms leading to the arrest of 41 persons. Seizures of the contraband were also made in Tiruchi, Pudukottai, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Tiruvarur and Mayiladuthurai districts. Police sources say sources of supply were identified based on interrogation of those held for smuggling of ganja leading to the arrest of some of them. A few drug offenders were detained under the Goondas Act as a deterrent measure. The objective of the drive was also to find out the source of supply with some of them found to be from Madurai and Dindigul, said IG Balakrishnan adding that the drive was being done based on local information and intelligence inputs and by forming teams to apprehend the accused. The contraband was mostly found to be smuggled from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh through Chennai, he said. The coastal vigilance committees have been asked to provide information regarding smuggling of the contraband in their respective villages, he said and added that the drive would continue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-350-kg-of-ganja-seized/article35673313.ece
02 August 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||These transwomen cook a feast on a cart||A group of transgender women have set up a food cart on Pudukottai Road after years of struggling to find employment. The cart, which was inaugurated on Wednesday has received a positive response so far, they said. Riyana, who leads the group is a field-level officer with a group associated with Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS). Through her work, she met the others- Sayyesha, Parveen, Maya, Namitha and Harini. All five transgender women are educated, some even hold masters degrees in Science and Commerce. However, not one of them have been able to secure jobs so far, Riyana said. “They have cleared job interviews, and even gone as far as meeting the officials at some workplaces, but have not been employed so far. Workplaces cite our safety, and say that other employees might misbehave with us, and do not give us the job,” she said. The group had been cooking and serving the destitute in and around Subramaniapuram and its surrounding areas when a group of bankers in the city noticed their work and asked if they would like to set up a food stall. The group donated Rs. 30,000, and the women were able to collect Rs. 20,000 from their savings to set up ‘Tasty Foods’. Riyana said that they purchased a push cart, new vessels, groceries and a stove with the funds. They also spent some of the money to level the ground where they have set up the stall. “Maya's mother makes and sells dosa batter. We have decided to purchase the batter from her on a daily basis and sell varieties of dosas,” she said. ‘Podi dosa,’ ‘chicken dosa,’ ‘vegetable dosa’ and other varieties are on the menu. Idlies and soup are also made to be sold from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The response has been overwhelming, she said. “Since we have just opened, we give all our customers a sweet along with their orders. On the first day, many gave us twice the amount of money and said that it was their moi (gift). A group of young men living nearby also bought us four buckets to store our ingredients,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/these-transwomen-cook-a-feast-on-a-cart/article35673389.ece

02 August 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Leopard moves out of Angiyam||A leopard which had attacked two persons on Saturday at Angiyam near Uppiliapuram on the Tiruchi - Namakkal border was not sighted thereafter and is believed to have gone into the Kolli hills reserve forest area situated a few kilometres away. A video grab of the animal moving in the night hours was captured in one of the camera traps that were placed at different places around a hillock at Angiyam following the incident on Saturday. The pug marks of the animal were found in the path leading towards the Kolli hills reserve forest area, said the Chief Conservator of Forests - in charge, Tiruchi, S. Ramasubramanian. The animal was not sighted after Saturday’s incident, he further said. Forest Department officials believe that the animal could have entered into Angiyam in search of a prey when the incident occurred after one of the villagers tried to take a selfie with the leopard in the background near a cave at Koneripatti hillock. The officials also believe that the animal was waiting for night to set in before moving out from Angiyam. District Forest Officer, Tiruchi, D. Sujatha said the department officials walked about five to six kilometres on Sunday morning and found pug marks of the adult animal in the direction leading towards the Kolli Hills reserve forest area on Sunday. This led them to strongly believe that the animal had moved out of Angiyam and gone into the Kolli hills reserve forest. Following the attack on two persons, the Forest Department officials placed four camera traps to capture video grabs of the animal's movement and advised the people of Angiyam and nearby villages not to go anywhere near the small hillock where the leopard was spotted, and to desist from venturing out in the night. The locals have been asked to immediately convey information to the field-level forest department officials in case they were to spot the animal||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/leopard-that-attacked-two-moves-out-of-angiyam/article35673376.ece

Speaking to reporters, he said some outfits which were keen on bringing the Narendra Modi government into disrepute were engaging in false propaganda. BJP State president Annamalai and many other leaders had spoken about it in the past. The people of Tamil Nadu, especially the farmers, can be rest assured that the Central government won’t take any action which may affect the interests of the people here, he said. Attacking the DMK government for remaining silent on the NEET issue, Mr. Radhakrishnan said it was not fair to play politics with students’ future. The government should provide training for the aspirants and ensure that students from the most backward community and the downtrodden benefit from the NEET. The State government should prepare the students properly, he said. The former Minister said that before the BJP came to power at the Centre in 2014, there were 189 government medical colleges and 215 private medical colleges in the country. “Currently, there are 289 government medical colleges and 269 private medical colleges in the country. The percentage of students taking medical courses stands at 54. Hence, the people should not get carried away by rumours or social media posts,” he said.

Two persons, Soman and Sunil Goyal from Halacarai had suggested to the waste management centre that a high-speed sifter and a slow-moving conveyor could be used to separate the micro-plastics instead of a sorting trough. They had also donated their sifter and lent their technical support during installation and operation of the equipment. P.J. Vasanthan, trustee of “Clean Coonoor,” which runs the waste management park with the help of the local municipality, stated that “one of the main challenges” in dry waste management is the escape of tiny bits of plastics such as sachet snips into the environment as the size of the plastics make them difficult to sort. Clean Coonoor estimated that around 10-20 kg of such micro-plastics inadvertently find their way into the surrounding environment for every tonne of waste sorted at the facility. “Larger articles are dealt with and sorted in the sifter which separates dirt and organic material from the waste stream as well. The smaller articles which tend to be missed are picked up on the conveyor. The system not only helps in identifying and picking up small plastics but also helps in detecting and disposing other small sized hazardous waste such as small-sized wires and circuitry, button cells and other small items,” said a press release from Clean Coonoor. The press release added that the NGO hoped that the new equipment would prevent leeching of harmful chemicals found in e-waste and also micro-plastics slipping through the sorting process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/local-solutions-to-manage-micro-plastics-at-waste-management-facility/article35673309.ece

Officials said that the crocodile was spotted by the people and informed the department. They added that they believed that the crocodile had travelled upstream due to the heavy rainfall in the region last week. Kalai Vendan, Forest Range Officer, Pandalur Range, said that the crocodile was spotted on July 28, and was monitored for a few days. Residents cautioned “Since then, it has not been spotted by any of the field staff,” he said, adding that local residents had been informed of the sighting, and had been asked not to venture near the river. “There are multiple hamlets along the river course, and all residents have been informed of the potential presence of the crocodile,” said Mr. Vendan. Officials reiterated that marsh crocodiles are not known to attack humans, but urged caution. They have also blocked off access to the river from the Athikunna government school, and other places used by the residents. “We have not sighted the crocodile in over three days, and suspect it could have made its way back to the Ponnani River from where we believe it could have made its way up the Athikunna River during the rains,” said officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/forest-dept-monitoring-river-where-crocodile-was-sighted/article35673273.ece

Located behind the the Vallalar High School, off the Chennai-Bengaluru Highway (NH 48), the pond has turned into a dump with residents finding it convenient to throw garbage in it. Vellore Collector P. Kumaravel Pandian conducted a surprise inspection of the pond recently. “With northeast monsoon just a few months away, rejuvenation of such ponds will save excess rainwater and help recharge groundwater in the water-starved town,” said Mr. Pandian. Spread over 10,000 sq.ft, the pond is 15 feet deep with a thin bund. As per plan, the civic body will desilt and deepen the waterbody to hold more rainwater. Storm-water drains in the neighbourhood will be connected to the pond to maintain the water table in the locality. The bund will be raised at least 1.5 feet above the existing level and will be strengthened. Staircases and tiled walkers’ paths around the pond will be constructed. With the school located in front of it, the pond will be fenced to prevent trespassing. The entire work, which will start next week, will be funded from the general funds of the Corporation. To ensure more green cover, more than 100 palm saplings were planted around the pond by the officials led by the Collector. The saplings will be maintained by the local body for an year before putting them under the care of residents in the neighbourhood. “Stormwater drains that connect such waterbodies will be cleaned to ensure free flow of rainwater into the ponds and lakes nearby,” said N. Sankaran, Commissioner, Vellore Corporation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vellores-sathuvachari-pond-all-set-for-a-major-makeover/article35673649.ece

02 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Junction improvement project likely to resume after monsoon||Early last year, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) announced its decision to give a makeover to as many as 35 busy junctions across the city. More than a year later, just four junctions have been improved. The junction improvement works are now likely to be taken up, in a phased manner, only after the monsoon. Civic officials said it was very difficult to take up any development work during the monsoon, as heavy rain would have a direct bearing on the deadlines. Each junction slated for a makeover will have a theme. For instance, the civic body has developed K.R. Circle, adjacent to the University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering, with engineering as the theme. Minor works, such as landscaping and installation of water fountains, are pending. The defunct fountains at the N.R. Square junction, opposite the BBMP head office, has been repaired. “We have finalised the themes for a few other junctions. For instance, Anil Kumble Circle on M.G. Road will be developed around the theme of cricket and Basaveshwara Circle, adjacent to Chalukya hotel, will be developed around the theme of the Chalukya empire. We have proposed a welcome insignia at Mehkri Circle as many tourists will be entering the city on that route from the Kempegowda International Airport,” an official said and added that during the course of improvements, the BBMP would first take up geometric corrections for free vehicular movement, followed by lighting, kerb design, and beautification of traffic islands. The first junction to be improved was Windsor Square, where the ‘Make in India’ lion statue has been installed. The lion statue, weighing 1,140 kg and made of fibre reinforced plastic, was unveiled in February this year. B.S. Yediyurappa, when he was Chief Minister, unveiled the Mysuru Dasara Dibba themed installation at the Nayandahalli junction. Since its installation, it has become a “selfie point”, said civic officials. The 35 junctions will be improved at a cost of Rs. 100 crore. Officials said that around Rs. 20 crore had now been earmarked for these junction improvements under the 15th Finance Commission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/junction-improvement-project-likely-to-resume-after-monsoon/article35673178.ece
02 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Third wave: Doctors want govt. to stock up MIS-C medicine||As the demand for Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) needed for treating post COVID-19 Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) has been high during the pandemic, experts now suggest that it would be advisable for the government to stock up for the third wave. IVIG is a therapy treatment for patients with antibody deficiencies. It is prepared from a pool of immunoglobulins (antibodies) from the plasma of thousands of healthy donors and helps the patient fight infections. While it was in use even during the pre-COVID-19 days, the demand has gone up during the pandemic, especially in the second wave when doctors saw many children with MIS-C. Epidemiologist and public health specialist Sunil Kumar D.R., who heads the Department of Community Medicine at Akash Institute of Medical Sciences, said IVIG treatment proved extremely crucial during the second wave when a lot of children developed MIS-C. “Children develop MIS-C two to six weeks post COVID-19. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and rashes,” he said. “As children with MIS-C are extremely sick, any shortage can prove to be fatal and hence, while the second wave is subsiding it is advisable that the government stock IVIG for the third wave,” said Dr. Kumar, who is also part of the BBMP’s death audit committee. Drop in donations Sagar Bhattad, Consultant, Paediatric Immunology and Rheumatology at Aster CMI Hospital, said as immunoglobulin is a biological product derived from the plasma of healthy donors it is a challenge to produce it in a short span of time. “Plasma donations have come down during the pandemic and due to this production has also gone down. However, the demand is high. The government should collaborate with manufacturers now and also explore importing stocks. While rational use should be promoted, steps should be taken to prevent hoarding,” he said. “Although steroids are another option, we prefer a combination of steroids and IVIG if the disease severity is high. Trials are underway in the West, to compare IVIG versus steroids,” he said. Judicous use Chandrika S Bhat, Consultant, Paediatric Rheumatology Services, Rainbow Children’s Hospital said as the production of immunoglobulins is a long process, it would be advisable for doctors to use IVIG judiciously. Supraja Chandrashekhar, Consultant Paediatrician and Paediatric Intensivist at Columbia Asia Hospitals ( a unit of Manipal Hospitals), Yeshwanthpur, said the demand for IVIG has shot up in the last one year. “We have seen and treated over 35 cases at our hospital,” she said. “IVIG is expensive and a 10 gram vial costs over Rs. 15,000. The dosage depends on the weight of the child (2 gms per kg is the recommended dose). As a lot of adolescents weighing over 50 kgs also develop MIS-C, capping dose of 100 gms is recommended,” she added. Tenders floated State Health Commissioner K.V. Trilok Chandra said the government has started the process to procure 10,000 doses of IVIG at a cost of over Rs. 10 crore. “We have already floated tenders and are hoping the procurement process will be completed by next month. The stocks will be supplied in batches and will be used in all government hospitals where MIS-C cases are reported,” the Commissioner told The Hindu on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/third-wave-doctors-want-govt-to-stock-up-mis-c-medicine/article35673191.ece
02 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Cabinet expansion: Many seniors anxious about not getting berth||As the new Chief Minister flew to New Delhi to finalise the Cabinet expansion exercise, expected to happen on Wednesday or Thursday, lobbying for a ministerial berth only intensified. With reports of the party high command wanting to give opportunities to youngsters and reduce the average age of the Cabinet, several senior leaders of the party are anxious about their political future. “If a leader is kept out of the Cabinet on the basis of seniority and age now, the fear that he may be denied ticket to contest in the upcoming Assembly polls is very real. So the fight to make it to the Cabinet has assumed an existential tone for many seniors in order to stave off retirement,” a senior party leader said. Former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar may have already bowed out of the race, but other seniors said to be on the list of those likely to be dropped continue to jockey hard for a berth. Prominent among them is K.S. Eshwarappa, who had earlier said it was evident that the party was giving opportunities to youngsters in both its organisation and the government and had also said that he would abide by the party’s decision if they asked him to go. Now, however, he has done a U-turn and has openly expressed his wish to be anointed Deputy Chief Minister or given a plum portfolio, preferably Rural Development and Panchayat Raj. He recently met senior RSS leader Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat. Several seers from Kuruba community have alsodemanded that he be made a Deputy Chief Minister.  It may be recalled that in a viral audio clip, said to be of BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel (which he has denied), it was claimed that “Jagadish Shettar’s and Eshwarappa’s teams” would be kept out of the Cabinet. Another audio clip, purportedly of a conversation between senior leaders R. Ashok and V. Somanna, which has gone viral on social media, has the two men quarrelling and accusing each other of conspiring against one another and carrying tales to the high command in an attempt to scuttle their ministerial chances. Mr. Somanna has told presspersons that the conversation dated back over 25 days. “The audio clip only betrays the anxiety among the senior Ministers,” said a former Minister. Other seniors who may not make it to the Cabinet include S. Suresh Kumar and Kota Srinivas Poojary, party sources said. Meanwhile, Assembly Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri, who was one of the probables considered for the Chief Minister’s post as well, is tipped to vacate the Speaker’s chair and be sworn in as a Minister. If that happens, one of the seniors who fail to make it to the Cabinet, preferably from the RSS stables, will likely be anointed as Speaker, sources said.

02 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Gowda hints at support to govt. if things go amiss||In what set a buzz in the political circles on Sunday evening, former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) patriarch H.D. Deve Gowda dropped broad hints that the regional outfit could come to the rescue of the ruling BJP “if there is trouble”. “It is a feeling that if there are troubled times for this government, we should cooperate,” he told reporters after meeting Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai here. “The (JD-S) party is not interested in going to elections and we have not thought about it as well. The (BJP) high command has blessed Mr. Bommai and everyone has blessed (him). Probably I feel that there will be no trouble. I do not know.” The former Prime Minister said: “Mr. Bommai has the blessings of (former Chief Minister) B.S. Yediyurappa. However, I do not know if it (administration) can be managed by keeping Mr. Yediyurappa out,” he said. Explaining his stance, he said: “We (JD-S) have no desire to go to elections before 2023. The zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat elections will be completed in 2022. After that there will be about eight to nine months for the (Assembly) polls.” While Mr. Gowda’s son and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had several times in the past reiterated the stand that the JD(S) would not destabilise the government and would extend issue-based support to the BJP government, it is for the first time that the party supremo has spelt out his stance. In fact, Mr. Kumaraswamy’s public support soon after the collapse of his 14-month-old JD(S)-Congress coalition, triggered by the BJP, had been seen in political circles as cozying up of the regional party with the saffron party. Earlier, Mr. Bommai met Mr. Gowda to seek his blessings. He was accompanied by former Minister V. Somanna, both of whom had migrated to BJP from the Janata Parivar. Former Minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Revanna was also present at the meeting. Later, speaking to presspersons Mr. Bommai said that Mr. Gowda was a tall leader and had been his father S.R. Bommai’s contemporary and associate. “He has blessed me and suggested that I should do good work for the State to resolve long pending issues,” he said. “We did not discuss anything in particular. I will meet him again to seek his advice in the coming days. When it comes to the State’s water and land issues, all of us are together,” he added.  JD(S) has no desire to go to elections before 2023. The zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat elections will be completed in 2022. After that there will be about eight to nine months for the (Assembly) polls. H.D.

02 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State to release Rs. 660 cr. for flood relief||The State government on Sunday announced the release of Rs. 660 crore to take up immediate relief work in the 13 flood-affected districts across Karnataka even as it has sought a central team to assess the damage. The announcement, by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, came after he chaired a high-level meeting of officials during which the decision was taken. “While Rs. 510 crore will be released immediately by the State government, we have also decided to utilise Rs. 150 crore from NDRF funds,” he said. The State has also written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah to send a team to survey the crop damage and full extent of losses owing to floods. “I will also discuss flood relief with the Centre during my visit to Delhi,” he said. He added that though the rain had stopped in most places, floodwater had to still recede from inundated houses and fields in Belagavi, Uttara Kannada, and Udupi districts. “In all, 466 villages have been affected by the floods, in which 13 persons have died and one person remains missing.” The Chief Minister said the priority was to restore road and bridge connectivity in the flood-affected region. “The work on restoration of roads and bridges will be taken up after the rains recede. The Deputy Commissioners have Rs. 700 crore in the accounts that will be used to spend on flood relief,” he added. Compensation Saying that officials have been asked to complete the survey of damaged homes and agricultural fields, he said the government has decided to stick to the enhanced compensation for damage to houses that was earlier announced during the regime of his predecessor B.S. Yediyurappa. “Accordingly, we will provide Rs. 5 lakh compensation to completely damaged houses, Rs. 3 lakh towards partially damaged houses, and Rs. 50,000 for houses that have had minor damages. We have released Rs. 10,000 as immediate relief to the families whose houses have been damaged,” the Chief Minister said. Mr. Bommai also said that instructions have been given to release money if there is any progress on the construction of houses damaged in the previous floods. Responding to allegations by Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah that dues from the Centre towards flood relief for 2019 had not come to the State yet, Mr. Bommai said the Union government had already released Rs. 625 crore. “I can also say what happened during his tenure. Being a former Chief Minister, he should not speak like that,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-to-release-rs-660-cr-for-flood-relief/article35673205.ece
02 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Buffalo meat to be back at BBP||The menu for carnivores at the Bannerghatta Biological Park (BBP) is soon set to reintroduce beef (buffalo meat). The pandemic, followed by the new ordinance on cattle slaughter had kept buffalo meat off the menu. But the park authorities are now finalising tenders for supply of the meat and hope to start feeding the carnivores beef in a week’s time. Vanashree Vipin Singh, executive director, BBP, told The Hindu that carnivores were given beef since inception in all zoos to mimic natural feeding habits because in nature, they feed on gaur, sambal and the like. “But due to COVID-19, there was a break in supply of beef and live animals. We resumed feeding beef in November, December, and January. It was re-tendered because the prices were higher. After the ordinance, other issues cropped up. So, we went back to feeding them chicken,” she explained. This January, the State government promulgated the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Ordinance, 2020 to ban slaughter of cows, bulls, and bullocks of all ages, and male or female buffaloes aged below 13. The new law makes provisions for stricter implementation of rules regarding transportation of cattle, seizure of vehicles, imposition of penalty, and operation of slaughterhouses. According to BBP authorities, the park needs 500-600 kg of meat a day. “We re-called tenders for meat of buffaloes above 13 years. The tender is getting finalised. Meat will be available in a week’s time,” Ms. Singh added. Though the authorities did not notice any marked difference after chicken became the staple, they want to ensure animals’ nutritional needs are not compromised. “We plan to give them a mix: beef for four days and chicken for two,” she explained. Steady stream of visitors Zoos in the State were hit severely due to the pandemic, lockdowns, and revenues drying up, but saw donations in the form of animal adoptions etc. Now, the park has started seeing a steady stream of visitors. “The response to reopening has been wonderful. We have had very well-behaved visitors. The maximum number of visitors recently was 7,000 last Sunday,” Ms. Singh added. Before COVID-19, the park saw around 17,000 visitors during holiday seasons such as Deepavali, New Year, Christmas, and Dasara, with the numbers even going up to 23,000 one time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/buffalo-meat-to-be-back-at-bbp/article35673451.ece
02 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP sets new deadline for Shivananda Circle flyover||Motorists, using alternative routes to bypass ongoing work at the busy Shivananda Circle in the Central Business District have reason to cheer. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is confident of completing work on the 493-metre-long overpass by the end of August. Several deadlines have passed and the BBMP has not been able to complete work on the overpass that comprises just 16 pillars. Senior civic officials attributed the delay to the 700-mm water pipeline that was “discovered” during the evacuation. “The pillar work could not be completed since the pipeline had to be shifted. Even the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Supply (BWSSB) officials did not know of the pipeline. It was only after the pipeline was shifted that we could progress,” the official said. This is not the first instance of lack of coordination between the two civic agencies. Several years ago, during the construction of the magic box flyover in front of Bangalore Development Authority, the civic agencies chanced upon a major water pipeline. Its shifting affected the completion of that project. BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta, who has in the past served as BWSSB chairman, said with many old pipelines still being used in the core city areas, the water board may not have the maps of these pipelines. Utility shifting, thus, becomes a huge challenge during the execution of civil projects. BBMP officials also added that during the preparation of the Detailed Project Report of any project, the civic body writes to all civic agencies, including BWSSB and Bengaluru Electricity Supply Company, seeking information about their respective utilities at the project site to prepare the estimate of the cost to shift them. “The same process was followed for this project. The BWSSB did not inform us about this pipeline,” they claimed. BWSSB officials, on the other hand, claimed otherwise. They blamed their counterparts in the civic body for not informing them or coordinating with them during execution of such projects. “We have detailed GIS-based maps of the water and underground drainage pipelines in the city,” they maintained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-sets-new-deadline-for-shivananda-circle-flyover/article35673179.ece
02 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Pvt. schools switch to flipped learning for online classes||Many private schools in the city, especially those affiliated with Central boards, have adopted the ‘flipped learning’ methodology while conducting online classes. In this model, students are given reading material and lesson plans ahead of the actual class unlike the traditional format where they are introduced to a topic in the classroom and then revise it at home. The flipped learning model aims at having higher student engagement in classrooms and moves away from the traditional chalk-and-blackboard method. Students are asked to read or watch videos relevant to their lessons and teachers facilitate a discussion, help children brainstorm, and clarify their doubts in the virtual classrooms. According to Dakshayini Khanna, principal of Harvest International School, schools are better prepared for online classes this year compared to the previous academic year. “Students are expected to complete the preliminary homework before they attend classes. Teachers are now primarily involved in summarising the lessons and clear students’ doubts during the online classes,” she said. Gauging the demand for this learning method, several private companies are visiting schools and want to offer curriculum and content to school managements. Sumanth Narayan, founder of Shanthinikethana School, said they follow a similar learning method. “We use an app that has preloaded content where students can read stories, solve puzzles, take part in quizzes that are related to their educational content. We do this so that students familiarise themselves with the lessons before the class starts. This is our attempt to gamify learning and reduce online fatigue caused by virtual classes,” he said. B.R. Supreeth, secretary, Oxford Institutions, Nagarbhavi, said they preferred this method for primary class students. “Besides facilitating involvement of students, the flipped model helps them become mentally ready for the class. Students are often distracted with gadgets and asking them to watch videos or read something pertaining to their lessons helps them get into the mood for these classes,” he said. However, many parents are not very happy with this learning method as it places the onus on students and parents to learn. Some are of the opinion that schools are transferring the burden of ensuring good learning outcomes onto parents and students. “My daughter and her classmates are asked to make presentations on all her lessons and it is discussed in class. She constantly needs my supervision and it becomes difficult to manage my work schedule,” said Shruthi S., a software professional whose daughter is in class four in a school affiliated to the CBSE board.  We use an app that has preloaded content where students can read stories, solve puzzles, and take part in quizzes.

02 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘No COVID-19 positive patient can refuse physical triage’||In the wake of rising COVID-19 cases in the city, the civic body has made physical triage mandatory for anyone who tests positive with no exceptions. If any individual violates the same, action will be initiated under Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Ordinance, 2020, and Disaster Management Act, 2005. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has moved towards 100% physical triage of COVID-19 positive patients. However, there have been instances of a few COVID-19 patients denying physical triage service. In a circular issued on Sunday, BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta stated that early physical triage of all COVID-19 positive cases is mandatory and no one can be exempted from it. The BBMP, to facilitate early triage, has set up physical triage centres at the Assembly constituency level and mobile triage units at the ward level/primary health centre level. The circular added that the decision was taken based on the expert committee’s view that early physical triage would help in reducing morbidity and mortality. Towards timely and effective containment and surveillance, the BBMP has also directed private laboratories and hospitals testing for COVID-19 to update the results on the ICMR portal immediately, apart from informing the civic authorities concerned. The civic body would initiate action against any violation of the order. Meanwhile, travellers from neighbouring States have to possess a negative report not older than 72 hours. The civic body has deputed teams in the various bus stations and railway stations to screen travellers coming from Maharashtra and Kerala and to check test reports and conduct tests wherever necessary. Containment zones On July 25, there were 75 micro-containment zones in the city, while on July 31, the number had increased to 135. While the number of positive COVID-19 cases being reported every day is between 400- 500, the number of containment zones has increased, with the BBMP laying more stress on containment and isolation efforts in a bid to check the spread of the virus. Mr. Gupta told The Hindu that the civic body was testing around 60,000 people every day. This, he claimed, was nearly double the testing in other major cities in the country. “While we are testing sufficiently, it is important to ensure that testing is done early. Early detection, triaging and contact tracing will help keep the virus in check,” he said. He also said the health officials had been directed to trace as many primary and secondary contacts. To speculation that the civic body may recommend imposing weekend curfew in the city, Mr. Gupta responded in the negative. He reiterated that the current situation did not warrant it. “At this stage, we are managing the situation by increasing our efforts in containment and isolation,” he stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-covid-19-positive-patient-can-refuse-physical-triage/article35673196.ece
02 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||RUPSA for restarting physical classes||Private school managements have demanded that the State government restart physical classes in schools at the earliest. The Registered Unaided Private Schools Management Association (RUPSA) said in a statement that the government has been inordinately delaying taking a decision on the same. “We recently met Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and appraised him about the issue of restarting physical classes, to which he was very open and promised classes would be restarted soon. We have decided to wait for another week,” the statement said. RUPSA urged the government to restart physical classes through Vidyagama or on shift basis. “If we had started physical classes by June, we would have got 50 teaching days and another 30 days before the advent of the third wave,” the statement said. Mr. Bommai said: “We will evaluate the situation in Karnataka as well as other States. Vaccination will be a criteria before the decision is taken,” he said, when his attention was drawn to the threat of private schools to reopen from next week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rupsa-for-restarting-physical-classes/article35673180.ece

The weapons and drugs were discovered during simultaneous raids conducted by the police on the residences of over 200 rowdies and habitual offenders that began on Saturday. This is part of the city police’s crackdown on gangs in the wake of several brazen daylight murders. While FIRs were registered against seven rowdies under NDPS and Arms Act, the medical reports of around 33 others are awaited. According to senior police officials, many habitual offenders were under the influence of drugs at the time of the raids. “Action will be taken based on the medical reports,” said Sanjeev Patil, Deputy Commissioner of Police (West). The police suspect that the accused booked under the NDPS Act are linked to various drug rackets and investigations are on to ascertain their involvement. “Many were not present in the house during the surprise checks and efforts are on to track them down. The remaining rowdies have been questioned about their present activities. We have also got an undertaking from them that they will not be involved in anti-social activities,” said a senior police official. In July, the Central Crime Branch police had conducted simultaneous raids and search operations in various parts of the city.

The 52-year-old artist has done at least 500 paintings on structures belonging to the Forest Department to spread awareness about wildlife. “I used to collect firewood when I was young and earn a few rupees a day. After returning home, I would paint what I saw in the forest. With the encouragement of my friends, I pursued my passion for painting.” Mr. Nagaraj gave up studies after SSLC and has never been trained in the arts. “Whatever I learnt was from my own experiments on the canvas,” he said. One day, he was busy drawing on a wall near his house when Ramachandra Nayak, a doctor and art lover, noticed his work and invited him to his nursing home. He commissioned a painting of Nayakanahatti Thippeswamy, a deity, by offering Rs. 100. “I was thrilled by his gesture. The amount he gave me is worth around Rs. 10,000 today,” he recalled. Gradually, he gave up the job of collecting firewood and decided to concentrate on writing banners, signboards, and helping students of B.Ed. courses prepare teaching aids. Later, he picked up photography as a hobby. Initially, he borrowed a camera paying a rent of Rs. 10 a day. Now, he is popular on social media for his wildlife photography and vivid presentations of Chitradurga’s historic fort and other tourist spots. A senior officer of the department, Srinivasulu, now member-secretary of the KSPCB, was among the first to notice his talent. “The officer appreciated my paintings while he was in Chitradurga and commissioned painting works in Dandeli. From there, many officers have invited me to paint,” he said. Later, he also created wildlife paintings at Anekal in Bengaluru Urban district. That caught the attention of many senior officers, who gave him assignments in other places. Gururaj B. Sankeshwar, Range Forest Officer of Anekal Wildlife Range, told The Hindu that Mr. Nagaraj had a rare talent and his paintings are lively. “His paintings have been helpful in spreading awareness about wildlife among the public,” he said. Mr. Nagaraj has been involved in wildlife conservation in Chitradurga. “I have built more than 20 small check dams in forests. They have helped wildlife. I have also planted hundreds of trees. It is, in a way, paying back to nature, as I cut many trees for firewood decades ago,” he said.  I have built over 20 small check dams in forests. I have also planted hundreds of trees.

Nearly 8,000 patients were admitted to various hospitals. The number of positive cases is expected to cross one lakh in a possible third wave. But, we are prepared to effectively handle the situation. We have already stocked 20,000 COVID-19 kits and 15,000 Remdesivir doses. We have put a mechanism in place to ensure adequate supply of oxygen to all hospitals in the district. We are going to increase the ICU bed capacity at VIMS Hospital and Trauma Care Centre in Ballari city,” Mr. Malapati told media representatives in his office on Sunday. He added that the 1,000-bed COVID-19 hospital established at Torangal by JSW Group in association with the district administration will continue to serve patients. Mr. Malapati said that Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai had held a meeting with Deputy Commissioners of the border districts and given instructions to them to take appropriate steps to contain the spread of virus from neighbouring States. Just as it was done in the first and second waves of the pandemic, congested vegetable and fruit markets will be shifted to larger spaces on the outskirts of the city for allowing people to maintain social distancing while doing transactions, he said. “We are planning to launch a house-to-house survey throughout the district on Monday. The survey will help the administration in identifying COVID-19 patients and isolating them immediately so that the further spread of the virus can be contained. I will hold a meeting of private hospitals and discuss with them the steps to be taken to face the third wave, if any. We will increase the number of fever clinics if the need arises,” Mr. Malapati said and appealed to the people to visit fever clinics immediately if they notice symptoms such fever and cough, cold and help the administration fight the pandemic.

He called upon people to voluntarily come forward to get vaccinated. Superintendent of Police Saidulu Adavath expressed discontent over the negligence of the people in maintaining standard operating procedure. “People think that the pandemic has gone and the lockdown is lifted. They don’t wear face masks and maintain social distancing. We will start organising awareness programmes in association with civil society groups.

As a possible third-wave fear looms, officials have been instructed to conduct more tests at border check-posts to keep a check on the spread of the pandemic,” Kalaburagi Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Dileesh Sasi has said. Six check-posts have been set up at entry points in Arjungi, Mashal and Belurgi villages in Afzalpur taluk and at Khajuri, Hirolli and Nimbal villages in Aland taluk on the Karnataka-Maharashtra border in Kalaburagi district. Travellers from Maharashtra have to produce RT-PCR negative test reports done not earlier than 72 hours before their journey. And, commuters who travel between the two States on a regular basis for emergency reasons must get tested every fortnight.

Though BJP candidates won five out of nine segments in the last Assembly elections, the region failed to get any representation in the Yediyurappa Cabinet. Though a few MLAs and MLCs from Kalaburagi district have started lobbying for Cabinet berths, it is mainly the names of Dattatreya Patil Revoor, MLA for Kalaburagi South, and Rajkumar Patil Telkur, MLA for Sedam, that are doing the rounds on social media and in political circles.

02 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Konkan Rly. says Karwar day train was causing huge loss||Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. (KRCL) has justified the cancellation of Yeshwantpur-Karwar-Yeshwantpur Tri-weekly day train between Mangaluru Junction and Karwar stating that the service was running under huge loss. Responding to Kumta-Honnavar MLA Dinakar K. Shetty’s letter seeking immediate restoration of the cancelled service, KRCL Chairman and Managing Director Sanjay Gupta said, “Government of India expects all PSUs to be profitable. Performance evaluation of PSUs is based on the financial performance and this is reviewed by the Government. Furthermore, Government of Karnataka has invested in Konkan Railway and its representative on our Board of Directors expects return from their investment.” Mr. Gupta said that the tri-weekly day train was restarted in April after the COVID-19 first wave. Between April 12 and May 4, nine services were operated in each direction and the overall occupancy was about 4%. “The poor response to this train may have been due to the reserved nature of this train as most of the people of Karwar-Mangaluru travel in unreserved class as their travel is short distance. But unreserved travelling of passengers is not yet permitted by the Ministry of Railways to avoid the spread of the pandemic,” he said. He further said that revenue generation was essential for any organisation for its survival. Even during the pre-COVID-19 time, occupancy on the Karwar train was very low between Karwar and Mangaluru. Patrons surprised Meanwhile, surprised with the argument made by KRCL that the occupancy of the train was very low, train patrons said that occupancy or revenue when COVID-19 second wave was on should not be considered at all. They said that KRCL was duty bound to cater to the people of the State who are the second biggest stakeholders in KRCL after Maharashtra. Refuting Mr. Gupta’s suggestion that the State government did expect profits from KRCL, sources in Infrastructure Development Department (IDD) told The Hindu that if profit-making was the government’s agenda, the Railways would have been given to private operators to handle. In fact, the government wants more trains to be operated on coastal Karnataka network to boost tourism and industry, sources said and added that the government would talk to KRCL in this regard. South Western Railway that owns the Karwar train said that a major portion of the total revenues (profit/loss) goes to the owning zone while the originating traffic revenue is shared by the owning as well as operating zones. Sources said that KRCL’s argument of loss from Karwar train was untenable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/konkan-rly-says-karwar-day-train-was-causing-huge-loss/article35673586.ece
02 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Vistadome coaches a big hit||Vistadome coaches attached to day train services between Bengaluru and Mangaluru to promote tourism by the South Western Railway have been receiving overwhelming response from the travelling public. They were almost fully booked for the last week of July. South Western Railway introduced two each Vistadome coaches on two tri-weekly and one-weekly day express trains between Yeshwantpur-Mangaluru Junction-Yeshwantpur. The maiden service was launched at Mangaluru Junction on July 11 with Train No 06540 Mangaluru Junction-Yeshwantpur weekly Express Special. With 44 executive class seats in each coach, the maiden run saw 79 passengers availing themselves of the services. The coaches ran to their full capacity on July 14, 17, 18 (with five on the wait list), 22 and 24 (with 18 on the wait list) from Mangaluru to Yeshwantpur. On the other hand, full occupancy of coaches was registered from Yeshwantpur to Mangaluru Junction on July 16 and 17 (with six each on the wait list), July 18 (one on the wait list), July 19, July 22 (three on the wait list), July 23 (seven on the wait list), July 24 (17 on the wait list) and July 25 (two on the wait list). The coaches were fully booked on July 26 and from July 29 to July 31, with wait lists. South Western Railway’s Chief Public Relations Officer Aneesh Hegde told The Hindu that while many travel from end-to-end, some passengers prefer to board the coaches at Hassan and travel up to Mangaluru or board the coaches at Mangaluru and travel till Hassan, specifically to enjoy the natural beauty of the Western Ghats. The zone, though wanted to introduce these coaches on the day trains in April itself, the onset of COVID-19 deterred the introduction as it was thought not many would travel during a health crisis. The introduction finally came in July during the monsoon, the right season to enjoy the beauty of the Western Ghats when greenery is on the bloom and when the water bodies are full. The coaches are equipped with reclining chairs that rotate up to 180 degrees to offer unhindered outside view through wide windowpanes and other state-of-the-art facilities available on Shatabdi coaches. The large windowpane at the rear of the coach offers a complete view of the outside beauty. However, this view gets obstructed when the train is on the Mangaluru-Yeshwantpur route as a banking loco is attached at the rear of the rake to push the train on the ghat section.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vistadome-coaches-a-big-hit/article35673584.ece

02 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||75 women undergo laparoscopic sterilisation||As many as 75 women have undergone laparoscopic sterilisation in three camps at government health facilities in Dakshina Kannada this year since the resumption of service on July 26. This procedure was not taken up early this year because of the second wave of COVID-19. In the camp held at the Government Hospital in Belthangady on Saturday, a total of 26 women underwent the procedure. As many as 27 women underwent the procedure at the Government Lady Goschen Hospital here on July 27. On July 26, 12 women underwent the procedure in the government health facility in Kadaba. Laparoscopic sterilisation is one among the two accepted methods of contraception for women in the country. This involves inserting a long thin tube with a lens into the abdomen through a small incision. This laparoscope enables the doctor to see and block or cut the fallopian tubes in the abdomen. Superintendent of Government Lady Goschen Hospital and laparoscopic surgeon M.R. Durgaprasad heads the team of three personnel from the Health and Family Welfare Department performing the procedure in the district since 1997. “We have so far performed the procedure for 80,000 women and it included a good number of those who have had Caesarean section previously,” he said. Auxiliary Nurse Midwives and ASHAs on the field, Dr. Durgaprasad said, inspire women to undergo this safe family planning procedure and subject them to tests to find those who are fit for it. The team, which comprises himself, a technical assistant and a data entry personnel, take a vehicle with necessary equipment to designated government health centres to perform the procedure. Each procedure takes about five minutes and all beneficiaries are dropped back home the same evening in their vehicle. Dr. Durgaprasad said that a facility was created in November last year on the third floor of the Lady Goschen Hospital for the procedure. During the first wave of COVID-19 last year, he said, care was taken to do the procedure on those who tested negative for COVID-19 in RT-PCR test. “With a surge in cases in the second wave, we did not hold any camps in the first six months of this year,” he said. Those undergoing the procedure receive a honorarium of Rs. 600 each if they are Below Poverty Line and Rs. 250 if they are from Above Poverty Line category. ASHAs and ANMs do follow-up visits to houses of beneficiaries and attend to complications, if any, they may face following discharge from hospital. “It is because of their work, we are seeing a good number of women coming forward for the procedure,” Dr. Durgaprasad said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/75-women-undergo-laparoscopic-sterilisation/article35673589.ece

In his complaint on Saturday, Dr. Kakkilaya said that office-bearers on the dais of the function had failed to wear masks. They sat too close and thus did not follow physical distancing.

02 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Mysuru district witnesses gradual decline in daily COVID-19 cases||Even though daily COVID-19 cases hit a downward trend in Mysuru during the last four weeks since restrictions were eased on August 5, the rate of decline has been gradual with the district reporting between 100 and 200 cases on most days. Health officials and experts claim that the pandemic is “under control” in Mysuru despite the daily cases remaining above 100 during the last four weeks, barring two days. “These numbers are normal for a district like Mysuru,” said Chidambara, nodal officer for COVID-19 testing and training. The claims come in the backdrop of a surge in cases in Kerala and the threat of a third wave. In Mysuru, fresh infections reduced from 966 last week to 864 this week. The estimated population in the district is 33.9 lakh. “There are around 9 lakh families. So, our daily infections will remain around 150-250. The virus has spread in the community and it will not come down easily till vaccination is completed or till we achieve herd immunity,” said Dr. Chidambara. Since mid-June, when the numbers dipped below 500 daily, there has been a gradual drop in daily infections, he added. Dr. Chidambara did not rule out the spread of infection from Kerala. But, a tight vigil is being maintained at the Bavali checkpost in H.D. Kote, where only people with a RT-PCR report less than 72 hours are being allowed. Officials are also collecting the contact details of those entering Karnataka with negative RT-PCR reports because the tests may not show positivity when the virus is in incubation. Such persons may turn positive after entering the State, he said. Meanwhile, Mudassir Azeez Khan, head of Community Medicine at Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMC and RI), attributed the slow progress in decline of cases in Mysuru to reasons that include transmission of the virus after easing of curbs and the presence of Delta strain in Mysuru, which spreads faster. Though the actual numbers may be higher than the reported figures if testing is carried out more scientifically, Dr. Khan also described the situation as “under control”. However, he did not rule out a spike in cases in October-November if the people do not take precautions. Referring to the spurt in weddings and other large gatherings post lockdown, Dr. Khan said the faster transmission of the virus during such events and influx of people from across the border could contribute to a spike in October-November. Dr. Khan said the third wave is likely to come around February-March 2022, a couple of months after the October-November spike. However, to avert fatalities and hospitalisation with severe symptoms, Dr. Khan said there is a need to step up vaccination, which has slowed down considerably in the last few days. Even if the vaccination does not prevent one from contracting COVID-19, it can prevent hospitalisations and deaths, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mysuru-district-witnesses-gradual-decline-in-daily-covid-19-cases/article35673600.ece
02 August 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Historians, scholars call for strengthening epigraphy||Scholars and historians across the country have taken exception to the short shift given to the epigraphy branch in the restructuring of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and the issue has now reached the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). There are only 31 epigraphists for the entire country of which 10 are vacant and not a single additional post has been created for epigraphy during the cadre restricting of the ASI that took place recently. Though 758 new posts were created after abolishing 304 posts, epigraphy branch was not only ignored but even the existing posts were reduced as in case of Sanskrit. A.V.

Prof. Narasimhamurthy, in a letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said that he was shocked that the government could not create even a single post for epigraphy which is an important wing under the ASI. “Many scholars of national and international repute have worked in the epigraphy branch and their contribution to historical research is immeasurable. As an historian and an archaeologist, I strongly believe that without the data gleamed from epigraphic research, history would be just a bunch of folk tales and myths’’, said Prof.N arasimhamurthy. He said not creating additional posts for epigraphy and reducing the sanctioned strength increases the burden of work besides resulting in a decline in standard of scholarship. “But above all it creates a sense of despair and disappointment to the serving staff due to the absence of growth opportunities’’, said Prof. Narasimhamurthy, urging the Prime Minister to create new posts, open regional centres, and restore the glory of the epigraphy branch. Meanwhile, other sources said historians, PhD students and postgraduate students of history from different universities across the country will also urge the government to give epigraphy its rightful due and encourage epigraphical studies. The epigraphy branch of the ASI was established in 1886 A.D. and thousands of inscriptions have been copied, deciphered and its gist published in the annual reports on Indian Epigraphy. However, due to paucity of staff only 50 per cent of the inscriptions discovered in detail so far have been published. But what is worrying the scholars is thousands of inscriptions which are a treasure-trove of information on history and culture of the country, were being destroyed owing to development works, mining, quarrying etc.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/historians-scholars-call-for-strengthening-epigraphy/article35673602.ece
02 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Joint survey ordered for rehabilitation of residents of Chengadi village||The Chamarajanagar district administration has ordered a joint survey of the reserve forest near Vaishampalya in Hanur division of the M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary for relocation and rehabilitation of the people of Chengadi village. Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi has sought a comprehensive report of the survey by the Forest and Revenue departments, besides an analysis of the pros and cons of the area identified for the relocation. The Revenue Department was also directed to rectify any anomalies and refine the records pertaining to the extent of landholding by individuals and the families identified for relocation. He also called for sorting out any discrepancies in the records in the initial stages itself so as to pave the way for the smooth relocation of the families. It was originally suggested Chikkallur village for the rehabilitation but it was decided to relocate the people of Chengadi to Vaishampalya near Hanur as it was more feasible, said V. Yedukondalu, Deputy Conservator of Forests, M.M. Hills. Though nearly 200 tribal families living in the remote village cut off from mainstream since centuries have periodically sought their relocation, it gained official traction in 2018 after which the State government issued an official order notifying the relocation in 2020. But the pandemic delayed the exercise. A review meeting was conducted on Saturday to expedite the process and the location survey and a report on the pros and cons of the area would be submitted by the third week of August. In all, 230 families have sought relocation as the existing geographical location of the village does not facilitate development and the terrain was inaccessible. Chengadi is almost 12 km deep inside the forest boundary and people have to trek long distances for basic amenities. The remoteness and inaccessibility is such that in the late 1990s forest brigand Veerappan used to move without any fear of the Special Task Force searching for him. The body of the former Minister Nagappa, who was abducted by Veerappan in 2002 and was subsequently shot, was also found in Chengadi forests. The rehabilitation entails acquisition of 178.9 hectares and the State government has sanctioned Rs. 35 crore for the purpose. A project consultant has also been roped in to provide inputs for the new model village in which the construction will be eco-friendly; emphasis would be on tapping green energy and rainwater harvesting, apart from promoting community farming. A primary health centre, school, and anganwadi should also be incorporated in the design for rehabilitation, said Mr. Ravi. Once implemented, the exercise would be a model for similar rehabilitation schemes of a few more remote villages such as Padusalanattha, Tokkere, etc.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/joint-survey-ordered-for-rehabilitation-of-residents-of-chengadi-village/article35673449.ece
02 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Visitors to Kodagu from within State may need RT-PCR report||Not just inter-State travellers, visitors to Kodagu from within the State may also have to carry a RT-PCR negative report. Though the district administration is yet to receive any written order from the government on tests for inter-district visitors, it was verbally communicated during a videoconference by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on guidelines to be strictly complied with. “We are awaiting an order on tourists from the government. If we get the guidelines on mandatory RT-PCR report even for tourists from within the State, we shall implement that. We have been told to screen people staying in resorts etc.,” said Deputy Commissioner Charulatha Somal. Ms. Somal recently inspected the border check posts and supervised the surveillance measures. In an order on Saturday, Ms. Somal said a RT-PCR report is a must to enter Karnataka and daily travellers from Kerala are supposed to get the test done once in 15 days. They must carry the report whenever they are travelling to Kodagu. She said the onus on checking the reports of the travellers lies with the bus conductors from the originating station. Meanwhile, the stakeholders foresee a cancellation in bookings, particularly in resorts and home stays which have been seeing almost 100% occupancy after the curbs were lifted, if the report is made mandatory for tourists. Kodagu has been attracting high-end tourists post-lockdown. The occupancy in Kodagu hotels has been dismal as they are reporting less than 20% occupancy. “If the tests are made mandatory, it may result in cancellation of bookings. The rise in surveillance may deter tourists from travelling,” sources in tourism industry said. Earlier, when restrictions were imposed on the entry of people from Kerala, it affected the tourist footfall in Mysuru and Kodagu, which dropped by nearly 30-40%. People with negative test reports within 72 hours were entering the borders but their numbers were small as noticed earlier. Hotels in Mysuru and homestays and resorts in Kodagu had also reported cancellation of bookings of visitors from Kerala earlier in view of the stricter rules. With fears of a third wave, the Delta variant, and rise in cases in Kerala, the government has alerted the DCs of border districts to curb the spread with early interventions. The stricter surveillance at border check posts in Mysuru and Kodagu may once again result in fall in tourist inflow like earlier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/visitors-to-kodagu-from-within-state-may-need-rt-pcr-report/article35673189.ece
02 August 2021||YADGIR,KARNATAKA||Yadgir administration takes fresh initiatives to check pandemic||In view of the high number of positive cases of COVID-19 that are being reported in Maharashtra and Kerala, the Yadgir district administration has taken some strict initiatives against travellers coming from those States to check the spread of the pandemic. Addressing members at a taskforce committee meeting in Yadgir on Sunday, Deputy Commissioner R. Ragapriya issued a clear direction to the officers saying that they have to implement the guidelines issued on July 31 by the State government for travellers from Maharashtra and Kerala. Those who wish to travel from Maharashtra and Kerala to the district should compulsorily carry with them negative reports of RT-PCR test conducted not older than 72 hours from the date of journey, no matter whether they are vaccinated or not, Dr Ragapriya said. “It will apply to travellers coming by flights, trains and other vehicles and it is the responsibility of the authorities concerned to confirm that the travellers are carrying negative RT-PCR test reports,” she added. The Deputy Commissioner directed the Home, the Health and the revenue departments officials to deploy officers to inspect vehicles passing through check-posts round-the-clock on shift basis. “The district administration has already set up eight check-posts in Yaragol, Mudbul, Malla (B), Tinthani, Gurmitkal, Kuntimari, Narayanpur and Malanur village borders,” she said. Dr. Ragapriya gave the responsibility of supervising preparations to tahsildars of the respective taluks. She also asked the Assistant Commissioner of Yadgir Revenue Sub-division to conduct surprise visits to check-posts to inspect whether staff are using thermal machines to check travellers or not. Conductors on duty on State-owned buses will be held responsible if any passenger is found on their buses without negative RT-PCR test report. Superintendent of Police C.B. Vedamurthy, Additional Deputy Commissioner Shankargowda Somanal, District Health Officer Indumathi K. and other officers were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yadgir-administration-takes-fresh-initiatives-to-check-pandemic/article35673445.ece

In a release here on Sunday, he said that the police will investigate the matter and further information will be given after they go through the case. Shahapur Police on July 30 registered a suo motu case against Basavaraj Bangi stating that he used abusive words against the former district in-charge Minister R. Shankar during the latter’s visit to flood-hit areas in Shahapur taluk of Yadgir district on July 24. In a video, which has gone viral, it is seen that Basavaraj Bangi is arguing with Mr Shankar demanding compensation. But, as per the police, who went through records, he had already received crop insurance in 2019. However, Basavaraj Bangi continued to argue with the Minister in public. Hence, he was booked.

Sahil Sheikh, a regular traveller between Maharashtra and Karnataka, remarked: “I have to shuttle three times a week. How can I keep getting tested twice a week?’’ ‘Streamlining soon’ Belgavi Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath and Superintendent of Police Lakshman Nimbaragi visited the Kuganoli checkpost on Sunday to take stock of the situation. Some passengers complained to Mr. Hiremath that the checking process was delaying their journey. Mr. Hiremath told The Hindu that the system would be streamlined in a few days. A similar situation prevailed along the border with Kerala. The Kodagu district administration, which has stepped up surveillance along the border, has also decided to carry out rapid antigen tests at all the checkposts from Monday. Similarly, more surveillance staff are likely to be deployed at the checkposts from Monday for quick screening of travellers. At the Attibele check post near Bengaluru, bordering Tamil Nadu, government officials were screening vehicles bearing registration numbers of Kerala and Maharashtra which were coming from both Kerala and Tamil Nadu. People who failed to show negative RT-PCR reports were sent back.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/travellers-to-state-hit-by-new-norms/article35673197.ece

02 August 2021||August 02 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Corridors of Power||The Congress’ “culture of high command” that the Bharatiya Janata Party once loved to mock seems to have penetrated deeply into the BJP system now in all aspects of party politics. Since the days of the country’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the Congress was known for its high command culture in all government and party matters, from the appointment of Chief Ministers to the selection of candidates for parliamentary and provincial elections. Now, with the BJP ruling at the Centre, the party leaders in the States have often talked about the high command and their readiness to obey decisions taken by them. In Karnataka, BJP leaders are often found referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, party president J.P. Nadda, and sometimes even veteran leader and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in almost all their speeches. Former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa thanked the first three in his farewell speech, while his successor Basavaraj Bommai (in picture) not only thanked all four in his first two days in office, but also visited Delhi to personally express his gratitude. Admitting to the narrowing differences between the two parties in this aspect of high command culture, an expert said the only difference now was the party symbols.   Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy (in picture) wants to know which party in Karnataka is “really and fully” in favour of the State with respect to the Mekedatu balancing reservoir project. “The Opposition AIADMK in Tamil Nadu has brought pressure on the NDA government at the Centre not to allow it. The ruling DMK has brought pressure on the Congress. However, in Karnataka, both the Congress and the BJP have been saying the project should be implemented. Who is on whose side?” asked the former Chief Minister on Twitter. Now, K. Annamalai, former IAS officer who has served in Karnataka for many years and is BJP party president in Tamil Nadu, has announced that he would go on a fast against the project. While the Mekedatu project has been seen as a unifying political force in Tamil Nadu, it has displayed cracks in the political forces in Karnataka, said Mr. Kumaraswamy, adding that his party would support all efforts to push the project forward. Without quite saying so, he was hinting that as a regional party, the JD(S) alone had no such contradictions on the two sides of the border.   Basavaraj Bommai came to the BJP Legislature Party meeting, where he was elected the new Chief Minister, in senior Minister R. Ashok’s car and accompanied by former Health Minister K. Sudhakar (in picture) . For the next few days, Dr. Sudhakar became a fixture next to the Chief Minister.  However, this is not the first time that Dr. Sudhakar has virtually become the shadow of top leaders, say insiders. A BJP leader close to former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said that in the initial days, after Dr. Sudhakar crossed over to the BJP, he regularly — almost daily — visited the veteran leader’s house to “take care” of his health. Sources in the Congress said that when he was with the party, the former Minister missed no chance to be seen with the then Chief MinisterSiddaramaiah, day or night.  Nagesh Prabhu   Sharath S.

After a series of inspections, the Lucknow-based Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO) of the Union Ministry of Railways last month gave its final clearance. State govt.’s support K.S. Pradeep Kumar, chairman, Autokast said it had become the first public sector company in the country to manufacture Casnub bogies for Railways. “It is a milestone for Autokast and industrial development of the State. We achieved this by competing against private players. It is the result of hard work of more than three years. The State government’s support in recent years has played a big role in the accomplishment,” Mr. Kumar said. Autokast, which was accorded a Class ‘A’ Foundry status by the RDSO in 2019, bagged a ‘development order’ in March 2020 for manufacturing five Casnub bogies for goods trains for the Northern Railway at a cost of Rs. 2.1 lakh a bogie. “The first of five Casnub bogies will be dispatched to Amritsar in Punjab by road. It will be flagged off by Industries Minister P. Rajeeve at 5.30 p.m. on Friday. The remaining four bogies will be given before September,” Mr. Kumar said. The remarkable turnaround of Autokast, which was once listed for privatisation, can be attributed to the previous Left Democratic Front government’s efforts to revive sick public sector undertakings in the State. The government had injected money into Autokast, which helped it modernise the unit. Upgraded status By successfully delivering the initial order for Casnub bogies, officials said Autokast’s status had been upgraded from development source to regular source. It has become eligible to participate in Railways’ tenders. Apart from manufacturing Casnub bogies, Autokast recently supplied deck-mounted closed chocks for INS Vikrant , India’s first indigenous aircraft carrier. It has also received an order for supplying brake drums for Maruti Suzuki cars.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/autokast-on-fast-track-with-railways-order/article35673560.ece

An online meeting was held in this regard at the Collectorate on Saturday . The meeting led by Water Resources Minister Roshy Augustine said that it was the duty of the government and the society to provide basic infrastructure and devices to students to help in online education. He said that opportunities should be given to students to learn lessons in a competitive manner by making digital devices available to all. The approach of the teachers and people's representatives towards this endeavour should be appreciated, he said. District Collector Sheeba George who presided at the function said that if one family is considered a single unit for online education, there are 5,973 units in the district for it. However, if each student is considered then there are 13,517 students having no facility for online education. Of them the students in Scheduled Tribe category in Class X and XII are 462. As per the estimate of the Tribal Department, there were 6,448 students without a laptop or tablet from Class I to XII in the district. As many as 3,148 students have applied for loan through Vidya Tharangini scheme under the co-operative sector. Of them 2,078 students have been already sanctioned the loan. In addition mobile phones were supplied by non-governmental agencies and individuals. Each school should give a weekly report to the Deputy Director of Education detailing the number of mobile phones already made available and the number needed. This report should also be submitted to the Collector. The presidents of 52 grama panchayats and two municipalities explained the arrangements in the local bodies for online education.  Of the total students, those in the Scheduled Tribe category in Class X and XII are 462.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/digital-device-challenge-in-idukki-district/article35673644.ece

The monitoring of an area of 13 sq km will be done using night vision and infrared cameras and drones. In addition sensor devices will also be installed in key areas to monitor human movement. B.Ramjith, Marayur DFO (divisional forest officer) said that this would considerably reduce the work of the field staff while getting timely information at the head office. Maryayur Sandalwood Division employs 200 people in addition to 100 permanent staff. This is the wealthiest forest division in the State with 56,000 sandalwood trees each having a number tagged on it. Over the years sandalwood smuggling could be effectively countered, reaching to almost zero level now. This was done through participatory management by employing the tribespeople in sandalwood protection and promoting agri-based employment inside the forest. The sandalwood division is also a habitat for a wide range of animal species including wild elephant, leopard, wild gaur, sambar and spotted deer. Animal barriers Animal barriers were often harmful to the wild animals and resulted in isolation of them in small areas. The movements of the wild animals on the borders could be effectively noticed and steps taken to drive them into the forest using the modern technology, Marayur Range officer M. G. Vinodkumar told The Hindu on Sunday. He said that though fencing was done and annual repair works taken up wild elephants constantly damage them. This was the reason for increasing man-animal conflicts in Kanthallur area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/modern-equipment-for-protecting-sandalwood/article35673539.ece

02 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Second ro-ro ferry set to begin service from today||The second roll on-roll off (ro-ro) vessel of the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), which was handed over to the Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC) for operation, is set to begin commercial service on the Bolgatty Island-Willingdon Island stretch from Monday. It is in view of the rise in demand from operators of container lorries and other vehicles hit by the skyrocketing fuel prices. High demand “Smaller goods carriers and two-wheelers too have been relying on the single ro-ro service during the past few weeks. The demand is on the rise, and it peaked at 150 vehicles, including 18 two-wheelers and a car, on Friday. Hence, we decided to introduce the second vessel that was handed over by IWA,” KSINC sources said. Passengers too can commute in the corridor in the ro-ro vessel, at Rs. 10. It is Rs. 30 for ferrying two-wheelers, Rs. 120 to Rs. 200 for cars / SUVs / cargo autorickshaws, Rs. 250-Rs. 600 for mini tippers / trucks, and between Rs. 800 and Rs. 1,200 for other vehicles, including 40-feet container trailers. The second ro-ro vessel will operate at regular intervals every 30 minutes, from 8 a.m. to 7.15 p.m. (the last trip will end at 8 p.m.), barring a lunch break from 1 p.m. to 1.40 p.m. The increase in prices of diesel and petrol has resulted in more motorists and goods carriers preferring the waterway route. A hotline number (98462-11163) is available on board the vessel, which will help the public know the service timings, the sources said. “The second vessel has been introduced on a trial basis. With people coming to know of the manifold advantages of water transport, we hope there will be sound patronage for both the vessels,” they added. A regular ro-ro service from the city to Fort Kochi and back had been mentioned in the election manifesto of the LDF. This is expected to get even more patronage than the container ro-ro service.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/second-ro-ro-ferry-set-to-begin-service-from-today/article35673521.ece

The findings of the survey were discussed at a meeting here recently to mark the end of the month-long intense awareness campaign under the Union government’s Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyan to salvage the district’s reputation. “We are planning to actively intervene in these hotspots in coordination with excise, police, and health departments, Kudumbashree, and local bodies in a year-long campaign starting from August 15. We are hopeful that it will help curtail the availability of alcohol and drugs in these hotspots and strip the district of its dubious distinction,” said Subair K.K., District Social Justice Officer. A survey held by the Union Ministry of Social Justice in 2019 had found Ernakulam to be among the 272 districts in the country afflicted with substance abuse. Every 29 out of the 100 men in the district was found to be using alcohol, which was higher than the national average of 27 out of 100. While alcohol continues to pose the problem in a majority of the hotspots, drugs also figure in significant proportions within the city limits. Among the hotspots within the city are the area near the Kaloor bus stand and beneath the North overbridge where youngsters converge and create a ruckus overnight, leaving behind liquor bottles and even used syringes as tell-tale signs of substance abuse. Committees have been formed at the corporation, municipal and block levels to plan and implement the project. With the pandemic putting up a stumbling block, interventions will be largely restricted to online till physical activities could be probably launched by October by which time vaccination for children is expected to be rolled out. “At least four sessions will be held a year separately for high school and higher secondary students and youngsters,” said Mr. Subair.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/campaign-against-drug-abuse-alcohol-planned/article35673516.ece
02 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Nod for Rs. 344-crore coastal protection work in Chellanam||The State government has accorded administrative sanction for work worth Rs. 344 crore for coastal protection in Chellanam, which has been identified as a “hotspot” of sea erosion in Kerala. The government plans to introduce coastal protection measures along the entire Kerala coast, but priority has been given to Chellanam, considering the intensity of the problem in the panchayat. A meeting of engineering and other experts convened by the Chief Minister earlier this year had decided to explore various options, including the use of tetrapods, for coastal protection. The order giving administrative sanction for the work in Chellanam said “robust measures of coastal protection like use of tetrapods for seawall need to be explored.” The government has said it will be exploring long- and short-term measures as well as soft and hard methods to solve the problem of coastal erosion. The Irrigation Design and Research Board (IDRB) has been entrusted with the task of carrying out the work worth Rs. 344 crore. The National Centre for Coastal Research was involved in preparing a design for the coastal protection structure and making an estimate of the expenses. Redesign The redesigned structure suggested by the IDRB includes a diaphragm wall supported by tetrapods. The rebuilding of damaged or sunken walls for a segment of 10 km along the Chellanam coast will cost around Rs. 254 crore, and another Rs. 90 crore will be spent on erecting groyne field in the Bazaar and Kannamali segment of the coast. A total of Rs. 1,500 crore has been earmarked in the State Budget 2021-22 for coastal protection measures. The State has also identified 10 hotspots of sea erosion along its coast. The fund for coastal protection work, including the ones being undertaken in Chellanam, will come through the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). A team of engineers with experience in coastal protection work will be constituted to oversee the work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nod-for-rs-344-crore-coastal-protection-work-in-chellanam/article35673525.ece

The authorities were pretending to be “asleep to the appeal for help from Chellanam residents,” said a notice issued by the Janakiya Vedhi announcing the protest action. It said the members of the group would sleep in front of the fisheries office to symbolise the lack of action on the part of the authorities. The Janakiya Vedhi has also opposed a move by the State government to rehabilitate and relocate people living within 50 metres of the high tide line by setting up a housing complex. The organisation said people were looking towards the government introducing coastal protection measures and not relocation measures. Fisheries Department sources had said last week that more than a hundred families in Chellanam had expressed interest in being relocated in the wake of severe sea erosion and flooding of homes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chellanam-residents-to-protest-against-inadequate-measures/article35673523.ece

The construction was nearing completion when on Saturday, a holiday, we received a letter from the Deputy Collector, asking us to urgently furnish the lease agreement, documents authorising the construction, copy of diversion certificate, ownership certificate, possession certificate, and minutes of the meeting that authorised the construction. Today [Sunday] evening, a team came with security and demolished the structure. We were thinking of submitting the documents tomorrow [Monday]. Are they not supposed to follow due procedure before doing such a thing? And, this is being done to a panchayat authority,” T. Abdul Khader, chairman of Kavaratti Dweep (village) panchayat, lamented. “The act reeks of an individual’s arrogance,” Mr. Khader added.

But for this patch of manmade forest, it just worked the other way around. Like virtually everything in 2020, the raging pandemic has cast a show over the very existence of Mango Meadows, country's first agricultural theme park. Home to about 4 800 species of plants including 700 trees, 900 flowering plants, the park is now struggling hard to stay afloat in the face of a looming debt disaster. Rs. 25 crore debt With its outstanding debts accumulating to a whopping Rs. 25 crore, it now faces the prospects of attachment under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act. Confirming the situation, N.K. Kurien, who owns the park, said the time for repaying the whole amount in a single tranche will run out by August 25. “While the mega floods of 2018 and the Nipah scare have all driven visitors away from the park in the past ever since its opening in 2018, nothing has ever hit all at once before. The pandemic was a shock no one saw coming and it has laid bare the inherent weaknesses of such a project,” he said. While the park remains closed, the owner incurs a monthly expense of around Rs. 6.5 lakh to maintain its bounty of biodiversity. “With no money coming in, only 65 of the total 300 employees are now staying back,” added Mr.Kurien In view of the situation, he has now approached the State government with a request to assign any of its financial agencies such as the Kerala Financial Corporation (KFC), Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) or Kerala Bank to take over the loan so as to pay the amount in different instalments. Meanwhile, a crowdfunding initiative has taken off to save the park, which acts as a repository of rare species and has found place in the URF World Records and the Limca Book of Records for developing the maximum number of agriculture and horticulture species in a minimum area of 30 acres. Campaign The campaign, organised by a committee including Kaduthuruthy legislator Mons Joseph and Mahatma Gandhi University Vice Chancellor Sabu Thomas, seeks contributions of Rs. 10,000 in return for a premium membership in the Mango Meadows family . Schemes for those making contributions in amounts less than Rs. 10,000 too have been formulated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-green-lung-gasps-for-breath/article35673536.ece
02 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Hairpin curves on Kuttiyadi pass likely to be widened||The hairpin curves on the Kuttiyadi-Pakrathalam Mountain pass, which are often used as the shortest route to reach Mananthavadi, are likely to be widened considering the increasing flow of vehicles, including inter-State goods carriers. In support of the Public Works Department’s plan, many local landowners in the area have expressed willingness to hand over the required land free of cost to the government. According to Public Works Department officials, the project under the consideration of the government will address the safety issues on twelve hairpin curves covering the nearly 17-km stretch of the total distance. For heavy vehicles, these dangerous curves have been posing a safety threat. Increasing accidents during monsoon season have also prompted the administrators to address the issue at the earliest. The route, mostly used by heavy vehicles during diversion of traffic from the Thamarassery Ghat Road during emergency situations, comes under the category of Major District Roads (MDR). It is maintained by the PWD wings in Kozhikode and Wayanad districts. Of the total 48-km distance of the Kuttiyadi-Mananthavadi road, the nearly 17-kilometre stretch between Kuttiyadi and Pakrathalam comes under the jurisdiction of the Kozhikode administration. Elected representatives from the area have already informed the State government that landowners in the area are ready to spare their land for the widening of the existing curves to 15 metres. According to them, the completion of the work will be a big boost to the domestic tourism industry, as it will ensure better connectivity with Wayanad district. Minister for Public Works P.A. Mohamed Riyas has also responded positively to the project with his assurance in the Assembly that it will be taken up seriously for a study by engineers and appropriate development plan will be adopted under any of the convenient local development projects. A few years ago, there were attempts on the part of the Tourism Department and administrators of Kavilumpara panchayat to beautify the road and make it an attractive route to Wayanad. Reckless waste dumping by passers-by had been brought under control with flawless monitoring and legal action. There were also attempts to improve road visibility by clearing undergrowth with the support of workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hairpin-curves-on-kuttiyadi-pass-likely-to-be-widened/article35673511.ece
02 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Central team expresses concern over high TPR in Kozhikode||A Central team of health experts has expressed concern about the high test positivity rate (TPR) for COVID-19 in Kozhikode district. They asked the district administration on Sunday to ensure strict enforcement of social restrictions and ramping up of tests. For the past couple of weeks, a majority of local bodies in the district are reporting a TPR between 10% and 15% and above. The team also examined the treatment facilities at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode. P. Raveendran, former Deputy Director General, DM Cell, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and K. Reghu, Additional Director, National Centre for Disease Control regional office, Kozhikode, were part of the team. They took stock of the spread of infection, containment measures, treatment facilities, and the progress of the vaccination drive. District Collector N. Tej Lohit Reddy and Health Department officials spoke about the need for more vaccine stock to speed up the inoculation drive. District officials said that they had already increased the number of tests. The Central team also directed the district administration to set up more first-line treatment centres in the district. Vehicle blocked Meanwhile, a group of Congress workers blocked the vehicle of the officials near Chaliyam to protest against the alleged discrimination in the allocation of vaccine. They alleged that the vaccine was being allocated only to workers of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The officials are reported to have noted their complaints. Later, local village officials informed the police, who persuaded the protesters to disperse. The district added 2,434 fresh COVID-19 cases to its active case pool on Sunday, which reached 24,612. Of the new cases, 2,400 are due to local transmission of infection, and the source of 29 others is not known.

02 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Greens worried over Supreme Court verdict on Thusharagiri land||Environmentalists in the State foresee a dangerous precedent if the ecologically fragile land near Thusharagiri in Kozhikode district is handed back to its original owners following the recent Supreme Court verdict. It may even spell doom for Chalippuzha, which originates from the three waterfalls in the area, Thusharagiri, Eerattumukku, and Mazhavil. This, in turn, will imperil the Thusharagiri eco-tourism project. It was in 2000 that the State government took over 540 acres near the Thusharagiri waterfalls in the high-ranges of the district, after environmentalists, including Medha Patkar and Sugathakumari, highlighted the uncontrolled tree felling in Jeerakappara near here. A dense forest now It was mostly barren land and some agricultural land, which now has turned into dense forest inhabited by several animals, including elephants, and some endangered species of butterflies. As the government had acquired the land under the Kerala Forest (Vesting and Management of Ecologically Fragile Lands) Act, 2003, without paying any compensation, some landowners had approached the court demanding that the land be returned to them. The matter was settled in their favour by the Supreme Court recently. A total of 71 acres have to be returned to the original owners based on this recent judgment. Two waterfalls in danger “The Chalippuzha, the lifeline of Kodenchery and nearby panchayats, originates from these three waterfalls. When the 71 acres are returned, two of the waterfalls will also be handed over. If the owners choose to take up mining or any sort of construction activities, these waterfalls will suffer and this will affect the Chalippuzha,” said T.V. Rajan, State Secretary of All Kerala River Protection Committee. So far, the State has not opposed handing over the land to the original owners, with the Forest Department claiming that it will not affect the eco-tourism project. Considering the serious implications of the problem, the River Protection Committee has appealed to the Chief Minister requesting him to file a review petition in the Supreme Court. It also plans to approach the court separately.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/greens-worried-over-supreme-court-verdict-on-thusharagiri-land/article35673501.ece

At the Beypore harbour alone, more than 100 medium-size boats and 50 larger boats are remaining idle. Emergency repair works ahead of resuming fishing after the trawling ban period have also come as a challenge for many. Boat owners say they have to shell out at least Rs. 4 lakh for the annual maintenance alone, including repainting works, at specialised yards. In the absence of such facilities in Kozhikode district, many are in a situation to take boats to the repairing yards at Munambam. Unable to withstand the crisis, the owners of more than 40 fishing boats from Beypore have already sold their boats at cheap rates. A majority of such boats were sold, as the owners could not mobilise money for the mandatory annual maintenance work. Some of them sold boats at scrap rates, as they were unable to repair them. “Fishing is hardly a profitable business now with the uncontrolled fuel prices. Many are now waiting for their turn to sell off boats. “At least Rs. 20 should be given as subsidy by cutting road tax for one-litre diesel if the government is truly concerned about the welfare of the segment,” says Karichal Preman, vice president, All Kerala Fishing Boat Owners Association. “These days, the owner of a medium or large fishing boat will have to set apart at least Rs. 1 lakh for meeting the basic cost of operation. If they return to the shore empty-handed because of adverse weather conditions or other emergencies, they will definitely be in crisis to resume the job next day,” says Mr. Preman. According to him, the loss of usual job days continues to be the biggest hurdle for creating a sustainable income. Boat owners from Puthiyappa harbour say the lack of sufficient number of local boat maintenance yards also create a lot of trouble for them. Only four small yards are now available in Kozhikode district, which can never meet the actual requirement of bigger boats. They also point out that the boat repairing yard earlier proposed near the Puthiyappa harbour still remains a pipe dream.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/crisis-hit-boat-operators-struggle-to-resume-work/article35673508.ece

02 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Crime mapping in 152 panchayats||The Kudumbashree is set to launch crime mapping in 152 panchayats in the State this month to prevent crimes against women and children. The first crime mapping by the Kudumbashree in select panchayats had led to the setting up of Snehitha gender help desks. The mission will now embark on a fresh exercise mapping 152 blocks (one panchayat in each block) in the first phase this year. Tools being prepared This follows an allocation of Rs. 20 crore in the State Budget for crime-mapping in all local bodies with the aim of reducing crime against women by at least 25% in five years. Tools for mapping are under preparation. These will help identify crime hot spots, types of crime, occurrence, and other patterns to analyse causes and devise strategies to prevent them, says Sindhu V., State Programme Manager, Gender, Kudumbashree. Report to govt. The mapping will be held at the Kudumbashree area development society (ADS) level. It will be consolidated into a report and handed over to the government. Next year, crime mapping will be extended to more panchayats. P.I. Sreevidya, Executive Director, Kudumbashree, says that based on information gathered, the Kudumbashree plans a focussed approach to preventing crimes against women. It will strengthen its systems, including Snehitha gender help desks, gender resource centres, and vigilant groups, to concentrate on preventive aspects. . Activity-oriented interventions in the area of gender equality are also planned by the Kudumbashree. It has prepared a thematic activity calendar for activities to be taken up by vigilant groups each month. The best activities will be shared on a platform and the group members felicitated. Educating students Kudumbashree is also focussing on gender education of children and the youth through gender clubs in schools and colleges. Gender training will begin in Balasabhas through games and activities this month. Modules for the training are ready. The gender dimension of issues faced by them, be it domestic chores, health, work, decision-making, will be discussed with their family members at ADS-level platforms, says Ms. Sindhu.

02 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Hope, tempered with caution, ahead of Onam||Kerala appears hopeful that the government will soon outline a plan to ease COVID-19 curbs on social life and commerce ahead of Onam. However, the government is apprehensive that the high average test positivity rate (above 15%) in at least 323 local government jurisdictions could dash the festival’s customary cheer. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is slated to review the COVID-19 curbs on August 3. The government has to walk a tightrope between curbing the pandemic and restoring livelihoods. It has to recalibrate pandemic control measures to fend off a possible third wave. The government is also under duress from traders to open up the retail and hospitality sectors 24/7. The business community feels the current set of TPR-driven COVID-19 curbs are self-defeating. Instead, they want the government to limit the restrictions to hotspots and allow regular activity outside. An official said the State would have to devise a lockdown strategy responsive to the changing patterns of the outbreak and limit the restrictions to areas most affected. Possibly, the government will need to alternate between phases of strict and relatively relaxed pandemic regulations. The government might take a call on allowing fully vaccinated customers inside malls, cinema halls, and sports complexes. The government is likely to impose micro-containment zones within a minimum radius of hotspots instead of locking down whole neighbourhoods.  Curbs likely to be reviewed tomorrow Govt. under pressure to open up livelihood avenues||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hope-tempered-with-caution-ahead-of-onam/article35673553.ece

They said the acute shortage of human resources in wards and ICUs in the State was seriously affecting patient care delivery. All residents were overworked following continuous shifts and the situation cannot be managed like this forever, they said. They KMPGA said they were also extremely worried that more than half of their three-year postgraduate training had been spent on COVID care, to the exclusion of other clinical exposure, training and academics. They said that talks with the Director of Medical Education had not been fruitful. The issue of human resource shortage had been raised several times with everyone from Medical College Principal to the Health Minister, in the past six months. On skill sets The medicos said they had willingly joined the State’s COVID care fight, sacrificing half their course period, which should have been spent on acquiring skill sets for their chosen specialities. But with the current batch of house surgeons leaving and one batch of residents preparing for their examinations, the staff shortage had become acute. The association demanded that the COVID patient load be shared by other peripheral institutions so that medical training and academics can resume in medical colleges. It demanded that additional human resources be sought with the help of National Health Mission. The medicos are also demanding incentives/risk allowances for resident doctors and reinstatement of the annual 4% hike in stipend. They wanted the 2016 MBBS final year batch who completed their practical examinations to be posted as house surgeons with immediate effect.  All of us are exhausted after continuous shifts and the situation cannot be managed like this forever, say medicos||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/medicos-to-go-ahead-with-12-hour-stir-today/article35673552.ece

Two persons have been taken into custody in this connection. According to the Naruvamoodu police, Aneesh, alias Kaaka Aneesh, of Kulangarakonam in Machel died after been hacked presumably by several people during the late hours of Saturday. His body was found at the unit close to his house on Sunday. The police suspected the murder to be linked to a gang rivalry. Aneesh is an accused in 28 criminal cases, including those related to murder, registered at Balaramapuram, Neyyattinkara and Nemom police stations. Detained under KAAPA He was let off after undergoing detention under the Kerala Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 2007, (KAAPA) for the third time on July 17.

The report points at remittance loss for the State, a serious cause for worry as remittances make up more than a quarter of the State Gross Domestic Product. The survey was conducted among 3,345 migrant workers who either returned home or are stranded abroad after being abandoned by their employers. A total of 397 workers out of them, making up more than 11% of the surveyed, were found to be victims of ‘wage theft,’ signifying termination without notice and withholding or deduction of wages and other benefits. Out of this, 90% belong to the construction sector, 2% manufacturing, 2% transportation and 2.5% comprising other sectors such as domestic work, retail and medical. According to figures maintained by NoRKA Roots, the field agency of the Department of Non-Resident Keralites, a total of 15.36 lakh migrant workers returned until July 15 this year since the outbreak of the pandemic. 1.3 lakh victims? Extrapolating the survey findings to these numbers, the CIMS estimates that around 1.3 lakh of those who returned due to job loss are likely to be victims of wage theft. “Immediate attention should be paid to timely access of justice mechanisms as certain GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries allow labour complaints only for a period of one year,” says Parvathy Devi K., migrant rights activist at CIMS and a research scholar at Mahatma Gandhi University, who authored the report. As per the analysis of data collected from the victims, a total of Rs. 62.58 crore has been denied. It was revealed that only nine respondents among the 397 were aware of the legal measures they could take to claim unpaid dues and wages after return to their country of origin. Along with the survey, CIMS, an organisation that has been handling issues of Indian migrant workers for over two decades, has also been filing cases of grievance since August 2020 in the MADAD portal, run by the Union Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/wage-theft-a-bane-of-gulf-returnees/article35673676.ece
02 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Landmark study on Dalits gets new edition||In the early 1970s, K. Saradamoni, one of the pioneers in Dalit and gender studies in Kerala, came across an old file titled ‘Abolition of Slavery in Kerala’, while going through the archives at the India Office Library, London. She was at that time about to begin working on her PhD under the French anthropologist Louis Dumont. That file set her off on a quest which led to her pioneering work Emergence of a slave caste: Pulayas of Kerala , published in 1980. Important Though that first of its kind study on caste slavery in Kerala became an important reference material, the book was not re-issued, until four decades later, a second edition came out last month, published by People’s Publishing House, Delhi. “The publishers had received several requests regarding this book. Though the book physically came out after she passed away in May, the work on it had begun before that, but got delayed due to COVID-19,” says Saradamoni’s daughter G. Arunima, Director of Kerala Council for Historical Research (KCHR). With a wealth of source materials, including administrative reports, writings by British officers, travellers and church mission records of the 1800s and 1900s, Saradamoni traces the evolution and abolition of slavery in Kerala. Attached to soil According to the system that existed in Kerala in the early 1800s, slaves were the absolute property of their masters. They were not attached to the soil. They could be made to do any work and could be sold to anyone. They did not even own their children. They begot children so that the master could have a continuous supply of workers. Pulayas constituted the largest slave community in Kerala. There were instances of the master selling the husband and wife or the children separately to different persons. The masters gave them just enough for subsistence. The master was not accountable to any person for what he did with his slaves. Abolished in 1843 The British Government in India legally abolished slavery in 1843. Malabar came under the scope of this act as it was under Madras presidency, but it did not apply to the princely states of Travancore and Cochin. The first anti-slavery proclamation was issued in Travancore in 1853, but it had a clause ensuring that the freedom of slaves will not affect the caste hierarchy and other ‘customs’. The Cochin royals issued the proclamation in 1854, with an additional clause ensuring that the slave and a free man will not be treated differently, if found guilty of any penal offence, thus granting the slave equality before law for the first time. This clause was included in a fresh declaration in Travancore in 1855. Travancore had around ten thousand slaves during the time of abolition. The final legal blow to slavery in India was struck by the Indian Penal Code, which came into force in 1862. But Saradamoni writes that the government did not also bother to create the climate nor the necessary machinery for implementation. Land rights She writes how the former agrestic slaves and traditional agricultural labour of Kerala had to wait for nearly a century before they could attain proprietary rights over the sites on which their huts were built, through land reform measures.  The writer has made use of a wealth of source materials, including administrative reports, writings by British officers, travellers and church mission records of the 1800s and 1900s.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-landmark-study-gets-new-edition/article35673503.ece

Earlier, the State had reduced the inter-dosage interval of vaccine to accommodate the interests of those going abroad.

Now the focus will be the time-bound completion of the second tunnel. The Chief Minister will convene a meeting in this regard soon,” the Minister said. Wildlife sanctuary The tunnel road at Kuthiran, a mountainous terrain in Peechi-Vazhani wildlife sanctuary, was planned during the widening of the Mannuthy-Wadakkanchery Highway to six-lane, to protect around 30 hectare of reserve forest. The 992-m tunnel was constructed at a cost of Rs. 200 crore. “It’s the result of years of protests and legal struggles,” said Adv. Shaji Kodenkandath, who has been in the forefront of legal battles for almost six years against the delay in completion of the tunnel. He filed a petition in 2015, against the unscientific construction work, which failed to maintain any safety rules. The High Court registered cases against National Highway Authority of India and the contract company in his petition citing the death toll in the frequent accidents on the battered road on the highway. He once again moved the court in 2020 demanding immediate opening of the tunnel. The tunnel road will help to ease the traffic block on the Palakkad-Thrissur national highway to a great extent. It will reduce the running time between Coimbatore and Kochi.

Once colleagues in the Indian National Congress, but now in different parties – M.V. Mysoora Reddy, J.C. Prabhakar Reddy, and N. Raghuveera Reddy – have come onto the same page to protect the rights of the people of Rayalaseema over irrigation water, and are regularly in touch with apolitical people and activists working for the cause. Following the Centre’s notification, Mr. Mysoora Reddy, a former Home Minister, issued a statement calling for creation of ‘Greater Rayalaseema’ to protect its people’s rights on all issues. Later, Mr. Prabhakar Reddy met Mr. Mysoora Reddy on Tuesday and Mr. Raghuveeera Reddy on Sunday. “I am meeting people from all the political parties and apolitical activists to bring them onto a single platform. I propose to organise a roundtable in a couple of months for a board-based discussion on how to protect our rightful share in the Krishan waters,” Mr. Prabhakar Reddy told The Hindu . Mr. Prabhakar Reddy and Mr. Raghuveera Reddy met at Neelakantapuram in Anantapur district for five hours discussing the water projects. The Nandyal-based Rayalaseema Saaguneeti Sadhana Samithi has been fighting for the water rights of the region for the last seven years. In July, it had conducted meetings in Nandyal, Kadapa, Tirupati, and Puttaparthi. It proposes to conduct a meeting in Kurnool soon. “We have been inviting political leaders, engineers, activists and apolitical organisations in all the districts to step up efforts in getting our rightful share of water,” said its president Bojja Dasaratharami Reddy. “While the Rayalaseema region has assured water for an ayacut of 19.82 lakh acres, it is at present getting irrigation water enough for only 7.98 lakh acres. The political parties need to focus on this,” Mr. Dasaratharami Reddy said. “The region has several ongoing projects, but none of them has been completed. We neither have sufficient reservoir capacity to store nor canals to irrigate the fields,” he observed. “The Handri-Neeva Sujala Sravanthi (HNSS), the Galeru-Nagari Sujala Sravanthi (GNSS), the Veligonda, the Somasila, and the Kandaleru projects have now no lawful right over the allocated water, as all these have been shown as ongoing in the gazette.

Criticising Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for not taking proper advice from experts in managing the finances, he said, “Welfare and development should be on an even keel so that State does not starve for funds.” “Bad finances are leading to cuts in pensions for many beneficiaries,” he alleged. “Videshi Vidya Deevena and Vidya Vasathi for the Dalits, OBCs, BCs, and the poor have been dispensed with, or stopped for quite some time, and there is no political commitment to get the Special Category Status for the State or the railway zone for Vizag,” he said. “Tinkering with the education system by introducing English medium against the worldwide norm of initial education in the mother tongue, and merging of primary classes with high schools will spell doom for the students,” Dr. Sailajanath said.

Mr. Bommai told media persons that he was going to the national capital to finalise Cabinet expansion and would carry out the exercise in the “next few days”. He is scheduled to meet Bharatiya Janata Party president J. P. Nadda on Monday, when he is expected to finalise the ministerial berths. Cabinet expansion was likely on Wednesday or Thursday, party sources said. Speculations is rife that not all berths may be filled at one go; some may be kept vacant accommodate dissenters, if any. However, a senior party leader said given that the time ahead for this dispensation is already short, the Cabinet would be expanded with one or two vacancies kept for any exigencies. While the names of Dalit leader Govind Karjol, Vokkaliga leader R. Ashok, and Valmiki leader B. Sriramulu, had reportedly been finalised for Deputy Chief Ministers’ (DCM) posts, there has been intense lobbying by several other seniors to corner the post. The party is reportedly mulling over creating another such post for the other backward classes, sources said. Mr. Bommai had earlier in the day said he was expecting a message from the party high command by Monday and would leave for Delhi over the next two days, but left for the national capital on Sunday evening, after a call from the party top brass, sources said. Before leaving for New Delhi Mr. Bommai met former Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa and reportedly discussed Cabinet expansion, sources said. It was feared that the Cabinet expansion exercise may take longer leaving Mr. Bommai as a single-man Cabinet amidst floods ravaging the State, a repeat of what Mr. Yediyurappa faced when he took charge in July 2019. However, Mr. Bommai had expressed confidence that such a situation would not be the case and he would expand the Cabinet within a week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/karnataka-cm-leaves-for-delhi-to-finalise-ministry-formation/article35672976.ece
02 August 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rising COVID cases put a dampener on Adi Krithika festivities||The decision of the authorities asking managements of Lord Subramanya Swamy temples in Chittoor district to confine the ‘Adi Krithika’ festivities to the temples, and bar public from having darshan, and also to prohibit them from trekking the hillock temples, came as a big disappointment among devotees. The decision was taken in the wake of rise in COVID-19 cases in the district from mid-July. Adi Krithika festival, which falls on August 2, usually generates a frenzied atmosphere with lakhs of devotees visiting the temple of Lord Muruga at Tiruttani in Tamil Nadu, just a few kilometres away from Nagari. The devotees, observing the ‘Kavidi’ ritual, reach Tiruttani from all over Chittoor and Nellore districts. Temples of Lord Subramanya Swamy located at Srikalahasti, Pakala, Puttur, Palamaner in Chittoor district and Tirugudu Mallam in Nellore district also witness the arrival of thousands of devotees. Having missed the festival last year due to COVID-19 lockdown, there was an air of expectation among the devotees this year that they could celebrate the occasion given the slowdown in the virus spread from mid-June onwards. But the rise in cases once again has put a dampener on their celebrations. Circle-Inspector (Nagari Urban) Maddaiah Achari said that public movement from Chittoor district towards Tiruttani was under surveillance. Meanwhile, Government whip and TUDA Chairman Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy visited the temple located near Ootlavaripalle in Pakala mandal and offered silk ‘vastram’ to the presiding deity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rising-covid-cases-put-a-dampener-on-adi-krithika-festivities/article35673139.ece

Sandhya (26) – reportedly jumped into the Vasista river, a tributary of the Godavari, along with their two children – Jaswin (4) and Bindu Sri Durga (2) – at Chinchinada in West Godavari district on Sunday. Satish, a resident of Jaggannapeta in East Godavari district, went to Kuwait in search of livelihood and returned. The family reportedly planned to visit one of their relatives in Palakol on July 30. As they could not be contacted since leaving the house, the other family members lodged a complaint with the Palakol police on the same day, said Narsapuram DSP P. Veeranjaneya Reddy. The couple, along with their children, reportedly jumped into the Vasista from Chinchinada bridge. The police have retrieved the bodies of Bindu Sri Durga and Satish and a search is on for the others, the DSP said.

02 August 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Proud of our daughter, say Sindhu’s parents||The moment of reckoning had finally arrived on Sunday when world champion P.V. Sindhu settled for a bronze in women’s singles in Tokyo Olympics, signalling an end to a 24-hour agonising wait for her family members back home here after the disappointing loss in the semifinal on Saturday. “This is the result of a lot of sacrifices and great efforts. We are proud of our daughter who faced many challenges on way to the Olympics bronze,” PV Ramana, the proud father of Sindhu, said. Tears rolled down as the proud parents Ramana and P. Vijaya struggled to control the emotions once Sindhu clinched her second consecutive Olympics medal (she won silver in 2016 Rio Games). Significantly, Sindhu, when Pradeep Raju, one of her mentors and coach at Suchitra Academy spoke to her this morning, assured that she would not return to the city without a medal. “She was very confident and determined to brush aside the loss to Tai Tzu-Ying in the semifinal on Saturday. And, this attitude was visible in Sunday’s bronze medal match,” Pradeep revealed in a chat with The Hindu . Not surprisingly, there were celebrations at Sindhu’s residence in Jubilee Hills with media and well-wishers descending there. A visibly elated Ramana gave credit to the coach Park Tae Sang, Suchitra Academy for their “great support”, especially the sparring partners from there, the Union Sports Ministry, Sports Authority of India, Government of Telangana and the Badminton Association of India for all the efforts which led to Sindhu clinching the Olympics medal. “After the semifinal loss, we were disappointed but were just hoping she would clinch the bronze. It is never easy to win any medal at that level. We are proud of her achievement as winning medals in consecutive Olympics is no joke,” Ramana said. “Celebrations will continue and how they will be, you will come to know soon,” he added.  It is never easy to win any medal at that level. We are proud of her achievement. P.V. Ramana, Father of P.V.

02 August 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Age limit for EWS employment under Central legislation enhanced||The upper age limit for employment, to be extended by the State government to economically weaker sections (EWS) under a Central legislation, has been enhanced by five years. This was decided at the Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday. On 7 January 2019, the Centre had approved a ten per cent reservation in government jobs and educational institutions for the EWS in the general category. This would be over and above the existing 50 per cent reservation for SC/ST/OBC categories extended by the State governments. The Centre also said people who had an annual gross income below Rs. 8 lakh should be identified for economic reservation. It had also informed the Supreme Court that it would be the State’s prerogative to provide ten per cent economic reservation in government jobs and admissions to educational institutions. In tune with the legislation, the Cabinet on Sunday passed a resolution sticking to the Rs. 8 lakh norm for eligibility to reservations in employment and education. The age limit was also hiked by five years. By another decision, the Cabinet decided to waive off crop loans borrowed by farmers in the range of Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 50,000 this year. The waiver would be taken up from August 15 till month-end. Due to financial constraints in the last two years due to COVID-19 pandemic, the waiver was done up to Rs. 25,000 only. It was the election promise of TRS to waive all crop loans up to Rs. 1 lakh. The meeting noted that the social security pensions in the State would increase by 6.62 lakh with the government’s decision to lower the age limit for old age pensions to 57. The facility would be available to only one member in a family. With this, the total number of social security pensions would go up to 58 lakh. The Cabinet also decided to lay foundation stones for construction of five super-speciality hospitals of the government shortly. They would be located at Warangal, chest hospital premises at Erragadda, Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences at Gachibowli, Gaddiannaram and Alwal. The meeting sanctioned a multi-super speciality hospital for workers and other poor at Patancheru. The health officials were asked to make arrangements for commencement of academic activity at seven new medical colleges next year. To meet further requirement of medical colleges in future, the officials were asked to look out for land. The meeting discussed the COVID-19 situation nationally and globally and some districts where the cases were high and the plight of children orphaned by the death of their parents due to the pandemic. Ministers K.T. Rama Rao, T. Harish Rao, P. Sabita Indra Reddy, V. Srinivas Goud, T. Srinivas Yadav, Koppula Easwar, Gangula Kamalakar, A. Indrakaran Reddy, and G.

02 August 2021||KADAPA,ANDHRA PRADESH||B.Tech dropout who ‘trapped’ 300 women arrested||The police on Sunday arrested a B.Tech dropout on charges of extorting money from around 300 girls and women by blackmailing them over compromising photographs and videos, after befriending them in person and online. The accused, identified as C. Prasanna Kumar (23), hailing from Proddatur town, allegedly trapped 200 girls and 100 middle-aged women from Hyderabad, Vijayawada and Kadapa, the police said. Even as no victim lodged complaint yet, an investigation into the house-breaking and chain-snatching cases pending against him led the police to the modus operandi. “Prasanna Kumar, addicted to many vices, resorted to trap girls and women to make quick bucks to fund his lifestyle. He allegedly befriend the victims and lured them into sexual relationship. He would blackmail them over the compromised photographs and videos, and extort money,” said Kadapa Town Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) B. Sunil Kumar, adding that the accused had been following the modus operandi since 2017.

02 August 2021||Kochi,ANDHRA PRADESH||Row over Lakshadweep beach villa plan||Ignoring what marine biologists have warned of as a serious “developmental misstep”, the Lakshadweep administration is pressing ahead with plans to construct beach and lagoon villas on three islands of the Union Territory with its fragile coral ecosystem. A tender notice inviting proposals from developers for building 370 villas using the design, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT) model on public-private partnership (PPP) basis on Minicoy, Kadmat and Suheli islands was issued by District Collector S. Asker Ali, in his capacity as managing director of the Society for Promotion of Nature Tourism and Sports (SPORTS), on July 31. September 2 is the last date for submission of proposals. A group of concerned scientists and researchers had petitioned the administration early last year detailing why the NITI Aayog-led project will be ecologically disastrous and socio-economically ill-considered. Lagoons as insurance “The lagoon is a vital ‘insurance site’ protecting the islands’ land and freshwater supply. Lagoon coral patches are temperature-adapted and serve as refugia for climate-disturbed outer reefs in Lakshadweep. The planned lagoon development will destroy, permanently modify and pollute large areas of the lagoon and its ecosystems,” the petitioners said. The beaches being cultural and ecological spaces for the islanders, the project would be detrimental to the interests of the local community as well, they argued. “Apart from being vital as nesting sites for several species of turtle, it is a multi-use environment for fish processing, copra processing, boat landing, fish sale, recreation and other critical social functions. Having access to the beach is critical to island life. Even beaches on uninhabited islands like Suheli are heavily used through the fair season for fish processing,” the scientists pointed out. 75-year rights According to the tender notice and draft concession agreement, the plan is to award to the successful bidder exclusive rights over 8.54 hectares of land and 6 hectares of lagoon on Minicoy; 5.557 hectares of land and 6 hectares of lagoon on Kadmat; and 3.823 hectares of land and 6 hectares of lagoon on Suheli island; for a period of 75 years to build and operate these villas. The proposed built-up area for the luxury project in Minicoy will be 13,702.5 sq metres on land (110 beach villas) and 5,020 sq metre (40 floating villas) on the lagoon; in Kadmat it will be 10,823 sq metre area on land (75 beach villas) and 4,500 sq metre (35 floating villas) on water; and in Suheli 9,945 sq metre on land (60 beach villas) and 6,300 sq metre (50 floating villas) on water. The project is estimated to cost about Rs. 806 crore. While there was earlier talk of 80% of employment in the project going to the local community, the documents only mention in passing that the “concessionaire shall make necessary efforts to employ locals to the extent possible ”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/row-over-lakshadweep-beach-villa-plan/article35672971.ece

02 August 2021||NALGONDA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Nagarjunasagar crest gates lifted||Fourteen of the total 26 crest gates of the Nagarjunasagar Project were lifted on Sunday evening as discharge from Srisailam Project nearly brimmed the 590-foot reservoir. Officials earlier had estimated the gate operation to take place on Monday, reportedly in the presence of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. However, with close to 5 lakh cusecs of water being received, project officials decided to operate the gates at around 6 p.m. Superintending Engineer Dharma Naik initially operated four of the gates and gradually 10 others were lifted to discharge about 1.30 lakh cusecs into the downstream Pulichintala Project and the Krishna delta. Mr. Naik said maintenance on all the gates was completed and the operation was smooth. The gates operation, with reference to previous years, is recorded early now. In 2019, with bountiful rains, all the 26 gates were lifted on August 12, a first since 2009. And the last year too, the gates were operated on August 20. Prior to operating the gates, officials along with local leaders were also alerted to follow the Chief Minister’s instructions to release water to the ayacut through the left canal. Local legislator Nomula Bhagat, MP B. Lingaiah Yadav and Irrigation officials participated in prayers at the canal’s head regulator before switching on the motors on Sunday. Later, showering flowers and clothes to the water as a custom, the leaders said Telangana was blessed with bountiful rains every year since 2014, making irrigation to the ayacut possible for the two crop seasons. Officials said that water release from the project will continue till all the major reservoirs and distributaries in the ayacut of Nalgonda and Khammam districts are filled, and as per the schedule the On-Off method will be followed between respective phases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/nagarjunasagar-crest-gates-lifted/article35672985.ece

02 August 2021||Ongole,ANDHRA PRADESH||Ancient Tamil inscription found at temple near Chirala||A 14th century Tamil inscription of the Kakatiyas has been found at Motupalli village near Chirala in Prakasam district. Dr. E. Siva Nagireddy, archaeologist and CEO of Pleach India Foundation, said it was curious that the Kakatiyas, who were ruling the present Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, came out with inscriptions both in Tamil and Telugu. The residents were also mainly Tamil-speaking then. Dr. Nagireddy, along with R. Dasarathareddy Reddy, president of Motupalli Heritage Society, chanced upon the inscription while documenting the historic Kodanda Ramaswamy temple located on the outskirts of Motupalli, an important port of call on the east coast during the medieval period. It is also interesting to note that Motupalli was known as Desi Uyyakondapatnam and the inscription slab was fitted on the west side wall of the temple during the 16 th century AD during renovation. The inscription has been written in Tamil language and Tamil and Grandha scripts. It dates back to Saka 1230 (August 1, 1308 CE), Kilaka, Vaisaka, Su. 10, Wednesday, pertaining to the reign of Kakatiya Rudra Deva II (1289-1323). It registers the gift of land as Tiruvidaiyattam for providing offerings to the God Raja Narayana Perumal at Desiuyyakondanpattinam by Cattanthai-Cemmanadiyal-Valumpothalakiyan alias Patinenbhumi-Vanikaratittan, for the merit of the king. This was confirmed by Dr. K. Muniratnam Reddy, Director, Epigraphy branch, Archaeological Survey of India, Mysuru who deciphered the 813-year-old Tamil Grandha script and revealed the historical importance of the content. The gift of land was given for the conduct of ‘Tiruvidaiyattam’ festival in the medieval temple for the merit of the last Kakatiya Emperor, Prataparudra . The inscription bears significance as it is the second and next to one more Tamil inscription found at Motupalli issued by Kakatiya Ganapatideva dating back to 1244 AD. The 'Abhaya Sasana', a charter that insures the life and goods of the sea-borne traders. He sensitised the local people on Sunday on the historical significance of the inscription. It was high time that the State government protected the inscription for posterity, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ancient-tamil-inscription-found-at-temple-near-chirala/article35673142.ece
02 August 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Seelam urges Pawan to sail with Congress||Describing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as a ‘communal party’, All India Congress Committee secretary J.D. Seelam on Sunday made a plea to the Jana Sena Party (JSP) president Pawan Kalyan to snap ties with the ruling party at the Centre and join hands with the Congress. Addressing the media here, the former Union Minister said the JSP chief should realise the Congress alone could protect the nation from the ‘divisive politics’ at a time when political realignment is on the cards to bolster the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). Opining that all sections of the society were upset the Narendra Modi government, Mr. Seelam said the controversial farm laws, unprecedented rise in prices of essential commodities and privatisation of the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) would be the ‘political Waterloo’ for the BJP. He said the Mr. Kalyan should strengthen the hands of the Congress. All the promises made to Andhra Pradesh on eve of the bifurcation including the Special category Status (SCS) will be fulfilled only if the Congress returns to power at the Centre and in the State. Alleging that the YSRCP government in the State was ‘competing with the NDA government in implementing anti-people policies’, Mr. Seelam gave a call to all former Congressmen in the YSR Congress Party to return to its fold.

02 August 2021||PATHANAMTHITTA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Sabarimala prasadam rates likely to go up||Hit hard by the COVID-19 induced lockdown that has been extended in different phases, the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) looks to revise the rates for offerings in the temples governed by it. According to officials, the special committee led by the TDB Commissioner has kickstarted the procedure for revising the rates for various offerings, which will come into effect upon receiving a nod from the Kerala High Court. The proposal, which follows a move by the Board to sell out its excess stock of utensils and vessels, envisages an upward revision of these rates by Rs. 5 to Rs. 20. Confirming the proposal, TDB president N. Vasu, meanwhile, said that it had nothing to do with the financial crisis experienced by the agency but aimed to account for the actual rates of materials used in these offerings. “It has been almost five years since we effected a rate hike while the cost of materials has gone up so much over the period,” he said. As to the extent by which the prices will go up, he said it was too premature to comment as the matter was still under consideration of the HC appointed committee. Official sources, however, said the rate hike was part of an action plan by the TDB to bridge an ever- widening gap between its revenue and expenditure. “A hike in the rate of offerings such as Aravana and Appam in Sabarimala, which are expected to go up by Rs. 20 and Rs. 15 respectively, will help offset the mounting losses due to a decline in footfall,” pointed out a senior official. The restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 disrupted the TDB’s economic model as it has suffered a loss of over Rs. 600 crore since March last year. The income from Sabarimala, which used to be the board's mainstay for long fell to Rs. 21 crore during the last pilgrimage season as against Rs. 270 crore in the previous year. With the uncertainty over the length of the pandemic-induced disruptions exacerbating the fears of a financial disaster, the Board is exploring ways to diversify its finances while rationalizing the expenditure by cutting down new vacancies. Aid from State During the previous fiscal, the TDB received a financial assistance of Rs. 90 crore from the State government. In July this year, it received yet another tranche of Rs. 10 crore from the State.  Sources say the rate hike is part of an action plan by the TDB to bridge an ever-widening gap between its revenue and expenditure||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sabarimala-prasadam-rates-likely-to-go-up/article35672987.ece
02 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Hospitalised cases show a rise in Kerala||The increase in COVID-19 cases in Tamil Nadu since Thursday has been accompanied by a marginal rise in the test positivity rate (TPR). The fact that the TPR has been witnessing an increasing trend, albeit marginally, despite a noticeable increase in the number of tests, has highlighted the need to be alert about the possibility of a rapid increase in cases in the coming days. While the number of people tested per day stayed at an average of around 1.42 lakh the week before, it gradually increased to 1.55 lakh on Wednesday. Since then, the TPR has increased from 1.1% to 1.3% on Sunday, accompanied by an increase in cases from 1,756 on Wednesday to 1,990 on Sunday. In the delta region, the TPR went up from 1.3% to 1.7% between Wednesday and Saturday. The western region witnessed an increase in the TPR from 1.6% to 1.8%, and the northern region from 1% to 1.1%. In terms of daily cases, the delta region saw a spike from 279 cases on Wednesday to 369 on Sunday. In the same period, cases reported in the western region increased from 654 to 758. Cases in the northern region increased from 651 on Wednesday to 707 on Saturday before falling to 686 on Sunday, possibly due to a drop in testing. Kerala on Sunday registered 20,728 new COVID-19 cases with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 12.14%. On Sunday, Karnataka’s Dakshina Kannada district recorded 410 new cases, the highest among all districts, including Bengaluru Urban. An official statement said Bengaluru Urban added 409 cases.

02 August 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tirupati to get greener with electric auto-rickshaws||The temple city of Tirupati is all set to become greener with reduced emissions, thanks to the initiative of New and Renewable Energy Development Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (NREDCAP) to convert the vehicles operated by petroleum products with electric vehicles (EV). As part of the ‘Go Electric’ campaign, the EV technology will be adopted to provide four-wheelers, three-wheelers, two-wheelers and charging infrastructure. As the first step, the fuel-operated auto-rickshaws are converted into electric vehicles by retrofitting them with batteries, apart from launching a swapping station. “The technology will be adopted for 200 auto-rickshaws and 20 swapping stations will be opened in Tirupati as a pilot project,” said NREDCAP Vice-Chairman and Managing Director S. Ramana Reddy on Sunday. Along with NREDCAP General Manager C.B. Jagadeeswara Reddy and OSD Ramanjaneya Reddy, Mr. Ramana Reddy attended a demonstration on the performance of auto-rickshaws retrofitted with batteries. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), a union Government initiative, has come forward to meet the cost of the retrofit kit and swapping stations established by battery manufacturers. “NREDCAP has been in the process of identifying prospective manufacturers of retrofit kits, studying their proposals and testing their performance. The response from auto-rickshaw union leaders, fleet operators and even passengers is encouraging,” Mr. Ramana Reddy told reporters. At the macro-level, training would be imparted to rural automobile mechanics and ITI students on handling electric vehicles. Though the initial conversion cost is one-third of the vehicle, the operating expenditure is just half of what used to be in fossil fuel-based vehicle, resulting in savings of Rs. 1.95 per km for drivers, Mr. Jagadeeswara Reddy explained. Similarly, one lakh EV-based two-wheelers would be supplied to government employees, offering them the benefit of subsidy as well as EMI basis. “On the environmental front, the conversion is similar to planting 22812 trees required to absorb the 456 tonnes of CO2 emitted by 100 auto-rickshaws in a year,” Mr. Ramana Reddy concluded. Based on the Tirupati experiment, 100 each retrofit kits would be extended to Visakhapatnam, Rajamahendravaram and Eluru cities.

Shreyas Samir Parkhie and Shubhra Singhal, graduate students from IISER Tirupati, along with Kumaresh Krishnan, an MCO graduate from Harvard University, won the Seed for Change Grant of $10,000 from The Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute at Harvard. The grant will be used to actualise their project INDIA EATS, an acronym for India Eradicating Anaemia Through Spirulina. Though 40% of the Indian population experiences anaemia, the high cost of supplements is a major impediment in addressing the issue. The brainstorming session conducted between the institutes churned up a number of factors, from which spirulina finally emerged as a viable solution. A member of the algae family, spirulina is rich in iron and has already been shown to be a better supplement than the conventional iron and folic acid tablets being used as a standard treatment for anaemia. Studies have also shown that spirulina increases haemoglobin levels among adolescents, children and pregnant women. “This is a project that can contribute a lot to Indian society, especially rural women who are prone to anaemia. Shubra and Shreyas were motivated in socially relevant projects right from the beginning at IISER,” observes Vasudharani Devanathan, an IISER academic who introduced them to Kumaresh and mentored them along with Venkatesh Murthy, a faculty member from Harvard. Shubra and Shreyas are elated at the sanction of the project. On growing the algae at a minimal cost, the team is contemplating to use industrial waste. “Previous studies have shown that spirulina can be grown in minimally-treated waste water and enriched with iron. This could help solve two problems in one go,” adds Dr. Vasudharani. The India EATS team nurtures a plan to form partnerships with NGOs to spread awareness about the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/iiser-students-collaborating-with-harvard-to-fight-anaemia/article35673640.ece
02 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Move to enrol tribal children in schools||The Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (APTWREIS) has embarked on a drive to bring children belonging to the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) into the school fold. In an attempt to enrol students from this group in the exclusive 10 PVTG schools with a capacity to accommodate 640 students in each of them, the Society secretary K. Srikanth Prabhakar has kicked off a campaign, going around their remote habitations and educating the elders and children on the several benefits of enrolling at these chools. Skill development He distributes brochures which speak in detail about the benefits the students are given such as cosmetic allowance, school kits under Jagananna Vidya Kanuka scheme, the financial assistance under Amma Vodi, vocational education, skill development, yoga, the chance to explore new ideas in the Centrally-sponsored Atal Tinkering Labs, training in self-defence techniques and coaching in English-speaking skills. A plan was drawn and groups were formed among principals and teachers to organise awareness programmes at public places in strict adherence to COVID protocols. Mr. Prabhakar claimed tremendous response to the campaign. Realising that some of them were unable to utilise the opportunities due to non-availability of Aadhaar cards, Mr. Prabhakar organised Aadhaar camps at Somasila, Buchireddipalem, Kavali, Sarvepalli, Kodavaluru ST Yanadi Colony in Chejerla village and Gollapudi ST Colony among a few other places on Saturday and Sunday. “The objective of these camps is to pave the way for the seamless admission of these children to schools,” he said. The PVTGs constitute the most vulnerable section among tribal people who inhabit isolated, remote and difficult areas in small and scattered hamlets. “We are hopeful that the government interventions will soon have a visible impact on their social and economic lives leading to an improved life,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/move-to-enrol-tribal-children-in-schools/article35673637.ece
02 August 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||New technology to help farm motors save electricity||In an attempt to introduce Permanent Magnet Brushless Direct Current (PMBLDC) technology in farm motors which would help farmers save energy, the Andhra Pradesh State Energy Efficiency Development Corporation Limited (AP-SEEDCO) signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Andhra University (AU) for preparing the design document, evolving manufacturing protocols as per industry standards, operational manual and developing a working model for demonstration of the technology. APSEEDCO Chief Executive Officer A. Chandra Sekhar Reddy, in a press release, said the PMBLDC technology improves the motor efficiency up to 90% when compared to the existing 75% achieved with induction technology. The life expectancy of the system is around 15 to 20 years as high- grade materials are used in it when compared to the conventional AC motor whose life span is around 10 years. The PMBLDC technology can be used for domestic pumping, in compressors of air conditioners (AC), refrigerators, washing machines, electric vehicles and etc. In a webinar conducted on the occasion by the AU on the PMBLDC technology on Sunday, Minister for Energy, Environment, Forest, and Science & Technology Balineni Srinivasa Reddy said the government was keen on providing quality power to the farm sector.

02 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||New parallel taxi track at Vizag airport ready for operation||The mandatory procedures for commissioning of the new parallel taxi track- N5 - at Visakhapatnam International Airport have been completed and it is ready for operation. Though it has already been notified in the Aeronautical Information Publication(AIP), a formal commissioning is awaited. The Airports Authority of India(AAI) had spent Rs. 23 crore on construction of N 5 and six additional parking bays at the airport. A total of 12 big aircraft can be parked at the airport now. In addition to this, four smaller aircraft can also be parked at the old terminal building. These facilitates parking for airlines operating late in the night and for early morning departures from the city. Once N 5 is commissioned it will help in increasing the number of flight movements by two an hour. Though the construction of N 5 taxi track was completed sometime in November 2019, it could not be commissioned immediately as there were several procedural issues to be followed. These included safety inspections by various agencies and sending information on the new taxi track to airports across the globe. The subsequent lockdown and restrictions on movement of flights due to COVID-19 resulted in further delays. “We are planning for the inauguration of N 5 by August 16. We have invited Visakhapatnam MP and the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Eastern Naval Command (ENC) for the launch,” said Airport Director K. Srinivasa Rao. The aircraft can start using the N 5 taxi track to reach the parking bays. The ‘L’ shaped N 5 track facilitates quick movement of the aircraft to the parking bays. The existing N 3 and N 4 are located perpendicular to the runway. On commissioning of N 5, the operational efficiency of the airport would improve considerably. The flight movements, which were 80 a day, before the lockdown, dropped drastically before picking up steadily after the easing of restrictions. The number of flight movements is now 46. Once N 5 becomes operational, the flight movements can be increased up to 120 a day. “The expansion of the terminal building is in the final stages and we expect it to be completed by September-end,” Mr. Srinivasa Rao added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/new-parallel-taxi-track-at-vizag-airport-ready-for-operation/article35673707.ece
02 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Murder politics started again in Seema, says BJP||BJP State general secretary S. Vishnu Vardhan Reddy has alleged that ‘murder politics’ have once again started in Rayalaseema and it has shown an increasing trend after the YSR Congress Party government came to power in the State. Addressing the media here on Sunday, he said the BJP was opposed to it. He alleged that seven persons were attacked with knives when some YSRCP leaders joined the BJP and added that the victims were in a critical condition in hospital. Mr. Vishnu Vardhan Reddy alleged that Proddatur MLA Rachamallu Siva Prasad Reddy wanted to erect a statue of Tipu Sultan in the town to which the BJP leaders were opposed, . He alleged that the MLA had organised a press conference and made sarcastic comments on the BJP leaders and described the BJP as a ‘communal party’. Mr. Vishnuvardhan Reddy wanted to know whether the Proddatur MLA was ready to seek a CBI inquiry into the case relating to murder of TDP leader Nandam Subbaiah. He wondered as to why no charge sheet was filed in the case so far. The BJP general secretary asked whether it was not true that the followers of the MLA were indulging in illegal activities by misusing his name. Mr. Vishnuvardhan Reddy sought to know whether the MLA was prepared to take an oath at the Kanipakam temple in this regard. Mr. Vishnuvardhan Reddy said that during his 22 years of service in the BJP, he had never indulged in any corrupt activities and was ready to take an oath in public to disprove the allegations made against him by the MLA.

02 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Trade unions slam Centre over privatisation of steel plant||All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) State president R. Ravindranath and Visakha All Party trade unions, people’s organisations Joint Action Committee (JAC) chairman M. Jaggu Naidu have warned that the Union government has to pay a price for putting up the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) and other public sector units (PSUs) for sale. A rally was taken out under the auspices of the JAC from the DRM Office Junction to the Gandhi statue near the GVMC. The rally concluded in a meeting. Addressing the participants in the meeting, they said that VSP was achieved after 32 persons had sacrificed their lives, 22,000 acres of land was given by farmers of 64 villages, 64 peoples representatives had resigned from their posts and students and general public participated in prolonged agitations. They alleged that the BJP was under the impression that it could do anything as it has the required numbers in Parliament. The Union government, which has put up the VSP for sale on the plea of losses, was also privatising LIC, Railways and other PSUs, which were making profits, they alleged. The corporatisation of defence establishments would jeopardise the security of the nation. The government was not even heeding the advice of defence experts and threatening defence employees to implement the Essential Defence Services Ordinance (EDSO), if they went on a strike, they alleged. The trade union leaders urged all MPs and MLAs in the State, irrespective of their political affiliations, to exert pressure on the Centre against privatisation of the VSP. Mayor lauded They thanked the Mayor and corporators for deciding to stage a protest near the Gandhi statue on August 2 to express solidarity with the steel workers and against the decision of the Centre.

02 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Smoking raises risk of lung cancer: expert||Lung cancer continues to be one of the most common cancers worldwide, claiming more lives every year than breast, colon and prostate cancers combined. It is estimated that lung cancer accounts for nearly one in five cancer deaths, accounting for 2.1 million deaths, globally every year. Lung cancers account for 12.8% of cancer cases and 17.8% of mortalities of cancer worldwide. Lung cancer is a preventable disease. Smoking increases the risk of lung cancer by 24-36 times. The risk is 3.5% in passive smoking, says Dr. Raghunadha Rao, chief consultant medical oncologist, KIMS ICON Hospital, Visakhapatnam. Exposure to second-hand smoke also increases the risk in non-smokers. The other risks include: air pollution, previous radiation therapy, exposure to radon gas, exposure to asbestos and other carcinogens. Workplace exposure to asbestos and other substances known to cause cancer — such as arsenic, chromium and nickel — can increase your risk of developing lung cancer, especially if one is a smoker. Lung cancer typically doesn't cause signs and symptoms in its early stages as they typically occur when the disease is at an advanced stage. The symptoms include persistent cough that doesn’t go away, coughing up blood, shortness of breath, chest pain, hoarseness of voice, losing weight, bone pain and headache. The two general type of lung cancers are small cell and non-small cell lung cancers. The small cell cancer occurs almost exclusively in heavy smokers and is less common than non-small cell lung cancer. The non-small cell lung cancers include squamous cell carcinoma, adeno carcinoma and large cell carcinoma. People with an increased risk of lung cancer may consider annual lung cancer screening, using low-dose CT scan. An X-Ray chest, CT chest or sputum cytology is advised depending on symptoms. Tissue biopsy is required for diagnosis confirmation and identifying of cancer, says Dr. Raghunadha Rao. The treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Quitting smoking reduces the risk of lung cancer, even if one had smoked for years. Options include nicotine replacement products, medications and support groups. One should also avoid second hand smoke and air pollution. A diet full of fruits and vegetables and daily exercise would also help, Dr. Raghunadha Rao added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/smoking-raises-risk-of-lung-cancer-expert/article35673699.ece

02 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||State caseload in July reduces by half||New COVID-19 cases in Telangana are on a steady decline, going by the data of the past few months. However, when compared to the first wave, the number of infections and deaths is considerably high. Around 1.34 lakh cases each were recorded in April and May this year when the second wave was at its peak. This was the time when people were struggling to find a hospital bed and desperate requests for oxygen cylinders were flooding social media platforms. A decline in cases was noted towards the end of June with the month seeing a little over 45,000 infections. In July, the number dropped to more than half. In case of deaths, the highest of 969 coronavirus patients succumbed in May. Though the fatality rate gradually dropped, at least two persons with the infection died every day in July. While both cases and deaths are showing a downward trend, some events which might lead to the third wave of the pandemic are active. Large scale celebrations, festival gatherings and political events are currently being held. A high number of people not maintaining COVID-appropriate behaviour poses a risk. Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao on Saturday said that even people who have tested positive for coronavirus are stepping out of home. Currently, around 650 people are detected with the virus on a daily average in Telangana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-caseload-in-july-reduces-by-half/article35673472.ece
02 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Teething problems continue to haunt Dharani transactions||Teething problems continue to haunt transactions in the Dharani portal, the online system introduced to reduce human interface in land transactions for making them transparent. Transactions related to assigned land in particular are hit by several problems. One such is assigned land registered under the Assignment Lands (Prohibition of Transfer) Act 1977 facing multiple assignments of the same land to several beneficiaries. According to officials, beneficiaries were given pattas during assignment drives at different points of time in the past without actually giving possession of land. Same land had been assigned to different beneficiaries during these drives. In cases where possession was given, land located in a particular area had been assigned to eligible beneficiaries while its location in the records bore a different survey number. Another typical problem encountered by the officials concerned in the agency areas is the operation of two legislations – Land Assignment (Prohibition of Transfer) Act and Land Transaction Regulation Act of 1970 popularly known as LTR 1/70 Act banning land transactions in agency areas between tribals and non-tribals and non-tribals and non-tribals. Senior officials said that transactions relating to assigned lands were accompanied by legacy issues. Assignment lands have been set in “limited auto lock mode” in Dharani portal wherein eligible beneficiaries could apply for only succession rights. “These lands falling under the PoT Act of 1977 are heritable not alienable. Only succession is permitted in respect of these lands not sale or gift,” a senior official told The Hindu . A specific module relating to succession has been incorporated in Dharani portal and applying through this portal will ensure that the transaction is carried out without any hassles. Succession certificates have been issued to few thousands of eligible beneficiaries who submitted their applications through the succession module. The Registration department had focused on addressing the legacy issues and Collectors had been directed to concentrate on attending the complaints as and when they are received. “There are certain problems, but these are not on account of Dharani portal,” the official asserted, adding steps are underway to ensure that these issues did not recur in the coming days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/teething-problems-continue-to-haunt-dharani-transactions/article35673454.ece

Around 2.2 crore people in the State are eligible for the vaccination. Of them, 1.12 crore have received their first dose of vaccine and only 30% of those beneficiaries have taken their second dose too. Health officials said their focus in the next one to two weeks will be on ensuring the second dose is completed. This marks a shift in the Health department’s priority. Around the beginning of July, Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao said that they wish to vaccinate maximum number of people with first dose. It was for this reason that the time interval between the two doses of Covishield was increased from 12-16 weeks to 14-16 weeks in Telangana. The vaccine coverage statistics till July 7 indicate that out of the 1.01 crore people who have received the first dose, 47.86% were from three urban districts — Hyderabad, Rangareddy and Medchal-Malkajgiri. Of the 22.32 lakh people who were awaiting their second dose of Covishield, 12.32 lakh were given the jab to complete the vaccination. Around 3.9 lakh people are yet to receive their second dose of Covaxin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/states-unvaccinated-population-over-1-cr/article35673474.ece

Vinod Kumar has stated that the Dalit Bandhu scheme was not new but was announced on the floor of the Assembly by CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao during the Budget session that allocated Rs. 1,000 crore for the purpose. It was conceptualised more than six months ago and the strategy and implementation were being worked out for the last few weeks, Mr. Vinod Kumar said here on Sunday, speaking at an awareness meeting for artistes of the Samskrutika Sarathi programme. He mentioned that the scheme was designed for comprehensive economic and social upliftment of Dalits. Responding to the Opposition criticism that it was announced keeping in mind the impending by-election to Huzurabad Assembly seat, Mr. Vinod Kumar said it was announced as Dalit empowerment during the Budget session but had taken time to take it forward towards implementation due to the COVID crisis. Huzurabad was chosen for launching the scheme as the CM has a special affection for Karimnagar, from where he had launched Rythu Bandhu. He stated that there was no scope for any politics and everyone should look for merits. Chairman of Samskrutika Sarathi and MLA Rasamayi Balakishan, MLC and poet Goreti Venkanna, and director of Cultural Affairs Mamidi Harikrishna participated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/dalit-bandhu-announced-in-budget-session-itself/article35673486.ece

02 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Muslim Women’s Rights Day a deception: Owaisi||All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen President Asaduddin Owaisi exuded confidence in making headway in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly polls even as he criticised Muslim Women’s Rights Day celebrations on August 1 as ‘betrayal’ and ‘deception’. The Muslim Women’s Rights Day corresponds to the day Parliament passed The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill and it became an Act. It is popularly known as the triple talaq law. Criticising the celebrations as ‘optics’, Mr Owaisi told mediapersons, “Crores of Muslim women have signed documents against this bill, and said they reject it. The burden of proof is on women. In this country, if you want to make a law, I say that the Modi government should make one against desertion of women”. The Hyderabad MP questioned why only Muslim Women Rights Day was being celebrated and whether women from the Hindu, Dalit and OBC communities have been empowered. He also underscored the low literacy rate among Muslim women and said issuing scholarships to those belonging to the community should be demand-driven. Mr Owaisi also spoke about the struggle for justice of women such as Fatima Nafees, mother of Jawaharlal Nehru University student Najeeb Ahmed, who went missing in 2016. Fielding questions on the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, Mr Owaisi said the Bharatiya Janata Party is ‘not in good shape’ in that State. He alleged that the party had mishandled the second COVID-19 wave, and added that there was rampant unemployment there. “This time, we are with Om Prakash Rajbhar’s alliance. Our party president (in Uttar Pradesh) Shaukat and Asim Waqar have strengthened, and continue to strengthen the organisation. We are certain that this time the people of Uttar Pradesh, through their prayers and blessings, will vote for our candidates and make them successful,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/muslim-womens-rights-day-a-deception-owaisi/article35673484.ece

02 August 2021||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Officials unwilling to reveal R&R plots’ allotment list||The episode of suspension of Head Master of a Zilla Parishad High School, B. Srinivas Rao, for falsely claiming Rehabilitation and Resettlement benefits for his son by indulging in impersonation has raised many an eyebrow. The big question now is how many such cases might have taken place and how many of them are yet to come to the notice of authorities or local residents. Mr. Srinivas Rao was a native of Vemulaghat, one of the villages getting submerged under Mallannasagar and working as a headmaster. Collector P. Venkatarami Reddy suspended Mr. Srinivas Rao on the grounds that he has wrongly claimed R&R benefits for his son by having someone else impersonate him. The residents of Vemulaghat and other submergence villages had flagged the possibility of such claims by ineligible persons and had consistently been demanding that the officials make public the list of beneficiaries of the Relief and Rehabilitation package. They had moved the High Court and got an order directing the officials to hand over a copy of the list of beneficiaries to the petitioners. The interesting part is that the officials preferred to pay a penalty imposed by the High Court rather than reveal the list of persons displaced by the project who were being allotted house sites as part of the R&R package. A group of oustees from submerging villages — S. Ashok, Ch. Umma Reddy and T. Ramesh — filed petitions in the High Court seeking details of beneficiaries of plots under R&R as the local level officials failed to respond under Right to Information Act (RTI). On April 20, 2021, the High Court gave six weeks time to Siddipet RDO and directed him to provide the details or pay Rs. 10,000 from his salary towards costs to the Telangana High Court Advocates’ Association. As the RDO had failed to provide the list by the due date, on July 13, the High Court directed Siddipet RDO Ananth Reddy to deposit Rs. 20,000 in favour of the Telangana High Court Advocates’ Association. “Mr. Ananth Reddy was present. He apologised for non-compliance of this court order to provide the documents sought by petitioner. He seeks a further period of 15 days to comply with the said order. Earlier also the court has granted time. As a final opportunity, this court grants further time of two weeks subject to the condition that Mr. Ananth Reddy shall deposit Rs. 20,000 in favour of the Telangana High Court Advocates’ Association and file proof of payment before the next date of hearing. It is made clear that no further time will be granted. List on 27.07.2021,” read the Court order on July 13, 2021, in cases filed by both S. Ashok and T. Ramesh. The RDO has deposited Rs. 30,000 for three writ petitions as directed by the Telangana High Court and informed this in the affidavit filed before the High Court. Mr. Anantha Reddy told The Hindu that he has forwarded the information in the case related to Ch. Umma Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/officials-unwilling-to-reveal-rr-plot-allotment-list/article35673493.ece

However, flex posters have come up at a few places in Bhongir Assembly constituency recently with a ‘unique’ message, a message seeking the resignation of sitting TRS legislator Pylla Shekhar Reddy alleging that he has miserably failed as an MLA, particularly in keeping promises made to his constituents. The flex posters, which have become head-turners, have been arranged by BJP leader Gudur Narayan Reddy. Through the posters, Mr. Narayan Reddy has asked the sitting legislator to quit and seek fresh mandate stating that he had lost the people’s mandate.   MLAs of different parties and the ruling TRS in particular are said to be nervous these days following the developments related to Huzurabad constituency, set for a byelection. The nervousness is not without reason. The State government showered several sops on Huzurabad constituency, where the bypoll has become a prestige issue for the ruling and Opposition parties, including the Dalit Bandhu scheme. MLAs are said to be under pressure from some quarters to resign so that similar benefits accrue to their respective constituencies too. Members of Opposition parties are staging dharnas demanding resignation of MLAs of their constituencies.   Coming back to Huzurabad, doubts are being expressed over the conduct of the byelection to Huzurabad constituency that fell vacant following resignation of sitting member Eatala Rajender. The State government addressed a communication to the Election Commission to put on hold the elections to Legislative Council where six seats fell vacant after members completed their tenure on the ground that the COVID pandemic is still not over. This has resulted in a debate in political circles as to whether the same yardstick will be applied to Huzurabad bypoll. The talk gained ground amid reports of increasing COVID cases in Warangal and Karimnagar districts in the past few days.   Many would often wonder about the wealth politicians amassed on enjoying power. But, most of the properties were Benami to escape the eye of rivals. In their quest to dig into the assets of leaders belonging to the ruling TRS, the rivals have deployed drones to beam pictures of such properties. This has happened to Ministers K.T. Rama Rao and G. Jagdish Reddy in the past. Now, Congress MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy raked up the issue again highlighting the building under construction by Mr. Jagdish Reddy at his native village Nagarm in Suryapet district. He said it was bigger than even the Pragathi Bhavan. Not stopping at that, he said Mr. Reddy rose up from a position where he did not even own a scooter. Whereas, Mr. Reddy said he continued to live in a rented house in Nalgonda despite being in politics for three decades.  (B. Chandrashekhar, M. Rajeev and N.

Unauthorised religious structures, often thinly disguised cases of land grab, had sprung up on public and private land obstructing roads and putting residents to inconvenience. Unfortunately, local political interests and ‘religious sentiments’ are standing in the way of removal of such structures as was evident in the report on a park being encroached in your columns. Will there be any action on this front? J.S. Acharya,  Nacharam   There is no proper drinking water supply in S.P.R.Hills, T.Anjayaa Nagar in Borabanda from last month.

T.Kailash Ditya, Barkatpura   Signboard displaying the directions at entry point of the newly launched Babu Jagjivan Ram - Balanagar flyover is creating unnecessary confusion.

The intended meaning was to show Jeedimetla’s driveway is to keep left and slide onto the service road and not to stay on the lane leading towards the Balanagar flyover. Furthermore, one must turn right, take a U-turn under the flyover, and then move left to join Jeedimetla main road. Hence, the authorities concerned must modify the signboard appropriately with clear-cut indications to avoid confusion. K.M.

02 August 2021||Mumbai,||Language of intimidation won’t be tolerated: CM||In a veiled attack on the BJP, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said the language of intimidation would not be tolerated and a befitting reply would be given to those speaking it. He made the statement in the wake of BJP legislator Prasad Lad’s reported remarks that if needed, the Shiv Sena Bhavan, the headquarters of Thackeray-led party in central Mumbai, would be demolished. However, he later retracted the remarks and expressed regret saying they were presented out of context by the media. Speaking at the inauguration of the BDD Chawls redevelopment project here, Mr. Thackeray referred to his three-party Maha Vikas Aghadi dispensation as a “triple seat” government (with the NCP and the Congress being the other constituents). Recalling a dialogue from Hindi blockbuster “ Dabangg ” — “ Thappad se dar nahi lagta (not scared of being slapped)” — the Chief Minister said, “Nobody should speak the language of slapping us as we will give back such a tight slap that the other person will not be able to get back on his feet.” Asking the beneficiaries of the chawls redevelopment project not to fall prey to allurement once the project gets over, he said, “Marathi culture must be protected in the redeveloped constructions at any cost as the chawls had a historic legacy, where revolutionaries had laid down their lives and also were witness to the Samyukta Maharashtra movement.” NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who was also present at the event, said the legacy of BDD Chawls should be protected and the Marathi-speaking people must stay back in the redeveloped houses, which would be given as part of the project being overseen by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/language-of-intimidation-wont-be-tolerated-cm/article35673366.ece

02 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Yet another year of admissions||Registrations to various undergraduate courses in Delhi University (DU) are set to begin from Monday. The online registration portal will be open till August 31 for aspirants to complete the application process. According to DU officials, the university will permit candidates applying under the ECA (extra-curricular activities) and sports categories to upload certificates from the last four years instead of the usual three, as an exception due to the pandemic. Like last year, no trials will be held and admissions under these categories will be based on certificates submitted by the candidates. Rajeev Gupta, Chairperson of DU Admissions, had earlier said: “All trial-based admissions including sports and ECA quota will be completely based on certificates this year. Students can upload certificates from last four years. This is a modification to what was done last year. For this year’s admission process, candidates can pick the three best certificates from the last four years and upload.” Mr. Gupta said that this modification was brought in to ensure that students who had missed out on participating in events last year due to the pandemic can also apply by choosing their three best certificates. Same procedure According to the university, theentire admission process will be held online and aspirants are not required to visit colleges and departments for any purpose. The admission criteria have also remained unchanged for this year, according to officials. “The admission committee has taken a conscious call to not change any eligibility criteria. Considering the unprecedented situation, the fee structure, registration and cancellation charges have also been kept the same. Colleges will also not be asking students to fill additional forms. However, colleges can collect additional data or information but that will not require extra payment,” Mr. Gupta said. Senior officials associated with the university’s online admission portal said that suitable framework had been created where aspirants can check fee structures for every college and course.  The varsity’s online portal will also have 24x7 helpdesks and Chatbots to assist students in clearing doubts and queries, officials added. “The admission branch will organise webinars and tutorial videos for aspirants. These videos will have details about the registration process and assist students to fill the application forms. Interactive and AI-based questionnaires have also been developed. All colleges and departments have been asked to appoint nodal officers, details of which will be uploaded on the website,” senior DU officials said. Apart from 13 courses for which admissions will be through DUET (Delhi University Entrance Test), admissions to all other undergraduate courses will be based on merit, the varsity had announced earlier this month. Cut-off marks Following the declaration of the CBSE XII board examinations, principals of several DU colleges and officials said that an increased number of students scoring above 95% could lead to the university having soaring cut-off marks this year. Last year, Lady Shri Ram College had an asking score of 100% for three courses – Economics, Political Science and Psychology. However, several officials also said that the cut-off marks would also depend on the number of aspirants applying to the varsity this year. Senior DU officials had also said that “better modalities” for cut-off marks would be worked out to avoid “over and under admissions.” According to the university, there are around 65,000 undergraduate seats on offer this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/yet-another-year-of-admissions/article35673353.ece
02 August 2021||New Delhi,||Ration distribution picks up pace after server glitches||After a bumpy start to the roll-out of the ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ scheme (ONORC) in Delhi, fair price shops (FPS) have distributed 87.8% of their target for July in the last 12 days, according to government data. Owners of fair price shops said that initially there were glitches in the online system, which the e-PoS (electronic point of sale) machines use, leading to queues at shops, but the system is working better now. Distribution of ration started only from July 20, as the Delhi government decided to implement the ONORC scheme a day before it. “Last week, the system was not working for a few hours for three days at a stretch leading to long queues of people waiting to get ration. However, for the past two-three days we have not faced any major problem,” said Satvir Singh, 61, who runs a shop at Matia Mahal. Mr. Singh showed a WhatsApp group, “Circle 21 Matia Mahal’, in which government officials were also present, and other FPS owners had also posted photos of their e-PoS machines, which could not retrieve data of people, after entering their ration card number. Initially, there were problems with the government server and many a times, shop owners were not able to connect the e-PoS to the online system.  No alternative way  Details of a beneficiary need to be entered online before distributing ration under the ONORC scheme, and if the system is not working, then there is no other alternative to give ration. “When a number is entered, it has to be checked with the local server and an UIDAI [Unique Identification Authority of India] server. If the person is from outside Delhi, then the other State’s server is also involved. So, if there is problem in any of the servers, the process won’t be complete,” a Delhi government official said. “Initially there were issues, but we have fixed most of the issues and the distribution is going very well now,” the official added. Krishan Kumar, who also runs a FPS, also said that the issues with the system are less now.  Govt. lacks preparedness   Anjali Bhardwaj of the Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyaan said that the government should have learnt from its past mistakes and should have been prepared this time. In 2018, the government had started distributing ration through e-PoS, but had to stop and go back to the manual system due to problems with the online process. “With the pandemic, PDS [public distribution system] has become the lifeline for people. When there are disruptions in the distribution, many won’t be able to feed their children,” Ms. Bhardwaj said.  She said that the government should have an alternative method to distribute ration if the online system is not working or biometrics are not being detected by the machine. “There is an uneven burden on the vulnerable people when it comes to the e-PoS system. People who do manual labour and old people are the ones, whose biometrics do not match with the system in most cases. And they are the most vulnerable too,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ration-distribution-picks-up-pace-after-server-glitches/article35673356.ece
02 August 2021||New Delhi,||‘Tiranga Yatra a plan to instigate and defame farmers’||Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Sunday appealed to Haryana farmers not to oppose the ‘Tiranga Yatra’ of the State’s BJP unit claiming that it was a “devious plan” to instigate and defame farmers. The umbrella body of 40 farmer unions said in a statement that the other programmes of boycott and flag protests against the BJP and the JJP will continue. “The proposed ‘Tiranga Yatra’ of the BJP’s Haryana unit is mainly to instigate farmers and defame them. SKM urged farmers to see through this devious plan of BJP, and to not let this dirty tactic, under the guise of the national flag, succeed,” it said in the statement. The Haryana BJP’s two-week-long ‘Tiranga Yatra’ ahead of the 75th Independence Day began from Bhiwani on Sunday, with party’s State chief O.P. Dhankar claiming that thousands of farmers also joined the event. Mr. Dhankar, along with State Agriculture Minister J.P. Dalal, rode a tractor with Tricolour fixed on its both sides during the ‘yatra’, which was taken out on a 30-km-long route from Bahal to Loharu. The SKM also said the ‘Kisan Sansad’ will continue at Jantar Mantar in Delhi on Monday. “The Kisan Sansad, despite the site of the Sansad in Jantar Mantar being flooded with water, is functioning in a disciplined manner, with detailed deliberations. In Chhattisgarh, a parallel Kisan Sansad was run by the State Kisan Sabha on Friday, in solidarity with the Kisan Sansad near the Parliament,” the morcha said. The Kisan Sansad is part of the latest strategy of the farmers who have been protesting against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws at multiple Delhi borders since November last year. The farmers have expressed fear that the new laws will eliminate the Minimum Support Price system and leave them at the mercy of the big corporations. Over 10 rounds of talks with the government that has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties. As part of these Kisan Sansad sessions, 200 farmers from the protest sites participate in a mock Parliament session at Jantar Mantar during which issues concerning the farming community were discussed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/tiranga-yatra-a-plan-to-instigate-and-defame-farmers/article35673347.ece
02 August 2021||New Delhi,||HC seeks CBSE stand on plea on assessment of private Class X students||The Delhi High Court has granted time to the Central Board of Secondary Education to respond to a plea concerning the methodology of assessment of private Class X students after the examination was cancelled on account of the pandemic earlier this year. Justice Prateek Jalan, hearing a petition moved by the mother of a private Class X student, passed the order after time was sought by the counsel for the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). “Rupesh Kumar, learned counsel for the Central Board of Secondary Education, seeks ten days’ further time to take instructions on the methodology for assessment of private candidates for the Class X examinations,” the judge recorded in the order dated July 29 as he listed the matter for further hearing on August 23. The notice to CBSE in the petition was issued in June when the court granted six weeks’ time to the education body to clarify its stand. In her petition, Payal Bahl has submitted that while students have been declared as “pass” after the announcement of cancellation of examinations, CBSE has not issued any notification regarding its policy on how marks are to be awarded to private students. CBSE’s attitude towards the students who are privately enrolled in Class X examination is “prima facie violative of the Article 14 of the Constitution of India” and takes away “their equal opportunity of proceeding with further education”, she contended. It is highlighted that CBSE has already notified that assessment of regular Class X students was to be based on internal assessment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-seeks-cbse-stand-on-plea-on-assessment-of-private-class-x-students/article35673348.ece

02 August 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi zoo reopens after over 3 months||The Delhi zoo was reopened to the public on Sunday, three and a half months after it was temporarily shut due to a surge in COVID-19 cases during the second wave. The facility had earlier remained closed for over a year due to the pandemic and bird flu and was reopened on April 1. “Rain could not deter the spirit and enthusiasm of the people, especially the young ones. We are trying our best to make their visit worthwhile,” Zoo Director Ramesh Pandey said. The zoo will operate in two shifts — from 8 a.m. to noon, and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Visitors are required to buy tickets online on the zoo’s website or at the entry gates using QR codes. The administration has also introduced cycles for its staff in a bid to minimise noise pollution due to vehicles and reduce carbon footprint. According to Mr. Pandey, the zoo had recorded only 124 animal deaths, the lowest in the last three years, while it remained closed to the public in 2020-21. There are 94 species and 1,162 animals in the zoo at present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-zoo-reopens-after-over-3-months/article35673349.ece

02 August 2021||Kandahar,||Afghan forces digging in to defend cities||Afghan forces fought fierce street battles and bombed Taliban positions on Sunday while insurgents swarmed major cities as they stepped up their nationwide offensive. Hundreds of commandos were deployed to the western city of Herat while authorities in the southern city of Lashkar Gah called for more troops to rein in the assaults even as Afghan air strikes left scores dead on the streets, residents said. Fighting has surged across Afghanistan since early May when U.S.-led foreign forces began a final withdrawal that is now almost complete. After seizing large tracts of rural territory and capturing key border crossings, the Taliban have started assaulting provincial capitals. In Kandahar, Afghanistan’s second-largest city and the former stronghold of the insurgents, days of fighting have displaced thousands of people who crowded into the city centre to escape the crossfire on the edge of the provincial capital. Flights out of Kandahar were suspended on Sunday after at least two rockets hit the runway before dawn. The facility is vital to maintaining the logistics and air support needed to keep the Taliban from overrunning the city, while also providing aerial cover for large tracts of southern Afghanistan. Taliban claims attack The Taliban claimed the attack, saying government warplanes were “bombarding” their positions from the airport. The rocket barrage came as the Taliban inched closer to overwhelming at least two other provincial capitals, including nearby Lashkar Gah in Helmand province. “Fighting is going on inside the city and we have asked for special forces to be deployed,” Ataullah Afghan, head of Helmand provincial council, said. Afghan security forces have increasingly relied on air strikes to push the militants back from cities even as they run the risk of hitting civilians in populated areas. “Every inch of the city has been bombed,” Badshah Khan, a resident of Lashkar Gah, said, adding the two warring sides were fighting “street to street” battles. “You can see dead bodies on the streets. There are bodies of people in the main square,” he said, adding the Taliban had even surrounded the city’s police headquarters and Governor’s office. “The threat is high in these three provinces... but we are determined to repel their attacks,” Afghan security forces spokesman Ajmal Omar Shinwari said. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) demanded the Taliban “provide answers” for the rocket attack on its office in Herat on Friday that killed an Afghan guard. The capture of any major urban centre would take their current offensive to another level and fuel concerns that the army is incapable of resisting the advances. As fighting raged, President Ashraf Ghani again slammed the Taliban for failing to marshal their negotiating power to reach a peace deal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/afghan-forces-digging-in-to-defend-cities/article35672917.ece
02 August 2021||Verona,||Europe’s vaccine cards meet resistance||Shouts of “Liberty!” have echoed through the streets and squares of Italy and France as thousands show their opposition to plans to require vaccination cards for normal social activities, such as dining indoors at restaurants, visiting museums or cheering in sports stadiums. Leaders in both countries see the cards, dubbed the “Green Pass” in Italy and the “health pass” in France, as necessary to boost vaccination rates and persuade the undecided. Italian Premier Mario Draghi likened the anti-vaccination message from some political leaders to “an appeal to die.” The looming requirement is working, with vaccination requests booming in both countries. Still, there are pockets of resistance by those who see it as a violation of civil liberties or have concerns about vaccine safety. About 80,000 people protested in cities across Italy last weekend, while thousands have marched in Paris for the past three weekends, at times clashing with police. More than 200,000 marched across France on Saturday, 14,000 of them in Paris, in the biggest show yet. Denmark pioneered vaccine passes with little resistance. Belgium will require a vaccine certificate to attend outdoor events with more than 1,500 people by mid-August and indoor events by September. Germany and Britain have so far resisted a blanket approach, while vaccinations are so popular in Spain that incentives are not deemed necessary. Many say vaccine pass requirements are a source of inequality that will further divide society, and they draw uneasy historic parallels. “We are creating a great inequality between citizens,’’ said Simone in Verona because he said he “feared for his livelihood.” “We will have first-class citizens, who can access public services, the theater, social life, and second-class citizens, who cannot. This thing has led to apartheid and the Holocaust.” Holocaust survivors call the comparison a distortion of history. “They are madness, gestures in poor taste that intersect with ignorance,’’ said Liliana Segre, a 90-year-old Holocaust survivor and Italian Senator for life.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/europes-vaccine-cards-meet-resistance/article35672920.ece
02 August 2021||Islamabad,||Pak. finalises Bill to grant new status to Gilgit-Baltistan: report||Pakistani authorities have finalised a law to award provisional provincial status to strategically located Gilgit-Baltistan, a media report said on Sunday. India has clearly conveyed to Pakistan that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the areas of Gilgit and Baltistan, are an integral part of the country by virtue of its fully legal and irrevocable accession. India maintains the Government of Pakistan or its judiciary has no locus standi on territories illegally and forcibly occupied by it.  Dawn newspaper reported that under the proposed law by the Ministry of Law and Justice, the Supreme Appellate Court (SAC) of Gilgit-Baltistan may be abolished and the region’s election commission is likely to be merged with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). Sources in the Law Ministry told the newspaper that the draft of the Bill titled ‘26th Constitutional Amendment Bill’ had been prepared and submitted to Prime Minister Imran Khan. According to the sources, the draft Bill has been prepared after careful reading of the Constitution of Pakistan, international laws, the UN resolutions especially those related to a plebiscite on Kashmir, comparative constitutional laws and local legislation. The stakeholders, including the governments of Gilgit-Baltistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, had been consulted on the proposed constitutional amendment, the report quoted sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pak-finalises-bill-to-grant-new-status-to-gilgit-baltistan-report/article35672918.ece

02 August 2021||Wellington,||New Zealand apologises for raids on Pacific people||New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Sunday formally apologised for police crackdowns in the 1970s that “unfairly targeted” the country’s Pacific community. The infamous “dawn raids” were carried out by officers and immigration officials, often accompanied by dogs, to arrest and deport individuals who had overstayed their work visas. Pacific people comprised a third of overstayers but represented 86% of prosecutions, while Britons and Americans in New Zealand — who also comprised a third of overstayers — saw just 5% of prosecutions in the same period. “Today, I stand on behalf of the New Zealand government to offer a formal and unreserved apology to Pacific communities for the discriminatory implementation of the immigration laws of the 1970s,” Ms. Ardern told a gathering of Pacific dignitaries in Auckland. Minister for Pacific Peoples William Sio, who emigrated with his family from Samoa to New Zealand in 1969, described the raids as “racism of the worst kind.” Wellington encouraged migration from Pacific islands such as Samoa, Tonga and Fiji after Second World War to fill worker shortages as the economy expanded. But those who migrated faced a backlash during the 1970s downturn, with claims they were taking jobs from New Zealanders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/new-zealand-apologises-for-raids-on-pacific-people/article35672924.ece

02 August 2021||August 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Pegasus, a blemish on democracy||Pegasus, the mythical winged horse from Greek mythology, is known to have allowed Bellerophon, the Corinthian hero, to ride him in order to defeat the monstrous Chimera before flying off to the heavens where he was turned by Zeus into an eponymous constellation. He has now returned to earth in the guise of a malware designed to fight terrorism, criminality and national insecurity. Though interpreted as an allegory of soul’s immortality in modern times, Pegasus becomes a symbol of poetic inspiration, only to be turned into a reprehensible cyber weapon in the hands of dictators and bigots with the purpose of putting down dissent and killing critical thought. The constellation still glows in the heavens, but no longer evokes the age-old mythical sensations for humanity. Where science has brought us How science has aided in the inadvertent political game of demolishing basic human rights has finally fructified in the production of a technology that infiltrates human privacy right up to the bedrooms of its targets. When C.P. Snow walked into the Senate House at Cambridge in 1959 to deliver his Rede lecture, ‘The Two Cultures’, he sparked a global debate that would put a nail in the coffin of humanities, giving a boost to the study of science for the advancement of humanity. The two distinct cultures that emerged led to the confrontation between the technocrats and ‘literary intellectuals’. While the former stood in favour of social reform and progress through technology and industry, the latter, who Snow disparagingly called “natural Luddites”, had insignificant consideration for progress through industrialisation. We now know where science has finally brought us. The shadowing of our every move in a cyber-savvy world has resulted in escalating military and police repression. Mounting security concerns have been met with mounting technological responses. It is a world ridden with tensions between security and freedom, secrecy and transparency. Democratic structures along with fundamental liberties stand eroded in the face of unrestrained free market economics that exists only to direct every facet of life. This is a system of the Panopticon, an architectural edifice where the warden in a central tower can monitor the prisoners in their cells without the prisoners seeing the warden. The use of Pegasus, therefore, poses a stark danger to democracy and freedom, particularly in 10 governments believed to be the customers of NSO Group: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Hungary, India and the UAE, all believed to have a dismal record in the protection of human rights. The obsession with power through surveillance has brought in its wake not just the blitzkrieg of information, but also given rise to political systems that aim at behaviour control, destroying the sanctity of the individual’s privacy and thereby threatening democracies with serious consequences. We are caught in a world where the harsh reality of power and its exercise takes predominance over the constitutionally guaranteed right of self-determination and freedom of expression. The central motive, however, remains political domination through the control of any dissent or ideological variance with the state. The security agencies of democracies and dictatorships are engaged in gathering the phone ‘data’ of citizens who show any signs of opposition, heaping it all away for any contingency that might arise in the future. Working against all norms of jurisprudence, the national security state remains ‘legitimately’ above board, blatantly pursuing acts of social control through surveillance on the basis of national security. The new metamorphosised role of Pegasus has finally become the terror of a devastating hacking scandal, a means of punishing people and threatening to drown the world of freedom. This is at the heart of the contemporary debate on the use of Pegasus, a battle between the totalitarian state and dissidence. In such circumstances, living in confrontation with the state apparatus is tantamount to being labelled as “anti-national”. There are many incarcerated without a trial for years. True to the concept of fascism, the interrogation of state policy becomes a betrayal in the Orwellian sense, where free thought and debate are an anathema. The utopia promised by the government of Oceania in George Orwell’s 1984 is an illustration of the logic of totalitarianism. Such an over-organised system represents the purging of history and free human thought for the smooth and peaceful running of the state apparatus. Criticism is not permitted by a management that has at its disposal highly developed surveillance technology, the ‘thought police’ that incarcerates or eliminates any ‘thought criminal’. As Hannah Arendt argues, the state ensures not just the transformation of the outside world but also the very dysfunctionality of the unpredictable nature of human creativity and its spontaneity. In Orwell’s novel, O’Brien, an agent of the thought police, owing complete allegiance to the Party, explains to Winston, the central character, the unending process of persecution that can appease the ruling class so as to give it an assurance of its immortality. The state manipulates the rebirth of Winston, turning his rebellious old self into a faceless believer. Similarly, in his classic, Brave New World , Aldous Huxley envisages material progress all right, but with enormous dangers to human creativity. In such a world, no prodigies or rebels can be born. It is a world of the “hatchery” in which “hobbits” are “manufactured” at various stages of arrested physical and mental development whose strength lies only in falling into line. The Pegasus upheaval finds a parallel in Orwell’s ‘Big Brother’ symbolising the modern state and its authoritarian apparatus. Governments have lied about intelligence operations, illegally spied on millions of innocent people, and collected data from every conceivable electronic source to be potentially used to censor dissent, blackmail people or just intimidate those who struggle to make corporate and state power accountable. The post-Snowden years have seen new technologies like Pegasus enhancing surveillance to the point of exposing us to the danger of losing our very grip over our day-to-day private affairs. Expansive interrogation The ills of the modern state emerging from the culture of secrecy is therefore apparent. There would probably be a world of feasible peace and openness if there were no classified documents. One thing has become clear after the revelation of many governments illegitimately engaging in spying on their citizens: the hour has come to oppose all such excessive oppression through serious political action. Like Edward Snowden, we all live online and indeed, there really is no place to hide. However, the future is not foreclosed, and as long as there is critical inquiry, there is hope. As Howard Zinn, the historian, once said: “We are supposed to be thinking people. We are supposed to be able to question everything.” A more expansive interrogation of the treachery inherent in the return of the Pegasus affair and its fallout for rights activists, investigative journalists and writers calls for a serious probe. Or else, the gradual diminishing of our individual right to free speech and the dismantling of democratic institutions would culminate in the return of Orwell’s Oceania.

02 August 2021||August 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The draw of space and nuclear technologies||Even as billionaire Jeff Bezos was preparing to blast off into space last month, another billionaire, Bill Gates, took an equally momentous decision to launch his own nuclear reactor with an eye on the possibility of exporting fast breeder reactors to power hungry nations (https://reut.rs/3ylFSgW). Both of them characterised their initiatives as essentially aimed at the environment to reverse climate change. Answering criticism on his expensive and wasteful adventure, Bezos insisted that he had an environmental vision: “We need to take all heavy industry, all polluting industry and move it into space, and keep Earth as this beautiful gem of a planet that it is,” he said. Mr. Gates stressed the importance of nuclear power as the clean energy required to meet the requirements of the world, even though the safety of nuclear reactors and the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons are a growing concern. The future of atomic energy Back in 2007-08, the then Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mohamed ElBaradei, had established a Committee of Eminent Persons to look at the future of nuclear power in 2020 and beyond. As an Executive Director of the Commission, I had helped to produce a report, which asserted that “the international community has both auspicious opportunities and significant challenges to tackle as the world moves into its seventh nuclear decade. Expanded use of nuclear technologies offered immense potential to meet important development needs. In fact, to satisfy energy demands and to mitigate the threat of climate change — two of the 21st century’s greatest challenges — there are major opportunities for expansion of nuclear energy”. The report predicted that a “nuclear renaissance” will solve not only the world’s energy problems, but also alleviate climate change. Fukushima and after But the expectation was short-lived because the Fukushima Daiichi accident in Japan on March 11, 2011 completely transformed the nuclear power situation beyond recognition and dealt a blow to plans for swiftly scaling up nuclear power to address not only climate change but also energy poverty and economic development. An IAEA article, “Nuclear power 10 years after Fukushima: the long road back”, says, as the global community turned its attention to strengthening nuclear safety, several countries opted to phase out nuclear power. The nuclear industry was at a standstill except in Russia, China and India. Even in India, the expected installation of imported reactors did not materialise because of our liability law and the anti-nuclear protests in proposed locations. India had to go in for more indigenous reactors to increase the nuclear component of its energy mix. More than 50 nations, which were knocking at the door of the IAEA for nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, quietly withdrew their requests. After intensive efforts to strengthen nuclear safety, as said in this article, and with global warming becoming ever more apparent, nuclear power is regaining a place in global debates as a climate-friendly energy option once again. Countries such as Japan and Germany reopened their reactors to produce energy. But even as organisations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) recognise the ability of nuclear power to address major global challenges, it remains uncertain whether the value of this clean, reliable and sustainable source of energy will achieve its full potential any time soon. The Fukushima Daiichi accident, adds the article, continues to cast a shadow over the prospects of nuclear power. Furthermore, in some major markets, nuclear power lacks a favourable policy and financing framework that recognise its contributions to climate change mitigation and sustainable development. Without such a framework, nuclear power will struggle to deliver on its full potential, even as the world remains as dependent on fossil fuels as it was three decades ago. The Gates plan Even when the uncertainty continues and the anti-nuclear lobby is gaining momentum, TerraPower, the nuclear company founded by Mr. Gates, has just announced an agreement with private funders, including Warren Buffett, and the State of Wyoming, U.S. to site its Natrium fast reactor demonstration project there. Moreover, since it falls within the “advanced” small modular reactor project of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the Department will subsidise the project of one of the richest men in the world to the extent of $80 million this year. As an article by the non-proliferation sentinels in the U.S, Henry Sokolski and Victor Gilinsky, titled “Bill Gates’ Fast Nuclear Reactor: Will It Bomb?” (https://bit.ly/3fjM1Tc) says, Mr. Gates believes that the fast breeder reactors will replace the current reactors. The DOE and other nuclear enthusiasts also believe that small, factory-built, modular reactors will be cheaper and safer, and will be so attractive to foreign buyers that they will revive America’s nuclear industry and enable the United States to compete in an international market now dominated by China and Russia. Another benefit envisaged is that fast breeder reactors will provide a solid nuclear industrial base for meeting U.S. military nuclear requirements. DOE has found bipartisan Congressional support for funding the project. Mr. Sokolski and Mr. Gilinsky have challenged the move on several grounds such as the failure of earlier efforts to develop such reactors, and the risk of the turning of inert uranium to plutonium, and then using the plutonium as fuel. They have argued in their article that it can even “breed” excess plutonium to fuel new fast reactors. What concerns them most is that plutonium is a nuclear explosive which can be used for developing a bomb. They are afraid that the availability of plutonium through commercial channels would be fraught with dangers. As their article says, TerraPower announced in March that Natrium would be fuelled with uranium enriched to 20% U-235 rather than explosive plutonium. But the question being asked is if Natrium reactor takes off and is offered for export, will the same restraint apply. Currently, only a handful of nations can make 20% enriched uranium. The critics believe that there will be a rush to make 20% enriched uranium world wide. The main objection to nuclear enrichment beyond a point in Iran arises from the fact that it would lead to weapon grade uranium being available for them. The other objection being raised against the Gates project, as cited in the article, is that the principal reason for preferring fast reactors is to gain the ability to breed plutonium. That is surely what foreign customers will want. The way it is configured, the reactor would make and reuse massive quantities of material that could also be used as nuclear explosives in warheads. Focus on India and China India’s fast breeder reactor, which is not subject to international inspections, is seen as capable of feeding the nuclear weapons capability of India. And the recent reports that China is building two more fast reactors have immediately provoked international concerns about China’s possible weapons plutonium production. The opponents of TerraPower believe that India and China will be encouraged in their efforts to develop fast breeder reactors and may even want to buy them from Mr. Gates. They also think that the characterisation of TerraPower as small is a gimmick and they will have to be made big to make them economical. The claim that fast reactors are safer than light water reactors has also been called into question. It has been pointed out that U.S. Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter made it U.S. policy to discourage the commercialising of plutonium-fuelled reactors. President Ford had announced that the U.S. would not support reliance on plutonium fuel and associated reprocessing of spent fuel until “the world community can effectively overcome the associated risks of proliferation.” (https://bit.ly/3fii71N). The critics do not think that the world has reached such a stage. No one can predict whether the space adventure of Mr. Bezos or the nuclear venture of Mr. Gates will benefit the U.S. and the wider world. But billionaires have the sixth sense to know how to multiply their own billions. T.P.

02 August 2021||August 02 2021 00:00 IST,||A cycle of low growth, higher inflation||In recent times, right-leaning economists have been arguing that the Government does not need to do anything with the economy and that it will revive by itself. They call those who disagree with them, doomsday merchants. These economists reason that, like after the Great Depression, the economy rebounded worldwide, and so will it with us. The argument is fallacious on four accounts: The first factor, demand. In the case of the Great Depression, demand was created by the Second World War effort. Especially in the United States, which was largely spared of the destruction, its industrial capabilities could be used as a supply base for the entire Allied effort. In the current scenario, there is no war to create demand. On top of it, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in demand destruction. This is because many jobs have been lost, and even where jobs were retained, there have been pay cuts. Both of these trends were confirmed in the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy and other surveys. The only bright spot in this dismal scenario is that the western world has spent a lot of money stimulating the economy. From the point of view of the Indian exporter, rising freight costs and non-availability of containers is a significant impediment along with structural issues such as a strong rupee relative to major competitors. Only the Indian IT sector is placed well to capitalise on rising demand in the world markets. Next is inflation. India is suffering from stagnant growth to low growth in the last two quarters. At best, any growth in the current quarter will be illusionary because it comes on top of substantial negative growth in the first quarter of last year, perpetuating a statistical phenomenon known as the “low base effect”. The base effect states that when measuring YoY, or year-over-year growth, we take the previous year’s numbers as the base and measure the growth as a percentage. As in the low initial base set by last year, almost any growth this year is seen as a significant growth percentage. In comparison, the absolute growth figure is negligible. This scenario is eerily similar to the early 1970s in the United Kingdom and the United States, where low growth was combined with rising inflation. Causes in India Inflation in India is being imported through a combination of high commodity prices and high asset price inflation caused by ultra-loose monetary policy followed across the globe. Foreign portfolio investors have directed a portion of the liquidity towards our markets. Compared to a developed capital market such as that of the U.S., India has a relatively low market capitalisation. It, therefore, cannot absorb the enormous capital inflow without asset prices inflating. This might be seen as a welcome move, but it is to be noted that most of India’s population do not own equity or bonds, which means that they cannot cash in on asset inflation. The wealthy upper class gets richer due to access to financial assets. The middle and lower-middle-class get destitute due to regressive indirect taxes and high inflation, with their wealth eroding due to said inflation. Especially in the case of the lower middle class, inflation is lethal as they do not have access to any hard assets, including the most fundamental hard asset, gold. Fuel prices Additionally, supply chain bottlenecks have contributed to the inflation we see in India today. Essential goods have increased in cost due to scarce supply because of these bottlenecks caused by COVID-19 and its reactionary measures enforced. India’s usurious taxation policy on fuel has made things worse. Rising fuel prices percolate into the economy by increasing costs for transport. Furthermore, the increase in fuel prices will also lead to a rise in wages demanded as the monthly expense of the general public increases. This leads to the dangerous cycle of inflation and depleting growth. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has chosen to look the other way, claiming that this inflation is transitory in nature while inflationary expenses are entrenched. Inflation is here to stay because the RBI is infusing massive liquidity into the system by following an expansionary monetary policy through the G-SAP, or Government Securities Acquisition Programme. This is designed to keep the interest rates of government bonds at 6.0% and thereabouts. An added threat of rising rates is the crowding out of the private sector, which corporates are threatening to do by deleveraging their balance sheets and not investing. The third is interest rates. The only solution for any central banker once he realises that inflation is entrenched is tightening liquidity and further pushing the cost of money. If this does not dampen inflation, repo rates will need to go up later this year or early next year. Tightening the money supply is a painful act that will threaten to decimate what is left of our economy. Rising interest rates lead to a decrease in aggregate demand in a country, which affects the GDP. There is less spending by consumers and investments by corporates. On NPAs Finally, rising non performing assets, or NPAs. Rising interest rates, lack of liquidity, and offering credit to leveraged companies instead of direct subsidies to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to counter the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects will result in NPAs of public sector banks climbing faster. Our small and medium scale sector is facing a Minsky moment. The Minsky moment, coined by the economist Hyman Minsky, states that every credit cycle has three distinct stages. The first stage is that of cautious lending and risk aversion by the bankers. The second stage is lending to trustworthy debtors who can pay the principal and its interest. The third stage is a state of euphoria caused by rising asset prices where bankers lend to debtors regardless of their ability to pay back interest, let alone the principal. Minsky moment The Minsky moment marks the decline of asset prices, causing mass panic and the inability of debtors to pay their interest and principal. India has reached its Minsky moment. This means that the public sector unit and several other banks will need capital in copious amounts to make up for bad debt. Several banks and financial institutions have collapsed in the last 18 months in India. The Union government’s Budget is in no position to infuse large amounts of capital. At best, we can expect a piecemeal effort as in the past seven years. As a result of the above causes, credit growth is at a multi-year low of 5.6%. Banks do not want to risk any more loans on their books. This will further dampen demand for real estate and automobiles once the pent-up demand is over. The Indian economy is in a vicious cycle of low growth and higher inflation unless policy action ensures higher demand and growth. In the absence of policy interventions, India will continue on the path of a K-shaped recovery where large corporates with low debt will prosper at the cost of small and medium sectors. This means lower employment as most of the jobs are created by the latter.

02 August 2021||August 02 2021 00:00 IST,||What makes a reader keep reading||Among the multiple challenges a journalist has to confront is the quality of writing that sustains the readers’ interest. Elegant writing is neither a legal requirement nor a regulatory prescription. It is an earnest invitation for an exchange of ideas without taxing the reader. One of the instructions Vinod Mehta gave me when I became an editor 20 years ago was to ensure that my journalism is not boring. “Boredom kills journalism,” he asserted. It is trite to say journalism is not fiction. Good, reliable journalism has to adhere to strict factual accuracy. The rules of attribution cannot be compromised. The act of verification is an integral element of journalism. In short reports, these three elements suffice. A talented desk will ensure that no meaning is lost and hence, no reader is lost. However, in long-form journalism, engaging writing matters. Concerns in narrative journalism The year I became an editor was the year the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University established a programme on Narrative Journalism. Nieman Curator Bob Giles said, “Narrative journalism builds a newspaper’s franchise for the long term. It plays to the strengths of print journalism — space and considered reporting — adding value that no other medium can duplicate.” The programme underscored that the values of journalism and creative approaches to prose can easily coexist without the core tenets of good reporting being eroded. Russel Frank, who worked as a journalist for decades before becoming a journalism teacher, flagged a major concern of editors towards certain aspects of long-form journalism. He wrote: “When reporters write stories that read like good fiction they inevitably arouse suspicions. Reality is messy. Speech is messy. If a story is tidy — if the plot is too seamless or the quotes are too eloquent — the reporter probably juiced it a little. Reconstructed scenes are particularly suspect. Instead of relying on tape recordings or notes of their own observations, reporters rely on the memories of the people who were there.” Mr. Frank also pointed out that “the surge of interest in narrative journalism has coincided with a surge of scepticism among newspaper readers.” Journalists add notes for their print version and give hyperlinks for the web version to ensure that the rules of attribution are not lost in writing a report. Fog everywhere Literature teaches us how to work with words in a manner that the reader doesn’t get bored. Much has been written about the journalistic quality of Charles Dickens’s writing. What we learned from him is the art of description, which is different from the act of deception. For instance, in Bleak House, he wrote: “Fog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city. Fog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping into the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards and hovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales of barges and small boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient Greenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog in the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper, down in his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of his shivering little ‘prentice boy on deck.” This is a wonderful example of how fragments and extremely long sentences coexist to make reading a worthwhile experience. The fine editor, Harold Evans, in his book, Do I Make Myself Clear? Why Writing Well Matters , refers to Dickens to explain the new language of obfuscation that is creeping into our public sphere. He wrote: “Fog everywhere. Fog online and in print, fog exhaled in television studios where time is anyway too short for truth. Fog in the Wall Street executive suites. Fog in the regulating agencies that couldn’t see the signals flashing danger in shadow banking.” His antidote was: “But never come there fog too thick, never come there mud and mire too deep, never come there bureaucratic waffle so gross as to withstand the clean invigorating wind of a sound English sentence.” This, indeed, shall be the governing creed of both the reporters and the desk as they put out their stories. readerseditor@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/what-makes-a-reader-keep-reading/article35672907.ece
02 August 2021||August 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The benefits of breastfeeding||UNICEF states that “breastfeeding is among the most effective ways to protect maternal and child health and promote healthy growth and optimal development in early childhood.” Infants should be breastfed within one hour of birth, breastfed exclusively for the first six months of their lives, and be breastfed after six months in combination with solid, semi-solid and soft food until they are about two years old. Many advantages Breastfeeding provides greater immunity for children against infection, allergies, cancers and obesity; and improves brain maturation. It is also beneficial for the mother: it promotes faster weight loss after birth, reduces postpartum bleeding, and protects her against breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and osteoporosis. Data from The Lancet show that more investment in breastfeeding could add $300 billion to the global economy and prevent about 8,20,000 child deaths every year. The advantages of breast milk are evidence-based, yet globally only 25%-40% of babies are breastfed. Breastfeeding and later wet nursing were the norm for millions of years. During the Renaissance period, breastfeeding came to be seen as unfashionable. Feeding bottles and formula milk were aggressively advertised leading to a reduction in breastfeeding between the 17th and 19th century. However, during the late 19th century, an increase in infant mortality rate and rise in noncommunicable diseases during adulthood were attributed to bottle feeding. This prompted experts and leaders everywhere to push for breastfeeding across the world. The World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action (WABA) was established in 1991 to create awareness about the importance of breastfeeding. In 1992, WABA in coordination with UNICEF introduced World Breastfeeding Week during the first week of August every year. India enacted the Infant Milk Substitutes, Feeding Bottles and Infant Foods Act in 1992 with stringent regulations. However, the National Family Health Survey-5 data show that there has been a decline in early breastfeeding in as many as 12 of the 22 surveyed States and Union Territories while the share of institutional births has increased.  Maternity and paternity leave The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) has promised in its manifesto that maternity leave in Tamil Nadu would be extended to 12 months. This is essential as women are entering the workforce in large numbers while society has shifted to a nuclear family system. Such a move will ensure uninterrupted breastfeeding. Nevertheless, counselling and educating the parents, establishing breast milk banks, providing lactating mothers with subsidised breast milk pump equipment, and setting up exclusive facilities to breastfeed will prove to be beneficial for mothers to provide exclusive breastmilk for children up to six months. The inclusion of husbands in this conversation is incumbent. Both the mother and newborn are vulnerable for the first 12 weeks. Getting used to breastfeeding takes at least 14 days. Therefore, assistance from the partner is indispensable during this time. However, Indian law only allows for 15 days of paternity leave. It is imperative to extend this to 12-16 weeks. India is a low-middle-income country with a meagre allocation of the GDP towards health. Communicable and non-communicable diseases hamper our economic growth. The theme for World Breastfeeding Week this year is ‘Protect Breastfeeding: A Shared Responsibility’. With a change in social, cultural and environmental factors, breastfeeding is no longer mother-centric. Governments must allocate specific funds, rigorously implement the law, invest in educating parents and health workers and involve civil society organisations and the media in spreading awareness. Breastfeeding has decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is important that the promotion of breastfeeding should be a continuous process, not an event restricted to a week. Poongothai Aladi Aruna was Information and Technology Minister of Tamil Nadu under the DMK (2006-2011)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-benefits-of-breastfeeding/article35672908.ece
02 August 2021||August 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Long overdue||Reservation for students from Backward Classes in seats surrendered by States to an ‘All-India Quota’ (AIQ) in medical colleges run by State governments was long overdue. The Centre’s decision to extend its 27% reservation for ‘other backward classes’ to all seats under the AIQ is a belated, but welcome development, as Other Backward Class (OBC) candidates have been denied their due for years. And in concord with its keenness to balance OBC interests with those of the socially advanced sections, the Union government has also decided to provide 10% of the AIQ seats to those from the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS). This is almost entirely the outcome of a Madras High Court verdict and the efforts of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which approached the court with the demand. The AIQ is a category created by the Supreme Court to free up some seats from residential or domicile requirements in some States for admissions to their medical colleges. Introduced in 1986, the AIQ comprised 15% of undergraduate medical and dental seats and 50% of post-graduate seats surrendered by the States for admission through a central pool. There was no reservation in the AIQ, and, once in the past, the Supreme Court set aside a Madras High Court order directing the Centre to implement Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes quota in the category. In 2007, the Supreme Court allowed 15% Scheduled Caste reservation and a 7.5% Scheduled Tribe quota under the AIQ. Meanwhile, based on a central law favouring Backward Class reservation in educational institutions, the Union’s 27% OBC quota was introduced in central educational institutions. There was no move to implement OBC reservation in the category. In the courts, the Medical Council of India argued against OBC reservation, but the Union government said it was not averse to the reservation, subject to an overall 50% limit. The omission of OBC reservation in the AIQ seats was obviously discriminatory. There were OBC seats in medical institutions run by the Centre, as well as State-specific quotas in those run by the States. It was incongruous that seats given up by the States to help the Centre redistribute medical education opportunities across the country were kept out of the ambit of affirmative action. There was even a case to argue that, as AIQ seats originally belonged to the States, the quota policy applicable to the respective States ought to be applied to them. The Madras High Court, in July 2020, held that there was no legal impediment to OBC reservation, but, given that the policy varied from State to State, it left it to the Centre to decide the modalities for quotas from this academic year. The Centre has now decided on the 27% OBC quota, but not before the High Court termed the delay in doing so “contumacious”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/long-overdue/article35672890.ece
02 August 2021||August 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Elusive gold||India at the Olympics has always been about feverish hopes, bruising anguish and a few medals. Since its debut at the Games in 1900, the world’s second most populous nation has ended up with either a single-digit tally or none at all. That familiar tale is being repeated a week after the Tokyo Olympics commenced and India is currently assured of three medals. One, a silver claimed by weight-lifter Mirabai Chanu in the 49kg category. And second, a minimum of a bronze guaranteed as boxer Lovlina Borgohain qualified for the semifinal in the welter-weight segment. The bout will be held on Wednesday. Badminton star P.V. Sindhu too joined the party, seizing her bronze after defeating China’s He Bingjiao 21-13, 21-15 during Sunday’s third-place play-off. Through their exploits Mirabai and Lovlina, hailing from Manipur and Assam, respectively, have revealed the rich sporting ability shimmering in the North-eastern States linked to the mainland through the chicken’s neck above Bangladesh. Mirabai and Lovlina owe their triumphs to their innate strength and hard work besides the obvious support from family and the Sports Authority of India. With Sindhu, they have also reiterated women-power. Sindhu, who won the silver at the previous Olympics at Rio de Janeiro, had an exceptional run till she ran into Chinese Taipei’s Tai Tzu-Ying in the semifinal and then made amends with a bronze. India had a moment to savour when its women’s hockey team entered the quarterfinals. While a strong Australian outfit awaits in the knockout on Monday, the women will add to India’s evergreen hockey-hopes that gained a fillip after the men defeated Great Britain 3-1 during Sunday’s quarterfinal. After the 1980 gold, the men’s quest to win another Olympic medal has gained impetus and the road ahead is tough but interesting. In the limited chronicle of good tidings, Kamalpreet Kaur’s excellent throw of 64 metres in the discus throw event was a spark. Kamalpreet qualified for Monday’s final and a lot is resting on her shoulders. While these stirring events kept India afloat, there is also the litany of heart-breaks that included Mary Kom’s loss in boxing, a fact the 38-year-old failed to initially admit following her adrenaline rush. The travails in shooting and archery did not add up to the original template of good form and resultant expectations. Shooters Saurabh Chaudhary and Manu Bhaker had their moments but they were not enough. The Games exert immense pressure as it is always about the athlete combining individual excellence with national pride. Tennis champion Novak Djokovic failed to even win a bronze while gymnast Simone Biles withdrew from events citing mental fatigue. It is never easy and the Indian contingent would vouch for that going into the second week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/elusive-gold/article35672891.ece

Sen Varma, said here yesterday that the bogus inclusion and wrongful exclusion of names would be eliminated altogether in the new electoral rolls to be finalised in October. He told newsmen that this was possible with the introduction of the electoral card system, unprecedented in the history of election anywhere in the world. He said that about 125 officers and employees of the Election Commission in 35 batches were checking and supervising the revision of electoral rolls in the Union Territory of Delhi. The two Deputy Election Commissioners and the three Secretaries were daily making random checks both in the rural and urban areas. The last date for completing the enumeration work originally fixed for July 31 had been extended to August 15. Supervision by the Election Commission staff had instilled great enthusiasm among the enumerators and the voters, especially in the rural areas. In a particular area which the Chief Election Commissioner did not want to disclose, there were 2,000 bogus names, and in another there was large-scale exclusion of names.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/electoral-rolls-being-made-fool-proof/article35672899.ece
02 August 2021||August 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Do you want to bond with the best?||The RBI recently released the features of Retail Direct Gilt Account as part of its (and the government’s) initiative to encourage retail participation in government bonds. The question is: should you invest in government bonds? In this article, we discuss the benefits and the issues associated with such investments. For the purpose of our discussion, we will assume that you are investing to achieve a life goal. We also assume that, at present, your preferred choice for bond investment is bank deposits. Interest-rate risk You are exposed to interest-rate risk when you invest in bond mutual funds or any bond investment that generates capital appreciation. The risk is that bond prices typically decline when interest rate rises (or in anticipation of rates going up). You are not exposed to this risk if you invest in bank deposits because you earn only interest income. Now, direct investment in government bonds also protects you from interest rate risk. How? True, government bonds trade in the market and offer opportunities for capital appreciation. But you can choose to earn only interest income by keeping these bonds till maturity and receive the par value from the government. It is possible that you may have to pay a premium to buy these bonds. The point, however, is that you need not bother about prices going down during the life of the bonds. And, of course, government bonds do not have credit risk. So, you can be confident of getting back the par value at maturity. The upshot? Government bonds offer stable income, just as bank deposits do, and typically without credit risk. But before you do decide to invest, consider an important risk associated with such investments. Reinvestment risk Suppose you want to accumulate Rs. 15 lakh in 10 years. Assuming you have Rs. 10 lakh today, you must invest in a product earning 4% per annum to accumulate Rs. 15 lakh in 10 years. Suppose, you invest in a 10-year government bond offering 4% post-tax interest income. It seems that you are all set to achieve your goal. But unwittingly, you have exposed yourself to reinvestment risk. To accumulate Rs. 15 lakh in 10 years, you need to earn 4% on a compounded annual basis. So, the interest income you earn every year must be reinvested at 4% till the tenth year. The issue is that RBI could lower the interest rate in any of the intermediate years. And, that would mean you cannot reinvest at 4%. Referred to as reinvestment risk, this risk, if not managed well, can set you on a path to failure to meet a life goal, Suffice it to understand that the more frequent the interest payments, the greater the reinvestment risk. Now, government bonds pay every half-year. So, this risk could be greater with government bonds than comparable bonds paying interest rate annually. Conclusion You should directly invest in government bonds if you are excited about the newer investment avenue. But, you should consider the following points if your objective is to invest in government bonds for achieving a life goal: First, both government bonds (if held till maturity) and bank deposits do not carry interest rate risk. Second, government bonds expose you to reinvestment risk. Bank deposits do not, if you invest in cumulative fixed deposits (for lump sum money) and recurring deposits (for savings from monthly income). Third, you can invest anytime in deposits and match the maturity of your deposits with the time horizon for your life goal. With government bonds, your primary investment is dependent on when RBI holds auctions, and the bond maturity offered in each auction. Finally, bank deposits expose you to small credit risk whereas government bonds are typically credit-risk free.

02 August 2021||August 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Gold gleams, silver struggles||Precious metals remained broadly range bound in July. After a distinctly weak performance in June, Comex gold managed to close in the green. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s dovish stance on interest rates and the soft trend in the U.S. dollar helped gold prices recover in July. Comex gold gained 2.6% to close at $1,817.2 an ounce. But Comex silver lost 2.5% to $25.45 an ounce. Mirroring the global trend, MCX gold futures gained 1.9% to close at Rs. 48,001 per 10 gm. MCX silver futures closed 1.8% lower at Rs. 67,847 per kg. The short-term outlook for Comex gold is positive. The price may rise to the immediate target range of $1,870-1,880. A move past $1,837 would confirm the positive outlook. This outlook would be under threat if the price closes below the immediate support at $1,740-1,750. Until this is breached, there would be a case for a move to $1,880 and higher. A drop below $1,740 may impart weakness and the price could then slide to $1,650-1,660. The price of Comex silver has been confined to a range and the near-term outlook depends on the direction of the breakout from this range. A move above $26.8 would be a sign of strength and may propel silver price to the next target of $27.5-28. However, a fall below $24 would be a sign of weakness and it could then slip to the downside target of $22-22.5. Though MCX gold closed on a positive note in July, the price is still confined to a range. The short-term outlook hinges on the direction of the breakout from this range. A move above Rs. 49,000 would be a sign of strength and it could then rise to the major target at Rs. 51,250-51,300. A close below Rs. 47,300 would be a sign of weakness and could push the price to Rs. 43,500-44,000. The near-term outlook for MCX silver is negative. It could slide to the immediate target range of Rs. 63,000-63,500. This view would be invalidated if the price moves above Rs. 70,00-70,500. A close below Rs. 65,900 would strengthen the case for a slide to Rs. 63,500 and lower. To summarise, the short-term outlook for precious metals is unclear. A breakout from the levels mentioned would influence the direction of the short-term move.  (The author is a Chennai- based analyst / trader.

02 August 2021||August 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Ask Us July 25||Q.I am a 21-year-old medical student. I have started a recurring deposit (RD) with the Rs. 1,000 that I save every month. Now, I want to start investing. What options would you suggest? Am I eligible to invest in stocks and mutual funds (MFs)? Since investment gains are subject to taxation, what rules will I be subjected to if I start investing at this age? Sharan D. A.As you are 21 and a major, you can certainly invest in any instrument of your choice, including shares and mutual funds, irrespective of whether you are employed or not. You will, of course, need to meet the KYC requirement specified for each type of investment. Usually, if you have a PAN card and an Aadhaar for proof of address, this should suffice for most investments, along with the account opening form. Apart from bank RDs, you can consider small savings schemes operated by India Post. These are absolutely safe investments backed by the Government of India. India Post offers 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year fixed deposits, a recurring deposit account, a 5-year monthly income account, a 5-year National Savings Certificate where your interest compounds until maturity, a 15-year Public Provident Fund and many other options that offer a guaranteed return. There are also deposit products from Non-Banking Financial Companies such as HDFC and Sundaram Finance that offer fixed returns if you lock in for 1,2,3 or 5 years. The interest you earn on both post office schemes and NBFC deposits are treated as your income and taxed at the income tax slab rate applicable to you each year. MFs are riskier investment vehicles that deliver returns based on movements in market prices of the assets they invest in. You can invest either through monthly instalments (called Systematic Investment Plans or SIPs) or through one-time investments. There are different types of MFs carrying differing risk profiles, from those that invest in large-, mid- and small-cap stocks to those that invest in safer options such as bonds. The key advantage of open-end MFs is that they offer anytime liquidity as you can sell your units to the MF whenever you need to exit. The dividends received from MFs are taxed in your hands at your I-T slab rate. The capital gains are taxed as short-term or long-term capital gains, based on how long you hold the fund. When you buy shares, you get to own a share of the business which entitles you to dividends from the company and share price appreciation, if any, when you sell the shares. Dividends are taxable in your hands as income and capital appreciation as short term or long-term capital gains (after one year of holding). As you have no income from an occupation, you will need to add up all your incomes from stipend, dividends from MFs and shares, interest from deposits and short-term capital gains from any sale of MFs and shares to arrive at your gross taxable income. If your taxable income is up to Rs. 2.5 lakh in a year, you are not liable to pay any I-T. For income beyond Rs. 2.5 lakh up to Rs. 5 lakh, you pay tax at 5%. For income beyond Rs. 5 lakh and up to Rs. 10 lakh, you pay tax at a 20% rate. To save tax, you can also invest in instruments under section 80C of the I-T, which allow you to claim up to Rs. 1.5 lakh in annual deduction from your gross taxable income. Certain post office schemes and ELSS MFs are eligible for this deduction. In effect, up to Rs. 4 lakh of your income can be exempt from I-T in a year provided you are able to use 80C effectively. However, tax savings should not be your only objective while choosing investments. Before choosing them, you need to be clear on three things – the financial goals towards which you are investing, the time horizons you have to achieve them and your risk appetite which is your ability to take losses or volatility in your returns. For holding periods of 7 years or less, you must consider deposit products, post office schemes and debt MFs. You should venture into shares or equity MFs only if you have a 7-year-plus horizon. Finally, tax can be levied on your MF or stock market investments once you become a taxpayer, as and when you sell units or shares and make capital gains. Q.I am a senior citizen (81). I redeemed MFs in January this year. The total capital gain received was Rs. 13.30 lakh. My annual income is Rs. 17 lakh, from other sources. Can I get tax exemption for capital gains u/s 54 EC? A.P. Chari  N. Sree Kanth answers: With effect from April 1, 2019, capital gains arising from sale of land, building or both only are eligible for exemption under Section 54EC of the I-T Act, 1961. The capital gains in your case are arising from the redemption of MFs due to which they are not eligible for exemption under Section 54EC of the I-T Act. Depending on the nature of the MF redeemed, the tax treatment will vary and accordingly, will have to be included in your total income. Q.Please clarify whether total income (taxable income) or gross total income is to be taken into consideration for filing I-T. returns. Also, is TDS applicable to each branch for bank deposit interest? A.R.K. Sundaram A.For filing returns for individuals under Sec. 139 of the I-T Act, total taxable income will be considered to determine it exceeds the maximum amount not chargeable to I-T. Under Section 194A of the Act, the words ‘a banking company’ is used, due to which the limits for non-deduction applies to each banking company and not branch wise.  (N.

02 August 2021||Tokyo,||Sindhu stamps her class, adds another feather to her cap||P.V. Sindhu fixed her hair, shuffled her feet thrice, leaned forward and muttered “come on.” She took a deep breath before letting the shuttle sail over the net. The point ended with a thunderous cross-court smash, and she let out a scream. She had scaled the mountain of expectations, beating China’s He Bingjiao 21-13, 21-15 to secure an Olympic bronze medal. She is now the first Indian woman to have back-to-back medals at the Olympics. Emotional conflict Sindhu, however, had walked into the court with a myriad of thoughts. “I had an emotional conflict, whether to be sad that I had lost a chance to make it to the final or find happiness that I had another shot at winning a medal,” she said. But none of those thoughts mattered once the contest began on centre court at the Musashino Forest Plaza. Bingjiao, much like Tai Tzu-ying on Friday, tried to restrict play close to the net but Sindhu countered. The Chinese kept the shuttle low but whenever she offered Sindhu even an inch of flight, she was greeted by a point-killing smash. The Indian led 11-8 and a streak of Bingjiao unforced errors saw her cruise ahead. There came a time when the Chinese shuttler looked exasperated — she had done remarkably well to cover the court and return a Sindhu smash but the 26-year-old from Hyderabad smashed the return to the other end of the court. She pocketed the first game 21-13. Longer rallies Bingjiao tried to engage Sindhu in longer rallies in the second game in a bid to control the tempo of the game, but the Indian was prepared. She finished points early and derived great success from her ferocious forehand cross-court smashes. The duo was tied 11-11, before Sindhu switched gears to take off. She toyed with Bingjiao to surge ahead 19-15. A minute later, she embraced her coach Park Te-sang, with another Olympic medal in her bag. “I’m super happy to be the first Indian woman athlete to win back-to-back medals,” she said, noting that this medal was a lot more difficult to achieve compared to the silver in Rio 2016, where she had little expectations or pressure. “It hasn’t sunk in yet! I just want to be in the moment and I’m going to enjoy this,” said the reigning World champion, who made it a memorable Sunday for India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sindhu-clinches-bronze-makes-it-a-super-sunday-for-india/article35673110.ece
02 August 2021||Tokyo,||Dressel, McKeon leave in a blaze of glory||Caeleb Dressel won two more titles on Sunday to end his Tokyo campaign with five golds, as Australia’s Emma McKeon became the first woman swimmer to win seven medals at a single Olympics. Fantastic efforts Dressel earned the title of world’s fastest swimmer with a lightning 21.07 seconds in the 50m freestyle before helping the US men shatter their own world record in the 4x100m medley relay. McKeon was just as impressive, blasting through the 50m in 23.81s then spearheading Australia to the medley relay honours on the final day of action. It boosted her medal tally to seven — four gold and three bronze — surpassing the six won by East German Kristin Otto (1952) and American Natalie Coughlin (2008). McKeon also matched the record for the most decorated female athlete at a single Games ever, tied with Russian gymnast Maria Gorokhovskaya (1952). Like McKeon, Dressel took the 50-100 freestyle double, but also powered to the 100m butterfly title in world-record time, while adding 4x100m free and medley relays to thrust himself into rarified company. He joins Americans Michael Phelps, Mark Spitz and Matt Biondi, and Otto, as the only swimmers to win five or more golds at one Games. While the US again topped the medals table with 30, including 11 gold, second-placed Australia had 20 medals, nine of them gold. Dressel and McKeon returned for the event-closing relays with Dressel delivering a storming butterfly leg to steer the US to a world-record 3:26.78s. That shattered US’s own global mark of 3:27.28s set at the 2009 World Championships, with Adam Peaty’s Britain taking silver ahead of Italy. In the women’s relay, McKeon swam the fly for Australia, which came home in an Olympic-record 3:51.60s to upset two-time defending champion USA. Canada was third. Distance double America’s Robert Finke overcame fatigue to secure the Olympic distance double by winning the men’s 1500m gold medal to go with his 800m title.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/dressel-mckeon-leave-in-a-blaze-of-glory/article35673153.ece
02 August 2021||August 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Jacobs! The bolt from the blue||It was a magical Sunday night in Tokyo as Lamont Marcell Jacobs virtually came from nowhere and raced away as the fastest man of the Olympics. With American world leader Trayvon Bromell crashing out in the semifinal and China’s Su Bingtian topping that round in a new Asian record time of 9.83s, many had expected surprises in the final. Still, none expected Jacobs to come good for he had never won any major 100m title earlier. The race was anybody’s till about 70m when the 26-year-old America-born Italian made his move to stunningly take the gold in an European record time of 9.80s with American Fred Kerly (9.84) and Canadian Andre de Grasse (9.89) picking silver and bronze. Jacobs is the first Italian to take the 100m title and its was a personal best for all three. It was certainly a dramatic day and a wonderful Italian night, for the men’s high jump produced two gold medallists after Gianmarco Tamberi and Qatar’s Mutaz Essa Barshim finished level at 2.37m after clearing all their earlier heights in their first attempt. They had both failed at 2.39. They were given two options: a jump-off or to share the gold and they decided to go for the latter. Tamberi shed tears of joy for he had missed the 2016 Olympics with an injury and was in crutches around that time. He brought the cast, that held his leg together then, to the Tokyo track to remind the world what he had been through. Barshim was in tears too, it was the World champion’s first gold after silver in Rio and London 2012. A few minutes before that, Venezuala’s Yulimar Rojas was screaming in delight after breaking Inessa Kravet’s 26-year-old women’s triple jump World record with 15.67m (old 15.50) in her last effort. She had broken the Olympic record with her first jump, a 15.41. Portugal’s Patricia Mamona (15.01) and Spain’s Ana Peleteiro (14.87) took silver and bronze. Lijiao finally gets gold Earlier China’s Gong Lijiao, who had won silver and bronze earlier, completed her Olympic medal set in women’s shot put with a personal best 20.58m. All her five legal throws were better than American silver medallist Raven Saunders’ efforts (19.79).  Jacobs came from a family of motorcyclists, but his mother Viviana was against it. So he tried everything, including swimming, football and basketball He is a decent long jumper too and has a personal best of 7.95m||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jacobs-fastest-man-on-the-planet/article35672990.ece
02 August 2021||TOKYO,||‘If I can do it, anybody can’||P.V. Sindhu hopes she can inspire a new generation after adding the Tokyo Olympics bronze to her 2016 Rio silver on Sunday. The World champion defeated China’s He Bingjiao 21-13, 21-15 to add another prize to her collection, five years after finishing second at the Rio Games. Now she feels that the Indians can use her achievement as a springboard for more badminton success. “I’m sure a lot of youngsters and others will get motivated to work hard and come up,” she said. “I'm sure we can do this. If I can do it, everybody can do it.” Sindhu was aiming to become only the second Indian to win an individual Olympic gold, but had lost to Chinese Taipei’s Tai Tzu-ying in the semifinals. She said she was “sad” at not being able to go one better than at Rio. However, Sindhu she was able to put the disappointment behind her and claim bronze. “I had to close out all my emotions for this one match and give it my all,” she said. “I’m very happy and I think I've done really well. Getting a medal for the country is definitely a proud moment for me and the people out there.” Sindhu followed up her 2016 Olympics silver by winning the World title in 2019. She said she would “definitely” look to challenge for Olympic gold again at the 2024 Paris Games, and backed herself to continue improving. “Every time I win, it’s a stepping stone,” said the 26-year-old. “It builds my motivation. I can do much better and I can work harder. “I think that's my passion towards the sport — once you achieve something, you want to achieve more and more.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/if-i-can-do-it-everybody-can/article35673112.ece

02 August 2021||(Providence,||Pakistan edges Windies narrowly||Pakistan’s bowlers did just enough to restrain a rampant Nicholas Pooran and come away with a seven-run victory over the West Indies in the second T20 International of the four-match series here on Saturday. Pooran’s explosive unbeaten 62 off 33 balls with six 6s and four 4s kept the West Indies in with a chance until the final over when 20 runs were required to overhaul Pakistan’s 157 for eight. However, Shaheen Shah Afridi dismissed captain Kieron Pollard and then denied Pooran to ensure the visitors were kept to 150 for four. Also, off-spinning all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez, bowling the first over, dismissed Andre Fletcher with his second ball and conceded just six runs in his four overs. West Indies suffered another setback when opening batsman Evin Lewis retired hurt on 35 midway through the innings. Earlier, Jason Holder and Dwayne Bravo put the brakes on the Pakistan scoring rate. Holder returned figures of 4/26 while Bravo claimed 2/24 as the tourists squandered a solid platform provided by Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan. Babar’s polished 51 (58, 2x6, 4x4) was the top core of the innings.  The scores: Pakistan 157/8 in 20 overs (Mohammad Rizwan 46, Babar Azam 51; Jason Holder 4/26) bt West Indies 150/4 (Evin Lewis 35, Nicholas Pooran 62 n.o.).   Toss: West Indies.

Pradeep Raju, Praveen Raju, trainer Srikanth Verma and the young badminton players, who had sparred with P.V. Sindhu in the lead up to the Tokyo Olympics, have played an important role behind Sindhu’s bronze medal-winning feat at the Tokyo Olympics. “Yes, we were definitely disappointed after Sindhu’s loss to Tai Tzu-ying in the semifinal. Now we’re glad that she pulled off another memorable performance,” said Pradeep, who has been working with Sindhu’s coach Park Tae Sang since February this year. “Sindhu has been with us since 2017. When she started her quest for the Olympic gold after her below-par performances in the three tournaments in Thailand, including the Super Series final, she wanted to prove a point to herself and the world,” said Pradeep. “From the Suchitra Badminton Academy, the senior-most strength and conditioning trainer and a physio travelled with Sindhu,” Pradeep said. “We have given inputs to the strength and conditioning team, and she is now faster and leaner. She had match simulations where she played from positions like 16-0, 17-20, 18-20. If you see this helped her against Akane Yamaguchi in the quarterfinal in the first game,” Pradeep said. “We ran video analysis on her game and all her possible opponents to ensure she understands and adapt very easily to every style of play,” Pradeep said. “Despite pandemic throwing the tournament structure haywire, it worked in Sindhu’s because it gave her enough time to learn new strokes like slow drop and the half-smashes,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/support-system-behind-sindhus-medal-journey/article35673158.ece
02 August 2021||Chennai,||Comprehensive win for Warriors||Ruby Trichy Warriors continued its fine run in the Tamil Nadu Premier League with a comprehensive six-wicket win over Salem Spartans at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium here on Sunday. Electing to field first, Warriors delivered an excellent bowling performance, restricting Spartans to just 116/8. Measured knock In reply, despite an early wobble, Adithya Ganesh produced another measured knock in a chase to help Warriors get close to a playoff spot. The left-hander walked in when Warrirors were 49/3 in the eighth over and played sensibly without taking risks as he made an unbeaten 28 with one six. He was supported by Antony Dhas, with the duo adding 49 runs for an unbroken fifth wicket. Opener Akshay Srinivasan gave Spartans a positive start with a flurry of boundaries — a drive and cut through the off-side and two more through the leg side off pacer Saravana Kumar. However, skipper Rahil Shah got the better of Akshay, who chipped it straight to the hands of mid-on fielder. The Spartans batting unit never managed to string together any decent partnership. Warriors pacers Poiyamozhi and Antony Das once again gave crucial breakthroughs. Rahil marshalled his resources well, always looking to get wickets and led from the front with an impressive spell of 1/16 and two crucial catches. Deep trouble When left-arm spinner Mathivannan had Vijay Shankar caught at cover, Spartans were in deep trouble from which they could not recover. It was M. Ashwin’s top score of 21 and a few boundaries from the lower-order batsmen that helped the team get past 100.  The scores: Salem Spartans 116/8 in 20 overs (M. Poiyamozhi 2/25, P. Saravanakumar 2/26) lost to Ruby Trichy Warriors 120/4 in 18.3 overs (Adithya Ganesh 28 n.o., W. Antony Dhas 24 n.o., G. Periyasamy 2/17) .

Sai Kishore’s brilliant 4/30 to beat Dindigul Dragons by 24 runs at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Sunday. The left-arm spinner, along with Sandeep Warrier (1/21), were playing their first game after returning from Sri Lanka and delivered for the defending champions. Chasing 160 for victory, the Dragons’ chase started off well with skipper Hari Nishaanth’s 39 (31b) before Sai Kishore had the former caught and bowled. In his last over, Sai Kishore removed the dangerous Vivek Raj and S. Swaminathan to seal the contest for his side. Blazing start Asked to bat first, CSG openers Kaushik Gandhi (45) and N. Jagadeesan (41) gave a blazing start to put a competitive total of 159/7. Both batsmen stepped out to pacer Vignesh to clear the fence down the ground and added 73 for the opening wicket. Dragons then fought back with left-arm spinner M. Silambarasan (1/18) and ambidextrous spinner Mokit Hariharan (1/16) to put the brakes on CSG’s scoring with just 65 coming between the seventh and 15th over. Later, U. Sasidev’s 29 helped CSG recover some of that momentum it lost during the middle over and, it proved to be enough in the end.

02 August 2021||TOKYO,||India beats GB, ends four-decade wait||The Indian men’s hockey team ended a 41-year wait to make it to the medal round at the Olympics as they clinched a 3-1 win over Great Britain at the Oi Hockey Stadium on Sunday to advance to the semifinal. Britain saw more of the ball initially and looked menacing, but India took the lead in the seventh minute against the run of play. Simranjeet Singh won the ball at the edge of the D and neatly played it to Dilpreet Singh, who converted from close range. Brilliant save India goalkeeper P.R. Sreejesh pulled off a fine save to deny Samuel Ward soon after as Britain pushed for an equaliser. Graham Reid’s side doubled its lead within seconds of the second quarter when Hardik Singh won the ball and found Gurjant Singh. Gurjant skilfully pivoted 180 degrees to weave past his marker and snuck it into the goal past Britain’s goalkeeper Ollie Payne. Upping the ante The Indian defence dealt with a barrage of attacks in the third quarter as Britain upped the ante, and dominated possession. The Indian backline was kept on its toes, but Britain lacked the finishing touch. Having squandered two penalty corners, it finally converted off its third in the 45th minute as Ward found the back of the net. The last 15 minutes were a nervy affair — the Indians had to hold on to their slender one-goal lead, while the British continued to play on the offensive. Sreejesh summoned all his skill as he made save after save to keep the British at bay. Yellow for Manpreet  India's task became even more challenging when skipper Manpreet Singh was shown a yellow card with six minutes on the clock and had to sit out. The British had the man advantage but failed to make it count as Hardik Singh netted India’s third in the 57th minute. Solo run The 22-year-old went on a solo run during a counter-attack and made his way towards the opposition goal. He had his first shot saved but scored on the rebound. Minutes later, the Indian camp broke into emotional celebrations after sealing the win. They had just taken a step closer to their dream of bringing back Indian hockey’s Olympic glory days. “We are very happy because we are reaching the semifinal after a long time. The tournament isn’t over yet and we need to keep our feet on the ground and focus on the next match,” said Manpreet. The Indians will take on Rio 2016 silver medallist and reigning world champion Belgium, which beat Spain 3-1 in the last eight, in the semifinal on August 3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-overcomes-great-britain-hurdle/article35672989.ece
02 August 2021||HYDERABAD,||Vaishnavi uses her experience well||Vaishnavi Veeravamsham of Hyderabad topped the Monsoon Regatta National-ranking championship with some impressive heavy wind sailing at the Hussain Sagar Lake here on Sunday. Vaishnavi had her mainsheet badly stuck in a pulley block during the first race and despite leading for the most part struggled to keep that pace downwind where the sail would just not release for speed.

The experienced Anand had travelled as Sania Mirza and Ankita Raina’s physio after the tennis team opted for him rather than a coach when it was allowed only one support staff. Meanwhile, the wrestling squad had one physio who could only enter the training venue and was not staying in the village. The early exit of the tennis players led to the IOA converting Anand’s tennis accreditation to all access. He was already staying at the athletes village and thus has been able to immediately help the wrestlers. Anand — part of the Indian Fed Cup and Davis Cup teams over the years — has an extended service in the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tennis-physio-comes-to-wrestlers-rescue/article35673159.ece

02 August 2021||GURUGRAM,||Activists fume over ‘mindless digging’ to combat flooding||It is often remarked that history repeats itself. In Gurugram, it repeats itself every monsoon in the form of waterlogged roads. A heavy spell of rain — around 160 mm in a span of less than 36 hours on July 18-19 — left the city inundated. Water gushed into houses and roads virtually turned into rivers. Underpasses on the national highway running through the city were also flooded, and a body was retrieved from one underpass. All major roads and intersections in the city were waterlogged. Sheetla Mata Mandir Road, a perennial waterlogging point, was the worst affected. Videos of devotees, including women and children, wading through waist-high water went viral on social media. But despite the heavy rain for more than a day, the situation on Raghvendra Road, also known as Golf Course Road, was remarkably better than the previous year with none of the underpasses on the road being inundated and the rainwater getting drained just a few hours after the downpour. In 2020, three underpasses on Raghvendra Road, a signal-free stretch through DLF area from Shankar Chowk to AIT Chowk, were inundated and had to be shut for traffic. The longest underpass, near DLF Phase-I Rapid Metro station, was filled to the top. “After the rains last year, a committee comprising then Municipal Corporation Gurugram Commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, Additional Commissioner Jaspreet Kaur and the local councillors in Zone-III, deliberated on the matter and decided that the four creeks flowing through the area must be cleaned and widened, and their segments reconnected to avoid flooding,” said Tushar Yadav, Executive Engineer, MCG Division-8, Zone-III. Waste dumped in creeks Mr. Tushar said a huge quantity of waste, mostly construction and demolition waste, was cleared from the creeks, which were then also widened. The pipes from under the roads connecting them to the drain along the Chakkarpur-Wazirabad Bandh were also de-silted. “Despite the heaviest rain of the season on July 19 and two more spells later, the situation on Golf Course Road has been far better compared to the previous year. We now plan to plant vegetation along the creeks,” said Mr. Yadav. He, however, conceded that the work in the creeks was done without the supervision of an environmental expert and not based on any report or study. Subhash Yadav, Head, Urban Environment Division, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, said the agency constructed chutes on the roads along the creeks, raised the height of the speed-breakers, dug up contour trenches and created water bodies in 600-hectares area of Aravalis to successfully collect around 11,46,000 kilolitres of water on July 19. Drainage system “The water collected was estimated to be equal to the city’s water supply for 3-4 days. Since the water drainage system of the city is not made to handle rainfall of this scale in a single day, there was waterlogging. The situation could have been far worse had the water collected in the Aravalis also flowed down into the city’s drainage system,” he said.  Mr. Subhash claimed the experts had suggested construction of concrete check dams inside the creeks, but he used his expertise to decide that earthen check dams were enough to hold the run-off, keeping in view the amount of rainfall the city received. Several environmentalists, however, are fuming at what they call the “unscientific”, “short-term” and “quick-fix” approach of the government agencies to solve ecological issues. The environmentalists pointed out that the water bodies dug up in the creeks had left several trees uprooted and roots of many other exposed and caused the soil around them to erode, causing more harm than good. “It seems that no calculations were done for the dimensions of the pit before digging it. After rains are over, these huge pits can be great dumping areas for construction and demolition waste and other wastes,” said Hemani Pundir Rawat, a volunteer for Clean Air, in a tweet about the pit dug in Creek-1 along Sunset Boulevard Road. Unwanted construction A few others have also objected to the construction of the “unwanted” cement chutes despite hume pipes along the road, and the “mindless” digging of the forest to create contour trenches and the setting up of avoidable check dams. Saurav Bandhan, an environmentalist, said the government agencies must take “appropriate scientific measures” to collect and harvest the rainwater flowing down the creeks, ridges, natural drains of the Aravalis without displacing any trees and soil. “Widening of natural drains could be done but with proper care, and appropriate soil erosion prevention measures. Depending on the average annual rainfall, contour bunds or graded bunds could be constructed of proper structural design and construction material. Boulders, stones and rubble should be used. No cemented structures should be permitted in the Aravalis. The rainwater runoff on the roads should be channelised into the natural drains, depressions, creeks etc. with the help of hume pipes fitted with trash screens,” said Mr. Bandhan. He added that loose sandy soil of the Aravalis, if compacted properly with vegetation to prevent erosion, could be used for constructing the bunds or barriers but only with proper understanding of the slope, flow rate, volume of rainwater, and other factors. Hydro-geological experts, geologists, structural engineers, etc. must be consulted and such projects should be implemented under their supervision, he added. “The Aravali mountain range is ecologically fragile. Destroying the Aravalis will destroy the ecosystem of Gurgaon,” warned Mr. Bandhan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/activists-fume-over-mindless-digging-to-combat-flooding/article35673342.ece

In one of the pictures, Mr. Kumar is seen offering a “shawl” to Mr. Chautala with the two leaders surrounded by a couple of more people. Mr. Tyagi is also seen in the picture. Mr. Chautala, who was released from jail last month on completion of his 10-year sentence in a corruption case, had this past Tuesday said that he would soon start meeting political leaders towards forging a ‘third front’. The octogenarian leader had said that he would try to meet leaders of all Opposition parties before September 25, the birth anniversary of former Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal, to forge an alternative to the “corrupt BJP government at the Centre”. Mr. Chautala had said that he also had plans to meet Mr. Kumar, a BJP ally. The BJP is the ruling party at the Centre and has alliance governments with the JJP in Haryana and with JD(U) in Bihar. Farm laws flayed Mr. Chautala had said that the “biggest need today is to change the present regime”, adding that the Centre’s farm laws were against the farmers and would only benefit the corporate. Mr. Kumar and Mr. Tyagi have earlier worked with Mr. O.P. Chautala’s father and former Deputy Prime Minister late Chaudhary Devi Lal.

02 August 2021||jaipur,||Rajasthan farmers turning into entrepreneurs||Farmers growing grains and vegetables in their fields in western Rajasthan are now sorting and grading their processed agricultural products with machines. Taking advantage of subsidies, incentives and land conversion offered by government agencies during the pandemic, cultivators in the State are fast turning into entrepreneurs. With the agro-industry setting its firm foot in nondescript rural areas, mainly in Jodhpur district, chains of warehouses, cold storage facilities and food processing units have been established on agricultural land in a big way. Despite the adverse circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, as many as 617 agro-projects are in the pipeline with an estimated investment of Rs. 1,255 crore. Farmers have evinced a keen interest in setting up units for oilseeds, pulses, spices, cotton, milk and grain processing along with warehouses and cattle feed enterprises. While becoming financially self-sufficient, farmers are also providing employment to the village youths. Support for entrepreneurship in the farmer community came through the State government’s agro-processing, agri-business and agri-export promotion policy adopted in 2019. The ambitious scheme gives subsidy on capital investment and interest to farmers and entrepreneurs for setting up agro-processing industries and developing infrastructure. Mohan Ram Chaudhary, who established an agro-industry at Mathania village in Jodhpur’s Osian tehsil, told The Hindu that the decreasing ground water level had created difficulties for his farming activities. “When I came to know of the new scheme, I submitted a project report for a groundnut decortication unit. The loan and subsidy were approved in the pandemic,” he said. Onion, garlic export Woman farmer Munni Sankhla, known as a progressive cultivator in the region, has installed an onion-garlic dehydration plant in her agricultural field. Ms. Sankhla said her unit had started exporting onions and garlic, available locally in good quantity, after value addition. Farmers were also getting fair prices for their produce through such units. Shiv Ram Parihar of Balarwa village, who has set up a spice processing enterprise, said farmers could store their commodities with the creation of warehouses and get loans to meet their immediate needs without the compulsion to sell the produce immediately after harvesting. 50% grant for project As part of the policy, farmers and their organisations are given a 50% grant, or a maximum of Rs. 1 crore, of the project cost, while other eligible entrepreneurs get the grant of 25%, or a maximum of Rs. 50 lakh. To reduce the cost of operation, farmers are given interest subvention at the rate of 6% for five years on getting term loans. Bhaskar A. Sawant, Principal Secretary, Agriculture, said the value addition to agricultural products would directly benefit the cultivators by facilitating the sale of processed items at fair and remunerative prices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rajasthan-farmers-turning-into-entrepreneurs/article35673325.ece

02 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Extensive waterlogging, road cave-in reported in Capital due to heavy rain||As rain continued to lash Delhi, waterlogging remained an issue in several parts of the city. After a road cave-in under the IIT flyover on Saturday, another incident was reported from Ashoka Road on Sunday. The Captial received 12.8 mm rainfall between 8 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. on Sunday and 28.2 mm of rainfall over a period of 24 hours ending at 8 a.m. The maximum temperature settled at 32.1 degrees Celsius, which was two degrees below normal and the minimum temperature settled at 24.8 degrees Celsius — two degrees below normal. The Met has forecast a generally cloudy sky with moderate rain/thunderstorms on August 2. The maximum and minimum temperature is likely to settle between 29 and 25 degrees Celsius. PWD Minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday said the road cave-in under the IIT flyover has been repaired in record time. He tweeted: “The tireless efforts of our Delhi Jal Board officials have restored the broken water pipeline before yesterday midnight under the IIT flyover. Thereafter, our PWD officials worked round the clock and repaired the sunken road under the IIT flyover in record time [sic]”. The PWD said there was a leakage under the IIT flyover and the road was submerged in water and was thus closed for traffic. The DJB said it repaired the broken pipeline in less than 8 hours and the water supply was restored before the next water supply time so that no inconvenience was caused. Water levels in Yamuna Delhi government officials also said the Yamuna was flowing just below the danger mark at 205.30 meters on Sunday morning, which was just below the danger mark of 205.33 meters. They added that over 100 families living in the Yamuna floodplains have been moved to higher areas over the last few days.
