Spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, who had been a shadowy figure for years, promised that the Taliban would honour women’s rights, but within the norms of Islamic law, though he gave few details. He said the group wanted private media to “remain independent” but stressed that journalists “should not work against national values”. He said the insurgents would secure Afghanistan — but seek no revenge against those who worked with the former government or with foreign governments or forces. “We assure you that nobody will go to their doors to ask why they helped.” The capital of Kabul remained quiet for another day as the Taliban patrolled its streets and many residents stayed home, fearful after the insurgents’ takeover saw prisons emptied and armouries looted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/taliban-vow-to-honour-womens-rights-but-within-islamic-law/article35968228.ece
18 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC issues notice to Centre on pleas alleging snooping||The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued pre-admission notice to the Union government on petitions seeking an independent inquiry into allegations that the government used Israeli spyware Pegasus to snoop on citizens. The court made it clear to the government that “none of us want to compromise the defence of the nation... but there are citizens, some of them persons of eminence, who have complained of hacking of their phones”. After issuing notice, a Bench of Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana, Justice Surya Kant and Justice Aniruddha Bose said that it would consider the further course of action, including the formation of a committee to inquire into the allegations, in due time. The court listed the case for hearing after 10 days. The notice was issued after the government, represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, stood firm by its two-page affidavit denying “all and any” allegations. Mr. Mehta said any revelation about any software allegedly used by government to counter terrorism would compromise national security.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-pleas-alleging-snooping/article35968226.ece
18 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||India brings back Embassy staff||After a tense day when diplomats were turned back from travelling by Taliban guards, 140 Indians, consisting of 120 Indian Embassy staff and Indo-Tibetan Border Police personnel, 16 civilians and four mediapersons, flew back to New Delhi on board a military flight on Tuesday. The flight, a C-17 Globemaster, was one of the two aircraft operated by the Indian Air Force for bringing home all Indian personnel from the Embassy. However, the government maintained that it had not “abandoned” Afghans, and launched a new e-visa category, especially for Afghan nationals wishing to come to India. “We were a very large mission of 192 personnel, who were evacuated from Afghanistan within a period of three days in a very orderly fashion in two phases,” said Indian Ambassador to Afghanistan Rudrendra Tandon, during a refuelling stopover at Jamnagar in Gujarat. On August 16, another C-17 brought back nearly 40 diplomats and other personnel, after the others were turned back from driving to the airport by Taliban guards in Kabul, who stopped the convoy, confiscated some equipment and forced them back to the Embassy. According to sources, some difficult and uncertain hours followed, as Indian diplomats, led by Mr. Tandon, coordinated with the new militia now in control of the capital and other diplomatic missions to ensure the safe passage of the convoy out of Kabul, and then to the Hamid Karzai International Airport, currently under the control of the U.S.-led NATO troops.

Karnati Subramanyam, 33, correspondent of Life Energy English Medium School, and wife Rohini, 27, allegedly consumed poison while travelling in a car on Sunday night. The couple had reportedly made a video and posted it on social media. The duo said they had borrowed large amounts of money and were unable to repay their debts as they could not collect enough school fees from the students, but had to spend to maintain the institution. Video goes viral The police and their relatives began to search for them after the video went viral. The couple was shifted to the Kurnool Government General Hospital when they were found, where doctors declared them brought dead. According to the Koilakuntla police, the couple had run a private school for the past four years and had reportedly invested at least Rs. 2 crore to develop it. They had bought six school buses too. There were no admissions during the past two years due to the pandemic, but the interest on the loans they had taken kept increasing. On the other hand, the fee collection was meagre. On Sunday, the couple had gone to Rohini’s parents’ house at Atmakur and returned in the evening to Koilakuntla. On the way back, they allegedly consumed some tablets in the car after parking it near Karivena village and sent a video they had shot to a few of their contacts.

18 August 2021||New Delhi,||States differ with Centre on fuel||A day after Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman ruled out any immediate cut in fuel taxes levied by the Centre, and said States should cut their own taxes on fuel to give relief to consumers, several State governments were not amused and termed it an insult when their finances were already weak. Ms. Sitharaman had asserted that the States gained more than the Centre from higher oil prices because they charge ad valorem duties, while the Centre charged a fixed levy, which would be difficult to slash as it had to subsidise fuel price reductions undertaken by the United Progressive Alliance government in 2012-13. “The Union Finance Minister has made it amply clear that the Centre has no intention to reduce the fuel prices. The stand that the States have the option to reduce it is tantamount to insulting the States, which are already in a financially weak condition,” Kerala Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal said. Arguing that petrol and diesel had become pricier because of the additional and special excise duties and cess imposed by the Narendra Modi government when global oil prices were declining, Rajasthan Transport Minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said Ms. Sitharaman had rubbed salt in the wound by telling a lie about the States making more money. “It would be wrong to pass the buck to the State governments, when the Modi government’s real intention is to benefit the corporate sector,” he said, seeking an apology from the Minister to the nation for telling “a brazen lie”, and urgent cuts in fuel prices and restoration of the subsidy on LPG. Tamil Nadu Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan took to Twitter to respond to Ms. Sitharaman’s jibes about the State announcing a three rupee cut in petrol taxes after hiking the duties by seven rupees earlier. The FM had also targeted the DMK for being party to the UPA “trickery” of issuing oil bonds to subsidise fuel prices. The decision to reduce tax on petrol by Rs. 3 per litre was “integrity and not trickery,” the T.N. Minister countered. “Between 2016 and 2020, the BJP’s ally, the then AIADMK government had raised tax on petrol by Rs. 7 per litre in two stages. The DMK had argued against it when in Opposition. Now DMK formed Govt. & reduced petrol tax by Rs. 3/litre. With respect, this is ‘Integrity’, NOT ‘Trickery’,” Mr. Thiaga Rajan said in a tweet. The DMK had made a poll promise that it would reduce petrol prices if voted to power. Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who also holds the Finance portfolio, said there was no proposal before the government to reduce levies like neighbouring Tamil Nadu had done. Urging the Centre to take a helpful stand towards States, Mr. Balagopal said any attempt to include petroleum products under the Goods and Services Tax regime would further jeopardise States’ interests. “Already, the Centre is reluctant to share revenues, and giving them more control would harm the States,” he said. In Telangana, officials remained non-committal about replicating T.N.’s rate cuts. “The Centre collects all the cesses which are not shared with the States. No freedom exists for the States,” a senior Finance Department official said.  (With inputs from Tiki Rajwi in Thiruvananthapuram, Deepa H. Ramakrishnan in Chennai, Mohammed Iqbal in Jaipur, B.S.

Mr Tandon was present at the CCS meet and briefed the Prime Minister on the ground situation in Kabul. Sources said the CCS was briefed in detail on the current and evolving security and political situation in Afghanistan. The Committee was also briefed on the recent evacuations of Indian Embassy officials and some members of the Indian community, as well as some members of Indian media. The meeting was attended by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Home Minister Amit Shah, and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. External Affairs Minister S.

18 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre not for forming security force to protect judiciary, courts||The Union government told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that it was “not advisable” to form a Central security force to protect the judiciary and court complexes. The government said security of courts was “better left to the States”. Appearing before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) N.V. Ramana, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the Centre, said problems of security varied from State to State. The State police would be better equipped to gauge the deployment needs in local courts and take care of logistics of transporting criminals and protecting witnesses, among other crucial functions within court complexes. The Ministry of Home Affairs had issued extensive guidelines for the States to follow while protecting courts and the judiciary. Besides, Mr. Mehta said ‘police’ is a State subject under the Constitution. The court had taken suo motu cognisance of the attacks on judges along with petitions pending since 2019 seeking better protection for the judiciary and in courts. The turning point was the recent murder of a judge in Jharkhand, Uttam Anand, in broad daylight. The court had asked the Centre’s opinion on forming a central security outfit in the manner of the Railway Protection Force to protect courts and judges. “It is not advisable to have a central security force like the CRPF... There should be a fuller implementation of the guidelines of the Home Ministry. It is advisable that security is taken care of at the State level because problems vary from State to State. For example, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have naxal problems… It has to be State-specific instead of country-specific,” Mr. Mehta submitted. But the court questioned the implementation of the guidelines and the poor security provided to courts. “Question is whether the guidelines are followed and to what extent these governments are providing security… CCTVs cannot prevent a criminal from attacking a judge. There should be something in place to prevent threats, attacks on judges,” Justice Surya Kant, on the Bench, told the Solicitor General. Affidavits from States Justice Kant said several States had not bothered to file affidavits detailing the security arrangements in place for courts. Others who had filed affidavits presented a “lazy picture” of the security arrangements. The Bench allowed the States to file their affidavits in 10 days subject to paying Rs. 1 lakh each as costs. The court warned that Chief Secretaries would be summoned in case of non-compliance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-not-for-forming-security-force-to-protect-judiciary-courts/article35968162.ece
18 August 2021||August 18 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Opposition unity won’t be affected’||Former Lok Sabha member Sushmita Dev , who abruptly ended her three-decade-long association with the Congress to join the Trinamool Congress on Monday, said her decision was not driven by anger or negativity but what is ‘emerging’ nationally. Edited excerpts.  You were a part of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s core team, close to Sonia Gandhi; yet you decided to leave the Congress. Would it not be seen as a reflection on the leadership? I am a small part of a party with a huge legacy. In my letter dated August 15, I believe I have made it crystal clear that they have done their very best for me. And although I didn’t state this, but I believe I have done my very best in any capacity that they had given me an opportunity to work. And I have thought it through. Whether it comes to my region, what is emerging for the future, I believe what I have done will not be counterproductive to anyone concerned. But something would have prompted you to leave. Were you upset with someone or about something? This decision is not motivated by anger, anxiety or any negative feeling. Sometimes, the situation doesn’t permit to explain myself to anybody. But I thought it through and my conscience is clear: I think I have made no ideological compromise. And I believe that as a very junior politician, what I see emerging nationally, I believe the decision I took that was also a factor. And beyond that, I don’t think this is the time to speak further. I am only 24 hours into a new party You talked about how Abhishek Banerjee [Trinamool’s national general secretary] and Rahul Gandhi would work together. But there is also this view that Trinamool has taken away a talented leader of the Congress and this could affect Opposition unity? Does the Congress not bring people from other parties? Every party does. So why should an issue like this impact such a greater and a bigger cause? I think all the leaders involved here, whether it’s the Chief Minister of West Bengal or the Congress president, don’t you think that they are astute politicians to know that this cannot impact Opposition unity? I think to connect this with what is emerging in national politics is an oversimplification. Many believe that the Bengal elections were a turning point, even for national politics. Going ahead, do you think Mamata Banerjee and Trinamool are better placed than the Congress or its leadership to take on the Narendra Modi government in 2024 polls? I think it’s a fallacy to compare two parties or two leaders in this given situation. That would be derailing from the real purpose. I am repeatedly seeing that people on the streets want a change. And if any of us mean well, if any leader means well, any party right now means well, they must work together for this greater purpose. India as a nation has been built over decades but is falling apart in the eyes of the people. And that is the larger picture. In this situation, it shouldn’t be whose party is better, whose party is older or whose leader is stronger. We have to galvanise to put up that fight and that is what the nation expects from us. What role do you see for yourself in the Trinamool? I have to say that first I met Abhishek Banerjee and he gave me a lot of time, almost an hour. And thereafter I met the Chief Minister of West Bengal; she gave me around half an hour, 45 minutes. It was a very free and frank interaction. I made it very clear that I haven’t made this shift with a specific purpose in mind. Whether they have a specific purpose in mind, that will emerge in the next few days. But one thing we have agreed to is that whatever role they will give me and wherever they give me a role, I will have to come through. I have said that I have worked so hard in the three districts of Barak Valley [Assam] and I would definitely not like to compromise on what I have built over 10 years and what my father has built over 40 years. And Mamata Di is a mass leader and she knows what it is to build cadre. Not for a moment did she ask me to abandon anything. She said you have come, relax, go back to Assam, talk to your people. .

It will be conducted as a 120-minute, multiple choice, computer-based test, according to a National Testing Agency (NTA) notice. Registrations opened on Monday, and the last date to register is September 1. According to a statement from the Central University of Punjab, which is acting as this year’s nodal institution for the consortium that administers the examination and counselling process, the two Central universities of Kashmir and Orissa have opted out of the consortium this year and will invite applications for admission separately. From the next academic year 2022-23, CUCET will cover admissions for all 45 Central universities, including the older and more prestigious ones such as the Delhi University and the Jawaharlal Nehru University. The Centre had initially proposed to expand the test this year itself, in accordance with recommendations in the National Education Policy, but decided to delay implementation due to COVID-19 disruptions. The 12 participating institutions this year are the Assam University, and the Central Universities of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Jammu, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, south Bihar and Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cucet-to-begin-on-sept-15-for-12-central-universities/article35968164.ece
18 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. invites bids for V-P Enclave||The government on Tuesday set in motion its plan to construct a new residence for the Vice-President by inviting pre-qualification bids for the proposed Vice-President’s Enclave next to North Block and the Rashtrapati Bhavan at an estimated cost of Rs. 192 crore. As a part of the larger Central Vista redevelopment project, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) invited potential bidders for pre-qualification till August 31. The project was estimated to take 10 months and Rs. 192 crore, according to the pre-qualification bid document. The CPWD document said, “The proposed Vice President Enclave shall be constructed in plot of L&M Block adjacent to existing North Block, New Delhi. The existing temporary/permanent/semi-permanent structure of L&M Block shall be dismantled before start of new construction. The site is located in high security premises of North Block & Rashtrapati Bhawan. The proposed Vice President Enclave shall be of reinforced cement concrete framed structure building. The existing offices of North Block shall continue to function during the entire period of execution of this project, therefore utmost care is required to minimise construction noise, dust free area and other construction activity related issues.” Spread over 20,000 sq m, the buildings would include the V-P’s residence, with basement, ground and first floor, a secretariat with ground and first floors, a guest house, sports facility, staff quarters, barracks, CPWD building and ancillary buildings. The bid document said the contractor would have to set up labour camps and provide for transportation of workers to and fro from the site in three shifts. Stringent access control measures for entry and exit of workers, material and equipment would have to be implemented due to the “high degree of security concerns at the site and the work itself”, the CPWD said. As it did for the Parliament construction project, the CPWD split the bid into two stages. After the potential bidders are short-listed in the pre-qualification stage, they will be invited to submit technical and financial bids. Meanwhile, another project under the Central Vista revamp has seen further delays. The bids for construction of three buildings of the Central Secretariat were supposed to be opened on Monday, but was pushed to September 4, the fifth such postponement since the tender was floated on June 2.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-invites-bids-for-v-p-enclave/article35968124.ece

18 August 2021||Ghaziabad,||Plea to further quiz Kappan dismissed||A Mathura court on Monday rejected an Uttar Pradesh police application seeking permission to take a further statement from journalist Siddique Kappan, who has been booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and is lodged in the Mathura jail. Additional Sessions Judge Anil Kumar Pandey dismissed the demand of the police/ STF to further interrogate the journalist. Kappan and three others were arrested on October 5, 2020, in Maat, Mathura, when they were on their way to a Hathras village to meet the family of an alleged rape and murder victim. The police held that they were planning to foment tension in the area. In his application, Vinod Kumar Sirohi, Deputy Superintendent of Police, STF Field Unit, Gautam Buddh Nagar, who has investigated the case, said it was necessary to interrogate Kappan in relation to a sentence handwritten on the literature/ document of the banned organisation SIMI that was recovered from the room of the accused. “Apart from this, information is also to be sought from the accused regarding the work allotted to Kappan in the minutes of the general meeting of Popular Front of India,” the application said. Wills Mathews, advocate representing Kappan, submitted that the investigation was complete and the chargesheet was filed on April 3, 2021. He argued that the police’s position that further investigation was needed, in this 10th month of registration of the FIR, was against the letter and spirit of Criminal Procedure Code and amounted to a violation of the Fundamental Rights of the accused. Mr. Mathews also pointed out that Kappan had expressed his willingness to undergo a lie detector test or brain-mapping in a reply on April 4 this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/plea-to-further-quiz-kappan-dismissed/article35968128.ece
18 August 2021||Bhubaneswar,||Odisha plans ‘odyssey’ to wild cattle island||There’s every chance of visitors to the Hirakud reservoir in western Odisha bumping into the large numbers of cattle growing in the wild there for over 60 years. The Odisha Forest and Environment Department is all set to begin ‘Island Odyssey’ and ‘Hirakud Cruise’ ecotourism packages for tourists to islands inside the reservoir when COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. ‘Cattle island’, one of three islands in the Hirakud reservoir, has been selected as a sight-seeing destination. When large numbers of people were displaced from their villages when the Hirakud dam was constructed on the Mahanadi river in 1950s, villagers could not take their cattle with them. They left their cattle behind in deserted villages. As the area started to submerge following the dam’s construction, the cattle moved up to Bhujapahad, an elevated place in the Telia Panchayat under Lakhanpur block of Jharsuguda district. Subsequently named ‘Cattle island’, the piece of land is surrounded by a vast sheet of water. According to the Hirakud Wildlife Division, a massive herd of cattle has grown there, away from human beings for decades. Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Anshu Pragyan Das, who has visited the island as part of a survey, said, “The cattle show wild characteristics. They are not ferocious, but shy. If a person comes near, the animals just run away. When the Hirakud cruise begins, tourists will get to see these cattle from a distance. We are not going to disturb the cattle population.” Soon after India got freedom, the Hirakud dam construction began. A total of 73,923 hectares were submerged. According to government sources, approximately 18,000 families were displaced. However, Gopinath Majhi, convenor of the Hirakud Bisthapit Sangharsh Samiti, said 26,501 families were displaced to pave the way for the construction of one of India’s largest dams. Ms. Das said the ecotourism project will be run with the involvement of local fisher families.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-peek-at-wild-cattle-during-odishas-island-odyssey/article35968157.ece
18 August 2021||New Delhi,||Acquitted men move Delhi HC seeking ‘right to be forgotten’||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the Centre and search engine giant Google to respond to a petition by two businessmen, who have invoked the “right to be forgotten”, and sought the removal of certain articles relating to a criminal case lodged against them, from various online platforms. Justice Rekha Palli, however, declined to grant any interim relief to the businessmen at this stage saying, “You have a right to privacy but we have to see how we can balance it”. The judge posted the case for further hearing on October 28. Businessmen Jaideep Mirchandani, an NRI, and Siraj Amani, in their joint petition, said they were aggrieved by the certain online articles related to their arrest in a 2002 case, in which they were acquitted in 2016. The petition argued that they “had been honourably discharged by the competent courts, yet the alleged articles and wrong information available online against petitioners continue to haunt them”. The plea said the businessmen have the “right to be forgotten” or a “right to delink” in the context of the facts and circumstances of the case. It said the petitioners have a right to ask the authorities to remove all the links related to him on the search index, which is “irrelevant and obsolete”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/acquitted-men-move-delhi-hc-seeking-right-to-be-forgotten/article35968158.ece
18 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||Gurkhas not to be tagged as foreigners||The Assam government’s Political Department on Tuesday issued a notification ordering the State police’s Border wing not to forward any case against Gurkhas to the Foreigners’ Tribunals under the Foreigners’ Act of 1946. The official notification follows the Cabinet’s decision on August 4 to exempt the community from being tagged as non-citizens and tried in the tribunals for ascertaining their citizenship or detaining and deporting them. The Border wing is tasked with identifying people of doubtful citizenship and serving them notices for a Foreigners’ Tribunal — a quasi-judicial establishment — to take over. According to the 2011 census, Assam has more than 5 lakh Gurkhas, most of whom came as members of armed forces under the British administration. Leaders of the community said about 22,000 Gurkhas were left out of the draft National Register of Citizens published on August 31, 2019. The cases of some 2,500 Gurkhas are pending in a few of the 100 Foreigners’ Tribunals in Assam. All such cases are to be withdrawn, a government directive said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gurkhas-not-to-be-tagged-as-foreigners/article35968160.ece
18 August 2021||Srinagar,||Muharram procession barred in Lal Chowk||Several Shia mourners were detained and journalists allegedly thrashed by the police, as the Jammu and Kashmir administration barred the Muharram procession in Srinagar’s Lal Chowk on Tuesday. Concertina wires and barricades were erected on several stretches to stop Shias, who traditionally organise processions on the 8th of Muharram in areas around Lal Chowk. Locals said several mourners were detained when they tried to cross the barricades and converge onto the streets of Lal Chowk. Many were carrying placards with Islamic and ‘free Kashmir’ slogans written on them. The police used tear-smoke shells and resorted to baton charge to disperse the mourners. Many were seen being pushed into police vehicles. “We respect the religious sentiments and practices of all, but at the same time, it is also our joint responsibility to defeat the ill designs of vested interests who try to disturb peaceful atmosphere,” Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar said. The move to ban the procession came weeks after a government order said “the Muharram processions shall be observed as per the past practice”. On Tuesday, several photojournalists were allegedly beaten up when they were covering the clash.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/muharram-procession-barred-in-lal-chowk/article35968132.ece

Mr. O’Brien was responding to questions from presspersons on Sushmita Dev joining the Trinamool Congress from the Congress party. “The All Indian Trinamool Congress does not believe in poaching and breaking.

18 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Kerala woman asks govt. to locate daughter||The government of India should help find the women who had gone to Afghanistan to join the Islamic State, mother of one of the women said on Tuesday, as turmoil gripped that nation. K. Bindu, mother of Nimisha Fathima, said she had heard her daughter was released from a prison in Kabul by the Taliban but had not received any information about her whereabouts. “I am extremely worried and expect the Government of India to find my daughter. I heard that she has been freed but there is no confirmation of that and I am unable to understand the condition that my daughter is currently in,” said Ms. Bindu. Latest reports have revealed that the Taliban regime in Kabul has freed a large number of convicts from two major prisons in Kabul that held several fighters of the IS. With the release of the women and other members of the IS, security agencies have heightened alert to locate them. However, it is not yet known where the Indians are at present after their release. The Hindu has earlier reported that four Indian women who had accompanied their husbands to join the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP) are unlikely to be allowed to return to the country. The women, all from Kerala, went to Nangarhar in Afghanistan during 2016-17 accompanied by their husbands and continued to stay there. In the course of various military incidents, the husbands were killed and the women were captured during the Ashraf Ghani regime. They remained in prison till being released by the Taliban after the capture of Kabul.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-woman-asks-govt-to-locate-daughter/article35968139.ece
18 August 2021||Lahore/New Delhi,||Sikh emperor’s statue vandalised in Pakistan||A nine-foot-tall bronze statue of the first ruler of the Sikh Empire, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, was on Tuesday vandalised by an activist of the banned Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) at the Lahore Fort in Pakistan’s Punjab province, according to media reports. India has slammed the act, saying Pakistan has completely failed in its duty to prevent such attacks which are creating a “climate of fear” among the minority communities. A video clip circulating on social media shows the accused chanting slogans, breaking the arm of the statue and dismantling Singh’s bust from the horse and flinging it to the ground. The activist has been arrested by the Punjab police, the Express Tribune newspaper reported. Shahbaz Gill, Special Assistant to Pakistan’s Prime Minister on political communication, said that immediate action would be taken against the accused. India’s External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said, “The Pakistani state has completely failed in its duty to prevent such attacks...

18 August 2021||August 18 2021 00:00 IST,||India brings back Embassy staff||According to sources, some difficult and uncertain hours followed, as Indian diplomats, led by Mr. Tandon, coordinated with the new militia now in control of the capital and other diplomatic missions to ensure the safe passage of the convoy out of Kabul, and then to the Hamid Karzai International Airport, currently under the control of the U.S.-led NATO troops. After spending the night at the airport, the Indians boarded the flight around 6 a.m. According to radar tracking websites, both flights took a long and circuitous route avoiding the Pakistani airspace and minimising travel through the Afghan airspace, to fly over Iran and returned to India over the Arabian Sea, and back over Gujarat. “In view of the prevailing circumstances, it has been decided that our Ambassador in Kabul and his Indian staff will move to India immediately,” the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson tweeted, announcing the evacuation, but did not clarify whether India’s diplomatic presence in Afghanistan had ended. Government officials clarified that they would open the visa applications of Afghans of all religions, including Hindus and Sikhs, that they had earlier issued statements about. On Tuesday, the MEA set up an “MEA’s 24x7 Special Afghanistan Cell” for all those needing evacuation once commercial operations begin. In addition, the Ministry of Home Affairs introduced a new category of electronic visa called the “e-Emergency X-Misc Visa” to fast-track visa applications for all Afghans wishing to travel to India. It will be a six-month visa that will be granted online. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, who is in New York, tweeted, “Understand the anxiety of those seeking to return to India. Airport operations are the main challenge. Discussions on with partners in this regard.” The government will now have to decide on the nature of relations with the Taliban government in Kabul, once it is formally announced, and whether to even maintain a basic engagement in order to continue flight operations into Kabul to evacuate more civilians. “It’s not that we have abandoned the people of Afghanistan. Their welfare and our relationship with them are very much in our mind. We will, going forward, try and continue our interaction with them. I can’t exactly say in what form or manner, as the situation is changing so much,” Mr. Tandon said.

18 August 2021||NEW DELHI/ COIMBATORE,||Oppn. rebuts FinMin on cost of UPA oil bonds||The Congress and the Left on Tuesday reacted sharply to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s assertion that it is difficult to reduce fuel taxes as the government has to foot the bill for oil bonds issued by the UPA, with former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram calling the argument ‘incredible ignorance at best and motivated malignity at the worst’. “The FM’s statement that servicing oil bonds stands in the way of giving relief on petrol and diesel prices is astonishing,” Mr. Chidambaram said, adding the NDA has no right to comment on the fuel subsidy after ‘profiting several times over through exorbitant taxes and cesses on fuel’. “The people know that UPA gave them relief and the NDA is crushing them through oppressive taxes and cesses,” he said, pointing out that the UPA government’s decision to subsidise fuel prices through borrowings, directly or through oil companies as a surrogate of the Central government, was known to every analyst and lender, and was ‘mentally added’ to the fiscal deficit at the time. “In either case, servicing the loan (interest) would be the responsibility of the Central government,” Mr. Chidambaram said. In Coimbatore, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury criticised Ms. Sitharaman’s comments and demanded a ‘complete’ withdrawal of the hikes in excise duty to contain inflation. Earlier on Tuesday, Congress general secretary Ajay Maken said the Narendra Modi government is ‘fleecing’ the common people to make up for shortfalls in corporate tax collections due to the tax rate cuts announced in September 2019. He pointed out that the spending on the servicing of UPA-era oil bonds was merely 3.2% of the taxes collected on petroleum products. Countering Ms. Sitharaman’s claim that high fuel prices are a legacy of UPA era oil bonds, the party claimed that spending on servicing of oil bonds is merely 3.2% of the tax collection from petroleum products.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/oppn-rebuts-finmin-on-cost-of-upa-oil-bonds/article35968133.ece
18 August 2021||August 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Centre gets notice on pleas alleging snooping||Mr. Mehta said any revelation about any software allegedly used by government to counter terrorism would compromise national security. “They [petitioners] want us to say whether Pegasus was used or not… It is nobody’s case that interception is done by governments for the purpose of national security. Softwares are used… They want to know which software is used… No government will say which software is used because if we divulge, terrorists may take advantage. Which software is used or not is a matter of national security. It cannot be a matter of public debate,” Mr. Mehta stated at the start of the virtual hearing. He clarified that the government was not refusing to reveal anything to anybody at all. “We are just saying we will not reveal it publicly,” he observed. “Tomorrow, a web portal may start a narrative that certain military equipment are used for some illegitimate purpose. A petition may be filed by a person who has nothing to do with this issue and who wants the military to declare whether the apparatus was used or not. I will be failing in my duty if I advice the government to divulge it on affidavit,” Mr. Mehta contended. The government had fairly agreed in court to form a committee of experts to inquire into the reports of Pegasus snooping, he noted. “As a responsible government, we are submitting that we will form a committee of neutral experts, whose report will be placed before the Supreme Court… I repeat, it is not my case that I will not divulge anything. All will be revealed before the committee… Let me do that before a committee… Permit us to form a committee… We will place its report before the Supreme Court itself,” Mr. Mehta stated. Justice Kant said there was no question of compromising national security. “We are not going to ask you to divulge anything that will harm the defence of the nation… We are extremely reluctant to say anything on that. But the question here is that there are some persons of eminence who have come here, saying there has been interception of their phones… That can be done, but with the permission of the competent authority… What is the problem if that competent authority filed an affidavit before us? In the affidavit we don’t want a single word on any aspect that relates to the security of the nation... All we are saying is that we are issuing simple notice… Let the competent authority say to what extent what information can be disclosed,” he explained. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, for veteran journalists N. Ram and Sashi Kumar, said “the security of the state is as important to the citizen as it is to the state”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-gets-notice-on-pleas-alleging-snooping/article35968136.ece

18 August 2021||August 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Mysterious workings of fate||Fate is powerful in the lives of people. All beings, right from Brahma to the tiniest ant, are under its influence and have to abide by its dictates. The truth is that one's good and bad deeds have to bear fruit. This means that each one has to experience the fruits of one's actions, good or bad. The effects last only as long as these are felt and experienced. In the Ramayana, where the main purpose of Rama avatar is Ravana samhara, many practical aspects of destiny's role are discussed as and when the events unfold, pointed out Sri R. Krishnamurthy Sastrigal in a discourse. Alongside, there are many lessons for humanity trying to cope with calamities beyond one's control, as when Rama's coronation is cancelled. Rama accepts it with equanimity and shows by example the way to deal with such occurrences that are characteristic of life. Whoever thought that Kaikeyi, who had always showered affection on Rama, should turn and deflect in this manner? Rama tells Lakshmana that though Kaikeyi bears the burden of blame, it is clear that she is impelled by fate. Lakshmana represents the rational mind that does not believe in fate. He is angry with his father who has forgotten the dharma that the eldest son alone is heir to the kingdom and has tamely yielded to the wishes of Kaikeyi. None can ever hope to decipher the mysterious workings of fate. It is known only after the event has taken place, that is, only when the result is experienced. The case of Parikshit is another example to illustrate the power of fate. The king is led to face the curse of death by snake bite for his inadvertent act towards a sage in meditation. A purana story describes how destiny had its final say despite all efforts on the part of the king to fortify himself against the curse from happening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mysterious-workings-of-fate/article35968150.ece

Sharing a short video reportedly of a Taliban fighter weeping in joy on reaching the outskirts of the Afghanistan capital, Mr. Tharoor tweeted, “It sounds as if there are at least two Malayali Taliban here — one who says ‘samsaarikatte’ [‘let me speak’ in Malayalam) around the 8-second mark & another who understands him!” However, a Twitter user said they were speaking Brahvi, which sounds similar to Dravidian languages and is spoken in the Zabul province of Afghanistan. Mr. Tharoor, however, seemed far from fully convinced about that theory. “Interesting explanation. Will leave it to the linguists to figure this one out. But there have indeed been misguided Malayalis who joined the Taliban, so that possibility cannot be ruled out entirely,” he tweeted subsequently. This seems to have further infuriated many, especially Malayalis, who were already enraged by his earlier tweet. A Twitter user said Mr. Tharoor had forced the entire Malayali community to defend itself against being branded as terrorist sympathisers. “Why don’t you leave us alone,” he said. “Shashi Tharoor tweets out BJP-RSS propaganda about Malayali Talibanis based on ‘ONE’ word in a video which sounds similar to Malayalam,” another tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tharoors-tweet-creates-a-furore/article35968149.ece

18 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Where folk arts and Western music too thrived||While the city is conventionally associated with Carnatic music, Madras actually was a fertile land for the flourishing of several folk forms and western music. Even as the sounds of song have retired online during the COVID-19 pandemic, here is a hark back to a colourful and mellifluous past. The British constructed churches and brought pipe organs for their worship services. Madras got its first taste of Western classical music when the British came to trade. Churches were the focal point for Western classical music then and parts of pipe organs were imported by ship and assembled here. St. Thomas Basilica (Santhome Church) is among the churches that still has a pipe organ being used for worship services. Augustine Paul, music director, Madras Musical Association (MMA), said the churches were the best venues for sacred choral music and instrumental music as they were acoustically well-designed. Sunday evenings were dedicated to such music concerts. MMA, which was founded in 1893, was one such organisation that hosted concerts regularly. The Governor of Madras Presidency was its patron, and the Governor’s band used to play on important occasions. There was not much of a gap felt in Madras when the British left the country after Independence as Indian musicians took over and made Western classical music popular in the city. Handel Manuel was the first Indian conductor of MMA. Victor Paranjyoti, who later founded Paranjyoti Choir, was also instrumental in promoting the choral tradition. German and British missionaries, who were also Tamil scholars, translated German and English hymns into Tamil. Similarly, many of the Latin hymns were translated into Tamil. In Chennai, the strong presence of Western classical music to this day could be attributed in some measure to the magnificent Anglican and Scottish churches, including St. Andrew’s Kirk, St. George’s Cathedral and St. Mary’s Church, which are more than 200 years old. During the British period, concerts were also organised to promote secular music outside the churches. Museum Theatre, Egmore, and Madras Club that was founded in 1832 were some of the venues where the British popularised operas and musical plays. Freemasonry, which had its lodges here, also organised music performances. The Madras Chamber Orchestra was famous for instrumental music outside churches, Mr. Paul said. The Anglo-Indian population in Madras also promoted western light music and pop music during the 1950s. Many of them excelled as brass instrument players. When more enthusiasts adopted Western music and Carnatic exponents experimented, there was a crossover between Western and Carnatic music that led to fusion music. Muthuswami Dikshithar is also said to have set to tune ‘Nottu Swaras’ using Western notes after he heard Western classical music during his visit to Madras. The Natya Sastra that forms the basis for south Indian music, dance and drama is also the basis for ‘Bhaaratha Koothu’ or ‘Theru-k-Koothu’ as it is known today. “The stories used to be from the Mahabharata, and old areas used to have regular performances,” said author and researcher V.R. Devika, who was smitten by the charm of ‘Theru-k-Koothu’ that she watched in the early 1980s. “Even today there are Koothu artistes who live in the city and continue their art form, a ritualistic spectacle, especially in the month of Aadi, when Amman temples bring in Koothu performers. Amman temples in Madras and the villages surrounding it have always been part of ‘Bhaaratha Vizha’,” said Arumuga Thambiran, who retired as the Dean of the School of Performing Arts, Pondicherry University. He explained that the Othavaadai theatre, which was on a street off Wall Tax Road, was a hub for theatre as well as Koothu shows. “There used to be ticketed shows, and advertisements for Koothu troupes as well. Unlike the present, Koothu was not restricted to temple festivals,” he added. The city, as K. Krishna Iyer wrote in The Hindu , had a thriving folk arts scene. In 1957, he organised a folk dance festival in Madras at N.K.T. Kala Mantap in Triplicane, a popular venue for events in those days. Apart from ‘Draupathi Vasthrapaharanam Koothu’ by Cheyyar Kannan and troupe, the festival had Kaichilambattam by K.C. Ekambaram, Villupaattu by Thozhavai Sundaram and party, Kirikatti Vadhyam by Mahadeva Pillai of Sembanarkoil, and kummi, kolattam and pinnal kolattam by artistes of Triplicane Saraswathi Gana Nilayam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/where-folk-arts-and-western-music-too-thrived/article35968293.ece

18 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Petrol price cut meant to make immediate economic impact’||The Tamil Nadu government has reduced the tax on petrol (by Rs. 3 a litre) to create an immediate economic impact. It had also provided indirect incentives to provide relief to (sections of) diesel-users, Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan informed the Assembly on Tuesday. Responding to V.V. Rajan Chellappa of the AIADMK, who felt a similar reduction in diesel price would have helped the poor, Mr. Thiaga Rajan said the government would make further decisions after monitoring petrol and diesel sales in the last 30 days. He said the government brought petrol price down since it would give relief to two crore two-wheeler riders. “We held a discussion with the Chief Minister and decided to give not just relief but increase the demand and spending powers. We wanted to give an economic stimulus.” Pointing out that oil marketing companies would not share the statistics of petrol and diesel users and the State government had to do its research, Mr. Thiaga Rajan said farmers, fishermen, logistics companies and private vehicles were using diesel, while high-end cars depend on diesel too. “Small cars run on petrol,” he said. Mr. Thiaga Rajan said the government had increased the diesel subsidy for fishermen and the transport [corporations] and given a six-month relief to bus operators from tax payment. “Though a lot of trucks and lorries are operated on diesel, the government has apprehensions about whether a reduction in input cost will reach the last mile. But in the case of petrol, it was very clear that a reduction in its price would benefit two crore bike riders,” he said. As for Mr. Chellappa’s claim that the AIADMK government had not increased taxes, Mr. Thiaga Rajan said that though it had not increased the taxes, it increased the levy on diesel and petrol twice. “Sometimes we have to increase tax. Late Chief Minister M. G. Ramachandran effected a 1% increase in sales tax to feed the children. If a government says it has not increased the tax and has not done anything, what is the need for a government? A good government should tax the appropriate section at the appropriate time for social and economic justice,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/petrol-price-cut-meant-to-make-immediate-economic-impact/article35968313.ece

18 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Poor quality of construction alleged in TNSCB flats||People allotted houses at the newly built flats of the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) at Kesava Pillai (K.P) Park in Pulianthope have complained of poor quality of construction. While the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Makkal Needhi Maiam demanded an inquiry into the construction, DMK MLA I. Paranthamen visited the site on Tuesday. A. Pasupathy, one of the allottees, said, “The quality is so poor that the plaster is coming off even if we scratch with our fingers.” The allottees were staying at the same site in the flats constructed many years ago by TNSCB. As those buildings became dilapidated, TNSCB evacuated the residents in 2018 to temporary shelters to raze the buildings and construct new ones. Two clusters, one with 834 units and another with 1,056, were built. Those already residing at the site were being allotted flats at the cluster with 834 units. “We suffered in the temporary shelters for more than two years without basic amenities. Apart from the construction being poor, TNSCB is demanding Rs. 1.5 lakh as our share for the flats,” Mr. Pasupathy said. G. Selva, secretary, Chennai Central district unit, CPI (M), who recently organised a protest against the demand to pay Rs. 1.5 lakh, alleged the previous government was culpable for the poor construction at an exorbitant budget. “A thorough inquiry must be conducted,” he said. Kamal demands probe MNM founder Kamal Haasan tweeted on Tuesday demanding that the contractor who built the flats be held accountable. “The building must be demolished and constructed afresh by the contractor with their own money. The government should directly monitor the quality of this construction,” he said. The problem was not just at K.P. Park, Vanessa Peter, founder, Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities, said. The government should conduct a thorough study on the quality of all TNSCB tenements. ‘Minor issues’ An official from TNSCB said the board would conduct an inquiry on the issues raised and take action if needed. The official said although the allottees were technically not yet allowed to take possession, many were entering the buildings and some miscreants were intentionally causing damage. Moreover, the official said the buildings faced some “wear and tear” problems as they were used as Covid Care Centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/poor-quality-of-construction-alleged-in-tnscb-flats/article35968300.ece
18 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||No priests removed for new appointments, asserts CM||No traditional temple priest has been removed to open the way for 58 new priests appointed from all communities, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin informed the Assembly on Tuesday. “A section seeks to derail the appointments by deliberately making posts on social media. No priest has been removed... If anyone proves that a priest has been removed for the appointment of the new priests, the government will take immediate action...,” he said after Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Minister P.K. Sekarbabu made a clarification. ‘I don’t blame media’ Mr. Stalin said people knew that a campaign was being run on social media to undermine social justice. The training for archakas, he said, was launched by the Karunanidhi government “to remove the thorn in the heart of Periyar [reformist leader E.V. Ramasamy]”. But the scheme to appoint priests of all castes to temples could not be implemented for some reasons. “Now we have implemented [it] and issued appointment orders. Those who are unable to stomach it are running a campaign on social media. I do not blame the media,” he said. Mr. Sekarbabu earlier said the government had no plans to remove bhattacharyas and other traditional priests. Since Muthukumar, the priest performing puja at the Naganathaswamy temple in Tiruchi, was also looking after the Tharukavaneswarar temple, a new priest was appointed for the Naganathaswamy temple.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-priests-removed-for-new-appointments-asserts-cm/article35968311.ece
18 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Bail denied to POCSO case accused Siva Shankar Baba||The Madras High Court on Tuesday dismissed two bail petitions filed by self-styled godman C.N. Siva Shankaran alias Siva Shankar Baba, 73, of Chennai in two of the three cases booked against him under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act of 2012. Justice M. Dhandapani rejected both petitions after not finding any ground to enlarge the petitioner on bail. The judge was also informed that the Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID) had already filed a chargesheet in the cases. In his petition, Siva Shankaran had claimed that he was not involved in the management of the private residential school at Kelambakkam near Chennai, whose former students had lodged complaints against him after many years of the alleged incidents. He claimed that he had only delivered guest lectures on spirituality and Tamil language in the school. He said one of the complainants was a 21-year-old Bharatnatyam dancer who had accused him of having forcibly hugged and kissed her when she was a student in 2018 and also when she had visited the school for a dance performance after completing schooling. Accusing her of having made false allegations on “imaginary grounds”, he claimed the complaint had been lodged to gain “cheap popularity.” The petitioner also sought bail on health grounds stating that he was a heart patient who was suffering from various other ailments too. According to the accused, he was born at Alankayam in the erstwhile North Arcot district in 1949 and joined a goods carrier transport company in Chennai in 1968 and eventually became its manager. Thereafter, he started his own firm named Ganga Cauvery Roadlines at Broadway in Chennai, constructed a bungalow in Anna Nagar and led a prosperous life. He claimed to have had a “spiritual awakening” in 1984, and went on a pilgrimage to mountains, forests and religious places. “On his enlightened return, the petitioner put up an Ayyappan temple at his house,” the affidavit said and told the court that he quit his family on January 16, 1997, and his wife, son and daughter were now residing in the United States with no connection whatsoever with him. Initially, he started his “spiritual activities” in a small room at Mannadi in Chennai before shifting to the terrace of his devotee’s house in Besant Nagar and then he moved to Neelankarai where Samratchana Trust, founded by him, had purchased 12 grounds of land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-denies-bail-to-pocso-case-accused-siva-shankar-baba/article35968360.ece
18 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. to get 1,650 more medical seats this year: Minister||Health Minister Ma. Subramanian on Tuesday expressed hope that the Union Government would grant permission for 11 medical colleges in Tamil Nadu and a total of 1,650 undergraduate students — 150 students in each college — would be admitted this year. “The Chief Minister sent me to seek permission from the Union Minister for students' admission and we made a request for inspection of the 11 colleges. With completion of inspection in Ooty and Tiruvallur, the inspection of all 11 colleges is over,” he said while responding to AIADMK member V.V. Rajan Chellappa, who said the erstwhile AIADMK government took steps to start the 11 medical colleges. Mr. Subramanian said it was the DMK government [2006-11] led by Kalaignar (M. Karunanidhi) which initiated the scheme for launching medical colleges in every district and administrative sanction was obtained for six colleges. But the government changed in the 2011 election. “[Now] we have already visited all the colleges and the Chief Minister told us to come up with a revised estimate if necessary and we have done everything,” he said. Former Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said the State had only 1,945 MBBS seats till 2011 and former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa increased them to 5,200. Mr. Subramanian said former Union Minister A. Raja succeeded in getting 35 acres for establishing the medical college in Perambalur, and the foundation was also laid. “When I visited there last week, I could not see the board announcing the medical college. The 35 acres have been converted into agriculture land. This is how the AIADMK government speeded up launch of medical colleges,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tn-to-get-1650-more-medical-seats-this-year-minister/article35968308.ece
18 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Restructuring of electricity tariff needs to happen soon, says Finance Secretary||Restructuring of electricity tariffs in Tamil Nadu needs to happen sooner rather than later, and people should be ready to pay for drinking water supply which can be monitored through smart metering systems, Finance Secretary S. Krishnan said. Speaking during a discussion on the State Budget 2020-21 organised by the Madras Institute of Development Studies, Mr. Krishnan said the government was not comfortable with the expenditure situation and subsidies in utilities, especially the electricity board. “Some of our electricity subsidies are clearly unsustainable. The restructuring of electricity tariffs needs to happen sooner than later,” he said. He said the issue of electricity being given to the farm sector also needed to be addressed and this was an issue that none of the political parties even wanted to speak about. Domestic consumption was a much larger issue. “On power being given to farms, you can say it is going for something productive. [But] There is no reason why anyone in this audience needs to be given 100 units of electricity free. We are losing on an average Rs. 6.7 to Rs. 7 per unit on domestic consumption,” he said. He said people should be prepared to pay for drinking water supply as well. “It is currently in a model that is subsidised… actually subsidised for the rich. If you live in a bungalow on Boat Club Road, you pay Rs. 50 per month for whatever quantity of water you consume without any billing. But actually people living in the slums might be carrying just puddles of water everyday and that is probably costing them Rs. 10 a day. Clearly the subsidy is going to the rich,” he said. Mr. Krishnan said there is a need for smart metering.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/restructuring-of-electricity-tariff-needs-to-happen-soon-says-finance-secretary/article35968301.ece
18 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC dismisses Suriya’s plea to waive interest on income tax payments||The Madras High Court on Tuesday dismissed a writ petition filed by actor R.S. Suriya in 2018 to quash an order passed by the Principal Commissioner of Income Tax and consequently direct the official to waive the interest levied for delayed payment of taxes for the assessment years 2007-08 and 2008-09. The assessment orders were passed after a search conducted at his premises on October 19, 2010. Justice S.M. Subramaniam held that the actor was not eligible for waiver of interest since he had not complied with all three conditions to be fulfilled for claiming such a waiver under Section 220 (2A) of the Income Tax Act of 1961. The judge concurred with the Principal Commissioner that the petitioner had neither cooperated in completing the assessment proceedings nor paid the taxes on time. “The reasons furnished in the impugned (challenged) order for rejection of application for waiver of interest are candid and convincing,” the judge observed. The actor had told the court that he receives payments, including advances, in cash with reference to priority in dates. Such advance payments received by him would be treated as income and brought to books for accounting and taxation only in the year when the project materialises. The actor stated that after the 2010 search operation, assessment orders were passed on December 30, 2011, for the years 2007-08 and 2008-09. The judge said the officer had clearly stated how the actor had not cooperated in completing the assessment proceedings in 2011. The officer had also accused the actor of not having furnished full details regarding his income even after the search operation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-dismisses-suriyas-plea-to-waive-interest-on-income-tax-payments/article35968326.ece
18 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||E-Budget cut the need for printed material: Minister||Finance and Human Resources Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan on Tuesday said the paperless Budget presented this year had substantially reduced the need to print documents for the MLAs. He said that in the past, 1,600 copies of 70 books would be printed and each member would get about 8,500 pages. “Many members would not take the books with them, and they were disposed of in bundles as old books. The printed material was wasted, and there was also a problem in disposal,” he said. Mr. Rajan said he took up the issue with the Chief Minister and the Leader of the House because many members would not read the books or refer to the statistics therein. “I wanted to print just 200 copies for the Governor’s office, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, libraries and treasuries. But the Leader of the House said there was a need to give printed copies to the MLAs, so we increased the number to 400,” he said, responding to a question from V.V. Rajan Chellappa of the AIADMK. Mr. Rajan said the MLAs could collect their copies from the same place at Fort St George where they got them earlier. “All the documents have already been uploaded in the computers of all members,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/e-budget-cut-the-need-for-printed-material-minister/article35968320.ece

Palaniswami. “You cannot take today’s debate as a precedent and repeat it in future,” he said. When Mr. Palaniswami sought to raise the attack of ‘Maavu Poochi’ ( Phenacoccus manihoti Matile - Ferrero ) on cassava, Leader of the House Duraimurugan explained that the Speaker had said the notice for the motion was received only on August 14, and it was sent to the Department concerned for a reply. But Mr. Palaniswami said it was a very important issue affecting farmers and should be discussed. Mr. Duraimurugan said a calling attention motion would be taken up only after the Speaker accepted the notice and the Minister concerned was ready with a reply. The motion moved under Rule 55 could not be raised during Zero Hour. But the Speaker allowed Mr. Palaniswami to raise the issue as an exception.

Responding to Leader of the Opposition Edappadi K. Palaniswami, the Minister said the attack was severe in Namakkal, Karur, Coimbatore, Erode, Tiruppur and Salem districts and the crop had suffered between 10% and 80% damage. “Four types of local pests also have attacked cassava,” he added. The Minister said the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University had studied the pest and come out with controlling measures. It would cost a minimum of Rs. 3,900 per acre. ‘Under control’ “Agriculture Department officials are visiting fields and removing affected plants. The disease has come under control because of measures taken by the government,” he said. Mr. Panneerselvam said the pest attack started when the AIADMK was in power and felt it could have been controlled if the government had taken action then.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pest-attack-on-cassava-plant-under-control-says-minister/article35968413.ece

Vasan on Tuesday alleged that the DMK government is blaming the previous AIADMK government and the Centre, and escaping from fulfilling its election promises. “More than 100 days have passed since the DMK came to power. They gave a slew of promises and trusting them, people voted for them. But in the revised Budget as well as in the Agriculture Budget, there were no announcements which met the expectations of the people,” he said, spearheading the party’s protest — to “draw attention” to the DMK’s [unfulfilled] poll promises — near Valluvar Kottam on Tuesday. “They should have at least fulfilled the major promises. This shows they are not concerned about the people. If the financial position was the reason, were they not aware of it while making the promises?” Mr. Vasan questioned. He asked what happened to promises like giving Rs. 1,000 per month to housewives, a cut in diesel prices and waiver of jewel and educational loans. “They [DMK] are saying that the promises would be fulfilled in the course of five years. It is delaying tactics and people won’t accept it. People had high expectations of the DMK government,” Mr. Vasan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-escaping-from-poll-promises-by-blaming-previous-govt-centre/article35968305.ece
18 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Fake godmen belittling genuine spiritual souls, says Madras High Court||The Madras High Court on Tuesday lamented that the image of genuine spiritual souls is being tarnished and belittled by fake godmen who use political and money power as catalyst to crystalise their evil intentions such as subjecting women and children to sexual harassment. The court also said that despite all evil acts, the “unscrupulous self-styled godmen” manage to maintain their social status due to gullible devotees. Justice M. Dhandapani made the observations while dismissing two bail petitions preferred by C.N. Siva Shankaran alias Siva Shankar Baba, 73, of Chennai, who was facing three cases booked against him under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act of 2012 and other provisions of IPC following complaints lodged by former students of a residential school in the city. Not finding any reason to grant bail to the petitioner since the police had made out a prima facie case against him, the judge said the petitioner would not be entitled to bail also because he was influential and capable of influencing the victims and other witnesses if he was enlarged on bail. The judge said the allegations levelled against the petitioner could not be brushed aside just because of the delay in lodging the complaints. “In this case, the allegation is that the petitioner has been involved in perverted acts against his devotees, who are none else than his students in the spiritual arena,” the judge observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fake-godmen-belittling-genuine-spiritual-souls-says-madras-high-court/article35968306.ece

Arguing a contempt of court petition before Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu, senior counsel P. Wilson, representing the DMK, said the High Court had last year directed the Centre to implement reservations only for the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in the AIQ medical seats. When the direction was not complied with, the party chose to move the present contempt plea this year. Thereafter, the Centre decided to provide reservations not only for OBCs but for EWS as well, he pointed out. Stating that the Government of Tamil Nadu had not accepted EWS reservation and had not implemented it, the senior counsel insisted that the Centre ought to have obtained the consent of the State government before applying EWS reservation to the seats offered to AIQ. After hearing him out, the judges adjourned the case to Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-questions-centres-provision-of-ews-reservation-in-aiq-medical-seats/article35968314.ece

The government has named Sultan Ahmed Ismail, part-time member, State Development Policy Council, as chairman of the seven-member committee. The terms of reference for the study on exploration and extraction of hydrocarbon projects in areas other than the Cauvery delta region will assess the impact of drilling technologies like hydro fracturing on groundwater and the environment. The committee will assess the impact of chemicals on the quality of surface water, flowing water, groundwater, soil and fertility of the land, irrigation sources, cultivation of crops, air quality, sea water intrusion and flora and fauna. It will also assess the quantity of groundwater required to be drawn out for carrying out exploration of coal bed methane, shale gas, petroleum and natural gas and whether such large-scale pumping of groundwater will lead to its depletion. In addition to this, the committee will see if drilling will lead to any subsidence of land and de-stabilise the tectonic plates below the area of exploration. The impact of such projects on the livelihoods of the people and food security of the region will also be assessed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/committee-to-study-exploration-of-hydrocarbon-projects-reconstituted/article35968321.ece

There may be an increase in rain from Saturday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Thunderstorm activity may continue over a few places of the State throughout the week owing to convective activity influenced by wind convergence.

18 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Cooking gas price goes up||The State-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) on Tuesday increased the price of domestic cooking gas by Rs. 25.50 a cylinder. In Chennai, a domestic cylinder containing 14.2 kg of gas is priced at Rs. 875.50 and the smaller 5 kg cylinder at Rs. 322.50. The last revision was on July 1 when it was Rs. 850.50 per cylinder. Usually, OMCs revise prices on the first of every month. Such constant increases badly hits poor consumers, said Elijah Mathew, who runs an NGO for residents of a slum in Perungudi. “These are people who have lost their jobs and do not have any income. They are somehow surviving with rice from fair price shops. It is really unfair to burden them with the hikes. Many got connections under the Ujjwala Scheme since they were not able to get gas connections. Now, they cannot buy cylinders and are going back to picking up firewood to cook,” he said. Kausalya of Kannagi Nagar said she had bought a wood-fired clay stove and had been using it to cook since gas prices were going up constantly. “I collect sticks for the fire. It does not cost me anything and I can prolong the booking of my gas cylinder. My family depends only on my salary, which is meagre. It would be nice if the subsidy amount at least for families like ours, was increased,” she said. Subsidy amount S.A. Ponnusamy, Tamil Nadu Milk Dealers’ Employees Welfare Association, said the subsidy amount should go up correspondingly along with increase in gas prices. It had come down from Rs. 563 a cylinder to a mere Rs. 25. The government should roll back the increase and make cylinders more affordable for the poor and middle class, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cooking-gas-price-up/article35968296.ece
18 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Thiaga Rajan expresses apology for remarks||A heated exchange between the ruling DMK and the main Opposition AIADMK in the Assembly on Tuesday was put to rest after Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan tendered an apology directed at V. Sampathkumar of the AIADMK. Speaker M. Appavu expunged certain remarks made by both parties on several occasions. During a general discussion on the revised Budget for 2021-22 and the agriculture budget, Mr. Sampathkumar (Harur) made certain remarks that were objected to by Mr. Thiaga Rajan, who in turn made certain remarks. After Leader of the Opposition Edappadi K. Palaniswami objected to the Minister’s remarks, Leader of the House Duraimurugan intervened and suggested that the remarks from both sides be removed. Mr. Appavu expunged the remarks, but the matter did not end there. When Mr. Thiaga Rajan intervened during Mr. Sampathkumar’s speech to give an explanation, Mr. Palaniswami argued that the Minister was giving a lengthy explanation. Mr. Duraimurugan, however, said Ministers were free to choose the length of their explanations. “When you were in power, we made the same request. But your Ministers went about giving long explanations; sometimes, we would step out for tea and return, only to see the Ministers continuing their replies.” Mr. Thiaga Rajan said he would try to keep his replies short but wanted to make sure that to those he gave the explanation had grasped it. When he wondered whether the AIADMK MLA could repeat the explanations he offered, Mr. Palaniswami objected and made certain remarks that were expunged following objections from some DMK members. Mr. Duraimurugan rose again to pacify Mr. Palaniswami.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thiaga-rajan-expresses-apology-for-remarks/article35968317.ece

18 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘5% of govt. lands under illegal occupation’||Claiming that almost 5% of the government lands in Tamil Nadu are under illegal occupation, Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan on Tuesday told the Assembly that a bill will be introduced to reclaim them and cancel fake registrations. Besides, the proposed law would provide for taking retrospective action against those who had registered documents illegally. Responding to the issue of illegal registration of government lands raised by legislator ‘Panruti’ T. Velmurugan, Mr. Rajan said the government had two plans to reclaim the lands. One was to develop a GPS-linked land management system with a database for the better understanding of all government departments. The other was to introduce a bill that would pave the way for correction of documents at the level of the Inspector General of Registration and take retrospective action against those who were involved in the illegal registration. P. Moorthy, Minister for Commercial Taxes and Registration, said since sub-registrars did not have the power to correct fake registrations, a bill would be introduced to bestow power on the Inspector General of Registration to cancel those registrations. Retrospective effect “Accordingly, all such registrations would be cancelled with retrospective effect,” he said. Mr. Rajan said even lands leased out during the British period were not reclaimed after the expiry of the lease term. “As per the CAG report, 2.05 lakh hectares of government lands are in the hands of encroachers. I would like to share another detail. Almost 5% of government lands have been encroached. In Chennai alone, 23% of land is under illegal occupation,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/5-of-govt-land-under-illegal-occupation/article35968323.ece

The court directed the company to reply to the notice within five weeks. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D.

18 August 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Notices served on encroachers in and around Valankulam tank||Coimbatore Corporation on Monday served notices on people who had encroached upon public space in and around the Valankulam tank to move out within the next few days. Near the Sungam roundabout, the Corporation issued notices to occupants of 52 houses in Eri Medu, on the way to Indira Nagar, to move out in the next 15 days. Sources said the Corporation had told the residents that the land they had encroached upon was necessary for the completion of flyover on Trichy Road. An exit ramp from the flyover to the Sungam-Ukkadam Road passed through the area, and the Highways Department that was constructing the flyover needed the land to erect columns, they said. The Corporation had asked the 52 families to approach the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board within the next 15 days to get alternative accommodation. On reaching out to the Board, the residents would get temporary allotment of flats in the Board’s Kovaipudur or Vellalore project. They could stay there until the Board completed the Ukkadam Pillukadu project, where they had been allotted flats. Likewise, the Corporation had served notices on 15 residents in Highways Colony, near the Valankulam tank’s northern bund. Though the residents had built houses as per rules, projects or temporary structures from their houses encroached upon public space. Hence the notice, the sources said and added that the residents had 15 days to act. Continuing its action against people who had encroached upon the water body, the Corporation had also issued notice to occupants of 15 shops on Burma Shell Lane, off Lanka Corner. Though the Corporation had issued notices more than six months ago to the 15 persons, they failed to comply with the notice. Now the Corporation had issued a fresh notice, this time giving only three days. If they failed to act, the civic body by this weekend would remove the structures built encroaching on the tank, the sources added. Fresh survey Meanwhile, the Corporation had also begun a fresh survey to identify more encroachments on the tank, particularly on its northern bund, as it had received a few complaints that it had removed only temporary structures and not permanent structures that were also encroachments. If there were encroachments, as alleged, the Corporation would definitely act, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/notices-served-on-encroachers-in-and-around-valankulam-tank/article35968342.ece
18 August 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Govt. should have evacuated Indians from Afghanistan much earlier, says Yechury||Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Tuesday criticised the Central government for its alleged failure in planning the evacuation of Indians from Afghanistan much earlier, as the airspace was shut down following the takeover of the country by the Taliban. Mr. Yechury arrived at Coimbatore for a two-day State Committee meeting of the CPI(M). Speaking to mediapersons prior to the meeting, he said many countries evacuated their citizens after witnessing the rapid advances made by the Taliban in Afghanistan. “At least for 10 days or two weeks now, it was evident what was going to happen. What were our pre-emptive moves?” he asked. Describing the situation in Afghanistan as a “grave humanitarian problem,” he demanded that the Central government provided information on the steps taken to ensure the safety of Indian citizens there. Mr. Yechury also alleged that India was seen as a “subordinate ally” of the United States of America. “The world must understand that it is not the fact why did the USA withdrew [from Afghanistan] so abruptly. The fact is that the USA should never have gone there,” he said. The CPI (M) leader termed the Pegasus snooping row a “brazen destruction of Indian democracy” and claimed that the government’s response in the Supreme Court on Monday was an “admission that they have used” the Pegasus spyware. Criticising the Centre’s move to observe August 14 as ‘Partition Horrors Remembrance Day’, Mr. Yechury said India went beyond the horrors of the Partition by adopting a secular and democratic Constitution and that the government must focus on “strengthening” the Constitution further. On the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Yechury claimed that it had now become “impossible” for the Central government to achieve its target of vaccinating the adult population by the end of this year as it would require the vaccination of “more than one crore a day” till December 31. “It appears that they (Central government) are inviting the third wave,” he charged, flaying the government’s alleged “mismanagement” of the pandemic. He also urged the Central government to withdraw the excise duty hikes on petroleum products immediately. In September, the CPI(M) would organise nationwide protests along with other Opposition parties with a raft of demands “for people’s welfare and [to] control the pandemic,” he said. Fuel prices Mr. Yechury also criticised the comments made by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on the Central government being unable to cut excise duty on petrol and diesel as it is paying back the cost of oil bonds issued to companies by the erstwhile UPA government. He claimed that the government earned Rs. 3.71 lakh-crore as revenue from excise duty in the financial year 2020-21 alone. “In the last seven years, the Modi government made Rs. 15.6 lakh-crores from these hikes in excise duty,” he said. These hikes were “the actual reason” behind the increase in fuel prices, Mr. Yechury said, demanding the withdrawal of the hike in excise duty “completely” to contain inflation. Coimbatore MP P.R. Natarajan and Politburo member of CPI(M) G. Ramakrishnan were present with Mr. Yechury at the press conference.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-should-have-evacuated-indians-from-afghanistan-much-earlier-yechury/article35968358.ece

First Additional District Judge S. Nagarajan awarded the punishment to K. Balakrishnan (25), a native of Dharmapuri. Balakrishnan had murdered R. Kariammal, a resident of Soundamman Kovil Street near Ondipudur, when she was alone at her residence on March 2, 2019. Balakrishnan committed the crime around 2.15 p.m. when Kariammal’s son R. Arumugam left the house after lunch. A relative who visited the house around 4.30 p.m. found her with injuries on the face and head. Mr. Arumugam later confirmed that four sovereigns of jewellery worn by his mother were missing. A special team headed by Inspector R. Vivekandan nabbed Balakrishnan two days after the incident.

18 August 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||RoDTEP rates get mixed response from exporters||The Union government’s notification of Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) on Tuesday received mixed reaction from the exporting sectors in Coimbatore region. A Sakthivel, president of Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said the much-awaited rates will help ease the liquidity for exporters, ensuring predictability and stability in the long term. The RoDTEP rates, which provide zero rebating of exports, are WTO compatible and thus will continue for long time until all the products and services are brought within the ambit of GST and embedded incidence is completely neutralised. “The RoDTEP coupled with GST refund and Duty Drawback ensure that our export products do not contain any incidence of taxes and duties,” he said. Coverage sectors He sought coverage sectors such as pharma, organic and inorganic chemicals, articles of iron and steel and iron steel under RoDTEP with effect from 1st January, 2021. Southern India Mills’ Association Chairman Ashwin Chandran said cotton yarn and fabrics were so far eligible only for duty drawback. From now on both these will be covered under RoDTEP. This will give an impetus to Indian exports, convert the raw cotton being exported into value added products, increase foreign exchange and create jobs for several lakhs of people, apart from using the surplus capacity already created both in the spinning and weaving sectors. Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI) chairman T. Rajkumar said export of textiles products suffered in the last few years due to the non-availability of duty-free access. The Indian textile industry was attracting embedded taxes to the tune of 6 % - 8% on cotton yarn and cotton fabrics products and the same were not getting refunded to them at any stage. These products were so far eligible only for duty drawback. Now, cotton yarn will get 3.8 % RoDTEP with a cap of Rs. 11.40 per kg and woven fabric 4.3 % with a cap of Rs. 3.4 per sq. metre. However, knitted fabric has been given only 1%. Mr. Rajkumar requested the Government to review the rate based on modular RoDTEP calculation. Knitted fabric made out of yarn should get a higher benefit than the yarn which has been taken care of in the case of woven fabric, he said. ‘Disappointed’ United Planters’ Association of Southern India (UPASI) president Prashant Bhansali said in a press statement that the plantation sector is disappointed with the RoDTEP rates announced for plantation commodities - tea, coffee, pepper and cardamom at 1% except for Black Tea (leaf and dust) in bulk which is at 1.7% and Natural Rubber at 1.4%. Plantation commodities that were exported were earlier getting the benefit of 5%, which was subsequently reduced to 3% under MEIS Scheme. “The lower RoDTEP rates would have serious implications on the competitiveness of the export of plantation commodities from India, especially since exports are on a down-trend,” he said. Export of plantation commodities needs to be supported as they were at a competitive disadvantage compared to other exporting origins due to infrastructural inefficiencies and other associated costs. Freight rates have also gone up by more than 150 % in the past 12 months, he said. Manoj Kumar Patodia, chairman of Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council, said the notification would go a long way not only in ensuring the healthy development of the textile value chain, but also improve India’s competitiveness in overseas markets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rodtep-rates-get-mixed-response-from-exporters/article35968440.ece
18 August 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||NGO urges Corpn. to clean Valankulam tank||Kovai Kulangal Pathugappu Amaipu, a water conservation NGO, has urged the Coimbatore Corporation, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, and Fisheries Department to stop pollution and conserve biodiversity in Valankulam tank. In its letter, the organisation’s Coordinator R. Manikandan said water in Valankulam tank had turned green with dead fish floating around. At the mouth of the pipeline where the Ukkadam water flowed into the tank, not only pond fish was floating but also sea fish, quite alien to the environment. The authorities concerned should investigate those behind the dumping of sea fish in huge quantity into the tank and also examine the floating fish to say if they were fit or unfit for consumption. Mr. Manikandan also drew the officials’ attention to sewage mixed with faeces flowing through a channel running along the lane off Lanka Corner. As the mouth of the channel was choked, the sewage remained stagnant releasing a foul odour. Besides, sewage from eateries opposite the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital flowed directly into Valankulam and so were the waste from toilets constructed for workers who executed the Smart Cities Mission work. Waste from the workers’ toilets was collected in an open septic tank and from that septic tank went a pipe discharging sewage into Valankulam, he said and urged the Coimbatore Corporation to initiate action the contractor concerned for polluting the water body. The Corporation that had carried out beautification work in Valankulam under the Smart Cities Mission should not allow the water quality to deteriorate, he said and urged the civic body to make the water safe for humans, birds and aquatic organisms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ngo-urges-corpn-to-clean-valankulam-tank/article35968344.ece

P. Muthusamy (56), the suspended VA of Ottarpalayam village office, was booked under Section 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code based on the complaint lodged by K. Gopalsamy (40), a farmer from Gobirasapuram near Annur. Video evidence Though Gopalsamy had lodged a complaint with the Annur police on August 6 evening, alleging that he was beaten up by the VA in the afternoon, the police did not register a case. The complaint was only entered in the Community Service Register (CSR). Police sources said that a case was not registered back then due to lack of evidence to substantiate his claim. At the same time, there was video evidence of Muthusamy falling at his feet. The police claimed that Gopalsamy was at large after he was booked on August 8 based on the complaints of the VA and the Village Administrative Officer V. Kalaiselvi, probably fearing arrest. The controversy saw a twist when another video that surfaced on social media last week showed Muthusamy assaulting Gopalsamy, proving that the latter’s claim was true. The video was shot by the same man who captured Muthusamy falling at Gopalsamy’s feet. Though the police tried to convince Gopalsamy to lodge another complaint, he did not come forward. The police sought the direction of a court to register a case based on the CSR entered on August 6 and booked Muthusamy on Monday. The Revenue Department transferred the VA and VAO to two different village offices on August 11 after the second video surfaced. The action was taken after the Department found that the two government officials submitted false information to the inquiry team headed the District Revenue Officer appointed by the District Collector. On Monday, the Collector placed the two officials under suspension.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/village-assistant-booked-for-assaulting-farmer/article35968346.ece

18 August 2021||CUDDALORE,TAMIL NADU||Veeranam tank receives inflow||After remaining bone dry for the last few months, the Veeranam tank in Kattumannarkovil has started receiving significant inflow, raising the hopes of farmers in the district to take up Samba cultivation. On Tuesday, the storage at Veeranam tank stood at 586 million cubic feet of water, out of its total capacity of 1,465 mcft. The tank, which remained at dead storage level at the beginning of the monsoon, has been receiving an inflow of 786 cubic feet per second (cusecs) from the Mettur dam in Salem district. At this stage, the tank is expected to reach its full capacity in the next two weeks. The tank gets its supply from the Vadavar channel at the Lower Anicut on the Coleroon river, a tributary of the Cauvery. At present, the Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSW) has been drawing 27 cusecs from the tank daily while another 16 cusecs was being drawn from the Wallajah tank in the district. “Once the water level in the tank reaches capacity, a decision will be taken on the release of water after holding consultations with the farmers’ associations,” an official of the Public Works Department (PWD) said. The Veeranam tank, one of the main drinking water sources for Chennai, irrigates about 45,000 acres of agricultural land in Bhuvanagiri, Kumaratchi, Parangipettai, Keerapalayam and Kattumannarkovil blocks in Cuddalore. Poor management K.V. Elangeeran, president of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Federation, pointed out that poor water management had resulted in nearly 2 tmc of water wasted as run-off annually. The PWD should increase the storage level of the tank to ensure a good harvest for farmers, he added. It should evolve a strategy and release the surplus water into the irrigation canal and channels. This would also recharge the ground water level in these areas, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/veeranam-tank-receives-inflow/article35968641.ece
18 August 2021||Dharmapuri,TAMIL NADU||Farmers, scrap dealers warned against profiteering on subsidised goods||Following complaints of drip irrigation equipment issued at a subsidy being sold in the open market by farmers, Collector S. Dhivyadarshini has warned of action against farmers and scrap dealers profiteering on subsidised goods. Drip irrigation equipment are being provided to farmers under the Prime Minister’s Drip Irrigation Scheme at varying rates of subsidies. Under the scheme, implemented through the Department of Agriculture and Horticulture, farmers are provided with 100% subsidy (for not exceeding 2 ha) and 75% subsidy (for not exceeding 5 ha). The equipment are issued at a subsidy for a period of use not less than 7 years. However, allegations of equipment being sold off at the open market by beneficiary farmers have risen forcing the administration to issue a warning against violators. According to the Collector, the drip irrigation implements given through a 100 % and 75% subsidy to deserving farmers shall be used only for farm use and shall not be sold in the open market. Scrap dealers, and plastic dealers are also warned against purchase of such drip irrigation equipment from the farmers with the knowledge that they were issued through subsidy. According to the administration, the agricultural equipment that were issued to the farmers incurred a cost to the government. The equipment are deemed as the property of the government and are meant solely for the farm use, the Collector has said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-scrap-dealers-warned-against-profiteering-on-subsidised-goods/article35968443.ece

Population had increased in the Corporation limits, leading to development of all the wards in the four zones. The workers were involved in collecting municipal solid waste from households from 6.30 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. and segregating it. Due to shortage of workers, those involved in drinking water supply were being used for solid waste management, the petition said. The workers were also involved in mass cleaning activities in the wards on all days which were earlier done only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. “Since mass cleaning is done from 6.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. every day, cleaning works in wards could not be done,” they said and wanted workers appointed for mass cleaning activities.

18 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Various aspects of maintenance of roads in rural areas discussed||Central government’s Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana initiative had helped the villages in the nooks and corners of the nation, with road connectivity in the last 20 years, said Virudhunagar MP. B Manickam Tagore. Presiding over a seminar organised as part of ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav campaign,’ on maintenance of rural roads here on Tuesday, he said that the road connectivity would not have been possible without the help of government officials. He further stated that Tamil Nadu was also among the States that benefitted most from the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), followed by Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. The seminar focused on the different aspects of maintenance of rural roads. It was attended by Panchayat Union chairpersons and government officials relating to rural development. Former Chief Engineer, State Highways Department, A K Rajaduraivelpandian, elaborated on the three important things that need to be taken into consideration while initiating new roads or reconstructing a road – the California bearing ratio, the traffic survey in that area and the data relating to water percolation. “Officials who are in-charge of roads can be fondly called as road doctors, because we need to take good care of them,” he humorously said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/various-aspects-of-maintenance-of-roads-in-rural-areas-discussed/article35968679.ece
18 August 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Schools await reopening||Schools in the city are prepared to welcome students back to their campuses, if the government decides to open schools for students from Classes IX-XII next month. “Teachers, students and parents will be happy, if the schools are re-opened, as it has been difficult to keep the students glued to online classes on a regular basis. We all are looking forward to it, but it won’t be without some challenges,” said Headmaster of St. Mary’s Higher Secondary School L. John Alexander. Schools with bigger student count will have a lot of thinking to do, he added. “ Our school has 2,600 students in classes 9 to 12. If we are asked to accommodate 20 to 25 students in a class, we need to allocate more sections for which we need more teachers. We also need to figure out a timetable that will work out well, with the present number of teachers,” he added. Sharmila Banu, Headmaster of the Ponmudiyar Corporation Higher Secondary School, said that regular sanitisation of the school premises has been happening, even in the absence of the students. “Corporation Commissioner asked us to keep the schools clean and sanitised, even when students were not coming. Sanitisation is done 2-3 times in a week. Some repair works are also being undertaken currently,” she told. K.S. Narayanan, Headmaster of Sethupathi Higher Secondary School, was confident that the school could face the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. “In January this year, schools functioned with the prescribed SOP. Students were seated by maintaining social distancing. They were provided sanitisers and masks. We also placed hand-washing facilities near the toilets and at the entrances. We will continue to follow all those things this time too,” he added. P. Vijaya, City Corporation’s Education Officer, assured that vaccination among teachers was done at a fast pace in Corporation schools. “Many exclusive vaccination camps for teachers were conducted by the Corporation. Around 75% of teachers is vaccinated. Those that were infected by Covid-19 had to wait to take the jab. Otherwise, both regular and contract workers in Corporation schools are vaccinated.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/schools-await-reopening/article35968675.ece
18 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Good news for those with low or no vision||Wearing a pair of Smart Vision Spectacles (SVS) fitted with AI (Artificial Intelligence) features will now help individuals with visual impairments move around with more confidence and also listen to texts in English and 73 Indian regional languages. The device was introduced at Aravind Eye Hospital (AEH) and is claimed to be the first of its kind launched in the country for the visually impaired. “It will enable them to use it beneficially for their education and also empower them in their daily lives, where mobility is impeded,” Dr.P Vijayalakshmi, Chief Paediatric Ophthalmologist and Head of Vision Rehabilitation Centre told The Hindu . The device is like any normal wearable eye glasses but fitted with two pen drive like gadgets on the arms that rest on the ears. The left pen drive has a camera with a flash that captures images within two metres of the face, identifies objects and warns of the obstacles in front and around, in order to make walking unobstructive. The tool also stores images and details of people known to the wearer and recognises and identifies the name and details, if the person comes in the line of vision. It also reads out texts by pressing the control buttons formatted in Braille on the frame. Manufactured by Bengaluru-based software company Smart Global Technology in collaboration with Boston-based NGO, Vision Aid, the prototype was tried with 50 patients at AEH over the last 10 months. The trials and feedback were meticulously run by vision rehabilitationist Flora Jeyaseeli. “Patients were able to tell us exactly what they wanted and it helped to tweak the model to optimum weight, size, shape and use,” Dr.Vijayalakshmi said. According to her, smart eyewears are available abroad but at a prohibitive cost, from Rs. 4 lakh to Rs. 8 lakh. “The SVS here costs Rs. 22,000 and reads in English in Indian accent for easy understanding,” she added. The Rotary Club (Chennai-East) has sponsored the first batch of 300 SVS.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/good-news-for-those-with-low-or-no-vision/article35968681.ece
18 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Regularisation of contract workers’ service sought||Members of the Central Organisation of Tamil Nadu Electricity Employees (COTE), affiliated to the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), Madurai, staged a protest in front of the TNEB office at K. Pudur, demanding regularisation of services of contract employees. The body felt that though the contract workers in the TNEB were the manpower that stepped up whenever an emergency or breakdown happened, they were never given the recognition they deserved. Many of them have remained as contract workers for 10 to 15 years, said a State executive member of the organisation, K Jeevanandham. “We want permanent employment for them. The DMK had taken up this issue in their election manifesto. We hope to get the government’s attention with this protest,” he said. Mr. Jeevanandham said these employees were kept off the record and their families ended up getting no benefits, if they died in harness. During emergencies like Cyclones Vardah, Gaja and Ockhi, these contract workers were taken to different parts of the State for taking up restoration work and were paid double or triple wages. Hence, they needed more official recognition in employment, he said. “In 2018, TNEB promised to give a daily wage of Rs. 380 for them. We want it on record and regularisation of service,” he added. Apart from wiremen, helpers and other workers from TNEB, these contract workers play a major role in pole works undertaken in extension areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/regularisation-of-contract-workers-service-sought/article35968683.ece

The court said that it was a policy decision of the government. A Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and K.

18 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Rangasamy planning to discuss Statehood issue with Modi||Chief Minister N. Rangasamy will take up the issue of Statehood for Puducherry with Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he calls on him next week. “There is no change in his stand on the Statehood issue even after an alliance with the BJP (the party has been non-committal on getting Statehood). He will certainly raise the issue with the Prime Minister and Union Home Minister Amit Shah during his visit. The Chief Minister’s Office is collecting details for a memorandum seeking Statehood to be submitted to the Prime Minister,” a top source in the government told The Hindu . A person close to Mr. Rangasamy said the Chief Minister was expected to take the COVID-19 vaccine shot in one or two days before he calls on the Prime Minister. He had delayed the vaccination as he was infected by the virus. The Chief Minister will request the Prime Minister to either accord Statehood or amend the Union Territories Act, 1963, delegating more powers to the elected representatives and officers down the line. As per the provisions of the Act, the administrator of the Union Territory means the Lt. Governor. Mr. Rangasamy had, in his conversations with Ministers and officers close to him, indicated that in the existing administrative set up there was no point in availing of funds or evolving welfare and development programmes as there were no powers with the Chief Minister or Ministers. “Even the power to clear a file for a bill of around Rs. 2,000 for repair of lifts at the government hospital is with the Lt. Governor. The Chief Minister is of the view that the system was changed in the last five years. Now, the powers are vested with the Lt. Governor or Secretaries. What is the point in talking about the revival of the Anglo-French Textile Mill with private participation when the Union Territory government has no power to even lease the land to an entity?” the source said.  The source said the Chief Minister was keen on Statehood or amending the Act so that more powers could be delegated to the Cabinet and officials down the line of Scretaries. Mr. Rangasamy would also press for a bureaucratic shake-up at the Secretary level when he calls on the Prime Minister, the source added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rangasamy-planning-to-discuss-statehood-issue-with-modi/article35968639.ece

Namassivayam said here on Tuesday. He was talking to reporters after inaugurating solar power projects with government subsidy. 1 KW plants Mr. Namassivayam, who also holds the Electricity portfolio, said a 1 KW plant could produce 135 units of solar power in a month. A person required to have 1 sq m of shadeless rooftop to establish a 1 KW solar power plant, he said. A rough calculation by the department revealed that a person could save at least Rs. 300 per month on electricity bills by having 1 KW plant at home. Urging the people to turn towards renewable energy, the Home Minister said the expenditure involved in setting up a 1KW to 3 KW capacity plant would be around Rs. 33,900. Of the capital cost incurred, the Centre would provide 40% as subsidy, he added. With proper maintenance, the plants would have a lifespan of around 20 years. Solar plants could help save money and reduce electricity requirements, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/subsidised-solar-power-projects-inaugurated-in-puducherry/article35968637.ece

Police said Arunachalam, 45, of Kulasekarapattinam was working as a ‘parotta’ master in an eatery in Kayalpattinam. He used to assault his wife Petchiammal, 34, under the influence of alcohol after returning from work around midnight, and the neighbours would intervene to save the woman, the mother of a girl child. When Arunachalam started beating up Petchiammal on Monday night, she resisted the attempt. Enraged over this, Arunachalam bit her finger and attacked her with an iron rod in which she sustained multiple injuries. Suddenly, Petchiammal snatched the rod from him and retaliated, in which Arunachalam reportedly swooned. She summoned her mother Vadivu to her house and the two women reportedly strangulated Arunachalam to death with a piece of cloth.

18 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||39-year-old Dalit woman keen to reclaim ‘Odhuvaar’ post||With holy ash smeared on her forehead and a rudrakasha mala adorning her neck, S. Angaiyarkanni, 39, renders hymns from Thevaram in front of portraits of deities in her house. The flawless rendering reverberates along the narrow bylane that leads to her residence at Sembattu in Tiruchi and a spirit of bhakti pervades her house. Ms. Angaiyarkanni, a Dalit, was the first woman appointed as Odhuvaar at Panchavarnaswamy Temple in Woraiyur in Tiruchi in 2006. Though she no longer holds the cherished position that she occupied for seven years, her devotion to God stands out. She is now knocking at the doors of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Department to become an Odhuvaar again. “It was my desire right from younger days to become an Odhuvaar , a position usually held by men in temples,” says Ms.Angaiyarkanni, whose late father was a labourer. Poverty and the challenging circumstances in which Ms. Angaiyarkanni grew up with five of her siblings in a thatched house at Sembattu did not come in the way of her desire. She joined the Government Music School at Tiruchi in 2001 upon completing Plus Two. The three-year systematic training in Thevaram brought about a transformation in her personality. She also learnt Thirupugazh , Abhirami Andhadhi and Panniru Thirumurai at the music school. Two years after completing the course, she got a break in mid-2006 when she joined the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department as a Odhuvaar at Panchavarnaswamy Temple in Woraiyur. “It was the first time that a woman was appointed as an Odhuvaar . I was elated,””she recalls with pride. Ms. Angaiyarkanni became a familiar face with devotees visiting the shrine as she rendered the holy hymns in front of the deity during the four k aalas every day. Her marriage in 2010 with Senthilnathan, a driver by profession of Namakkal, did not cut short her work. “I did not want to leave the opportunity that came my way and continued to do the job with devotion,” she says. She continued her duty even after delivering a daughter in 2011 and shifted to Woraiyur along with her parents to continue in the job at the temple till 2013. But “family circumstances and inadequate income” forced her to quit the post and head for Namakkal where her husband worked. “But the desire to serve god by rendering hymns at the temple lingers,” she says. She approached the temple authorities at Woraiyur in 2016 with a plea to absorb her again in the same post. But as an Odhuvaar had already been posted, she readily undertook other odd jobs at the shrine due to family circumstances. In early 2020, she left for Namakkal where she got stuck due to the COVID-19 outbreak. After over a year, she has returned to Tiruchi along with her 10-year-old daughter and now lives with her younger brother. She has also approached Panchavarnaswamy Temple authorities, but has apparently been told to meet higher officials of the HR & CE Department. “I will be extremely delighted if the authorities absorb me as Odhuvaar again as it would give me a chance to serve god and also help me in my life,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/39-year-old-dalit-woman-keen-to-reclaim-odhuvaar-post/article35968422.ece

18 August 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Autorickshaw drivers come together to launch ‘Sudesi’ App to get rides||A group of autorickshaw drivers have come together to set up a mobile application for customers to hail rides in accordance with the tariff fixed by the State government. The app, called ‘Sudesi’, allows autorickshaw drivers to claim the entire profit, as opposed to those of Corporate companies taking a major share of it, they said. A total of 600 autorickshaw drivers had come together over a year ago, calling themselves Sudhandhira Meter Auto after working under other App-based vehicle aggregator services. As part of the group, they decided to comply with the tariff fixed by the government. Regular customers who hail rides would contact them on a number and an available driver would take the ride. To get more customers, they approached a city-based App development company that refused their request multiple times due to lack of funds. However, in 2020, they came to an agreement with the company that associated themselves with the app as founders. “We got on board to provide app development and back-end support, and four people, including drivers as directors,” Vignesh Raj, founder, Sudesi App, said. A. Krishnakumar, who leads the team of 600 drivers said that ‘Sudesi’ App was a new look for Sudhandhira Meter Auto. “We continue the same services and hope that more people will use our app to travel. People think that going through corporate aggregators was a way to escape fleecing autorickshaws, however, these corporates take more than half our day's earnings as commission and taxes. We are left with nothing at the end of the day,” he said. With Sudesi, they give 10% of their day's earnings for usage of the app and for other maintenance purposes. The remaining amount the driver takes home, they said. Each driver also pays a membership fee of Rs. 100 per month to be a part of the Sudhandhira Meter Auto group. “We collect this money and do some charity work, or help the families of our members. We have collected funds for several of them during COVID-19 lockdown,” Mr. Krishnakumar said. Women drivers are also part of the group. “There are some senior citizens, single-ladies or women with kids who prefer women drivers. We have a team of drivers and are also willing to support women who wish to become autorickshaw drivers to support their families. We will help with documentation, acquiring loans and training,” said S. Lakshmi, one of the drivers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/autorickshaw-drivers-come-together-to-launch-sudesi-app-to-get-rides/article35968416.ece
18 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Diabetic patient receives stem cell therapy at Tiruchi hospital||In a pioneering “off-the-shelf” drug treatment in place of a surgical procedure, Maruti Hospital on Tuesday inaugurated its Regenerative Medicine Department by administering stem cell therapy for a diabetic patient who lost four toes each in both feet. Developed by pharma major, Cipla, jointly with Bengaluru-based Stempeutics Research, over 14 years, it is available (on order) in vials of 150 million and 200 million cells harvested from healthy individuals and costs between Rs. 1.5 to Rs. 2 lakh. Diabetic foot ulcers/critical limb ischemia prevents leg and feet from receiving adequate oxygen and nutrients needed for proper function. The stell cells are injected into the affected leg to promote new blood vessels growth called angiogenesis. It helps avoid amputation if given before gangrene sets in. “Stem cell treatment will help to improve blood circulation in the feet of the patient. The new method allows patients from any place to access this treatment in a ready-to-use procedure. We hope to use customised variations of this therapy for people with other medical ailments in the future, and reduce the dependence on transplants,” said V. R. Ravi, orthopaedic surgeon, Maruti Hospital, told the media. The drug was produced with mesenchymal stromal cell derived from the bone marrow of healthy donors between 20-25 years of age.

18 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||DTCP delegates more powers to LPAs in granting plan approvals||In a move to accelerate the process of plan approvals, the Directorate of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) has delegated more powers to Local Planning Authorities (LPAs). Under the existing system, layout promoters have to seek approval with DTCP for layouts exceeding 2.47 acres in corporations, municipalities and town panchayats. The power of issuing approval for sites exceeding five acres in panchayat limit also lies with the DTCP. Similarly, if the Floor Space Index (FSI) of residential, commercial and institutional building proposal is more than 15,000 square feet, the applicants have to approach DTCP for plan approval. As per the modified order, issued a few days ago, the LPA functioning at the district headquarters can grant plan approval up to 2,500 square metre (26,910 square feet) for residential, commercial and institutional in the non-high rise buildings category. The height of the buildings should not exceed 18.3 metres. In respect of building proposals of Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board and Tamil Nadu Housing Board, except for the proposal of high rise building exceeding 18.3 metres in height, permission can be granted by LPA without considering the parameters of Floor Space Index (FSI). The order issued by E. Saravanavelraj, Director, DTCP, says that field-level officials can grant approval for layouts and subdivision of land up to five acres in respect of urban areas (corporations, municipalities and town panchayats). If the new layouts are located in panchayat limits, approval can be issued by LPA up to 10 acres. If the layout is more than the prescribed limit the proposal should be sent to DTCP for approval. Significantly, the order says splitting of the site, owned by the same applicant or by an individual, who is a member of the same applicant, into portions for getting approval locally should not be entertained. Resolution The order on delegation of power has to be placed at an urgent meeting of the Local Planning Authority under the Chairmanship of the Collector or new town development authority. A resolution should be adopted so as to give effect to the modified rules and regulations in issuing plan approval for buildings and layouts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dtcp-delegates-more-powers-to-lpas-in-granting-plan-approvals/article35968405.ece

Corporation officials said the complex would be opened in a month. Floated as part of the Smart City Project, which was started two years ago in 2019, the Rs. 5.1 crore complex is aimed to decongest existing commercial complexes, such as Sarathy Mansion, Netaji Market and Kagithapattarai. “The shopping complex will cater to the needs of traders on the highway in Sathuvachari and Rangapuram areas. It will also help ease traffic flow to the central parts of the town,” said N. Sankaran, Commissioner, Vellore Corporation. As per plan, the single-storey shopping complex will have at least 20 shops on each floor with parking space for visitors and traders. The entire complex will have LED lighting facilities, uninterrupted water supply, CCTV cameras, wash rooms, purified water system and a compound wall. In order to ensure continuous power supply, Tangedco has started the work to install a 110 KV electricity transformer with two diesel generators as power backup. At present, Vellore Corporation has more than 2,500 shops in its four zones. Currently, most petty traders and small businessmen in Sathuvachari and Rangapuram have shops in Sarathy Mansion, resulting in traffic congestion. On the other hand, the new complex in Sathuvachari will not only provide traders in the neighbourhood better space for their business but will also help tap emerging businesses along the national highway.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/new-commercial-complex-in-vellore-nears-completion/article35968643.ece

18 August 2021||Begaluru,KARNATAKA||TB detected in 24 persons who recovered from COVID-19||With the detection of tuberculosis (TB) in 24 persons who had recovered from COVID-19 in Karnataka, the Health Department has launched an active case finding (ACF) campaign among people who have recovered from COVID-19. Launching the campaign, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar claimed that Karnataka is the first State in the country to start a door-to-door survey to detect TB among patients recovered from COVID-19 and their household contacts. He called upon all recovered patients to come forward and get tested during this intensified detection campaign. “It is not that all people who recovered from COVID-19 will get TB. But, as both COVID-19 and TB primarily infect the lungs, it is important that recovered persons get evaluated for TB voluntarily. All identified people will be tested and followed up for TB similar to what is being done for mucormycosis,” he said. State Joint Director (TB) Ramesh Chandra Reddy said the 24 TB cases are from Kodagu, Mandya, Mysuru, and Chamarajanagar districts. The patients recovered two months ago and TB was detected in them in the last 15 days accidentally. The campaign will cover around 80 lakh people, including the family members and contacts of those who had recovered between January and “Although Kerala also has done a similar survey, it has been done telephonically and not through physical door-to-door visits,” he said. Admitting that TB detection had been hit during the pandemic, the Minister said since 2017, 75 lakh suspected cases have been identified, and 88% of them have been tested. About 3.9% of them have been infected by TB, he said. Dr. Reddy said COVID-19 pandemic has affected key strategic interventions of the TB programme particularly notifications resulting in almost a 28% decline in TB case notification in 2020 as compared to 2019. “Globally, the investigation to see the possibility of reactivation of TB infection to TB disease among COVID-19 recovered persons is gaining momentum. There may be a possibility of increased occurrence of TB among COVID-19 recovered persons due to immunosuppression and lung inflammation,” he explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tb-detected-in-24-persons/article35968262.ece

18 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State to launch ‘Arogya Nandana’ in a week||With experts cautioning that children are likely to be predominantly affected during the third wave, the Health Department is all set to launch ‘Arogya Nandana’, a new initiative to test all children for COVID-19 in Karnataka. Chief Minister Basvaraj Bommai will launch the programme within a week, Health and Medical Minister K. Sudhakar said here on Tuesday. Addressing presspersons, the Minister said over 1.5 crore children in the State will be tested for COVID-19 under this initiative. “Besides, children with low immunity and other co-morbidities will be identified, and provided with nutritious food and supplements to boost their immunity. All measures will be taken to monitor their health,” Dr. Sudhakar said. The programme will be taken up jointly by the Health and the Women & Child Development Departments. The modalities of the programme are being worked out, he said. The State will appeal for additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine from the Centre to achieve its ambitious target to fully inoculate the entire eligible adult population in Karnataka by December 2021. “I will soon visit Delhi to seek additional supply of vaccines for Karnataka. With 25% of the vaccine production allocated to the private sector, we are having discussions with corporates to explore the possibility of the companies procuring vaccines under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and providing them to the State government. This will significantly accelerate the vaccination drive,” the Minister said. The Minister, who later met representatives of over 30 pharma companies in the State, called upon them to use their CSR funds for vaccine procurement. “It is now quite evident that the disease is mild even if those who have been fully inoculated are reinfected. Ahead of the third wave, there is a need to vaccinate all the eligible population and we want to do this by December. This can be possible if you join hands with the government,” he said. The Minister said the State is working towards preventing another oxygen crisis during the third wave.  Besides, children with low immunity and other co-morbidities will be identified, and provided with nutritious food and supplements to boost their immunity. K.

18 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Metro tunnel work: Slurry gushes into house, family evacuated||The ongoing metro tunnel work is giving sleepless nights to some residents in Shivajinagar. In the second such incident, slurry gushed into a house opposite Government V.K.O. School in the wee hours on Tuesday, forcing six of the family to move out of the house. One of the elderly members, who is paralysed and on oxygen support, had to be shifted to a relative’s house after the incident. Naseema Banu, a resident of the affected house, said, “On Monday night, the metro people had come with some machines. They did some tests related to tunnel work. We did not face any problem. Around 4 a.m., we started feeling some vibrations and slurry water started oozing out from the ground into one of the rooms. My aged sister, who is paralysed, was in the room. We immediately shifted her to one of our relatives’ houses. Within no time, the entire house filled with slurry water and through the main door, it started flowing on the road.” Ms. Banu said that metro officials assured them of providing accommodation and agreed to bear the cost. A shop owner in the area said, “Slurry was flowing on the road. The manhole got clogged and metro workers cleared it. The slurry also entered one of the small eateries located next to the house. We are hoping that the officials concerned take utmost care while carrying out the work.” Chief PRO of BMRCL B.L. Yeshwanth Chavan said, “The slurry leakage has occurred in one of the houses on Shivaji Road. The incident happened around 11 p.m. on Monday. The slurry has been cleaned and necessary grouting has been done. The occupants have been safely moved out. The slurry leakage on the surface is due to unconsolidated sandy clay strata in the area.” A tunnel boring machine (TBM), Urja, is burrowing a tunnel seven and half metres below the surface. The TBM had started tunnelling work from Cantonment metro station last August.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/metro-tunnel-work-slurry-gushes-into-house-family-evacuated/article35968255.ece

18 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Crowding at markets a growing concern||Crowding at markets and commercial hubs have emerged as a cause of concern amidst the ongoing festival and marriage season in the month of Shravana. Not only K.R. Market, the eve of festivals see crowding at several smaller markets across the city. Areas like Malleswaram and Gandhi Bazaar also see huge rush and the season also lead to crowds at clothing hubs like the Old Pete Area and Commercial Street. “Unless managed properly, this can lead to spread in virus, which is presently under check,” said a senior civic official. While the district administration has issued guidelines banning entry of devotees at temples on weekends and government holidays, the civic body will likely regulate crowds at markets too, issuing a new set of guidelines later this week. “We will issue guidelines for markets by Thursday,” said D. Randeep, Special Commissioner, Health, BBMP. At a recent meeting chaired by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, it was decided that stringent restrictions, including weekend lockdowns, will be imposed in districts with case positivity rate more than 2%. It is less than 0.7% in the city this week. “Current projections predict a third wave of COVID-19 to hit the city in September. So, managing the ongoing festival season is key in avoiding a third wave and another lockdown,” a senior civic official said. However, regulating crowds at markets and commercial hubs is not an easy task. “None of these markets have defined entry and exit points. Regulating crowds in an orderly fashion, ensuring social distancing is almost impossible. The exercise needs enormous force, but even then it is tough,” said a senior police official. “During the lockdown last year, only retailers were allowed into K.R. Market and many smaller markets were opened across the city. That will be a better approach,” he added. Meanwhile, traders at other commercial hubs oppose any more restrictions. “Business is already down, less than 50% of the usual.

18 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Appointment of VC shrouded in mystery’||The records on the appointment of the Vice-Chancellor of Karnataka State Dr. Gangubai Hangal Music and Performing Arts University, Mysuru, indicate that the “whole thing is shrouded in mystery”, the High Court of Karnataka observed orally on Tuesday. The court made the observation after finding a series of discrepancies in the records maintained by the State government and the Governor, who is the Chancellor of the Stateuniversities. The court, from the notings made in the files by the then Governor Vajubbhai Vala, pointed out that he had, on January 20, 2021, selected Nagesh V. Bettakote as Vice-Chancellor and had signed the order of appointment on January 22 following the draft notifications put up by his office the day before. From the notings made by the then Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurapa in the file maintained by the Chief Minister’s Office, the court notedthat the Chief Minister had recommended a person for the post only on January 22, 2021.  A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice N.S. Sanjay Gowda made these observations during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by Sri Prasanna Vidya Ganapati Mahotsava Charitable Trust, Mysuru. The petitionerhad alleged that the Chancellor had appointed a person, whose name was not recommended by the search committee. “These discrepancies and inconsistencies in the records, which may prima facie affect the legality of the decision-making process [of appointing a Vice-Chancellor],” the Bench observed in its order after perusing the original records. Pointing out that one of the pages in the file maintained by the State government did not exist in the file maintained in the office of the Governor, the Bench orally said there were a few other “clinching” aspects in the records that it would point out at a later stage. The records prima facie indicate that the Chief Minister’s recommendation did not exist on the day the Governor selected the person for the appointment, the Bench orally said, while pointing out that remark of the Chief Minister’s secretary, found in the government’s file, was missing in the files of the Governor. TheBench adjourned further hearing till August 30 while allowing the counsel for the petitioner and Mr. Nagesh to inspect theoriginal files.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/appointment-of-vc-shrouded-in-mystery/article35968271.ece
18 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Property registration in panchayat limits comes to a standstill with e-Swathu glitch||In what appears to be the result of a lack of coordination, the registration of property documents coming under panchayat limits across the State has been disrupted since Monday. The registration of documents through KAVERI e-Swathu has been stopped following the migration to a new secure platform by the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (RDPR) Department. “Migration happened without the knowledge of the Stamps and Registration Department, resulting in the disruption. As on Tuesday, the matter has remained unresolved,” a Revenue Department source told The Hindu . Properties coming under panchayat limits are registered through an integration of KAVERI and e-Swathu software. In Bengaluru, many areas outside BBMP limits that are witnessing rapid development in real estate come under panchayat limits. About 30% of the documents registered across the State are through e-Swathu. “There is no information to the public about the inability to register properties. Sub-registrars themselves do not know the problem. It has affected many people,” K. Ramesh, a property consultant in the city, said. It is learnt that the disruption was caused as the RDPR Department changed the URL from HTTP to the more secure HTTPS, but without informing the other stakeholders, including the National Informatics Centre and the Stamps and Registration Department. Furthermore, as the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, which developed the KAVERI software, tested the integration with e-Swathu on the HTTPS URL, it found that the KAVERI software was unable to support it for technical reasons. Safety aspect On its part, the RDPR Department has justified the move, saying it was done to increase safety. It has also pointed out that the Karnataka State Data Centre had given multiple reminders to do so. Panchayat Raj Commissioner Priyanka Mary Francis said there was no problem and certain internal issues were being sorted out by the State data centre. “No decision on how to move forward has been taken. People suffer from such lack of coordination. There was no intimation to the IGR office about the deadline to migrate to the HTTPS URL,” a revenue official rued. Meanwhile, Revenue Department sources said that the Stamps of Registration Department has urged the RDPR Department to temporarily restore the HTTP URL to prevent causing more inconvenience to the public.  Efforts to reach out to the Inspector General of Registration, K.P. Mohan Raj, and CEO of the Centre for e-Governance, Vipin Singh, for their response were in vain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/property-registration-in-panchayat-limits-comes-to-a-standstill-with-e-swathu-glitch/article35968275.ece

Another FIR The CID is also probing another FIR, registered earlier, based on the complaint filed on behalf of the Shah Harilal Bhikhabhai and Company, which had alleged that some miscreants secured decree against it by way of compromise before the Court of Small Causes without making the company as a party. Internal inquiry The High Court in November 2020 had also directed the Court of Small Causes to initiate an internal inquiry against the suspected officials of the court while pointing out that fraud, forgery and fabrication ordinarily do not happen without the involvement of insiders. The Division Bench has treated the matter as a PIL petition as the single bench had asked the Registrar General to take further necessary follow-up action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-notice-to-bar-council-to-prevent-getting-decree-from-courts-with-fabricated-papers/article35968253.ece

18 August 2021||Bengaluru/Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Afghan students in State worried about their families back home||Many youngsters from Afghanistan had come to Bengaluru chasing dreams of completing their studies, returning home, and working towards the upliftment of their country. Today, chances of doing so are bleak, and they are worried about their families back home as the Taliban has taken over. Most of them have been calling their families multiple times a day and wondering how the situation will pan out. Fahimullah Wardak, an MSc student of University of Agricultural Science [UAS] , Bengaluru, who came to the city in 2019, said he has been calling his family around 10 times a day. He is most worried about his wife and two daughters. “With the recent developments, I am worried about the future of my daughters,” he said. Although due to network issues, he has not been able to have a detailed conversation with them, he said that he just wants to hear that they are doing well. Hayed Hasan Anwary, who is pursuing Masters of Arts in Journalism and Mass Communication in Jain University, said, “My parents were frantic about the situation. They asked me to promise that I will not return to my home. They want me to work here in Bengaluru and support them financially or morally.” Many of them have not been able to meet their families for a long time as they were unable to travel due to the pandemic. Maruf Seddiqui , an MSc student of UAS, Bengaluru, said that he came to the city in 2019. “My parents and six siblings live in Afghanistan and I worry about them constantly as the situation is not normal,” he said. Students from Afghanistan studying in the University of Mysore on Tuesday met Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar and sought his help in getting their visas extended due to the suspension of flights to Kabul. Moreover, they are not ready to go back to their country. Prof. Kumar told The Hindu : “I was told by the students that their families are safe in Afghanistan and they wish to complete their education in Mysuru before returning home.” The V-C said he has advised them to focus on their education, especially those in their final year . “I think the Indian government will take appropriate decision since many study in various Indian universities. If necessary, we can make arrangements for their accommodation in hostels and are also ready for other assistance,” he said. The Manasagangotri campus has about 92 Afghan students. The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) provides 1,000 special scholarships to Afghan students every year and many prefer to study in Karnataka, especially in Bengaluru and Mysuru, said International Centre Director G.R. Janardhana. The university recently approved 25 scholarships for this year, but students could not come to India for various reasons. The current situation in Afghanistan has also put a question mark on the fate of students unable to return to Mysuru. “Before the lockdown, some students went home and only a few returned,” said Prof. Janardhana. Of 2,000 applications from abroad for admissions in the university this year, over 1,300 belonged to Afghan students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/afghan-students-worried-about-kin-back-home/article35968248.ece

18 August 2021||HUBBALLI/BELAGAVI,KARNATAKA||Forgotten tales of the freedom struggle in North Karnataka||Influenced by the freedom fighters led by Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of people from even remote areas of the northern districts of Karnataka plunged into the freedom movement, with scores sacrificing their lives and many others spending years behind bars. There are tales of heroic fights from commoners all across the region. The valiant fight of the Queen of Kittur (Belagavi district) Kittur Chennamma and her lieutenants Sangolli Rayanna, Amatur Balappa, and Gurusiddappa in the early 19th Century is known across the region. Historic session   Belagavi city hosted the 39th all-India session of the Congress party in 1924 — the only session chaired by Mahatma Gandhi. Over 20,000 delegates attended the session in Tilakwadi, for which the Royal Railways set up a temporary railway station. Although Belagavi district’s history is dotted with several mutinies, barring a few leaders and places, the rest are unknown. “The book Belagavi Zilleyalli Swatantra Sangrama by Annu Guruji, veteran freedom fighter, lists over 300 such villages and towns,” said Subhash Kulkarni, writer and former chairman of the district Khadi Gramodyoga Sangha. The book has details of warriors such as ‘Karnataka Kesari’ Gangadhar Rao Deshpande of Hudali, Venka Reddy of Hooli, Srirang Kamat of Bailhongal, Vaman Rao of Bidri, Ba Ya Deshpande of Pachchapur, and Shivanagouda Patil and Baburao Thakur of Belagavi taluk. These are the leaders who carried a cash reward of Rs. 5,000 on their heads. Inspired by Sabarmati Ashram, Gangadhar Rao Deshpande set up a Kumri Ashram in Hudali villag and Gandhiji stayed there and the nearby Khadi kendra for nearly two weeks. The Khandi centre is still functional. The adjacent district of the then undivided Dharwad district too was visited by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920, and this further motivated people such as Sir Siddappa Kambali, Gudleppa Hallikeri, N.S. Hardikar, Mailara Mahadeva, Hosamani Siddappa, Andanappa Doddameti, Umabai Kundapur, and Krishnabai Panajikar. Gandhi’s visit resulted in massive support for the non-cooperation movement. Khilafat movement During a protest related to the Khilafat movement, three activists — Mallikasab bin Mardansab, Goususab bin Khadarsab, and Abdul Gaffar Chautai — lost their lives in firing by the British on  July 1, 1921, near Jakani Bhavi in Dharwad. Mailara Mahadevappa of Motebennur, considered to be the lone participant from Karnataka in Gandhi’s ‘Dandi March’, lost his life in police firing during a violent protest related to the Quit India Movement. The British fired when the protesters tried to lay siege to a revenue office at Hosaritti, and along with Mahadevappa, two others — Veerayya Hiremath and Tirukappa Madiwal —too laid down their lives. Narayan Mahadeva Doni, 16, lost his life during police firing during a protest as part of Quit India in Hubballi. Gandhi’s influence motivated Sardar Veeranagouda Patil to set up a ‘Harijan Balikashrama’ in Hubballi, where he and his wife (despite facing social boycott) sheltered girls from downtrodden sections of society.

18 August 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||The Bhalki Conspiracy||Exactly 10 years after India’s First War of Independence in 1857, the anti-British sentiments echoed in Bhalki, and it was later termed the Bhalki Conspiracy. The associates of Nana Saheb Peshwa II and Tatya Tope, the notable leaders of the revolt, regrouped in Hyderabad and staged attacks against British camps in Secundrabad, Aurangabad, and other places in 1862. Rao Saheb, nephew of Nana Saheb, who led the attacks, was caught and executed. His associate Rama Rao challenged the British by hoisting Bhagwa Dhwaj at Ashti village nearBhalki in 1867. The British began a manhunt and when Rama Rao, also known as Jung Bahadur, and his associates Balakrishna, Vitoba, and Bhima Rao were holding a meeting at Bhalki, the British arrested them. They were charged with hatching a plot against the British and the Nizam rule and awarded life imprison- ment. Two others, Vishwanath and Jahangir Ali, were sentenced to 14 years in prison. The Bhalki Conspiracy is considered to be the last echo of India’s First War of Independence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/the-bhalki-conspiracy/article35968276.ece

18 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||MLAs to meet CM for ban on PFI, SDPI||Bharatiya Janata Party MLAs from the region will shortly call on Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and reiterate the need to ban Popular Front of India (PFI) and its political arm, Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), said Mangaluru City North MLA Y. Bharath Shetty here on Tuesday. Talking to reporters here, Dr. Shetty said that he and the other BJP MLAs from the region have in the past met Mr. Bommai several times when he was the Home Minister and spoken about the need to impose a ban on PFI and SDPI. “We will shortly meet Mr. Bommai and request him to fast track the process. There is a need to build a water-tight case against PFI and SDPI,” he said. The Union government has been building a dossier against PFI, he added. Stalling the movement of Swatantrotsava Ratha of Kabaka Gram Panchayat on Sunday as a cut-out on the vehicle had the photo of Veer Savarkar, Dr. Shetty said, was nothing but an attempt to create communal tension in the area. All the seven BJP MLAs are committed to ensuring development of the district and they will not tolerate any attempt to disturb peace. Asked why the issue of banning PFI is raised only after some incidents occur, Dr. Shetty said that banning an organisation is an ongoing process and the legislators of the region are closely following up the issue. Terming a statement of a member of a Hindutva organisation that the BJP has a tacit understanding with SDPI as a figment of one’s imagination, Dr. Shetty said that there is no reason for a national party to have a tie-up with fundamentalist forces. Dr. Shetty criticised Mangaluru MLA U.T. Khader for speaking lightly about Veer Savarkar and said that the latter has not read history properly. Earlier, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal activists staged protest demonstrations in front of various police stations across the district demanding action against SDPI. Participating in one such protest in front of the Barke Police Station, Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyas Kamath said that the State government is committed to taking effective action against fundamantalist forces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mlas-to-meet-cm-for-ban-on-pfi-sdpi/article35968691.ece

Hence, they decided to end their lives, he said. Soon after receiving the message, Mr. Kumar took action to trace the couple. He also sent a message asking the couple to calm down, while assuring them of support. Messages were sent to the friends of the couple also asking them to offer the man and wife wise counsel. The police reached the apartment at around 7 a.m. only to find the couple dead.

A statement issued by the Council Secretary of Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) on Tuesday said the election will be held at noon. Regional Commissioner of Mysuru G.C. Prakash will conduct the proceedings at the Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar auditorium on the MCC premises. The election was earlier scheduled to be held on June 11, but the High Court had stayed it in view of the restrictions in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 cases. The mid-term poll was necessitated due to the disqualification of Rukmini Made Gowda, who had been elected Mayor in February this year, from the membership of the MCC for submitting a false affidavit related to assets. After the June 11 poll was stayed, Deputy Mayor Anwar Baig had been serving as acting Mayor. The post of Mayor has been reserved for a woman from the general category. The electoral college comprises MLAs and MLCs of Mysuru, besides Mysuru Lok Sabha MP and corporators of MCC.

18 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Protesters in Delhi not farmers but middlemen: Karandlaje||Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Shobha Karandlaje on Tuesday said the protests being staged on Delhi borders are not by farmers but middlemen in the agriculture produce marketing committees (APMCs). These middlemen are holding dharna not in the interest of farmers but for their own benefits, she alleged. Ms. Karandlaje wondered how farmers could take part in protests for so long leaving work in their fields and claimed that the middlemen were holding the protests as the Centre’s new farm laws were expected to hit them hard. Addressing presspersons here, the Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP argued that the new farm laws were favourable to the farmers and the Centre will continue to make efforts to persuade farmers on why the Centre came up with the laws. “Despite knowing that the protesters are middlemen and not farmers, the Centre is ready to hold talks and about 11 rounds of consultations had taken place between the government and the leaders of the protests although the meetings were inconclusive,” the Minister said. Mr. Karandlaje blamed the government in Punjab for the protests claiming that the State would lose sizable revenue from the APMCs once the new laws were enforced. “Some vested interests are also behind the protests.” The Minister said the country made significant strides in food production, which she described as momentous. Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, India produced 305 million tonnes of foodgrains and 325 million tonnes of horticulture produce in 2020-21. This is something remarkable when the country faced devastating first and second waves of COVID-19. Admitting that the fertilizer prices have gone up recently, she said this was was because of increase in prices of raw materials imported. The Minister said the demand for fertilizers has also increased with more youth shifting towards agriculture, leaving jobs in cities and shifting to their villages amidst the pandemic. It is a good sign. Describing the crop survey app launched in the State as a “model” for the country, Ms. Karandlaje said there are plans to replicate the app in other States since it is helping farmers in assessing their crop and seek relief under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bhima Yojana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/protesters-in-delhi-not-farmers-but-middlemen-karandlaje/article35968585.ece

They included mini projects at Anavilasam, Chinnar, Chittoor Upper, Inchavarakuthu, Kangapuzha, Keezharkuthu, Lanthram, Mankulam, Pichadu, Chenkulam Augmentation, Thommankuthu, Thooval, Thottiyar, Thoovalar, Upper Kallar, Upper Chenkulam and Western Kallar. These are power projects based on diverting the tailwater from a project or by producing electricity from streams near waterfalls. Of the mini hydroelectric projects, the Pallivasal extension project is the largest one. The tailwater from the Pallivasal project will be diverted to the Chenkulam dam and it could produce the same quantity of electricity at the Chenkulam power house. It has been designed to produce 1.44 million units a day at Pallivasal. The project also envisages increasing the power generation capacity of the Chenkulam powerhouse by diverting water from the Kallar river. The extension project started in 2007 was to be completed in four years. But only 75% of the total works have been completed till now. A KSEB official said a request had been made before the government to allot Rs. 250 crore for completing the project. A senior official said the delay in realising the projects was due to the difficulties faced in importing equipment and related machinery. The COVID-19 situation had worsened the situation. Besides, there was an issue with sourcing spares too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/21-power-projects-yet-to-be-completed-in-idukki/article35968569.ece

Fresh orders Ajith Kumar Gothuruthu, secretary of Chendamangalam Karimpadam Weaving Cooperative H191, said the new initiative had seen creating fresh orders worth more than Rs. 5 lakh during the week. Most of the stocks are being sold now, he said . The service cooperative bank had introduced a scheme in which cooperative bank members paid Rs. 1,000 and the bank would pay for Rs. 1,500 worth of products to weaving cooperatives. Most of the products included saris, double dhotis, shirt pieces and shirts as well as churidar materials. Silk masks have been a great hit with the buyers, said Mr. Kumar. He said that the free school uniform programme of the State government had taken off well. However, cooperative societies were being paid Rs. 3.98 for each metre of woven cloth. If the payment can be raised to Rs. 10 per metre, the societies would be able to stand on their feet given the current rise in expenses including electricity charges, he said. The Karimpadam society had around 16 uniform looms with about 10,000 pairs of uniforms being churned out. The yearly turnover was about 10,000 metres, he added. Affected by floods Handloom cooperative veteran T.S. Baby said the bulk of the yearly handloom products is sold during Onam season. About 65% of the sales take place during the season.

Block panchayat president Raju Nair said on Tuesday that collection of plastic waste would be launched initially in three panchayats — Mulanthuruthy, Udayamperoor and Amballoor. A baling unit is being set up at the Arayankavu industrial area to handle the plastic waste collected from the six panchayats. The other three panchayats under the Mulanthuruthy block include Edakkattuvayal, Maneed and Chottanikkara. Mr. Nair said that the programme to eradicate plastic waste from the six panchayats was inaugurated recently and works had begun on the baling unit. The unit will turn plastic waste into plastic bricks, which will then be transferred to Green Kerala Mission. Members of the Haritha Karma Sena, the green army, under the Green Kerala Mission will collect plastic from the panchayats. It is expected that plastic will be collected from each of the panchayats to reach a total of around 30 tonnes per year to make the baling unit run without losses. Several initiatives in Mulanthuruthy have been a trendsetter. A group of women under the Mulanthuruthy Public Library had set up an LED assembling and repair unit more than five years ago and the Thurithikkara Science Centre in the panchayat under the Sasthra Sahitya Parishad had launched a campaign to save rainwater to recharge drinking water sources and overcome shortage of water in summer months.

The Persian cat from Vyttila had delivered a kitten and was breastfeeding it when something like a blood red tube was found protruding. The cat was immediately taken to the Government District Veterinary Center and an ultrasound scan and x-ray found a uterine intussusception, which is a rare condition in cats. The ultrasound scan found another live kitten in the normal horn of uterus. The intussusception was corrected surgically and a live kitten was retrieved from the uterus. A team under Dr. Abdul Lathief, Dr. Eldhose and Dr. Parvathi under the leadership of chief veterinary officer Dr. Indira rescued the kitten through a complex surgery that lasted an hour and a half, said a communication from the department here on Tuesday.

Satheesan on Tuesday said that the CBI probe into the solar case was part of an unholy nexus between the CPI(M) and the BJP. Cases against people, including former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy were registered on the basis of a statement given by a woman, an accused in a case of fraud. “But why is it that there’s no case registered against Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan despite the accused in an even bigger case giving statement against him? It’s the Central agencies that should investigate the foreign currency smuggling case,” he said in Kochi. All investigations announced by the State into the solar case ended citing lack of any credible evidence. Generally, the CBI took up inter-State cases and those that could not be cracked by the State police. But the solar case was handed over to the CBI with the mala fide intent to tarnish the image of Congress leaders. The inquiry, Mr. Satheesan alleged, was not just politically-motivated but the result of a conspiracy involving the BJP and the CPI(M).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/satheesan-sees-cpm-bjp-nexus-in-solar-case/article35968530.ece

The preliminary investigation carried out by the State Pollution Control Board (PCB) showed that the crumb rubber unit made an unauthorised discharge through a pipeline into the nearby land. This caused the discharge into the river. A long stretch of oil patch near the Pathalam regulator-cum-bridge had triggered concerns among local residents and environmentalists on Saturday. They had stated that the illegal discharge would have come from industrial units. The board had taken samples from the river to ascertain the source of contamination. Senior board officials said that action will be taken against the unit as per the report prepared by its Environment Surveillance Centre in Eloor. The analysis results of the samples will also be taken into account before deciding on the measures to be taken against the suspected unit. The board will serve notice on the management asking why environment compensation should not be recovered for the illegal discharge into the river in violation of the Environment Protection Act and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The board has found that the effluent treatment facility in the unit was not functioning as per norms. Huge quantity of water is required for processing. The water used should be treated as per the norms prescribed by the board for subsequent reuse. As the treatment facilities remain defunct, the unit is suspected to have discharged untreated water into the nearby land located close to the river.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rubber-unit-discharging-effluent-into-periyar-pcb/article35968538.ece

"I am worried and fear for the lives of my family. The situation is very bad," said Mr. Omar, a second-semester student of BBA. LLB programme. "The local citizens are in the dark about their future. My family members have locked themselves in our house to avoid getting caught in the crossfire in the event of shooting or violence on the streets," he said. Talking to The Hindu from Kabul, Parwiz Muradi (name changed), a research student at the Central University of Kerala (CUK) in Kasaragod, describes the situation in the Afghan capital as “terrifying.” Mr. Muradi, who has been in India since 2013, returned to Kabul just before the lockdown here. Since then, repeated efforts to return to the university have failed due to the pandemic. “With no electricity or proper internet connection, it is impossible to continue research,” he said. Living in fear Another research scholar, Jawad Ebrahimi, hopes to return to Kerala once the situation in Kabul normalises and peace is restored. Many students from the Hazra ethnic groups and other minority communities are afraid that they would be targeted by the Taliban. Hadi Khedri, a third-year student of BTech in Information Technology at CUSAT said that the streets in Kabul wore a deserted look, going by the feedback from his family after the takeover of Kabul by the Taliban forces was complete on Sunday. "The common man there has no clarity yet on who will take care of the safety and security of their families," he said. Mr. Khedri has one more year of studies at CUSAT and is concerned about his future. "I would not like to go back at this point of time. But I am equally concerned about the fate of my family," he said. Rawush Zafar, a second-semester student of MCA, said that local shops and offices remain closed in Kabul after the Taliban forces took control. "My family members said they heard gunshots last night. There have been reports of power outages and disruptions of the internet," he said. Standstill in streets Twenty-five-year-old Nafas Gul Saadat could not hold her tears back as she recalled the phone conversation with her husband and family members in Kabul on Monday morning. "My husband, who works in a private internet service provider, said that it is a standstill in the streets. They have not left the safety of their residence after the takeover of Kabul," she said. A student of MTech in Software Engineering, Ms. Saadat pointed out that she would like to continue her education. "I am really worried about the situation back home and cannot focus on my studies," she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/afghan-students-jittery-over-unfolding-events-in-kabul/article35968509.ece
18 August 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||COVID leaves ‘Lemon City’ in a pickle||Onam, the season of festivities and weddings, meant brisk business and bulk orders for the farmers of Puliyankudi till recently. A village in Tenkasi on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border and the hub of lemon growers and traders, Puliyankudi used to transport large consignments of the fruit to various parts of India earning the title of ‘Lemon City.’ But COVID-19 changed the scene for the village where nearly 50% farmers depend on lemon. Drop in price The sharp drop in price induced by the second wave of the pandemic has left the farmers in distress, forcing them to sell the produce at very low rates. “The demand nosedived in 2021 and has now hit an all-time low. We have over 1,000 lemon trees and everything, from procurement to sales, has been hit,” says K. Siddique, a farmer from Puliyankudi. Many farmers grow the ‘naattu’ variety of lemon. There are different types meant for making pickle, juice and ‘sadam’ (rice). Since lemons are offered to all guests in Kerala weddings, price used to soar during the month of Chingam. “But now weddings have become very small gatherings with less than 50 attendees. Also, we are tired of hearing ‘namukk Onam illa’ from Kerala buyers,” says Kaja Mohideen, a merchant in Puliyankudi. During the pre-pandemic days even small lemons were sold for Rs. 50 a kilogram, with the first quality ones fetching more than Rs. 100. “Now the price has come down to Rs. 30. Farmers are unable to cover even the production expenses. Many farmers and traders are contemplating other options due to the dip in demand,” he adds. No online orders According to vendors in Kerala, wholesale traders bring truckloads of lemons to the State in the season after summer . “But of late all the small-scale joints and street vendors who sell juices and sarbaths have remained closed. Since nobody orders lime juice online, the demand was very low,” says Mathew Paul, a Kochi-based merchant. In the absence of ‘sadyas,’ tourism, and temple festivals, the fruit has fewer takers. “Many temples in Kerala used to buy daily loads of lemon for offerings like ‘naranga mala.’ But devotees were not allowed during lockdown and even now entry is restricted. And now with all the uncertainties stemming from the spike in COVID-19 cases there is no point in pre-booking or procuring huge volumes,” says Radhakrishnan, a vendor from Kottayam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-leaves-lemon-city-in-a-pickle/article35968571.ece

18 August 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Pala bypass named after K.M. Mani||In a significant decision, the Left Democratic Front government has named the Pala bypass road after K.M. Mani, founder of the Kerala Congress (M) [KC(M)] who represented the Assembly segment for 13 terms from 1964 until his death in 2019. The road, which passes in front of the residence of Mani here, is regarded as a dream project of the KC(M) patriarch. The 4-km long and 15-meter wide bypass road connects Puliyannoor Junction along the Ettumanur-Poonjar State Highway with Kizhathadiyoor Junction on the Punalur-Muvattupuzha State Highway (Pala-Thodupuzha segment). The project was designed when Mani was the Finance Minister in the United Democratic Front government. He parted with his land to enable the implementation of the project. The project that commenced in 2014 was commissioned in 2018. The bypass was developed by widening a narrow stretch between Puliyannoor Junction and Civil Station Junction and also constructing an extension to the road. For firmer ties The naming of the road after the late leader, according to observers, also signals the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front’s plans to firm up its association with the regional party and maintain the upper hand it presently claims in the Christian heartland. “The aspirations of the LDF are evident — to cash in on the legacy of a leader it had long set itself against and help the Kerala Congress (M) recapture Pala, its citadel. The unveiling of the KC(M) supremo’s statue at Pala was the first step in this direction,” he observed. Mani’s legacy The brand of politics founded by Mani is so noteworthy that the Kerala Congress led by P.J. Joseph, the foremost adversary of the KC(M) in the region now, too holds a claim over it. The move, meanwhile, is also expected to give traction to the efforts by the KC(M) to affirm its presence and recapture the Pala Assembly seat, which for long served as its citadel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pala-bypass-named-after-km-mani/article35968577.ece

Opening the silver jubilee of the People’s Plan Campaign in the State on Tuesday, Mr.Vijayan urged the local bodies to come up with novel ideas and projects to survive COVID and highlighted the role of local efforts in combating the pandemic. Absence of models Addressing the local bodies virtually from his office in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday, the Chief Minister said the occasion should be a platform to form democratic methods for development to build a ‘new Kerala’. Mr. Vijayan said the biggest challenge before the State was the absence of prior models to follow. However, the local bodies were able to think beyond the preconceived framework of development and their capability was visible in the way they handled the floods and the pandemic. He asked the local bodies to come up with projects that would aid basic infrastructure development in sectors such as industry, agriculture, production, and tourism and take the environment into consideration. These projects should help the unemployed, women, and former expatriates to realise their potential.

18 August 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Swimming test for Plus One admissions draws flak||The State government recently directed District Sports Councils to conduct swimming tests and issue certificates to students who seek admissions to Plus One courses. The students get two bonus points if they produce the certificate showing their swimming skills during the admissions. Teachers, however, are apprehensive if it will lead to violation of the pandemic protocol with a large number of applicants thronging swimming pools across districts. For instance, a notice by O. Rajagopal, president of the Kozhikode District Sports Council, says that those who want the certificate can reach the swimming pool located at East Nadakkave in Kozhikode city with two passport size photographs, a copy of the Aadhaar card, and a fee of Rs. 25. If they show their swimming skills, the certificate will be given. The timings are scheduled between 9 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. and between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. The practice of asking for swimming skills certificates was started after the Thattekkad boat tragedy in which 15 students and three teachers died. The government reportedly wanted to ensure the safety of students. Earlier, local bodies were asked to provide the certificate. However, teachers say that they are yet to get any official information on the directive. “The notice has been spreading through social media. Many parents and teachers are wondering if it is genuine,” said a teacher from Nanminda Higher Secondary School, Kozhikode. K.K. Sreejesh Kumar of the Kerala Aided Higher Secondary Teachers’ Association said that conducting the event at a single venue in a district could lead to overcrowding and thus violate the pandemic protocol. “It is also unfair to charge a fee from the students. The council should decentralise the swimming test and hold it in other towns as well,” he said. Mr. Rajagopal said that all the guidelines were being followed while conducting the test. “Four students are asked to swim for a minute at a time. Around 350 students came on Tuesday. The pool is chlorinated and disinfected round-the-clock. The students take a shower after the exercise and disinfect themselves again before leaving,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/swimming-test-for-plus-one-admissions-draws-flak/article35968517.ece

Milma chairman K.S.Mani told reporters in Kozhikode on Tuesday that the foundation was bringing out products such as ready to cook vegetable biryani, rasam powder, turmeric powder, pepper powder, coffee powder, and chukku kappi under its banner. He said that the foundation had around 45 non-milk products at present. Mr.Mani said that the federation was paying a much higher price for milk in Kerala. This was a welfare measure and not financially viable. Hence, the decision to venture into other products. The federation could continue to support dairy farmers when all sectors crumbled due to the pandemic, he said. There was a steep increase in the amount of milk collected by Milma in the past one year. This was the result of the federation’s creative intervention in the dairy sector using the State and Central funds effectively, he said. While the milk production in the Malabar region had been higher compared with the Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam regions, the sale of milk had declined considerably in the region in the past one year in contrast to the other two regions, he said, adding that shops and restaurants remaining closed due to the lockdown was the main reason behind this. Hence, the excess milk was being sent to neighbouring States to be converted into milk powder. However, it was not a viable option and hence, Milma would set up a milk powder production plant at Moorkanad in Malappuram district soon, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/milma-ventures-into-curry-powder-production/article35968507.ece

At a COVID-19 review meeting here on Tuesday, he directed the Health Department to ensure that vaccination was not disrupted because of shortage of syringes. He also asked the department to ensure that telemedicine facilities in districts were functioning without fail. Mr. Vijayan asked the State experts’ committee on COVID and the Health Department to conduct a study into the 124 breakthrough infections reported at Mallappally in Pathanamthitta in persons who had received two doses of vaccine. It was decided at the review meeting that no further relaxations would be allowed for the Aranmula boat race than allowed the previous year. TPR rises to 15.48% The COVID-19 case graph in Kerala is on an unrelenting plateau with a daily caseload of 20,000 to 22,000 cases daily for the past three weeks.

18 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||LPG price hike hits families hard||Chingam 1 was eagerly awaited amid the COVID-19 hardship, but the news of a Rs. 25-hike in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder prices on Tuesday put a damper on the celebrations of countless households. Already reeling from the economic challenges of the second wave of COVID-19 and rising fuel prices, families have been dealt a heavy blow with the latest increase. A domestic gas cylinder cost Rs. 866 in Kochi and Rs. 869 in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday, upsetting domestic budgets. S. Anusha, who works in a private company in Kochi, said she had seen her salary slashed in the wake of the pandemic and the constant increase in domestic gas prices would affect the family budget. Deepthi George, a homemaker, said the price rise would hit calculations for monthly expenses. Prices had been hiked multiple times since December last, consumers pointed out. Last hike on July 1 The price for the 14.2-kg domestic cylinders was last hiked on July 1 by Rs. 25.5. On August 1, the prices of the 19-kg commercial LPG cylinders were hiked. The latest hike has left consumers an anxious lot, with several households in rural Kozhikode turning to firewood once again. Shibina Manoj, a homemaker from Koyilandy, said she made everything other than tea on her earthen stove now that she could not afford cooking gas. “We were all asked to migrate from firewood to cooking gas to stop air pollution. Now the price of cooking gas has defeated the purpose of migrating to it.” While rural families have the option of firewood, the urban population has no such reprieve. “We need at least one-and-a-half cylinders of cooking gas for a month. That is almost Rs. 1,300 off my meagre salary. I don’t know how we will manage ahead,” K.C. Beena, who works in a car dealership in Kozhikode, said. A gas distributor in Ernakulam said frequent price rise landed dealers in trouble as bills for delivery of cylinder on a day that had been printed the previous day had to be cancelled and new bills printed, leading to delays in deliveries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lpg-price-hike-hits-families-hard/article35968549.ece

Venugopal; former Ministers Adoor Prakash and A.P. Anil Kumar; Hiby Eden, MP; and A.P. Abdullahkutty, currently a top Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) functionary; are the respondents in the case. The complainant is an accused in the solar investment fraud case that had bedevilled the 2011 Oommen Chandy government. She had alleged that the politicians had sought and received sexual favours from her, promising State support for her business venture. The State police had in 2018 registered six cases against the politicians. However, the investigations had come to a dead end. The alleged crime had spanned Kerala, New Delhi, and other States. The police cases had provenance in a damning observation by a judicial commission appointed by Mr. Chandy (the then Chief Minister) to probe the so-called solar scam involving the complainant. It recommended that the police probe those named by the woman as her sexual exploiters. It concluded that demanding and accepting sexual favours for official patronage is tantamount to illegal gratification under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The Pinarayi Vijayan government accepted the commission’s findings and formed a special team to probe the accusations. The Left Democratic Front government dropped a bombshell in the run-up to the 2021 Assembly elections by promulgating an extraordinary notification in January to hand over the case to the CBI. The alleged victim in the case had also moved the government for a CBI inquiry. The notification came days after the Congress had nominated Mr. Chandy to spearhead the United Democratic Front’s Assembly election campaign. Cong. flays move The Congress greeted the news with outrage. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said the CPI(M) and the BJP had attempted to resurrect a set of lies to tarnish the Congress. Mr. Vijayan’s meeting with BJP leaders at the Centre was a precursor of the plot. Congress State working president Kodikunnil Suresh said Mr. Vijayan had breathed life into the old and discredited accusations to divert public attention from the foreign currency probe against him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cbi-opens-probe-against-cong-leaders/article35968551.ece

A groundnut farmer, Nagamuni, from Siddharampuram in Bukkarayasamudram mandal on Tuesday asked Ambati Krishna Reddy, Agriculture Advisor to State Government, for compensation for the loss of groundnut crop to farmers in their mandal. The farmers said only little groundnut crop was procured from the farmers out of the kharif yield, which had led to enormous loss to the community. “During crop cutting exercise, instead of 15 bags (45 kg each) of yield per acre, we got only 2.5 bags in the mandal and 5 in the district this time, but the government did not intervene to procure the yield. The cost of cultivation has increased manifold and currently around Rs. 25,000 was needed to grow groundnut in one acre and the yield does not cross 450 kg, thus leaving nothing in our hands,” another farmer said during a review meeting held at the Bukkarayasamudram MPDO office. While Assistant Director of Agriculture Venkataramana explained how farmers were losing insurance money despite crop loss due to flawed parameter of taking only weather-based statistics, but not the yield, Mr. Krishna Reddy said the government had paid Rs. 960 crore as compensation and asked the farmers to register their crop through e-Crop and receive all benefits. Excess rain Many of the mandals in Anantapur district received 30mm excess rain, but that turned to be detrimental for the groundnut crop, the Agriculture Officer explained. Joint Director Agriculture B. Chandra Naik said 865 RBKs coming up in the district would go a long way in ensuring quality seeds and cheaper fertilizers to farmers in one place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/groundnut-farmers-demand-compensation-for-crop-loss/article35968591.ece

18 August 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||A nightmare returns to haunt Afghan women||After the Taliban completely took over Afghanistan a few days ago, shivers ran down the spines of lakhs of Afghans, especially women. The restrictions imposed on women by the Taliban during their rule over the country from 1996-2001 have resurfaced. A 22-year-old Afghani woman, Nasiba Salehin, was a toddler when Taliban ruled Afghanistan the last time. The young woman who has completed Bachelors in Civil Engineering from Osmania University and stays in Hyderabad, Telangana, heard about the strict curbs imposed on women through her family members. The fresh graduate fears the dark times will return. “Now that Taliban took the reins of the country, we are afraid of re-experiencing the dark days of history where women will be forced to wear burqas and will not be allowed to walk in the streets. And the girls will be given permission to go to school only up to the age of 12. The Afghani women will be deprived of going to universities and will be strictly prohibited from doing jobs,” Ms Nasiba said. Shattered dreams Having completed the bachelors course, she was aspiring to pursue masters or do a job. With her city under siege by the Taliban, she fears it means losing her house, dreams, goals, ambitions. The fears are compounded as her scholarship too will stop by the end of next month, which would mean she has to return to Afghanistan. “Talibans will deny even our primary rights. I fear my family and friends will be killed and no one knows what will happen next,” she feared. Other Afghan women who stay in Hyderabad were too traumatised to talk. Male Afghani students too have expressed concerns about women’s rights. While the expatriates said that the Taliban has assured rights for women, they are not sure if the assurances will be acted upon.  Talibans will deny even our primary rights. I fear my family and friends will be killed and no one knows what will happen next.

18 August 2021||Kochi,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Allow people in emergencies’||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Tuesday directed the Karnataka government to ensure that people in emergency situations such as a death in a family, medical treatment, etc., are permitted to enter Karnataka on producing necessary documents to establish their respective cases, irrespective of the nature of the vehicle used for the purpose. The Bench, comprising Justice Shaji P. Chaly and Justice A. Badharudeen, passed the interim directive on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Manjeswaram MLA A.K.M. Ashraf and another person, complaining about the blockade being created by Karnataka on its borders with Kerala. Karnataka insisted on passengers having a negative RT-PCR certificate taken within 72 hours before entering the State. The petitioners also pointed out that emergency patients taken in ambulances alone were allowed to cross its borders. When the petition came up for hearing, Advocate-General of Karnataka Prabhuling K. Navadgi submitted that a revised circular had been issued. He said the government, through a circular on July 31, had adequately addressed the issue of emergencies. The circular had made it clear that certain categories of people, including students and the public, visiting Karnataka daily, were exempted from having negative RT-PCR certificates. Emergency situations such as death in families and medical treatment had also come under the exemption categories, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/allow-people-in-emergencies/article35968172.ece
18 August 2021||Kozhikode,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Kerala a recruitment hub for IS’||BJP president J.P. Nadda alleged that Kerala is now known for its terrorist operation modules, including recruitment centres for Islamic State (IS) militants, and gold smuggling rather than development initiatives. Inaugurating the newly constructed BJP district committee office in Kozhikode through videoconference on Tuesday, Mr. Nadda said it was a shame that the Chief Minister’s Office itself was complicit in gold smuggling. Law and order “The law and order situation in Kerala is deteriorating. Violence against women is on the rise. The police are mute spectators. They are acting only out of political considerations,” the BJP president said. He said the State’s economy was in a shambles with a debt of Rs. 3.5 lakh crore. The Union government was ready to help Kerala, but the State government remained uncooperative, he added. The money allotted for Central schemes for development projects such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe welfare schemes was unutilised, Mr. Nadda said. The BJP president said Kerala’s rising COVID-19 cases had now become a burden for the country. It was mismanagement not management, he added. ‘U.P. model’ “At least 10% of the 3.5 crore people were affected by COVID-19. But out of 22.9 crore people in Uttar Pradesh, only 17 lakh [0.73%] have been infected. The Uttar Pradesh model has been accepted around the world,” the BJP president said. Two doses of the vaccine will be available nationwide by December, he added. ‘Development stalemate’ Accusing the State government of being responsible for the development stalemate, Mr. Nadda said the political culture that prevailed for the last 40 years was hindering the development of the State. While Malayalis were contributing to development across the globe, development eluded the State, he said. Stating that although the literacy rate was high in Kerala, he said the educated had to scout for employment outside the State. “There are no jobs here. New industries are not coming and even the existing industries are closing due to the hostile attitude of the political leadership,” the BJP president added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-a-recruitment-hub-for-is-militants-nadda/article35968167.ece

18 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||CBI begins probe against Cong. leaders||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has reportedly opened an inquiry into the allegation that at least five Congress leaders had sought and received sexual favours from a businesswoman. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy; All India Congress Committee general secretary K.C. Venugopal; former Ministers Adoor Prakash and A.P. Anil Kumar; Hiby Eden, MP; and A.P. Abdullahkutty, currently a top BJP functionary; are the respondents in the case. The CBI has kept the First Information Report (FIR) in the case a secret to protect the victim’s identity as mandated by law. It submitted the report at the CBI special court in Thiruvananthapuram last week. The complaint The complainant is an accused in the sensational solar investment fraud case that had bedevilled the 2011 Oommen Chandy government. She had alleged that the politicians had sought and received sexual favours from her, promising State support for her business venture. The State police had in 2018 registered six cases against the politicians. However, the investigations came to a dead end. The alleged crime had spanned Kerala, New Delhi and other States. The police cases had provenance in a damning observation by a judicial commission appointed by Mr. Chandy (the then Chief Minister) to probe the so-called solar scam involving the complainant. It recommended that the police probe those named by the woman as her sexual exploiters. It concluded that demanding and accepting sexual favours for official patronage is tantamount to illegal gratification under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The Pinarayi Vijayan government accepted the commission’s findings and formed a special team to probe the accusations. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government dropped a bombshell in the run-up to the 2021 Assembly election by promulgating an extraordinary notification in January to hand over the case to the CBI. The alleged victim in the case had also moved the government for a CBI inquiry. The notification came days after the Congress had nominated Mr. Chandy to spearhead the United Democratic Front’s (UDF) Assembly election campaign. Congress flays move The Congress greeted the news with outrage. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the BJP were attempting to resurrect a set of lies to tarnish the Congress. Mr. Vijayan’s meeting with BJP leaders at the Centre was a precursor of the plot, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cbi-begins-probe-against-cong-leaders/article35968179.ece
18 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Stranded Indians say they feel abandoned in Afghanistan||Sunil (named changed), who hails from northern Kerala, had made Kabul his home for the past decade. Never had he imagined that on a day India celebrated her Independence, he would have to scramble to save his life from the advancing Taliban insurgents who were set to capture the Afghan capital. “On August 15, a group of us [Indians] packed our most essential belongings as soon as we got wind that Kabul was on the verge of surrender and headed for the Indian Embassy. A drive that normally takes 10 minutes took us seven hours. Many among us were looted en route. When we reached, we found that the Embassy was closed, and at that moment, we felt completely abandoned,” he told The Hindu over phone on Tuesday. The withdrawal of the Indian diplomatic mission from Afghan soil has left several Indians despondent. Working as a warehouse manager with a U.S.-headquartered firm in Kabul, Mr. Sunil had led a life of quiet for the past 10 years. All that changed following the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Now, many like him are left to fend for themselves. As his camp was taken over by the Taliban, Mr. Sunil has been living with a friend. While many like Mr. Sunil are holed up in various parts of Kabul, some are stranded in faraway places such as Jalalabad and Herat. While some managed to reach the Kabul airport, they were turned away by the U.S. forces that have been controlling air traffic. With the Taliban shutting down telecom services, people have been relying on weak WiFi signals to contact each other and their dear ones back home through WhatsApp. Many dread their food supplies running out, as no one is able to venture outside their homes. The Kerala government has written to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) for immediate steps to evacuate 41 Keralites, including women and children, who have contacted the Non-Resident Keralites’ Affairs (NoRKA) Department. The government also raised concerns over reports of the Taliban verifying the identity of the stranded Indians and confiscating the passports and other documents of many.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/stranded-indians-say-they-feel-abandoned-in-afghanistan/article35968180.ece

18 August 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP leaders question govt. on closure of criminal cases||The Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) has questioned the State government on the rationale behind indiscriminately scrapping criminal cases, wondering what message will such acts send on the State’s law and order situation, if not strengthening the hands of criminals. Referring to the rescinding of cases filed three years back against some miscreants in Old Guntur for attacking a police station, party’s president Somu Veerraju said such steps would demoralise the police force and urged the IPS officers working in the State to ponder if such steps were in the right direction. In an open letter written to the Chief Minister, he also pointed to the 2015 case filed in Rayachoti police station of Kadapa district, where the miscreants had barged into police station, manhandled policemen and even damaged several vehicles. “This seems to suggest that the Chief Minister is bent on reversing every step. The cash-strapped government may even consider scrapping the police department to save on funds,” he said. Addressing the media in Tirupati on Tuesday, he said such ‘bad practices’ would not augur well for the State’s law and order situation and could even encourage vandalism. “This sends an open message that those close to the government can act with impunity and attack policemen. The BJP would not stand a mute spectator to such erratic steps and would fight back to ensure justice,” he said. Mr. Veerraju later released posters on ‘Jana Aseervada Yatra’ ahead of the visit of Union Minister G. Kishen Reddy to Tirupati and Vijayawada.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-leaders-question-govt-on-closure-of-criminal-cases/article35968597.ece
18 August 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Elevated corridor mired in controversy over name change||The elevated corridor ‘Garuda Varadhi’, which is slowly yet steadily progressing despite the funds crunch, has landed into a fresh controversy on Tuesday, with the council meeting of the Municipal Corporation of Tirupati (MCT) giving it a new name ‘Srinivasa Sethu’. “The flyover, which starts at the abode of Goddess Padmavathi in Tiruchanur and lands at the foot of Tirumala hills, has no official name so far and hence the council has decided to give it a new name,” announced Tirupati MLA Bhumana Karunakar Reddy, who attended as a special invitee to the meeting. He insisted that ‘Garuda Varadhi’ was not a name officially given to the flyover. “More so, a section of the public raised objection over using the sacred name of ‘Garuda’, considered the celestial carrier of Lord Venkateswara, to a bridge where the vehicles are allowed to pass,” he said. He however remained non-committal on christening the same bridge as ‘Srinivasa Sethu’, a more reverential name. Mayor R. Sireesha, who chaired the meeting, announced to have accepted all the resolutions passed in the meeting. Deputy Mayors B. Abhinay Reddy, Mudra Narayana and the other councillors gave their nod to the projects proposed by Commissioner P.S. Gireesha. TDP stages protest TDP councillor R.C. Munikrishna raised objection to the name change, boycotted the meeting and staged a dharna outside along with G. Narasimha Yadav, the TDP’s in-charge for Tirupati parliamentary constituency. “The project was originally named by former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and hence the ‘reversal’ decision,” he fumed. He appealed to politicians not to play with sentimental issues. Taking exception to the ‘unilateral’ decision, Congress leader and former councillor P. Naveen Reddy questioned how the MCT could take a decision without the knowledge of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), a major funding partner. “The project is coming up with TTD funds. The council’s decision will have ramifications beyond the name change. What if the TTD declines funds in future, saying that the flyover is no more ‘Garuda Varadhi’?”, he questioned. Leaders from across the political spectrum appealed to the council to rethink on its decision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/elevated-corridor-mired-in-controversy-over-name-change/article35968599.ece

According to information, Kanaka Durga temple authorities have decided to construct the potu near the pathway of Sivalayam,which is located atop Indrakeeladri as part of the temple development plans. In fact, the potu was shifted downhill as soon as Bhavani mandapam and other structures were pulled down a couple of years ago to develop the greenery there. The temple prasadam potu has been located downhill since then. Kanaka Durga temple officials have prepared plans to construct the potu in a space of 2,500 square metres (more than 26,900 sft). Fourteen prasadam counters would come up in the proposed building. The existing prasadam counters at Mallikarjuna Maha Mandapam would be shifted there. Kitchen and stores would be shifted to the new building which will comprise a cellar and first floor. Tenders finalised The temple administration has already given administrative and technical sanction for the project. Tenders have been finalised and the contract was awarded to M/s.SR Edifice Pvt. Ltd. When contacted, Devasthanam Executive Officer Bhaskar said that the potu works cost Rs. 8.5 crore. The works are expected to be completed by Dasara 2022. Chief Minister Y. S.

18 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Civil activists condemn govt. decision on G.O.s||The State government’s decision to not upload any Government Orders (G.O.s) in the public domain came in for sharp condemnation from civil activists, who said the move was against the tenets of democracy and transparency. Stating that the government’s decision went against the fundamental rights of citizens and was in contravention to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, the activists said they have planned to approach the court in this regard. RTI activists are learnt to be planning to impress upon the State government the need to be transparent and accountable to the people. Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) Access to Information programme head Venkatesh Nayak said that the decision was against Section 4 of the RTI Act. “The Act lucidly says that the governments across the country have to upload all the rules, regulations, instructions, manuals and G.O.s which they make use of while discharging the duties. There was no reason to flout this requirement by the executive or a popularly elected government. The fundamental rights override the Andhra Pradesh Secretariat Office Manual and A.P. Government Businesses Rules. The circular issued by the government doesn't hold water,” Mr. Venkatesh said. Echoing similar views, All India Lawyers’ Union president Sunkara Rajendra Prasad said that the government was watering down the RTI Act, which was promulgated with the view that there should not be any secrecy in the functioning of the government. “The RTI came into existence to help people know about the administration of the government. There should be transparency in governance. This decision would lead to corruption,” he opined. Andhra Pradesh United RTI Activists (AURA) founder president Thota Vinod said that they would meet Governor Biswa Bhushan Harichandan seeking his intervention and take necessary measures so that there was transparency in governance. A representation would be given to the Chief Justice of India (CJI) also, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/civil-activists-condemn-govt-decision-on-gos/article35968716.ece

18 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Pandemic leaves Ganesh idol makers in a fix||With just three weeks to go for Vinayaka Chaviti (September 10), traditional artisans from various areas in the city are keeping their fingers crossed. Though the COVID-19 situation is under control, the idol makers are in a dilemma whether to increase production or not, expressing concern over the possible third wave in the coming weeks. Local idol makers have already started making a limited number of idols and are hopeful of getting good number of orders this year compared to last year. In general, migrants from West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha and a few other places make Ganesh idols at various areas in the city. But due to the COVID-19, many labourers have left for their native places. A few locals who have been involved in idol-making business are hiring artisans form other States. Srinu, a local businessman, has hired several artisans from West Bengal, who are experts in idol making. He has been paying up to Rs. 2,000 per day as wage for each employee. The workers have been making idols for the last few weeks near the APSRTC Waltair Depot. “We have been in this business since many years. But last year, we did not take up it due to COVID-19 situation and restrictions. This year, it seems like the festival will go in a proper manner without any issues, as the cases are on the decline. We are hopeful of making a good business,” he said. As of now, the workers have created about 90 idols of three to seven feet in height. The cost ranges from Rs. 7,000 to Rs. 50,000 per idol. “We will make more idols based on orders only,” Mr. Srinu said. Clay idols Meanwhile, a number of traditional potters from Kummari Veedhi, in Dondaparthy area, have been busy making clay idols in small sizes. The potters said that instead of big sizes, most of them have stuck to manufacturing smaller idols, which could be used to perform puja at houses. They say that even if the government imposes restrictions, the small size clay idols can be sold without any problem. However, compared to the previous years, the traditional potters have reduced the production keeping in view the COVID-19 situation. “Three to four years ago, there would be a need for at least two lorries of clay. Now half of that load is enough. A lorry load of clay costs Rs. 6,000. We pay Rs. 2,000 more for transport. We do not want to incur losses,” said Sathyavathi, a potter from the colony. She said they would increase production based on demand. Ramesh, a potter from Kummari Veedhi, said that with rising awareness over Green Ganesh idols, they generally get bulk orders from NGOs, various welfare and colony associations, commercial establishments, and offices. “Some people also insist on coloured clay idols. For them we use natural colours,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pandemic-leaves-ganesh-idol-makers-in-a-fix/article35968738.ece

The porata committee leaders and members picketed the administrative building of the VSP on Tuesday as part of their ongoing agitation against privatisation of the steel plant. The committee leaders said that the contractors were not coming forward to participate in the bidding process in view of the public protests against privatisation of the VSP. This was the reason for postponement of bidding twice, they said. They recalled that the Union government has admitted in the Rajya Sabha that the VSP had contributed Rs. 4,043.53 crore to the national wealth during the most difficult circumstances. The VSP has also supplied life-saving Liquid Medical Oxygen to various parts of the country during the second wave, it was offering employment to one lakh persons both directly and indirectly besides playing a vital role in the development of the region.

18 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Simhachalam temple to accept only native breeds of calves as donation||Simhachalam Devasthanam Executive Officer M.V. Suryakala has said that the male calves, donated by devotees to the temple, as per their vows to the deity, will be handed over to farmers, free of cost, as the death of calves is bringing disrepute to the temple. In view of the adverse reports in vernacular dailies, Ms. Suryakala told a media conference here on Tuesday, that the devasthanam was being held responsible for the death of calves though it was taking all possible measures like providing fodder, water and shelter to them at the temple ‘goshala’. Male calves, which were still being suckled by their mothers, were weaned away and left on the ‘Toli pavancha’ (first step leading to the hilltop) by devotees. Such calves do not have adequate immunity and turn sick easily. Further, a number of devotees were offering Jersey calves, as part of their vow. These calves were more vulnerable to disease, and the Jersey bulls were not even used for ploughing by the farmers. The EO said that a decision was taken not to accept Jersey calves, hereafter. In fact, this decision was taken way back in 2013 itself and following awareness created among people in the rural areas, the practice of offering Jersey calves declined. Of late, the practice seems to have once again caught the fancy of devotees. Farmers, who were coming to the ‘goshala’ to take the donated male calves, were picking up the healthy ones and leaving behind the famished ones. Replying to queries, she said there was no lapse on the part of the temple officials or staff in the maintenance of the calves but they were being blamed for everything. A decision was, therefore, to give away the calves to identified farmers, as soon as possible, instead of keeping them in the ‘goshala’. She also ruled out further expansion of the ‘goshala’. Viswa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Pudipeddi Sarma said that only native breeds of calves should be donated by devotees to ensure better survival. Devasthanam Trust Board member Narsimha Rao Naidu said that unscrupulous persons were getting fake ‘farmer ID cards’ and taking away the calves for sale at the slaughterhouses. Devotees should also understand that they should donate healthy animals to the deity as part of their vows, he said. Another Trust Board member Surisetti Suri Babu said that receipt should be given for every calf received by the temple.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/simhachalam-to-accept-only-native-cow-breeds/article35968719.ece

The violent tactics of the Maoists are causing disruption of development in the region and loss of lives of tribal people. The recent string of surrenders, which includes tribal leaders, is a clear indication that the Maoist ideology is no longer relevant in the region and the tribal people are vexed up with the violence, the police said. The support base of the Maoists has been dwindling and there has been no fresh recruitment from this region since last few years. Visakhapatnam SP B. Krishna Rao said the tribal people have come forward on a number of occasions, seeking development such as road and cellphone connectivity, which are being opposed by the Maoists. With the support base dwindling, Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee secretary Gajarla Ravi alias Uday is inducting cadres from Chhattisgarh and recently 20 cadres from the DK (Dandakaranya) region have moved into the AOB region . The cadres from Chhattisgarh, who do not understand the local language and culture, are pushing the movement into more critical phase. “This is why we are appealing to the Maoists to join the mainstream, the SP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-appeal-to-maoists-to-join-mainstream/article35968622.ece
18 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Pay fair compensation to tribals to be affected by road project: CPI(M)||The CPI(M) district committee has sought provision of compensation to tribal farmers and house owners, who would be affected by the proposed Greenfield Araku-516 E National Highway and new railway tracks. In a letter to the District Collector on Tuesday, party district committee secretary K. Lokanadham and district secretariat member Killo Surendra said that the affected tribal people should be paid compensation as per the Land Acquisition Act, 2013, which provides for fair compensation to the land and property losers towards their rehabilitation and resettlement. The Act necessitates a social impact study in the area to be affected by the land acquisition and preparation of a report on it. They said that no such study seems to have been made. The tribal people have to be told about the impact of the proposed development works on food security and a notification has to be issued in the newspapers but both these guidelines have not been followed till date, they said. Seeking the intervention of the Collector, the CPI(M) leaders said that as 1/70 Act is in force in tribal areas, the lands in these areas command very low rates. They appealed to the Collector to order payment of compensation to the tribal people based on land rates in the plain areas. The details of the land acquired village-wise and names of beneficiaries should be made available at village secretariats and gram sarpanch offices and the details informed to the beneficiaries through the volunteers. Alleging discrepancies and omissions in the survey, conducted in the past, they said that the names of beneficiaries were note recorded properly and those who were cultivating government land, banjar and poramboke were not recorded as agriculturists. A resurvey should be done between Koyyuru and Anantagiri mandals and tribal people should be involved in the survey. The works should begin only after 75% of compensation was paid to the affected people, under the Act. But, tenders were called in the preliminary stage itself and works were being started in violation of the guidelines, they alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pay-fair-compensation-to-tribals-to-be-affected-by-road-project-cpim/article35968727.ece

Lokesh should not politicise every issue as it some times leads to bad taste. Referring to the TDP leader’s comments during his visit to the house of enginering student Nallapu Ramya who was murdered in Guntur, the Minister alleged that Mr. Lokeshwas using the grief of the victim’s family for political mileage. “Mr. Lokesh is trying to settle political scores at a time when the family of the victim is grieving. This is in bad taste,” he said. Staff reporter from Guntur adds: MLA Merugu Nagarjuna told the media that the Opposition was accusing the government ‘blindly’,which is nothing but politicising an unfortunate incident. “The TDP leaders carried the party flags to the Guntur GGH and delayed the shifting of the victim’s body for Mr. Lokesh’s visit.

Along with leaders of Jana Sena and Dalit Ikya Vedika, Mr. Mohana Rao visited Vallapuram village of Gurla mandal and interacted with the farmers to learn about their plight.

18 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Probe begins into alleged rape at hospital||A day after it was reported that a woman was allegedly raped in Gandhi Hospital, ministers of the Telangana government and top police officers convened a meeting to take stock of the situation. Police on Tuesday said the woman was taken for medical examination, and later to the Bharosa Centre of Hyderabad police where her statement was recorded. Sources also said that the woman failed to identify the security guards who allegedly sexually assaulted her by confining her in a room. “Based on her complaint, we have registered rape case and a probe is on in all angles. However, possibility of repeated sexual assault on her inside the hospital is raising doubts, as there is constant movement of patients, their attendants, doctors, hospital staff and even police officers in some case, in every floor,” an officer requesting anonymity said, adding that the search for another woman who is missing is underway. In the course of developments on Tuesday, Home Minister Mohammad Mahmood Ali and Excise Minister Srinivas Goud met officials of the Gandhi Hospital and Hyderabad City Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar, Additional Commissioner of Police (Crimes) Shikha Goel, and DCP (North) Kalmeshwar Shingenavar. They reiterated that strict action would be taken against those who harass women in the State, even as they directed the police to probe the case from all angles, and in an expeditious manner. The Commissioner said that special teams have been formed to nab the accused. Later in the day, Telangana State Women’s Commission Chairperson V Sunitha Lakshma Reddy too visited Gandhi Hospital and sought information about the alleged rape in which a hospital staff is said to be an accused. Sources said that police have spoke to other patients in the ward. The alleged rape saw the protests with the Mahila Congress demanding the arrest at the earliest of those are are involved. The Chilkalguda police booked a case against a member of the staff of the hospital, reported to be a friend of the complainant’s brother, who was being treated at the hospital. The complainant alleged that she was injected with unknown substances and then raped for four days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/probe-begins-into-alleged-rape-at-hospital/article35968489.ece
18 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CRS in for revamp with penalties mooted for delays||Civil Registration System (CRS), the dynamic births and deaths website initiated by the Central government for a uniform registration process across the country six years ago is in for a revamp with provisions like monetary fines for delays or non-issuance of certificates, in light of discrepancies observed during the COVID waves throughout the country. While Telangana has not yet joined the system and Andhra Pradesh has firmed up being the only one from the South to be part of the online registration system, the draft proposals circulated shows that the Centre wants to introduce penalties against both the registration officials and the hospitals concerned for not issuing births and deaths certificates before the mandated 7-21 days. “Missing persons in both births/deaths and duplications can be avoided if States adhere to CRS as monitoring mechanism and integration of data is lacking at the village, mandal and district levels. Registration of Births and Deaths Act 1969 is in for major change once proposals are discussed and rules are framed,” informed senior officials, wishing to remain unnamed. Draft proposals suggest that any official or hospital refusing to write name, description and place of abode or to put thumb mark in the register would have to pay a fine of Rs. 250 and in case of any institution, the fine can be extended up to Rs. 500 per event of birth or death. Any Registrar — Assistant Medical Officer of Health (AMOH), Mandal Revenue Officer (MRO) — or Sub-Registrar — Assistant Municipal Commissioners (AMCs) or the village secretary — neglecting or refusing without a reasonable cause, to register any birth or death occurring in his/ her jurisdiction can be fined for up to Rs. 1,000 per case. Any medical practitioner neglecting to issue a certificate and any person refusing and deliver such certificate can also be punished for up to Rs. 1,000 in each event of a birth or death. In case of the criminal offence in giving false certificates, a penal fee of Rs. 150 is to be levied on the particular person or in case of institution a Rs. 500 fine per event of birth or death. Aadhaar number inclusion is to be made mandatory and CRS data can be used to update Population Registrar, electoral rolls, ration card database, passport and others. Another change suggested is appointment of special sub-registrars in event of any disaster for the spot registration of deaths and in respect of non-institutional adoption, the adoptive parents will have to provide information. In respect of child born to a single parent/ unwed mother from her womb, the parent or the nearest relative can do so. Any death occurring in medical institutions — public or private — it is mandatory to provide a certificate as to the cause of death. Senior officials hope that the draft will also bring a clarity about uniformity in departments dealing with registration because it is either the health department, department of economics and statistics or local governments in the States. TS has its own unified births and deaths website with glaring absence of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and many other civic bodies. “GHMC is mandated to issue birth/death certificates but it has stopped and enabled Meeseva centres to do so at a charge of an additional Rs. 10, at Rs. 30. At Rs. 20 per certificate, citizen service centres were able to generate more than Rs. 50 lakh revenue annually to take care of all expenses including salary to health assistants,” add senior officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/civil-registration-system-in-for-revamp-with-penalties-mooted-for-delays/article35968480.ece
18 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||50,000 2BHK units await allotment: CPI(M)||Despite completion of thousands of double bedroom housing units, the government has been dragging its feet when it comes to identification of beneficiaries and allotment of homes in the city. The fact was brought out through a petition under the Right To Information Act, by the CPI(M) city unit. As per the details shared by the party’s city secretary M. Srinivas at a media conference on Tuesday, construction of 51,346 double bedroom units has been completed in the city till now, while State-wide, the figure is over one lakh. Another 33,209 dwelling units in city are nearing completion, and ready for distribution in a few months. However, so far, the number of units allotted to beneficiaries in the city stands at mere 3,660, Mr.Srinivas shared, and questioned the rationale behind keeping the units vacant for years. The government has taken up the double bedroom housing project after formation of Telangana as separate State, and sanctioned 2.91 lakh dwelling units so far across the State with an estimated expenditure of Rs. 19,000 crore. So far, the government has spent Rs. 10428 crore on construction of the units, of which Rs. 8745 crore has been availed as loan from the HUDCO, while Central government has sanctioned Rs. 1311 crore as its share, the reply to the RTI petition said. State government, on the other hand, sanctioned a total of Rs. 23,679 crore towards the project over the last six years, of which only Rs. 371 crore has been spent going by the RTI reply, Mr. Srinivas pointed out. As per the Intensive Household Survey carried out by the Telangana government, the number of poor people without home is estimated to be at 4.57 lakh. Government has later received a whopping seven lakh applications for the double bedroom housing units. Both these numbers reflect the magnitude of the affordable housing needs in the State, but the government is delaying the process of identification of beneficiaries inordinately, disregarding its own orders issued a year-and-a-half ago for allotment of 4,125 units per constituency, Mr. Srinivas accused. Meanwhile, the needy people are falling into the trap of middlemen from the ruling party, hoping for allotment of the housing units, he alleged. While the poor are forced to pay for rented accommodation, public money is wasted on payment of interest on loans availed for the project, he said. Demanding speedy identification of beneficiaries and allotment of completed housing units, CPI(M) will start relay hunger strikes from August last week, Mr.Srinivas said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/50000-2bhk-units-await-allotment-cpim/article35968495.ece

ASRAAM is one of the ‘within visual range’ missiles available and BDL will be manufacturing these at its Bhanur unit in Telangana for domestic and export purposes through MBDA. The new facility will provide India with the ability to carry out final assembly, integration and test of ASRAAM missiles. This new generation close combat missile with its low drag, aerodynamic airframe, unrivalled speed and manoeuvrability throughout its flight along with increased agility makes it the best missile in its category of weapons. The missile has full ‘Lock On Before Launch’ and ‘Lock On After Launch’ operating modes, a press release said. “We are very pleased to be establishing this new ASRAAM facility with BDL. MBDA has a long and highly successful history of working with it for over four decades where a large number of MBDA-designed Milan missiles were made here,” said Mr. George Kyriakides. The new BDL ASRAAM facility will have the potential to also conduct maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) of missiles. It can also be adapted to conduct final assembly, integration and test of the CAMM missile of MBDA. CAMM is the missile used by the Sea Ceptor naval air defence system that has been offered as Short Range Surface to Air Missile (SRSAM) requirement. The BDL is the only firm in the country involved in manufacturing various types of missiles and underwater weapons for supply to the Indian armed forces and friendly foreign countries. It also handles launchers, test equipment, refurbishment/life extension of missiles and counter measures systems for domestic as well as international market. The MBDA with significant presence in five European countries and United States is capable of designing and producing missiles and missile systems corresponding to the full range of current and future operational needs of the three armed forces (land, sea and air).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bdl-ties-up-with-uk-firm-to-make-advanced-missiles/article35968493.ece

Party legislator and Public Undertakings Committee Chairman A. Jeevan Reddy said here on Tuesday that in spite of the conspiracies of the Congress and BJP to un-popularise the State Government, people in the State are making every scheme a big hit by receiving them with overwhelming support. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president A. Revanth Reddy, State BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar, BJP MP Dharmapuri Aravind and others are talking non-sense about Dalit Bandhu with the fear that people would abandon them permanently, once the dalit families start prospering with the revolutionary scheme announced by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, he said. The TRS leader pointed out that Mr. Bandi Sanjay had himself become a joke after promising insurance claims to vehicles damaged in the 2020 heavy rains and inundation of residential colonies in the city during the GHMC election campaign. He asked the two opposition parties to implement schemes like Dalit Bandhu in the States governed by them if they have any intention to uplift the dalit communities. He stated that the success of Dalit Bandhu in Telangana, even on pilot basis, would build pressure on the Centre and other States to think over such a scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-hits-back-at-cong-bjp-for-flaying-dalit-bandhu/article35968657.ece

Uttam Kumar Reddy on Tuesday alleged that the State government is deceiving women in self-help groups by not releasing dues of interest-free loans to them. Addressing local leaders at the mandal parishad general body meet in Vemulapally of Miryalaguda, he said the government owes dues of over Rs. 2,000 cr. to SHGs in the State and called it an unfortunate situation. Village sarpanches and MPTCs brought to the notice of the senior leader that fair price shops, under the public distribution system, are distributing mixed rice – coarse and fine – to white ration card holders. Mr. Reddy acknowledging grievances of Anganwadi workers said he would demand the State government to distribute only fine variety rice for mother and childcare through anganwadis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-govt-owes-rs-2000-cr-dues-to-shg-women/article35968491.ece
18 August 2021||RUDRARAM (SANGAREDDY DIST.),TELANGANA||Anything possible with political will: KTR||Information Technology Minister K. T. Rama Rao said that anything is possible if one has the political will. Telangana government has proved it again and again in spite of opposition from bureaucrats and other sections, he said. He said like Rythu Bandhu, Dalit Bandhu will become a model for the entire nation and expressed confidence that it will be be implemented without any problems. “Many ridiculed Chief Minister and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) president K. Chandrasekhar Rao when he embarked upon the mission of establishing a separate State. It has become a reality. Same is the case with Kaleshwaram project. He is meticulous and has the habit of working at minute levels and ensures complete execution of projects. Regarding Mission Bhagiratha, when we said we want 100% execution of the project within three-and-a-half years, officials from Gujarat, the first State to complete 70% of potable water supply to households, said that it was impossible stating that even Narendra Modi as Chief Minister could not do that. Now, the Union Jalashakthi Minister says that Telangana has been supplying potable water to each household,” said Mr. Rao while interacting with students of Kautilya School of Public Policy held at GITAM deemed to be university on Tuesday. Mr. Rao explained in detail his previous employment with a multinational company as in-charge of South Asia, then quitting job and entering politics without informing his father, winning the first election with 171 votes from Sircilla, then again winning with a majority of 89,000 votes, formation of Telangana, and becoming a Minister. “I am a second-generation politician and have seen my father closely working directly or indirectly in public life. My father worked in various roles as MLA and Minister. He wanted me to write UPSC exam and become an officer. He sent me to JNU for two months. There was something written on the walls of JNU that stuck me - In democracy everything will be decided by politics. You better decide what your politics is - I joined public life without his knowledge. I worked as an ordinary party worker from 2006 to 2009,” said Mr. Rao adding that he went to the US after completing his masters in bio-technology. On the strides made by the TRS government, Mr Rao said that the per capita power consumption is a yardstick of development, and in Telangana, the installed capacity of power has increased from 7,780 MW at the time of bifurcation to 16,000 MW and the consumption is 12,000 MW., more than that of the combined State, he said. Private investment of Rs. 2.35 lakh crore was made in the State in the last seven years by which about 15 lakh jobs were created, Mr. Rao said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/anything-possible-with-political-will-ktr/article35968498.ece

18 August 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Rival yatras target Gujarat’s hinterlands||Though Assembly elections in Gujarat are more than a year away, political parties have begun outreach campaigns, each with a series of yatras across the State. Seeking justice or nayay for the families of those who died of COVID-19 infection in Gujarat, the State Congress unit launched a yatra to meet all bereaved families. The opposition party has also demanded Rs. 4 lakh compensation from the BJP-ruled State government for COVID victims since the outbreak in March 2020. Officially, 10,078 people have died of the viral infection as per the data of the State Health Department. However, estimates based on data from local authorities, crematoriums and other sources say the actual toll could be upto a dozen times higher. As the pandemic has subsided now, the Congress is trying to reach out to the families of the victims. By raising the demand for compensation for the families, the opposition party has struck an emotional chord and also hopes to expose the failures of the BJP government during the pandemic. “We will meet each family which has lost its near and dear ones in the pandemic. This is to extend more moral and emotional support to them. We are demanding compensation of Rs. 4 lakh to each of the families,” said Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda. He said other demands include reimbursement of COVID-19 treatment bills incurred by patients at private hospitals, a judicial inquiry into the administration's failure in tackling the outbreak, as well as jobs for children of those government employees who died due to the virus. The Congress outreach exercise will cover all districts over two months and party leaders and workers are expected to visit more than 10,000 villages apart from more urban areas. Meanwhile, newly inducted BJP Union ministers from Gujarat have embarked on a Jan Ashirvad Yatra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/rival-yatras-target-gujarats-hinterlands/article35968567.ece

18 August 2021||Kabul,||Biden defends U.S.’s Afghan withdrawal||U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday defended the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan after the Taliban's stunning military takeover that triggered panic in Kabul with thousands mobbing the airport in a desperate attempt to flee. In his first public appearance since the Islamist insurgents seized control of the country at the weekend, he admitted the Taliban advance had unfolded more quickly than expected. Heaping criticism at the Western-backed government that was ousted with shockingly little resistance, he said U.S. troops could not defend a nation whose leaders “gave up and fled”, as did President Ashraf Ghani. “We gave them every chance to determine their own future. We could not provide them with the will to fight for that future,” Mr. Biden said in his address at the White House. “American troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves.” Panick stricken residents The Taliban captured Kabul, and most other main cities, with little bloodshed. But in the capital, panic gripped many residents who feared a repeat of the Taliban’s brutal Islamist rule from 1996 to 2001. At the airport, thousands of Afghans scrambled to board the few flights available. The United States has sent 6,000 troops to ensure the safe evacuation of Embassy staff, as well as Afghans who worked as interpreters or in other support roles. Other governments including France, Germany and Australia also organised charter flights.  Taliban fighters have taken over checkpoints across Kabul, and militants with rifles slung over their shoulders walked through the streets of the Green Zone, the heavily fortified district that houses most embassies and international organisations. Mr. Ghani's departure on Sunday finalised the collapse of his government. His whereabouts are currently unknown. The Taliban sought to reassure the international community that Afghans should not fear them, with co-founder Abdul Ghani Baradar saying the militants needed to show that they could “serve our nation and ensure security”. But many Afghans struggled to take comfort from such assurances. “It is a nightmare for educated women who envisioned a brighter future for themselves and generations to come," Aisha Khurram, a former youth representative to the UN, told AFP . The State Department said any U.S. ties with a Taliban government would depend on their respect of human rights and rejection of extremism. Mr. Biden issued a stern warning to the Taliban, saying any threats to U.S. interests would be met with a “devastating” military response.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-defends-uss-afghan-withdrawal/article35968113.ece
18 August 2021||August 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Hasty U.S. pullout caused a severely adverse impact: China||China on Tuesday said the “hasty” United States withdrawal from Afghanistan had caused “a severely adverse impact” there and conveyed to Washington that it could not “on the one hand work hard to contain China” and “on the other count on China’s support” to help stabilise the country. The message was delivered in a phone call on Tuesday between Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, which China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said in a statement took place at the latter’s request. Mr. Wang criticised the U.S. withdrawal to Mr. Blinken as well as it’s broader Afghan strategy over the past 20 years, delivering a withering assessment of its legacy there, according to the MFA statement carrying a readout of the call. The U.S. State Department in a brief statement said Mr. Blinken had, during the call, briefed China about developments in Afghanistan, including the security situation and efforts to bring U.S. and Chinese citizens to safety. The MFA said Mr. Wang had “elaborated” on China’s position “saying that facts have once again proved that it is difficult to gain a foothold in a country with a completely different history, culture and national conditions by mechanically copying foreign models.” People’s support “A regime cannot stand without the support of its people, and using power and military means to solve problems will only cause more problems. Such lessons deserve serious reflection,” he told Mr. Blinken. He also said “the hasty U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan has caused a severely adverse impact on the situation in Afghanistan and it would not be responsible if it continues to create new problems.” He criticised the previous Donald Trump administration’s move “to remove the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement from its list of terrorist organisations and apply double standards on the issue of counter-terrorism”. Among China’s concerns in Afghanistan is the presence of ETIM jihadists there which Beijing has said has carried out attacks in its western Xinjiang region, which shares a border with Afghanistan. Mr. Wang also said that cooperating on Afghanistan would not be possible while other tensions remained in the U.S.-China relationship. “China stands ready to have communication and dialogue with the United States to push for a soft landing of the Afghan issue, so that a new civil war or humanitarian disaster will be prevented in Afghanistan and the country will not relapse into a hotbed and shelter for terrorism,” he said. “However, the United States cannot, on the one hand, work hard to contain and suppress China and undermine China's legitimate rights and interests,” Mr. Wang said. “On the other hand, it counts on China's support and cooperation. Such logic has never existed in international exchanges.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hasty-us-pullout-caused-a-severely-adverse-impact-china/article35968115.ece
18 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘IS, JeM, LeT militants entered Kabul’||A large number of fighters belonging to the Islamic State (IS), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) have entered Afghanistan capital Kabul in the last few days, sources on the ground have informed. The Taliban leadership is aware of the presence of these foreign terrorists, who entered the city carrying the Taliban flag. It is understood that the groups are operating in different parts of the city and are not under the control of the Taliban. Under the agreement with the U.S., the Taliban are committed to preventing terrorist groups from operating in Afghanistan and are expected to evict these groups from Kabul in the next few days. An Afghan human rights worker who works closely with the Taliban political office in Doha said the next few days are going to be critical as the groups may indulge in operations on their own in violation of the orders of the Taliban leadership. Taliban leaders are trying to mobilise themselves to prevent the foreign fighters from finding a base in Kabul and some developments in that direction took place late on Monday with the arrival of Mullah Yaqub, son of the late Mullah Omar, founder of the Taliban. Possible clashes Yaqub arrived from Quetta, where the Taliban leaders have been based for decades. He is the ‘chief of operations’ of the Taliban forces, and it is expected that he will soon begin firming up the Taliban’s rule over Kabul. There are concerns about possible clashes that may take place between these terror groups and the Taliban if the latter try to dislodge them militarily. “Irrespective of the threats, the Taliban have asked them to leave Afghanistan and they will have to obey the orders,” said the human rights worker over phone from a location in Afghanistan. The Taliban have already engaged former President Hamid Karzai, Tajik leader and former CEO of Afghanistan Abdullah Abdullah and Hezb-e-Islami chief Gulbuddin Hekmatyar seeking support in forming the next government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/is-jem-let-militants-entered-kabul/article35968122.ece
18 August 2021||Panjshir,||Saleh says he’s ‘legitimate caretaker President of Afghanistan’||Afghanistan's defiant Vice-President Amrullah Saleh said on Tuesday he is “the legitimate caretaker President” after President Ashraf Ghani fled the country. “Clarity: As per d constitution of Afg, in absence, escape, resignation or death of the President the FVP becomes the caretaker President. I am currently inside my country & am the legitimate care taker President. Am reaching out to all leaders to secure their support & consensus,” Mr. Saleh posted on Twitter. It appears that Mr. Saleh has retreated to the country's last remaining holdout: the Panjshir Valley in the northeast of Kabul. “I won't disappoint millions who listened to me. I will never be under one ceiling with Taliban. NEVER,” he wrote in English on Twitter on Sunday, before going underground. A day later, pictures began to surface on social media of the former Vice-President with the son of his former mentor and famed anti-Taliban fighter Ahmed Shah Massoud in Panjshir — a mountainous redoubt tucked into the Hindu Kush. Mr. Saleh and Mr. Massoud’s son, who commands a militia force, appear to be putting together the first pieces of a guerilla movement to take on the victorious Taliban, as fighters regroup in Panjshir. "We will not allow the Taliban to enter Panjshir and will resist with all our might and power, and fight them,” one resident said on condition of anonymity. History with Taliban Such a battle would be the latest in Mr. Saleh’s long struggle against the Taliban as a one-time insurgent turned spy chief and later vice premier. Orphaned at a young age, Mr. Saleh first fought alongside guerilla commander Massoud in the 1990s. He went on to serve in his government before being chased out of Kabul when the Taliban captured it in 1996. The hardliners then tortured his sister in their bid to hunt him down, Mr. Saleh has said. After the September 11, 2001, attacks, Mr. Saleh — then a part of the anti-Taliban resistance — became a key asset for the CIA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/saleh-says-hes-legitimate-caretaker-president-of-afghanistan/article35968117.ece

18 August 2021||Tokyo,||Maki Kaji, godfather of Sudoku, dies in Japan||Maki Kaji, the creator of the popular numbers puzzle Sudoku whose life’s work was spreading the joy of puzzles, has died, his Japanese company said on Tuesday. He was 69 and had bile duct cancer. Known as the “Godfather of Sudoku,” Kaji created the puzzle to be easy for children and others who didn’t want to think too hard. Its name is made up of the Japanese characters for “number” and “single,” and players place the numbers 1 through 9 in rows, columns and blocks without repeating them. Ironically, it wasn’t until 2004 when Sudoku became a global hit, after a fan from New Zealand pitched it and got it published in the British newspaper The Times . Two years later, Japan rediscovered its own puzzle as a “gyakuyunyu”, or “reimport”. Kaji was chief executive at his puzzle company, Nikoli Co., until July and died on August 10 at his home in Mitaka, a city in the Tokyo metro area. Originally, Sudoku was called “Suji-wa-Dokushin-ni-Kagiru”, which translates to, “Numbers should be single, a bachelor”. Born in the main northern island of Hokkaido, Kaji started Japan’s first puzzle magazine after dropping out of Keio University in Tokyo. He founded Nikoli in 1983, and came up with Sudoku about the same time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/maki-kaji-godfather-of-sudoku-dies-in-japan/article35968120.ece
18 August 2021||August 18 2021 00:00 IST,||The script of the new endgame in Afghanistan||The rapidity with which Afghanistan has unravelled has shocked and surprised everyone. The fall of Kabul, and the ignominious end of any resistance to the Taliban within six weeks of the U.S. forces vacating the Bagram airbase (near Kabul) on July 2, reveals how brittle the vaunted Afghan Security Forces were. The departure of Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani and almost the entire top political leadership of Afghanistan to safer havens, removes the last vestige of hope that the Taliban can be checked. Like a ‘house of cards’, Afghanistan has fallen apart the moment foreign forces vacated the country. Taliban’s duplicity The enormity of the current situation is only now beginning to be evident to much of the outside world. The Taliban’s duplicity in projecting, at one level the image of a mature group during the Doha talks while at another, perpetuating violence of the most ferocious kind, is clearly evident as events unfold. The worst is, perhaps, yet to come. Afghanistan today is in a condition that is far worse than what existed when the Russians withdrew in the 1990s. At that time, there was at least a titular leader around whom those opposed to the Taliban could hope to mobilise and put up a fight. Moreover, the ‘retreat’ of the United States from Afghanistan in 2021 is far more humbling than the Russian withdrawal in the 1990s, for the latter at least had to contend with the actions of a superpower, like the U.S. This time the Taliban having played fast and loose with the U.S. has left the ‘superpower’ with not even the fig leaf of a honourable withdrawal. U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision to set a date for the withdrawal of the American forces, and treat this decision as one carved in stone irrespective of the situation within Afghanistan — without any consideration of the consequences — clearly enabled the Taliban to take over. After the Russian withdrawal in the 1990s, Afghanistan still had a future, for in the final years of the 20th century, the world was intent on making efforts to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a ‘black hole’ that would create mayhem across a vast region that bordered Iran, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and China. In the 1990s, moreover, the Taliban were a band of outlaws. Today, it is recognised — may be with different degrees of disdain — by powers such as the U.S., Russia and China, and is on the brink of gaining a country. For a regulated international order that most countries across the world seek, there could be no greater tragedy than the emergence of a ‘rogue’ state under the Taliban. Paving the way for terror The Afghan Establishment seemed to give up the fight against the Taliban earlier on by ceding authority to private militias, former Afghan warlords and a rabble of disparate armed groups. To expect that this kind of armed rabble would resist the Taliban was clearly a mistake. As the Afghan state implodes, one should now expect a wider cleaving between Pashtuns, Uzbeks, Tajiks, Hazaras and the myriad other clans that populate Afghanistan. The virtual death of the Afghan nation, approximates as it were to the ‘end of history’. The collapse of organised resistance to the Taliban within Afghanistan, together with the group being courted by Russia, China and quite a few other nations, apart from Pakistan — not excluding the U.S. — marks the saddest day in the history of a proud nation. This is also a moment of tragedy for Asia as a whole. It virtually spells the death-knell of any possible Afghan renaissance in the near future. Instead, the situation is far more likely to encourage erstwhile terror groups, such as the one led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar — a one-time client of Pakistan and a traditional opponent of the Taliban — to return to their erstwhile hunting grounds. Afghanistan versus Syria References to Afghanistan becoming another Syria are again misplaced. At the worst of times, Syria had a relatively strong President (Bashar al-Assad), while Afghan President Ghani can hardly be compared to him. The territory of Afghanistan is also very different from that of Syria. Afghanistan’s borders, with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, unlike that of Syria are extremely porous and almost impossible to guard or protect. More to the point, the end-game in Afghanistan has little in common with the power equations witnessed in Syria. In Afghanistan, the Taliban is intent on keeping absolute control and is counting on China, Russia, and Pakistan to do so. All of them are more intent on keeping out the U.S., and in effect India. Indulging in a blame game at this time may appear inappropriate. However, the U.S. cannot shrug off a major share of the responsibility for Afghanistan’s current plight. Apart from the decision of Mr. Biden not to alter the last date for the exit of U.S. troops in Afghanistan — which sent a clear signal to the Taliban of a collapse of U.S. resolve to safeguard the interests of Afghanistan — the stealthy exit of the U.S. from the Bagram airbase also left an indelible impression as far as the Taliban was concerned: that the U.S. had acknowledged the Taliban’s supremacy in return for the safe passage of their troops. All this has diminished the image of the U.S. in Asian eyes. In light of this, U.S. claims to ‘make America great again’ sound extremely hollow. Old threats may resurface Some political commentators seem to believe that after the initial success of the Taliban and the collapse of the Afghan state, the natural political dynamics of the region would assert itself. This seems like a pious wish. After two decades of active involvement in the affairs of Afghanistan, and spending over a trillion dollars in the process to defeat terrorism and the al Qaeda, the U.S. has left Afghanistan in a worse situation than when it entered. It is not possible to discern any reduction in terrorism or the demise of any of the better known terror groups, such as the al Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS), or for that matter, of lesser known terror outfits. As a matter of fact, there has been a resurgence in al Qaeda activities recently. The IS, after some earlier setbacks, is again regrouping and currently poses a real threat to areas abutting, and including, Afghanistan. Radicalised Islamist terror and the forces of ‘doctrinaire theocracy’ have, if anything, thus become stronger. The collapse of the Afghan state will ignite many old threats. Compared to the situation when the U.S. left Vietnam in 1975 — which was also seen by many as a kind of ‘retreat’— the Afghan ‘misadventure’ has been a disaster. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, Vietnam was able to emerge as a vibrant nation with a thriving economy. Under the Taliban regime, Afghanistan cannot hope for any such outcome. It would remain the ‘sick man of Asia’ for generations to come, a standing folly to perils of outside intervention in the affairs of another nation. Stakes for India, Iran Among Afghanistan’s neighbours, India and Iran are two countries that would find accommodation with a Taliban-dominated Afghanistan very difficult. Pakistan may be an enigma of sorts, but the Taliban will need Pakistan at least in the short and medium term. Relations between Taliban Afghanistan and Uzbekistan and Tajikistan may not be easy, but will not lead to any major problems for now. India, even more than Shia-dominated Iran, may be the outlier among Afghanistan’s neighbours for a variety of reasons, including its warm relations with the Karzai and the Ghani regimes in the past two decades. If the 21st century was expected to become the century of progress, the situation in Afghanistan represents a severe setback to all such hopes and expectations. The aftershock of the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban can be expected to continue for long. For India, the virtual retreat of the U.S. from this part of Asia; the growing China-Russia-Pakistan nexus across the region; and an Iran under a hardliner like Ebrahim Raisi, all work to its disadvantage. A great deal of hard thinking is needed as to how to retrieve a situation that for the present seems heavily tilted against India. M.K.

18 August 2021||August 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Remembering the horrors of Partition||Remembrances of mass killings and collective violence can play an important part in societies seeking forgiveness for the crimes they committed against humanity and resolving that they will never let those terrible events happen again. Israel remembers the Holocaust for more reasons than one. For different reasons, Germany too remembers the Holocaust through discussions in schoolbooks, public events and more. Japan, by actively remembering Hiroshima and Nagasaki, has not allowed the world to forget the destruction caused by the nuclear bombs dropped on the two cities. Not all nations, though, are committed to national remembrance. The United States, for instance, has not cared to publicly remember the genocide of the Native Americans during the 18th and 19th centuries. A refusal to remember The biggest example of forgetfulness of a 20th century event is that by India. It has never cared to collectively remember the estimated two million Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs who died in targeted murders and the tens of millions who were displaced in British India during the months before Independence. India’s holocaust, which never has an ‘H’ to it, is for the most part something we remember as having happened because of British perfidy and Mohammed Ali Jinnah’s cunning ways. As a society we bear no responsibility, we believe. But it is only by constantly telling ourselves what happened that we can come to terms with the mass murders of the time. By not remembering the crimes perpetrated on each other, we do not reach closure, we only push them aside in our minds. There is no national memorial for the millions murdered, sexually violated, and displaced during Partition. School textbooks only note the killings; they do not remember them. There are no names, there are no faces, there are no voices of those millions. In a reflection of the national attitude, the arts too barely remember the slaughters. Saadat Hasan Manto’s stories, Bhisham Sahni’s novel Tamas (which was also turned into a film for TV), and the fictionalised presentations in the film Bhaag Milkha Bhaag are exceptions. The academic world has over the past quarter century sought to make amends with a wide body of work of Partition studies and the creation of Partition archives, but these have not permeated into wider society. (There is, though, a Partition Museum that has been established in Amritsar, not by a government but by a trust set up by a dedicated group of citizens.) The blame for this post-Independence refusal to remember and seek forgiveness must be laid squarely at the door of the governments since 1947. In their anxiety to deny the two-nation theory, the state of the new republic sought to gloss over the terrible killings of Partition. It did not forget the mass murders, but it did not seek to actively remember the horrors that had taken place only a few years earlier. Pakistan was no different in not remembering the violence that happened on its side of what became a new national border. Independent India’s call was ‘Let us get on with building a nation of communal harmony’. Yet it was the opposite that happened. In the absence of collective remembrance, people’s memories of the mass violence became easy fodder for the embers of communal hatred. Indeed, the refusal to openly acknowledge and atone for the Partition slaughter was an important cause of the communal violence that dotted the decades after 1947. A string of violent events took hundreds of lives each time, if not thousands, from Jabalpur (1961) to Ahmedabad (1969), Jamshedpur (1979), Moradabad (1980), Bhiwandi (1984), the Rath Yatra killings of 1989, Bhagalpur (1989), the Babri Masjid demolition violence of 1992-93, Bombay (1993); the list is endless extending to Gujarat (2002) and beyond. All these conflagrations are testimony to the outcome of the divisions built around Partition that have lingered ever since. Reopening wounds It is never late to begin the process of remembrance and to come to terms with the past without erasing it. This remembrance must be of all the communities — Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs — in undivided India, on both sides of the present borders, in the west and the east, who saw unimaginable devastation. It must be a journey of remembrance that seeks forgiveness and makes us say ‘Never again’. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision (let us make no mistake: the decision has the Prime Minister’s imprint all over it) to institute August 14 every year as ‘Partition Horrors Remembrance Day’ cannot be such a beginning. No communities are mentioned in the Prime Minister’s statement, but the choice of the date tells us what it is about. Up to two million people of all religions died, but it is on the day which marks Pakistan’s emergence as a nation that we will remember the brutalities of Partition. This kind of remembrance will reopen wounds and give a new edge to the divisions that led to the deaths during Partition. If the post-Independence error was to avoid talking about the mass killings, the new decision will keep the past on the boil. This is not remembrance; it encourages us to let the wounds fester. We are surprised with this decision, but we should not be. It is in keeping with the idea of India as a Hindu Rashtra. A part of the Rashtra was ‘lost’ to Pakistan on August 14, 1947, and we are now told that we must remember on that very day those who lost their lives during the events that ended with the break-up of the so-called Akhand Bharat. This is not a dog whistle ahead of the Uttar Pradesh elections; it is something more dangerous. Seventy-five years after the birth of two countries, this decision by the Prime Minister of India seems to be aimed at recalling that the emergence in 1947 of two independent nations, rather than just one, was a mistake that we cannot be allowed to forget. The institution of ‘Partition Horrors Remembrance Day’ will then not help us remember and grieve in silence for the people who were killed. It will have the opposite effect — perhaps even intentionally — of retaining the anger over Partition. Such a decision could have dangerous consequences in the future. If we truly want to make a beginning at remembrance of the horrors of the time, we could start by establishing a national museum of Partition in the heart of New Delhi. Mahatma Gandhi had suggested after Independence that the Viceroy’s House (now Rashtrapati Bhavan) should be turned into a hospital; the suggestion was not taken up. Perhaps, now we could turn the new residence of the Prime Minister, proposed as part of the Central Vista Redevelopment Project, into a museum that remembers the millions of people of all communities who were killed or were forced to flee their homes 75 years ago. Such a national memorial in India could be a catalyst for Pakistan and Bangladesh to establish similar museums to honour the dead in those parts of British India. This may well mark a larger South Asian process of remembrance of everyone who died, whatever their religious denomination and wherever their location at the time of Partition. This would be a true collective atonement for those terrible events. C.

18 August 2021||August 18 2021 00:00 IST,||A report that is at odds with access to knowledge||In 2002, in light of two progressive pronouncements by the Supreme Court of India ( Miss Mohini Jain vs State of Karnataka and Ors. and State of Himachal Pradesh vs H.P. State Recognised and Aided Schools Managing Committees and Ors. ), the right to education found a secure constitutional home in the fundamental rights chapter of the Indian Constitution. This fundamental right, set out in Article 21A, guarantees every child between the ages of 6 and 14 access to free and compulsory education. In a series of rulings ( Anuradha Bhasin vs Union of India , and Avinash Mehrotra vs Union of India ), the top court has interpreted the right in a broad and expansive way, holding that it imposes an affirmative obligation on the government and civil society to secure its enjoyment. Consistent with this spirit, the Court held in Farzana Batool vs Union of India that, while access to professional education is not a fundamental right, the state must take affirmative measures to secure the right to education at all levels. State’s failure Against this backdrop, the cavalier dismissal of the right to education under the garb of “ensuring balance between copyright protection of the publishers and public access to affordable educational study material” by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce in a recent report (https://bit.ly/3maSZhq), is deeply worrying. The Committee suggests curtailing fair dealing provisions under Indian Copyright law — which enable access to the work without the copyright holder’s consent — since it was informed that the provisions pose “a detrimental impact on the publishing industry and authors who are mainly dependent on royalties”. To highlight this as a concern instead of the abject state failure to remedy impediments to accessing educational material, exacerbated by the novel coronavirus pandemic, betrays complete ignorance of the state’s obligation to secure the right to education. The issue of ‘purpose’ The Committee takes note of the Delhi High Court’s landmark judgment in the DU photocopy case. In that case ( The Chancellor, Masters & Scholars of the University of Oxford & Ors vs Rameshwari Photocopy Services & Anr.), the court (both the Single Judge and the Division Bench) adopted a robust understanding of the educational exception enumerated in the list of fair dealing provisions in the Copyright Act. Section 52(1)(i) allows the reproduction of any work by a teacher or a pupil in the course of instruction. The court held that ‘course of instruction’ therein is not confined to the time and place of instruction, and would include anything that could be justified for the purpose of instruction. This includes steps commencing at a time prior to lecturing and continuing till after it. It also noted that apart from Section 52(1)(a), which provides for the right to a “fair dealing” of any copyrightable work, other rights/purposes enumerated under Section 52 would not have to meet the express requirement of fair dealing. Thus, Section 52(1)(i) was recognised as enumerating an affirmative purpose exempt from infringement. The fairness of use under these Sections can be deemed to be presumed by the legislature as long as it is justified by the purpose specified. Consistent with this, the court also noted that there are no quantitative restrictions on the extent of the reproduction permitted as long as it is justified by a specific purpose under Section 52. In its report, the Standing Committee notes that it is distressed that the conflict between educational institutions and copyright owners does not bode well for the “overall literary culture and image of the country”. In a bid to make the system fair and equitable, it calls on the government to amend Section 52 to allow for such copying only in government-owned institutions. It further states that there should be a quantitative limit on how much copying is permissible and regulation of the storage of copied works in digital formats. A flawed view The Committee’s views are flawed for multiple reasons. First, they betray a profound misunderstanding of the raison d’etre for granting copyright in educational content. As the single judge eloquently noted in the DU photocopy case, the purpose of copyright is to increase the: “harvest of knowledge, motivate the creative activity of authors and inventors in order to benefit the public”. Therefore, the rights of publishers are only a means to an end. Relatedly, the Committee misunderstands the role of fair dealing provisions within this framework. Fair dealing provisions are user rights which are no less important than the rights of publishers. Given the fundamental character of the right to education, the importance of these rights can be traced to the Constitution. Therefore, their interpretation should reflect their salutary nature. Second, the Committee errs in assuming that the rights of publishers were not duly accounted for in the DU photocopy judgments. Addressing arguments regarding any adverse impact of adopting a broad interpretation of the educational purpose exemption on the market of the concerned copyrighted works, the Division Bench noted with an example that access to copyrighted material for literacy and education does not curtail the market for these works. It held that students are anyway not potential customers of 30-40 reference books in the library, and that citizens with improved literacy, education and earning potential expand the market for copyrighted materials in the long run. Third, having quantitative restrictions on the extent of permissible copying would be inapposite, because any limit would be arbitrarily arrived at. Instead, what is needed is a test suited to Indian realities and its development needs of making access to education more equitable and fairer in a context of deepening socio-economic inequalities. Looking backward The novel coronavirus pandemic has revealed the inadequacy of our fair dealing provisions to promote educational access. Specifically, these provisions were not designed to promote the free dissemination of educational content in digital form and to facilitate the sharing of resources required to effectively offer virtual education. The Committee should have focused on suggesting amendments to Section 52 that would have made our copyright law fit for today’s challenges. That it has decided to look backward instead of forward is deeply troubling. Given the Supreme Court’s richly articulated constitutional obligation of the state to secure access to education, copyright law should facilitate, as opposed to attenuating its enjoyment.

18 August 2021||August 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Celebrating Einstein’s century||In 1921, the Nobel Prize Committee requested two Nobel Prize winners, Allvar Gullstrand and Svante Arrhenius, to evaluate if Albert Einstein should be awarded the Nobel Prize. They concluded that Einstein would have to wait and the Nobel Committee decided not to award the Prize to anyone in 1921. Opinions changed in a year and when Einstein did receive the 1921 Prize in 1922, it was not for his theories of relativity but for “his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect”. The citation harked back to the revolutionary theories that Einstein had established in 1905. ‘Annus Mirabilis’, or the Year of Miracles, is how 1905 is remembered by physicists because Einstein, only 26 then, published four remarkable papers that year. One of them explained that light was made of photons and when light shone on metal, each photon’s energy correlated to electron’s speed on the metal’s surface. This theory redefined the composition of light and Einstein himself dubbed it revolutionary. It was for this that he received the Nobel Prize. Special theory of relativity Einstein propounded theories of relativity. The special theory of relativity was published in 1905. The questions that necessitated research on relativity were deceptively simple. Ever since the pre-Newtonian days of Galileo, it was known that motion was relative. For example, if two bicycles ride in opposite directions, the speed of the second observed from the first is the sum of the speeds. James Maxwell had established that light was an electromagnetic wave and the value of its speed was calculated. Building on this, Einstein understood that while moving from one frame of reference to another, which is moving at a different speed, the speed of light remains a constant. He gave a physical interpretation to the equations governing the transformation from one frame to another based on this fact. So, how does light’s velocity stay constant? Einstein’s theory establishes that time moves slower within a moving body when measured from a point at rest (but moves normally within the moving body itself) and the length of the moving body contracts when measured from an outside point at rest. When a moving body emits light, the length contraction and time slowdown of the moving body are just exactly what are needed to restore the speed of light to its constant value. Einstein’s insight was that there was no absolute time because time was measured by the simultaneity of two events and this simultaneity would be observed differently, say, within a moving train versus from a railway platform. As lagniappe to the scientific community, Einstein published his famous mass-energy equivalence E=mc2 in late 1905. A mundane example of the application of the special theory of relativity is the use of GPS on our phones: satellites account for time differences in their clocks due to their high speed and their positions away from earth’s gravity and then calculate the geo-location. General theory of relativity From 1907, in bouts of scientific creativity, Einstein sought to generalise the special theory of relativity. Put simply, how does gravitational force act instantaneously between massive stars and planets that are millions of miles away? His research led him to geometry of curved spaces and multi-dimensional geometry that Bernhard Riemann had pioneered in the 19th century. With some help from his mathematician friend Marcel Grossmann, Einstein worked out equations using tensors, the mathematical implement to describe transformation of different dimensions. In November 1915, Einstein completed the general theory of relativity. As per this theory, space and time form a continuum, like a fabric, and every object in the universe distorts this fabric, much like how dropping a large ball distorts a taut trampoline sheet. This distortion is gravity. It produces two effects. One, the fabric causes any other object in the vicinity to move towards the heavier object and this is why gravity causes an object to pull things towards it. Two, it bends light in the process of attracting it. This bending of light was what was observed as experimental verification of the theory, in 1919, by the English astrophysicist, Arthur Eddington. The theory is general enough to apply to all forms of motion, including those where gravity does not appear. Under specific simplifying conditions, the equations matched Newton’s laws. The Nobel Laureate S. Chandrasekhar said that “it is probably the most beautiful of all existing theories”. In just two decades, Einstein led physics out of its traditional moorings, laid the entablature of modern physics on Newtonian and Maxwellian pillars of classical physics and opened it up to newer questions.

18 August 2021||August 18 2021 00:00 IST,||More feed, better productivity||A major stumbling block faced by Indian farmers pertains to the lack of affordable good quality feed and fodder for livestock. A study by the Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute has observed that for every 100 kg of feed required, India is short of 23.4 kg of dry fodder, 11.24 kg of green fodder, and 28.9 kg of concentrate feed. This is one of the chief reasons why Indian livestock’s milk productivity is 20%-60% lower than the global average. If we break down the input costs, we find that feed constitutes 60%-70% of milk production costs. The significance of Sub-Mission on Fodder and Feed recently announced by the Indian government is underscored by the fact that livestock is the major source of cash income for about 13 crore marginal farmers and is an insurance in the event of crop failure. The lack of good quality feed and fodder impacts the productivity levels of cattle. As about 200 million Indians are involved in dairy and livestock farming, the scheme is important from the perspective of poverty alleviation. Revised scheme When the National Livestock Mission was launched in 2014, it focused on supporting farmers in producing fodder from non-forest wasteland/grassland, and cultivation of coarse grains. However, this model could not sustain fodder availability due to lack of backward and forward linkages in the value chain. Therefore, the Mission has been revised to make the programme focus primarily on assistance towards seed production and the development of feed and fodder entrepreneurs. It now provides for 50% direct capital subsidy to the beneficiaries under the feed and fodder entrepreneurship programme and 100% subsidy on fodder seed production to identified beneficiaries. The Sub-Mission on Fodder and Feed intends to create a network of entrepreneurs who will make silage (the hub) and sell them directly to the farmers (the spoke). It is premised on the idea that the funding of the hub will lead to the development of the spoke. The large-scale production of silage will bring down the input cost for farmers since silage is much cheaper than concentrate feed. Studies have indicated that by growing fodder crops one can earn Rs. 1.60 by investing Rs. 1 as compared to Rs. 1.20 in the case of common cereals like wheat and rice. Private entrepreneurs, self-help groups, farmer producer organisations, dairy cooperative societies, and Section 8 companies (NGOs) can avail themselves of the benefits under this scheme. The scheme will provide 50% capital subsidy up to Rs. 50 lakh towards project cost to the beneficiary for infrastructure development and for procuring machinery for value addition in feed such as hay/silage/total mixed ration. The scheme can be used for covering the cost of infrastructure/machinery such as bailing units, harvester, chaff cutter, sheds, etc. The revised scheme has been designed with the objectives of increasing productivity, reducing input costs, and doing away with middlemen (who usually take a huge cut). Availability of green fodder A major challenge in the feed sector emanates from the fact that good quality green fodder is only available for about three months during the year. So, the ideal solution would be to ferment green fodder and convert it into silage. Hence, under the fodder entrepreneurship programme, farmers will receive subsidies and incentives to create a consistent supply chain of feed throughout the year. The idea is that farmers should be able to grow the green fodder between two crop seasons and entrepreneurs can then convert it into silage and sell it at nearby markets at one-tenth of the price of concentrate/dry feed ensuring affordable quality fodder to dairy farmers. In this context, it is heartening to see successful models of silage entrepreneurship by several start-ups across the country. Since India has a livestock population of 535.78 million, an effective implementation of this scheme will play a major role in increasing the return on investment for our farmers.

18 August 2021||August 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Between word and intent||The disquiet over the absence of adequate debate or discussion in Parliament is quite widespread. Concerned citizens and sections of the Opposition bemoan the evident haste with which laws are pushed through; presiding officers fret over the low productivity due to time lost amidst unruly protests; and even government representatives may worry that their legislative agenda is not being carried out in time. The Chief Justice of India, Justice N.V. Ramana, has added a new dimension to this sense of discontent by pointing out the absence of any help from parliamentary debates when the courts are faced with ambiguities or lacunae in laws. His description, of a “sorry state of affairs”, would resonate as crucial pieces of legislation are indeed passed without sufficient debate, and often with nothing more than a Minister’s brief reply or a mere assurance in response to any concern raised by some members. The CJI’s concern was possibly occasioned by some specific law such as the Tribunals Reforms Bill, recently passed with a few clauses struck down by the Supreme Court. However, the import of his observation, at a celebration to mark the 75th Independence Day, was that when the courts were unable to fathom the intent behind some laws, the parliamentary record could throw some light if the debates were sufficiently enlightening. He referred to the illuminating debate on the Industrial Disputes Act as an example. It is quite true that a fuller debate in the legislature would provide greater insight into the intent behind laws, but a situation that requires a scrutiny of such intent ought not to arise in normal circumstances. Legislation should be drafted clearly and the letter of the law should not stray much beyond its purpose and scope. A purposive interpretation of statute is normally required only when the wording of the law is unclear. Otherwise, reliance on House committee reports or parliamentary debates is only an extrinsic aid, and not fully determinative of a law’s meaning. In a recent example, the Supreme Court ruled that the 102nd Amendment to the Constitution ousted the power of State governments to identify backward classes, even though it was vehemently argued by the Government that it was not Parliament’s intention. It highlights the need to have the wording of the law fully reflect the legislative intent. More than the quality of debate, it is the scope for detailed discussion that imparts clarity and a much-needed proximity to the original intent and purpose to any statute. For this, it is vital that important pieces of legislation are scrutinised by standing committees, which will have the advantage not only of eliciting replies from the executive but also inputs from the wider civil society, before the statute is framed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/between-word-and-intent/article35968096.ece
18 August 2021||August 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Doctor at the door||Long before the pandemic struck, health experts had warned of a health epidemic — one that involved non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The last two years, however, managed to expose the frailties of even robust health systems in the country that saw not one, but two debilitating waves of COVID-19. It also exposed the chinks in what was traditionally believed to be the armour of health care — institution-based treatment. When access to these institutions was severed all of a sudden, States had to introspect about how they could bolster their health-care set-up in ways that would protect it from such disruptions. For Tamil Nadu, this introspection resulted in its ‘Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam’ scheme, a community-based intervention to tackle and treat NCDs and to address the crucial issues of prevention and early detection. Inaugurated by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin earlier this month, it involves a tentative budget in excess of Rs. 250 crore. It includes population-based screening for the 18-plus population for 10 common conditions — hypertension, diabetes, oral, cervical and breast cancers, TB, leprosy, chronic kidney disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, mental health — and the delivery of hypertension/diabetes drugs to patients aged 45-plus besides to those with restricted or poor mobility. The State, which has a high burden of NCDs, also acted on data that indicated very low community control rates for hypertension (7.3%) and diabetes (10.8%) among patients. Once the tenacious link between NCDs such as uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension, and COVID-19 outcomes was apparent, it became clear that control of these health parameters was paramount and would necessitate uninterrupted access to health-care services. According to the India: Health of the Nation’s States report, in 2016, 55% of the total disease burden in India was caused by NCDs, with the burden of NCDs increasing across all States from 1990 to 2016. The disruption of access to health care during the pandemic did affect compliance to drug regimens, and led to uncontrolled disease, with implications for quality of life too. It is ideal that nations prepare themselves to face further epidemics that might occur and cause similar disruptions in society by arming themselves to overcome such drawbacks. The Tamil Nadu initiative is a well-meaning notch in trying to address this; the efficacy of its chosen method of door delivery of drugs has been proven earlier with the supervised drug regimen, or DOTS therapy used in tuberculosis control. Ultimately, the success of a well-conceived programme rests in the proper implementation of each of its components. If Tamil Nadu is able to demonstrate, with this scheme, that it is possible to maintain the continuum of care even in the most trying of circumstances, then, here is a model that could inspire other States to follow suit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/doctor-at-the-door/article35968097.ece

Giri, delivering the convocation address of the Bombay University this evening [Bombay, Aug. 17], said that the primary purpose of education should be to inculcate the virtues of humanism, tolerance, reason and breadth of vision among the students and instil in them the fervour for imaginative ideas and quest for truth. In this task the teacher played a unique and distinct role, he said. Viewed in this context, the President said in different parts of the country discipline and integrity were fast waning from among the people. Mr. Giri pointed out that if discipline was eroded either in the educational institutions or in the community life the future of the nation was bleak and whatever progress one might make or academic excellence one might acquire, one was doomed to failure. They must protect their community and educational institutions from this danger. The association and relationship between the students and the teachers was more than ordinary, he said. The President emphasised the importance of elevating the teacher-student relationship to one of understanding, cordiality and mutual co-operation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/giri-cautions-against-indiscipline/article35968106.ece
18 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Exporters to get duty relief as part of Jan. 1 RoDTEP scheme||The Centre on Tuesday notified the rates and norms for the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme, with Commerce Secretary B.V.R. Subrahmanyam asserting it would put ‘direct cash in the pockets of exporters’ soon. The RoDTEP scheme had kicked in from January 1, replacing the earlier Merchandise and Services Export Incentive Schemes (MEIS and SEIS) that were in violation of WTO norms. A budgetary allocation of Rs. 12,454 crore has been made for 2021-22 under the scheme which covers 8,555 tariff lines, accounting for about 75% of traded items and 65% of India’s exports. To enable zero rating of exports by ensuring domestic taxes are not exported, all taxes, including those levied by States and even Gram Panchayats, will be refunded under the scheme. The rebates under RoDTEP, which Director General of Foreign Trade Amit Yadav said is WTO-compliant as per legal advice, range from 0.5% to 4.3% of the Free On Board value of outbound consignments. The lowest rate is offered on items like chocolates, toffees and sugar confectionary, while yarns and fibres have been granted the highest rate. “Steel, pharma and chemicals have not been included under the scheme because their exports have done well without incentives,” said Mr. Subrahmanyam. “There are a couple of more schemes in the pipeline to help exporters, but RoDTEP, which is valid till March 31, 2024, will be our flagship scheme.” The top trade official also assured of a resolution of the pending dues under the MEIS and SEIS by the first week of September, through a ‘staggered’ mechanism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/exporters-to-get-duty-relief-as-part-of-jan-1-rodtep-scheme/article35968084.ece
18 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Scrappage norms to spur new vehicle demand by up to 30%’||The recently unveiled automobile scrappage policy will help boost new vehicle demand in the country by about 25-30%, leading to additional GST revenues of about Rs. 40,000 crore for the Centre and States, Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Tuesday. The Minister added that the policy would help India become the top-most auto manufacturing hub in the next 5 years. “There are about 1 crore end-of-life vehicles in the country… and this data is three years old … People will not buy new vehicle if they don't scrap the older vehicles,” he said. He also clarified that reduction of road tax by up to 25% by States is not just an advisory. “We are authorised under the concurrent list to decide the principle of taxation... Scrappage policy will lead to an increase in revenue for State governments as there will be a 25-30% increase in auto sales and they will get GST… Centre and State governments will get Rs. 40,000 crore each... Employment will go up, pollution will decrease,” he explained. Mr. Gadkari said the department had also requested the auto sector to give discounts of 5% on new models as incentive for consumers to scrap vehicles. Amit Varadan, joint secretary, added that the Ministry had estimated savings of about Rs. 1.15 lakh in 5 years on new vehicle purchase following scrapping of the old vehicle. For trucks, this could go up to Rs. 8.32 lakhs in five years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/scrappage-norms-to-spur-new-vehicle-demand-by-up-to-30/article35968086.ece

The move comes at a time when many firms are eyeing a listing on the bourses. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has also streamlined the disclosure requirements of group companies. In a notification, SEBI said that if the object of the issue involves offer-for-sale or financing other than for capital expenditure for a project, then the minimum promoters’ contribution of 20% would be locked in for 18 months from the date of allotment in the IPO. Currently, the lock-in period is three years. Holdings disclosure SEBI also amended the takeover regulations because of the implementation of the System Driven Disclosures. Under the new rule, certain disclosure obligations for acquirers / promoters on acquisition or disposal of shares aggregating to 5% and any change of 2% thereafter, annual shareholding disclosures and creation or invocation or release of encumbrance registered in depository systems under takeover regulations would not be applicable. The amendment will be effective April 1, 2022, the regulator said in a notification, dated August 13. The regulator also eased norms on the quantum of sweat equity that can be issued by new-age tech firms listed on the Innovators Growth Platform. The yearly limit for sweat equity shares will be 15%, while the overall limit will be 50% of the paid-up capital at any time.

Observing that the retreat of the second wave of coronavirus pandemic had been slow, the officials writing on the ‘State of Economy’ in the August edition of the RBI Bulletin said, ‘aggregate demand conditions are buoyed by the release of pent-up demand post unlock, while the supply situation is improving with the monsoon catching up to normal levels and sowing gaining pace’. “Manufacturing is gradually turning around.” On inflation, the officials said the headline CPI inflation for July 2021 came in at 5.6%, down 70 bps from 6.3% in June, “reinforcing the view that the recent upsurge has peaked and the worst would be behind us”. On a central bank digital currency (CBDC), a fiat liability denominated in the national unit of account that is digitally issued and accessible to all economic agents, the RBI officials wrote “there is a quiet confidence within that its time is nigh”. ‘Complement cash’ They said the CBDC may not directly replace demand deposits held in banks and would complement physical cash. It would compete with other online and offline payment methods and thereby support a more resilient and diverse payment system while shunning the risks associated with private digital currencies. The RBI was conscious that the CBDC had to be meticulously planned, designed and tested, they wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/economy-gaining-a-grip-price-rise-has-peaked-rbi-officials/article35968093.ece

(FRL) from going ahead with the Rs. 24,713 crore deal to sell its business to Reliance Retail, which was objected to by e-commerce major Amazon, in case no stay was obtained from the Supreme Court within four weeks. Justice Suresh Kumar Kait, hearing Amazon’s plea for enforcement of the award by Singapore’s Emergency Arbitrator (EA) restraining FRL from going ahead with the deal, said that in the absence of any stay from the apex court, he had no option but to enforce the order passed by Justice J.R. Midha on March 18. “Either get a stay within 2-3 weeks...or comply with the order. This court has no third option,” he said. Besides restraining FRL, Justice Midha had imposed costs of Rs. 20 lakh on the Future Group and associates and ordered attachment of properties. Further hearing is set for September 17.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/will-enact-judges-order-if-no-sc-stay-hc-tells-frl/article35968078.ece
18 August 2021||New Delhi,||Retail sales touch 72% of pre-pandemic level: RAI||Retail sales across India continued to recover in July, reaching 72% of the pre-pandemic levels of July 2019, and businesses are pinning hopes on the festive seasons for a further boost, Retailers Association of India (RAI) said on Tuesday. The rate of recovery was 50% of pre-pandemic levels in June 2021, the RAI said. In RAI’s latest business survey, retail businesses in south India have indicated a sharp comeback with sales at 82% of the pre-pandemic levels (July 2019), as against 50% sales in June 2021. However, west India is yet to improve, registering sales at 57% of pre-pandemic levels. “This is mainly because of prolonged curbs in Maharashtra that disrupted the smooth functioning of... retail in the State,” RAI said in a statement. Quick service restaurants recovered the most with sales at 97% of pre-pandemic levels. “There is a possibility of significant sales recovery for retail businesses as the festive season approaches, provided restrictions on modern retail are relaxed across the country, allowing smooth operations and return to normalcy,” said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, RAI.  In July this year, quick-service restaurant sales were at 97% of pre-pandemic levels of 2019||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/retail-sales-touch-72-of-pre-pandemic-level-rai/article35968080.ece

18 August 2021||London,||Indian pacers pull off famous win in a dramatic finish||India’s world-class pace attack pulled off an incredible heist with the bat and then a magnificent performance with the ball to decimate England by 151 runs in the second Test here on Monday. The fifth day at the hallowed Lord’s was a fabulous exhibition of Test cricket, with India bowling out England for 120 as the home team tried to bat it out without going for a chase of 272 in 60 overs. Golden chapter It was a match where odds were in favour of England but the cricketing Gods wanted Virat Kohli’s men to script another golden chapter in the history of Indian cricket. Mohammed Shami (56 n.o. & 1/13) and Jasprit Bumrah (34 n.o. & 3/33) played innings of their lives and then rocked the England top-order, before Ishant Sharma (2/13) and Mohammed Siraj (4/32) played their part to perfection to give the visitors a 1-0 lead in the five-match series. This is India’s third Test match win at Lord’s having won earlier in 1986 and 2014 series and it has now six points in the World Test Championship. Joe Root’s (33) dismissal by Bumrah had England on the mat at 67/5 just after tea. It could have been six down soon had Virat Kohli held onto the catch provided by Jos Buttler at first slip but it evaded his reverse-cupped palms and Moeen Ali’s edge didn’t matter as Ravindra Jadeja over-stepped. But then Siraj bowled couple of superb successive outgoing deliveries to get Moeen (13) and Sam Curran (0) to make it 90/7 before picking up the final wicket of James Anderson.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-pacers-pull-off-famous-win-in-a-dramatic-finish/article35968191.ece
18 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Thrilled at regaining full playing rights||Anirban Lahiri is thrilled at returning to the FedEx Cup Playoffs and gaining full playing rights for the next season on the PGA Tour. Addressing a virtual press conference on Tuesday evening, Lahiri said, “It has been a challenging year and now I have the reins back in my hand. If I play well over the next few weeks, I can make the season look a lot better.” Making the cut Lahiri, 34, finished tied 46th last weekend in the $4.6-million Wyndham Championship. The cheque of $18,000 took his earnings to $930,661 and placed him 121st on the Fedex Cup rankings on the PGA Tour. The top-125 keep their playing rights for the next season. In the 21 events that Lahiri played, he made 11 cuts, dotted with three top-10 finishes, with the best of third place in the $3.5-million Barbasol Championship.  Lahiri now looks ahead to doing well in the first of the playoffs, the $9.5-million Northern Trust (August 19-22) in New Jersey. From here, the top-70 from finishers will be eligible to play in the $9.5 million BMW Championship. Thereafter, the top-30 figure in the season-ending $12-million Tour Championship. Lahiri last figured in the FedEx playoffs in 2018 and thereafter, could not keep his full playing rights after finishing 178th (in 2019) and 219th (in 2020). Underlining the importance of finishing among the top-125 players, Lahiri said, “Eligibility is a big thing on the PGA Tour. It guarantees you every start on all full field events, barring the invitational ones. If I do well in the playoffs, I can enter a few more 'bonus' events. Earlier, I would wait to get into some events but now I can pick and choose which one to play. “For a golfer, it’s a big deal. I have a job next year. For now, these next few weeks are really going to make a difference if I give myself opportunities to do well.” Long road to recovery Reflecting on this fitness, Lahiri said, “It took me a full two months (post-COVID) to get close to my normal speed and strength. “By June end, I started feeling better. I played lots of events, week after week. I had to manage my energy levels. As you know, Tokyo was hot and humid and took a lot out of us. But I am well conditioned. I am doing most of the things right to get back to my fitness levels of pre-COVID times” Asked to reflect on his six winless seasons since joining the PGA Tour in 2016, Lahiri said, “I know I need to win. I know I have not played at my best. Since I played 12 PGA events before getting my PGA card, you can call it my seventh or eighth season on the PGA Tour.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/thrilled-at-regaining-full-playing-rights/article35968239.ece
18 August 2021||New Delhi,||‘Bowling first wasn’t ideal decision by Root’||The legendary Sachin Tendulkar says the current England’s team is in complete awe of India’s world-class seam attack with only its skipper Joe Root looking capable of getting a big hundred. In an exclusive interview, the iconic batsman spoke on a host of issues including India’s victory, the standard of England Test team, Rohit Sharma’s dominance against the new ball. Excerpts:  You have been a part of many memorable wins. How would you describe this victory at the Lord’s? When I saw Joe Root putting India in after winning the toss, I was really surprised and I felt that in itself was an indication that England was worried about our fast-bowling attack. I actually shared a message with a friend on Friday morning around 8 a.m. that if weather allows us, we are winning this Test match. The surface looked dry to me later on, because you could see that first ball from Mohammed Siraj’s new spell took off from good length and hit Ollie Robinson on the chest. That was clear indication that the surface had over-dried and hence the ball took off from there. Bowling first wasn’t an ideal decision by the England captain and credit to our openers, they were brilliant. What do you make of this England batting line-up? This England team has had a history of collapses. I felt that is where they lost the grip and if you look at their batting, how many batters can one say, this guy can come out and get a big hundred? In this team, I don’t see anyone other than Joe Root. Teams of past had number of such players whether Alastair Cook, Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell, Jonathan Trott, Andrew Strauss. Yes they might get an odd hundred but how many can get big hundreds consistently? Other than Root, I can’t find anyone and that’s the state of their batting today. May be the reason for Root to opt for fielding first. How did you find Rohit’s batting in first innings and how much of a concern is his propensity to play the hook and pull which is leading to his dismissal? Whatever I have seen, I feel, he has taken the lead and he has shown the other side of his temperament and how he can change his game and adapt to situation and play accordingly. He has been a leader there and KL has supported him brilliantly. As far as playing pull shot is concerned, he has cleared the fence with that shot and I am looking at what he has been able to achieve for the team in both Tests. Rohit has left the ball and defended the ball brilliantly or equally well. He was always a fantastic player but seeing his last few innings in England, I can say he has definitely gone a notch higher.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bowling-first-wasnt-ideal-decision-by-root/article35968215.ece

Sindhu underwent a full-length physical conditioning session at the Suchitra Gym after being given a touching reception on her arrival at the campus after the Games. “I cannot think of a vacation right now as I have to prepare for couple of major events scheduled in the next few months. I wish to be a near-complete player,” Sindhu told The Hindu . “There is nothing like working on any specific area of my game.

18 August 2021||August 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Kohli did a great job, but Kohlism needs to be reviewed||India have just won a terrific Test at Lord’s, and it’s a good time to discuss their philosophy, Kohlism. That a team reflects its captain is one of the cliches of the sport. A great sight of the contemporary game is the passion and energy that Virat Kohli brings to it. And the supreme confidence too, not just in himself as a player but in his team as well. When India came out to bat again after lunch on the last day, it was sheer chutzpah. The nine balls they played didn’t matter to either Mohammed Shami or Jasprit Bumrah. But what it did to the English openers, who had begun to mentally prepare themselves to bat and then had to stop-start their routine all over again, was immense. The result was two ducks at the top of the order. India never let go after that. Results often balance on such subtleties. Brave decision To understand your bowlers so well and to recognise their power well enough to decide that 60 overs would be enough to dismiss England is remarkable. In the end India didn’t need even that much. Nor did they need a spinner. It was a brave decision to drop Ashwin, by far the best in the world; questions would have been asked had India failed to dismiss England. But 39 of 40 wickets so far have fallen to the seamers, and Ravindra Jadeja needed to bowl just six overs. One of the unintended consequences of Bumrah’s intimidatory bowling to James Anderson in England’s first innings was England’s tactics backfiring on the final morning. To attempt to dismiss numbers nine and ten through intimidatory bowling with the field spread out was absurd. Heavy price If England felt the match was theirs at that point and they needed only to teach Bumrah a lesson, they paid a heavy price for this short-sightedness. Bumrah’s attack on Anderson was out of character, and frankly, both unnecessary and unfair. He might have been advised by his captain. Television loved it of course, especially on the final day when the retaliations and reprisals took over. India seemed to have a pressing need to show who was boss, as did England. But the latter’s ammunition was inadequate. Who did what first is unimportant in such cases. And so to Kohlism. It can be defined as a philosophy where hostility and retaliating before being provoked is key. Confrontations are encouraged, in the belief it pumps up bowlers. It also involves conducting the emotional orchestra of that portion of the stadium where the Indian supporters sit. There is too the notion sometimes that a victory is not enough, it has to be accompanied by humiliation, a word that has no place in sport. Stump mikes did pick up much derisive laughter. For years as Indian teams rolled over and died in the face of aggression (one top batsman even burst into tears when sledged), they were held up as examples of good behaviour. Actually, they just lacked the self-belief. Then a number of things came together to give Indian teams the swagger they had lacked. The financial power of the cricket board, the No. 1 rankings, the victories abroad, the belief that international cricket would die without India’s support. On the field, captains like Sourav Ganguly and Kohli refined the arrogance to a fine art. But in Ganguly’s time there were players like Rahul Dravid and others who ensured that things didn’t go out of control. This is not to suggest that things went out of control at Lord’s but it could have. There is no Dravid in this team. If there is — Ajinkya Rahane, perhaps — the majority is likely to overrule him. There is a choice to be made here. Do we want our cricket team to be seen as aggressive bullies who act as if the 22 yards and everything else belongs to them, or is there another way of winning that does not reach down into the lesser devils (as opposed to the better angels) of our nature? Need to pull back To a generation brought up on aggression and giving as good as you got, Kohlism might appear natural and reasonable. Perhaps it is. But with three Tests remaining, and the relations between teams already beginning to dip, things could get worse. Both teams need to pull back, but especially the one which has Kohlism as its stated policy. Umpires will have a difficult time. This Indian team is too talented, too various in its gifts, and too successful for it to be remembered merely for poor behaviour. To put down India’s incredible showing on the final day to inspiration provided by the tensions earlier is unfair to the skill and motivation of the bowlers. Aggression is welcome, even necessary, but it can slide into boorishness and gratuitous violence. That really is the danger.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kohli-did-a-great-job-but-kohlism-needs-to-be-reviewed/article35968194.ece
18 August 2021||Kolkata,||Stimac “may consider” releasing Jhingan for club football in Croatia||Indian men’s team coach Igor Stimac on Tuesday said he “may consider” releasing his premier defender Sandesh Jhingan from national commitments to play club football in Croatia. Stimac said: “Having in mind that the Croatian league has already had five rounds, and the players are fit, we are thinking as to how we can help Sandesh get into form as soon as possible, and also try to facilitate him get his place in the team. “It’s important for him to get into the playing XI. So we may consider releasing him from the camp and bringing him back but allow him to stay with the club.” Stimac had coached Croatia to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. The Indian team’s defensive mainstay Jhingan is expected to join Croatian top division club HNK Sibenik, making use of a clause that allows him to leave his current club ATK Mohun Bagan if he gets an opportunity to play in Europe. India will be travelling to Kathmandu later this month to play Nepal in two international friendlies in September. “It is very difficult to organise matches under such circumstances. You need to understand that no one is able to come to India, and if we want to go out to play there are quarantine rules. So the options are very limited,” Stimac said. “We had agreed to first play Libya and Jordan in Istanbul. But the long duration of quarantine in Istanbul didn’t allow us to proceed with the matches.”  It’s important for him to get into the playing XI. So we may consider releasing him from the camp||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/stimac-may-consider-releasing-jhingan-for-club-football-in-croatia/article35968524.ece
18 August 2021||KOCHI,||First major test for long jumper Shaili||She is the under-18 World No. 2 this year, the u-20 Indian record holder and the National champion in women’s section. And the World Athletics (u-20) championships, which begin in Nairobi on Wednesday, will be long jumper Shaili Singh’s first major test. With a 6.48m effort at the inter-State Nationals in June, the 17-year-old is the fifth-best jumper in the Worlds’ entry list but she appears capable of much more. “She is excited seeing the people here and the spirit but it all depends on the day,” said Robert Bobby George, who has been coaching Shaili in Bengaluru for more three three years, from Nairobi. “It’s her first international meet, I need a personal best from her.” High expectations For Bobby too, it will be the first big test in nearly 20 years. He had coached his wife Anju George to the long jump bronze at the 2003 Worlds and in Shaili’s case, it will be a bigger challenge as expectations will be high. Sweden’s European champion Maja Askag (season best 6.80), Spain’s Tessy Ebosele (6.63) and Italy’s Arianna Battistella (6.55) are some of the athletes Shaili will be watching out for. Indians have won just two golds at the u-20 Worlds and they came in the last two editions through javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra (2016) and quartermiler Hima Das (2018). With Neeraj claiming gold at the Tokyo Olympics, the focus will be on the two Indian javelin throwers, u-20 Federation Cup champion Kunwer Ajai Raj Singh Rana (SB 74.75m) — who had topped the 2018 Youth Olympics Asian qualifiers in Bangkok — and Jay Kumar (72.29). Ajai is the third-best thrower in the entry list where Ukraine’s under-20 European champion Artur Felfner begins as favourite. Opportunity For Priya Mohan, the country’s fastest quartermiler this year (53.29s) who missed the Olympics as she was not a national camper, Nairobi offers a wonderful opportunity to improve her timing with athletes like Nigeria’s Imaobong Nse Uko (51.70) and Poland’s Kornelia Lesiewics (52.02) in the fray. With the World Championships, Commonwealth Games and Asian Games lined up next year, she will have a lot to look forward to. Neeraj’s breakthrough gold in Tokyo should also inspire the rest in the 27-member team to pull off a surprise or two. The five-day meet will offer a peep into the future and youngsters like sprinters Godson Brume and Tina Clayton, middle-distance runner Diribe Welteji and high jumper Yonathan Kapitolnik could be big names in the next few years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/first-major-test-for-long-jumper-shaili/article35968367.ece
18 August 2021||Chennai,||Domestic PSA event from August 23||For the first time, there will be a Professional Squash Association (PSA) domestic Challenger-10 squash tournament for men and women exclusively for Indians. The “domestic PSA event” will be held at Indian Squash Academy here from August 23 to 26. The prize money for the tournament is $12,000. In June, PSA wrote to all the National Federations asking them to host domestic tournaments with a 50% reduction in prize money. Reduced prize money “With international travel remaining difficult, we are extending the option of hosting domestic and cross-border events with a 50% reduction in prize money until December 31. This applies to Satellite and Challenger Tour 3, 5, and 10 tournaments,” it said. PSA added it would give permission to host domestic-only tournaments on a case-by-case basis. “We do encourage all hosts, where possible, to hold regional tournaments. “However, domestic-only tournaments will still be granted on a case-by-case basis,” it said. Abhay Singh, Harinderpal Singh Sandhu, S. Velavan, Rounak Yadav, Abhishek Pradhan, Abhishek Agarwal, Aadit Zaveri and Rahul Baitha will take part in the men’s section. In the women’s category, Sunayna Kuruvilla, Tanvi Khanna, Urwashi Joshi, Sanika Choudhari, Sachika Balwani, Aparajitha Balamurukan, Abhisheka Shannon and Janet Vidhi, among others, will compete.  Squash Rackets Federation of India (SRFI) secretary Cyrus Poncha said since SRFI was not able to hold any tournaments for nearly two-and-a-half months due to the lockdown, this tournament will be of immense help to Indians who are looking for PSA ranking points. “We last conducted a PSA event in Chennai (March 29-April 2) and after that, till July, we didn’t have any major activity,” he told The Hindu here on Tuesday.

18 August 2021||London,||Boycott criticises England’s tactics||Geoffrey Boycott feels England was “stupid” with its tactics in the second Test against India and also allowed emotions to get the better of them. “This Test match has proved two things. Firstly, if you are stupid you do not deserve to win Test matches. As much as we love Joe Root for his magnificent batting, he cocked up with his tactics. “Secondly, England cannot keep relying on Joe for all their runs. There has to be an improvement from the top three very soon because it is getting beyond a joke,” Boycott, a former England captain, wrote in The Telegraph . “Joe had been doing well with his field placings and captaincy but seeing Jasprit Bumrah at the crease was like a red rag to a bull. “He encouraged Mark Wood to just pepper him with fast short balls. It is obvious the England captain and some of his players wanted payback for the working over Bumrah gave James Anderson in the first innings. “Tempers were frayed. Heated words were exchanged as England seemed more intent on hitting Bumrah and Mohammad Shami instead of getting them out. “The tail swiped and edged. The field spread out on both sides of the wickets to stop the run scoring and England suffered the embarrassment of India declaring.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/boycott-criticises-englands-tactics/article35968189.ece

18 August 2021||August 18 2021 00:00 IST,||The torch song: flashback 34 years||The year was 1987. Rajiv Gandhi had taken over as Prime Minister against a troubled political backdrop. He was our youth icon — genteel, suave and progressive. And he, along with Doordarshan’s director general Bhaskar Ghose, felt that Indian patriotism needed a shot in the arm. They hired advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather to make a film on national integration, and briefed the team led by Suresh Mullick and film director Kailash Surendranath. Suresh, O&M’s maverick creative director, decided to use our sports heroes, both current and past, in the film. Nothing inspires patriotism in Indian hearts the way sports does. The visuals were deceptively simple: a flame passed from person to person, till it finally reached the hands of children — our future. However, it would not be one continuous shot filmed at a single location, but multiple shots taken across the country at iconic locations, and seamlessly spliced together.  Close calls and coordination  The film starts with the sound of a bugle, and the visual of a lone man (cricketer K Srikkanth) holding aloft a lit torch, running by the sea at sunrise. Then comes the main melody, which gets fuller with each subsequent bar, layered over with keyboard, strings, percussion and horns. It builds up to a crescendo and an unexpected finale of ‘ Jay a  h e! ’ from our national anthem. The finale has not lost its impact in 34 years. Composer Louis Banks’ name will forever be in the annals of history thanks to this outstanding composition. But this was not what the powers at Doordarshan were expecting. They protested that the national anthem was sacred. Rajiv Gandhi, however, loved it and gave it the nod. I was a 20-something film executive at O&M Madras at the time. I was enlisted along with my counterparts across the various branches to contact the sportspeople. Doordarshan picked up the production tab, but neither the sportspeople nor the production team took a fee. I handled the Madras section — Srikkanth, and track and field athletes PT Usha and Shiny Abraham. (Ramesh and Ramanathan Krishnan’s segment had already been done at the Madras Club.) Having previously worked with Srikkanth, I got him on board. Next came Usha and Shiny. They were returning from Malaysia after an event, along with their coach Nambiar. Their flight was expected to land around 1 am on the day of the shoot. Since I was the film executive and could speak Malayalam, I was designated to receive them. My colleague, Ramesh, accompanied me. After a long wait, they emerged from the terminal. Nambiar needed some cajoling, but we soon bundled them into the car and headed to the Connemara Hotel. Despite a few heart-stopping moments — the hotel told us there was no room for Nambiar — we finally checked them in. I was surprised that the hotel staff didn’t react to the presence of the two prominent athletes. We then raced to Srikkanth’s house in Kalakshetra Colony. He was sleepy, and a little grouchy, but nonetheless was ready in his tracksuit at 4 am. Bless him! We rushed him to Covelong beach at where he probably did three runs to nail the shoot. We dropped him home and headed to the Connemara.  Deer on the track  This time, the atmosphere at the hotel was different. When Usha and Shiny came down to the lobby in their tracksuits, there was a collective gasp followed by an awestruck hush. I guess the girls were not easily recognisable the night before in their salwar kameezes ! I was gratified. Their location was the race track at IIT Campus, adjacent to the deer park. When the camera was set up, a miracle happened; a herd of deer ambled out of the woods. Suresh and Kailash had an inspiration. They asked Usha to walk over to where the deer were grazing. Shiny was to take her position a little ahead. It was a gamble; we had only one chance to get it right. The director gave them a hand signal, Shiny ran over and handed the torch, and Usha started running. She startled the deer, but instead of disappearing into the woods, they ran along the tracks ahead of her. It was magical. That high-speed shot, along with the soundtrack, which starts to soar at this point, never fails to give me goosebumps. A month later, I was at the Bombay office on work and met Suresh in the corridor. He steered me into the packed conference hall. I stood among my colleagues and watched the film unfold. It was played on loop all week. Spread the Light of Freedom was aired on Doordarshan on August 15, 1987. Its impact was astounding. We hadn’t realised at the time that we were witnessing history in the making. I quit advertising almost 30 years ago, but the pride of being associated with this film will stay with me forever.  Geeta John now runs an interior design practice in Bengaluru, and dabbles in film styling, writing and playback singing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-torch-song-flashback-34-years/article35968554.ece
18 August 2021||August 18 2021 00:00 IST,||To the Moon and back, virtually||Art is no longer limited to traditional silos such as the white cube or plain digital. The new creative economy deals in cryptocurrency, collects non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and offers complete transparency. This opens up the field to pretty much any creator, which explains the success of artists like 13-year-old Laya Mathikshara from Chennai. This May, she minted her first NFT, an animated artwork titled What if, Moon had life? It shows the “cold” satellite’s active core bubbling. The teenager listed the reserve price as 0.384400 ETH (the token of the Ethereum blockchain) — “inspired by the distance between the Earth and the Moon (3,84,400 km). It sold for 0.39 ETH (approximately Rs. 90,500) on the platform Foundation. “My parents didn’t really believe in NFTs. Nor did I initially,” she says. “Then, three weeks later, someone bought it. That’s when I got the confidence it could work and began minting other artworks.”  V irtual bragging rights  An NFT is a digital asset that exists on a blockchain, which certifies authenticity and ownership. For Mathikshara, who started painting at the age of nine, her first NFT was a big step. It all began during lockdown last year, when, taking a cue from her sister, a computational neuroscientist, she started to learn programming languages such as Python and C++. This naturally transitioned into an interest in digital art. “I had just three to four hours of [online] school, so I began looking for hobbies. I found digital art and animated videos cool,” says the student of Chennai Public School. “I started by learning programmes like Blender and Cinema 4D. It was hard and I messed up a lot, but I watched YouTube videos and figured it out.” Currently, she has 17 creations listed on Rarible, 13 on Foundation, and seven on Indian platform WazirX. Among her most recent works is Gratitude , a 110-second short film minted on WazirX. It was screened at the 16th Busan International Kids and Youth Film Festival last month. Next, the typography-and-animation work that pays tribute to Covid-19 warriors will be screened in theatres in New York City in October, for the All American High School Film Festival. “It’s like the Oscars for teenagers,” Mathikshara says excitedly.  Into the metaverse  In the last year, the artist says she’s found a sense of community in the NFT world. “I was able to get in touch with a lot of creators, and understand how artists got into the NFT space,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/to-the-moon-and-back-virtually/article35968555.ece
18 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Attacked by ‘upper caste men’ while hoisting flag, say Dalits||Members of the Dalit community at Jatav Mohalla in Delhi’s Tughlakabad have accused “members of the upper caste” of attacking and ill-treating them when they tried to hoist the Tricolour on Independence Day near a statue of B.R. Ambedkar. The police said an altercation took place between families of the Jatav community and the family of Jitender, who belongs to the Gurjar community. Eight people were injured in the clash and cross-FIRs have been registered, the police said, adding that the issue stems from a years-long land dispute. According to cloth trader Chander Pal, 56, residents of Jatav Mohalla decided to hoist the national flag at 11 a.m. near a statue built on a piece of disputed land. “That land was allotted for construction of a marriage hall for our community but the upper caste men objected to it. One particular family intervened and ensured a procedural delay. The hall has still not been constructed,” he said. Usage of land Jitender and his family have allegedly laid claim over the plot for the past several years. The Jatav community said that they want to use the vacant plot for their community gatherings and social ceremonies. But Jitender’s family allegedly started using the land to rear their cattle and to dump cow and buffalo dung. Mr. Pal said that on April 15, the family installed a statue of B.R. Ambedkar “to appease us” but continued to use the land to their advantage. “There used to be cow dung everywhere and even close to the statue. It’s disrespectful. Women from our community took to cleaning the area daily,” he said. On Independence Day, Mr. Pal said that when they gathered at the plot and hoisted the flag, the family objected to them using the area for the event. “It started as an argument but eventually a bunch of them gathered and started pelting stones at us. We somehow managed to flee,” he said.  Mr. Pal said that the issue of usage of the plot has been an ongoing matter since 2013 and the community feels that they are not treated as equals. “We have houses measured in yards and they have acres,” he said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (South-East) R.P. Meena said a PCR call regarding the quarrel was received at Govindpuri police station. “On reaching the spot, it was found that the family of one Jitender got into a quarrel with Mr. Pal and some residents of Jatav Mohalla over removal of tarpaulin and wood. This is an old dispute between the two sides,” he said, adding that Mr. Pal alleged he was abused during the incident. On the other hand, Mr. Jitender said he was beaten up by the crowd. During the clash, both sides suffered minor injuries and medical examination was conducted, the police added. Both parties make regular complaints against each other, an officer said. However, both the parties had settled the matter amicably. Further probe is on, the police said.

18 August 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi sees 93% fall in samples sent for genome sequencing||There is a 93% fall in the number of samples for which COVID-19 genome sequencing was done in June, compared to April, according to Delhi government data shared with The Hindu . Lesser samples were sent for genome sequencing as new COVID-19 cases have also come down from an all-time high of 28,000 daily cases in April to less 100 cases in most days now, officials said. Through genome sequencing, the government finds new variants of the virus and this helps them to form better strategies to fight the virus. Delta variant “Even lesser number of samples have undergone genome sequencing in July,” a Delhi government official said. “The Delta variant is the dominant strain of the virus in Delhi at this moment. It has seen a steady rise in the past few months. Also, till now, Delta Plus variant has not been detected in Delhi,” the official said. In April, 1,887 samples from Delhi underwent genome sequencing at NCDC, whereas in June, there were only 132 samples. Apart from the NCDC, genome sequencing is also done at ILBS, but majority of genome sequencing is done at NCDC, officials said. Experts said that more samples should be sent for genome sequencing even though cases are dropping. “With Delta variant, we took a lot of time to figure it out and that led to a severe second wave. If we had done genome sequencing of more samples, then we would have understood that proportion of Delta variant was really high and could have prepared accordingly,” said Jugal Kishore, head of Community Medicine Department, Safdarjung Hospital. He said that the government follows a policy of doing genome sequencing of 5% of COVID-19 positive samples. “With everything opening up, there are chances of newer variants spreading faster. So, the government should ideally be doing more genome sequencing. They should be doing 10-15% or even more,” Dr. Kishore said. The city reported 38 new COVID-19 cases and four deaths in the past 24 hours, as per a bulletin released by the Delhi government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhi-sees-93-fall-in-samples-sent-for-genome-sequencing/article35968391.ece
18 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Everything changed suddenly, silently’||People who arrived at the Embassy of Afghanistan on Tuesday for paperwork and other formalities, recounted how the situation in Kabul had taken a drastic turn for the worse over the last couple of days. With family members and relatives still in Kabul, some said the common citizen was paying the price for trusting a government that ultimately “fled”. For Mohammed, who reached the national capital from Kabul on August 8 with three of his family members, it had been a close shave. “When we left Kabul, the situation was not as bad and it started to deteriorate only a couple of days later. It just got worse by the day and people were scrambling to get visas. We do not know how all of it happened so suddenly and silently. For a long time, we thought maybe the Taliban won’t reach Kabul very soon,” said the 32-year-old. His sister is still in Kabul, Mr. Mohammed said. “She is a cancer patient and her husband is also out of town. She is now left with no access to money, as the banks have also closed. You cannot withdraw a single penny. We are worried about her and it is a horrific situation that people are going through.” The Kabul resident is currently stationed in Lajpat Nagar. “We remember the pre-2000 era and even if the situation back home improves, people might not be ready to leave as the scars will remain. The common citizens are the ones who are the worst sufferers. The Ashraf Ghani government also promised us many things but ultimately they fled. It is shocking to see people fall off planes.” Drastic change Naweed Azimi, a 26-year-old documentary filmmaker who has been in the Capital for the last four years, said several of his relatives were still stuck in Kabul. “For the past few days, they have been trying to get a flight out of there, but it has become chaotic at the moment. Even a week back, things were better. Suddenly things changed drastically and now everything is shut and not safe at all.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/everything-changed-suddenly-silently/article35968385.ece
