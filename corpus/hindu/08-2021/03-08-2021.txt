03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC questions States on cases under 66A||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the States to respond to a petition that stated citizens continued to get booked and prosecuted under Section 66A of the Information Technology Act for expressing themselves freely on social media. Unconstitutional Section 66A was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in a judgment in 2015. A Bench, led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman, said the State governments, which controlled the police force, had to answer for the violation of the court judgment. The judiciary could be reined in from wrongly charging under Section 66A, but the cooperation of the States was necessary to put the brakes on the police from registering FIRs under Section 66A. The court said that it intended to pass a wholistic order after hearing the States. It listed the case after four weeks. ‘Distressing, shocking’ On July 5 last, Justice Nariman found it “distressing”, “shocking” and “terrible” that people were still booked and tried under Section 66A even six years after the court struck down the provision as unconstitutional and a violation of free speech. NGO People’s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL), represented by senior advocate Sanjay Parikh and advocate Aparna Bhat, had drawn the court’s attention to the violations. Justice Nariman had authored the judgment, trashing Section 66A in a petition filed by law student Shreya Singhal, who highlighted cases of young people being arrested and charged under the ambiguous provision for their social media posts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-questions-states-on-cases-under-66a/article35692136.ece
03 August 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra relaxes curbs in more than 20 districts||The Maharashtra government on Monday relaxed pandemic curbs in more than 20 of its 36 districts including extending shop timings in these areas and permitting all government and private offices to function with full capacity. For the remaining 11 districts, including Pune, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, and Ratnagiri, ‘Level 3’ restrictions are to remain in place, said an order issued by Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte. Additionally, the order directs respective district authorities to impose more effective restrictions in Sindhudurg, Satara and Ahmednagar, considering the emergence of fresh cases in these districts. The order leaves the decision to relax existing restrictions in Mumbai, Mumbai Suburban and Thane districts to the disaster management authorities of these districts. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation on Monday permitted shops to remain open till 10 p.m. throughout the week while medical and chemist shops can stay open for 24 hours. The civic body’s instructions also said that hotels and restaurants could remain open till 4 p.m. on all days of the week. Except for swimming and other close contact games, all indoor and outdoor games are permitted to be held. Shooting has also been allowed while following all COVID-19 norms. CM non-committal Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray continued to remain non-committal about the opening of local train services in Mumbai to all sections of the public, remarking that the easing of curbs was being done gradually. The relaxations in the 22 districts of the State allow all essential and non-essential shops (including shopping malls) to remain open on all weekdays till 8 p.m. and till 3 p.m. on Saturday. All shops and malls except essential shops, will however, remain closed on Sundays.

03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||At $35 bn, July exports 34% higher than pre-COVID level||India’s merchandise exports in July were 34% higher than the pre-COVID levels of July 2019, at $35.17 billion, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said on Monday, but the trade deficit hit a three-month high as gold imports jumped 145.4% from the 2019 levels. Imports rose from $41.8 billion in June to $46.4 billion, 14.75% higher than pre-pandemic activity. But without factoring in oil and gems and jewellery brought in, imports actually shrank 0.17% over the same period. Total merchandise exports during the first four months of 2021-22 now stand at $130.6 billion, about 22% higher than 2019. The government is confident of meeting the $400 billion target for the full year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/at-35-bn-july-exports-34-higher-than-pre-covid-level/article35692140.ece

The restrictions will remain “until further orders” in Golaghat and Lakhimpur districts due to a positivity rate higher than the rest of the State. The Assam State Disaster Management Authority on Monday issued a revised directive for both rural and urban areas, withdrawing the night curfew while continuing to suspend inter-district passenger transport services. According to the directive, a partial curfew from 2 p.m. to 5 a.m. and a curfew from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m. will remain in force in Golaghat and Lakhimpur in view of the “moderate positivity rate”. In the remaining 32 districts, “all public transport authorities shall enforce COVID-19 appropriate behaviour and seating inside the vehicles, carriers, containers, etc.,” the ASDMA directive said, making it mandatory to wear masks in public places and allowing 10 persons at the most for marriage or funeral programmes. The directive also said that the situation would be reviewed on August 7 for taking a call on restarting inter-district passenger services and reopening institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covid-19-curfew-across-assam-withdrawn-barring-two-districts/article35692579.ece
03 August 2021||New Delhi,||Chargesheet filed against Sushil Kumar, 12 others in murder case||The Delhi police on Monday filed a chargesheet against double Olympic medallist wrestler Sushil Kumar as the main accused and 12 others in connection with the alleged murder of a former junior national wrestling champion at the Chhatrasal Stadium here. The final report has been filed before Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Satvir Singh Lamba. The judge will announce the date for hearing after taking cognisance of the 1,000-page chargesheet on Tuesday. The chargesheet names 13 accused, including Kumar. A total of 15 accused have been arrested and five are on the run. Kumar and his associates had allegedly assaulted wrestler Sagar Dhankar, 23, and two of his friends, Sonu and Amit Kumar, on the intervening night of May 4 and 5. Sagar succumbed to the injuries later. The police had earlier called Kumar the main culprit and the mastermind of the murder and said there was electronic evidence wherein he and his associates could be seen beating Dhankar with sticks. Kumar, facing charges of murder, culpable homicide, criminal conspiracy among other offences, is lodged in the Tihar Jail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/chargesheet-filed-against-sushil-kumar-12-others-in-murder-case/article35692303.ece
03 August 2021||Belagavi,||Leaders in Bengaluru, Delhi lobbying for berths||With the State Cabinet due for expansion in a few days, several legislators from North Karnataka are camping in Bengaluru and New Delhi to lobby for Ministerial berths. Most BJP legislators in Belagavi, including those who were part of the B.S. Yediyurappa Cabinet, are said to be in the State or national capital, meeting senior leaders. Rumours seem to have added fuel to such efforts: one is that the party will accommodate younger faces in the Cabinet and the second that members of various factions within the State BJP, will be inducted. No one knows if they are true. But it is pushing several leaders to lobby for themselves and others, a senior legislator said. Following the defection and re-election of three legislators, the BJP has 14 MLAs in Belagavi district now. All of them have visited senior leaders in Bengaluru and New Delhi in the last week. Some have visited Mr. Yediyurappa, while others have met Sangh Parivar leaders. Bagalkot has six BJP MLAs, including the former Ministers Govind M. Karjol and Murugesh Nirani. Vijayapura has three BJP MLAs, including Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, who had openly opposed Mr. Yediyurappa. Umesh Katti, who held a meeting of officers in Hukkeri on Monday, defended his visits to Delhi. He said that he had come back from New Delhi after meeting leaders Amit Shah and J.P. Nadda. “Is it wrong to meet my own party leaders?’’ he asked. He told journalists that he was no aspirant for any Ministership and that he had met the national leadership as a matter of courtesy. “If they give me an opportunity, I will serve the State as a Minister. Or else, I will serve my constituency as a legislator,” he said. He expressed the confidence that he will be made a Minister. “Even though I have not expressed my desire to be a Deputy Chief Minister, I will perform my role well, if given an opportunity,’’ he said. Meanwhile, some organisations and party workers are demanding that their leaders be made Ministers. Members of the Madiga Samaj and Jai Bhim Sangha demanded that Duryodhan Aihole, three-time MLA from Raibag, be made a Minister. He belongs to the left-hand community among Scheduled Castes. “The community remains under represented. He has proven to be a pro-people MLA and his efforts should be recognised,’’ Jai Bhim Sangha president Ramesh Rayappagol said. Followers of Member of Legislative Council Mahantesh Kavatagimath held a press conference in Chikkodi seeking Cabinet berth for their leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/leaders-in-bengaluru-delhi-lobbying-for-berths/article35692457.ece
03 August 2021||Bengaluru,||Schools, PU colleges unlikely to reopen soon||With the spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in pockets of the State, the government, which was considering reopening schools, is likely to make a U-turn. Experts who were part of the committee formed by the government to recommend several issues, including reopening of schools, had suggested that all classes - from Class I to II PU - reopen from August 1. The Commissioner for Public Instruction (CPI), heading the committee, tweaked the report to say high school classes should be allowed to start from the second week of August and the lower classes, after a week. A senior official in the Department of Primary and Secondary Education said: “We were keen on restarting classes but with the increase in cases in some parts and prediction of a third wave, we do not want to take a risk and therefore do not want to reopen schools and PU colleges.” Sources also said the State government had decided not to reopen schools and PU classes as the students were not vaccinated. “While degree colleges are open as those students have got at least one dose, taking the same risk for school and PU students is difficult as they would have not got the vaccine,” a source said. On the other hand, the committee also quoted the Devi Shetty Committee report which recommended that schools and colleges should be opened in a phased manner. Several studies have pointed out that the school closure had led to loss of foundational abilities. Alternative strategies Rishikesh B.S., Associate Professor, Azim Premji University, said the pandemic was likely to continue. “In such a scenario, can they afford to close schools for a year?” he questioned. He said there was a need for the government to chalk out different strategies based on how the COVID-19 situation pans out. “Whenever cases rise and schools cannot remain open, there is a need for alternative programmes such as Vidyagama so that children’s learning is not affected,” he said. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said there was a need for schools to reopen at the earliest. “There was a considerable delay in taking a decision on reopening. With the political developments and no Education Minister at the moment, the opening will be delayed further. As there is prediction of a third wave, if schools are not reopened, learning loss will be far worse,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/schools-pu-colleges-unlikely-to-reopen-soon/article35692159.ece

Mr. Deshmukh and his son are being probed by the central agency over alleged money laundering and allegations that bar owners in Mumbai had paid him money. The NCP leader in his letter to the ED reiterated that the agency has neither furnished a copy of the ECIR nor the list of documents sought from him and he was available for audio-video electronic mode. “It appears that the subject summons have been issued solely with an aim to create a prejudice...,” he said, in the letter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/anil-deshmukh-skips-ed-summons-for-fourth-time/article35692647.ece

03 August 2021||CHENNAI,||President hails Madras legislature’s contribution||Hailing the rich contributions made by the Tamil Nadu legislature over the past century, President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday observed that the [erstwhile] Madras legislature had sown the seeds of a fully representative democratic form of governance, which were realised after Independence. Welfare State “The concept of the welfare State has taken deep roots in this legislature irrespective of who rules here,” he said addressing the centenary celebrations of the State legislature at Fort St. George, Chennai. He unveiled a portrait of five-time former Chief Minister and DMK patriarch M. Karunanidhi in the Assembly on the occasion. “This legislature became the fountainhead of many progressive legislation, which were subsequently replicated across the country to empower the weaker sections of society and strengthen democracy,” the President said. Roots of democracy According to Mr. Kovind, the Madras legislature can rightly be credited with nurturing the roots of democracy by focusing on governance to uplift the poor and purge social evils. “Politics and governance in the region evolved around positive and rational content that targeted the welfare of those living on the margins,” he noted. The abolition of the Devadasi system, widow remarriage, mid-day meals in schools and distribution of agricultural land to the landless were some of the revolutionary ideas that transformed society.  Lauding the leadership qualities of Karunanidhi, who started his political career as a teenager, when India was still fighting for freedom, the President said the former Chief Minister must have been satisfied while breathing his last that this land and its people had made astounding progress and development on all fronts. “He must have been satisfied too, as he spent every waking hour of his long and productive life in the service of the people of the State and also of the nation.” Pointing out that very few political leaders were so passionate about language, Mr Kovind said: “For him [Karunanidhi], his mother-tongue was the object of worship. Tamil, of course, is one of the greatest and the oldest languages of humankind. The whole world takes pride in its rich heritage. But it was Karunanidhi who ensured that it was granted official recognition as a classical language. Kalaignar was a leader in a class of his own. He was among the last links we had with the stalwarts of our national movement.” Recalling that the titan among the freedom fighters C. Rajagopalachari, who was the first Indian occupant of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, had graced this State Legislature too, Mr. Kovind said: “His successors too were exemplary political leaders. Among all Rajaji’s successors, however, it is Shri Karunanidhi-ji who ruled the longest, and thus has left a defining stamp on Tamil Nadu.” “It is indeed gratifying to learn that the legislature has a tradition of honouring the greatest stars of land,” he said and pointed out to the portraits of Thiruvalluvar, Mahatma Gandhi, C. Rajagopalachari, C. N. Annadurai, K. Kamaraj, E. V. Ramasami, B. R. Ambedkar, U. Muthuramalingam Thevar, Muhammad Ismail Sahib, M. G. Ramachandran, Jayalalithaa, S. S. Ramaswami Padayachi, V. O. Chidambaram Pillai, P. Subbarayan and Omanthur P. Ramaswamy Reddiar in the House. Earlier commencing his speech with a Vanakkam , the President attempted a few sentences in Tamil to a loud applause from the gathering and eventually switched to English. Governor Banwarilal Purohit, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, Assembly Speaker M. Appavu and Deputy Speaker K. Pitchandi spoke on the occasion. Among those in the gathering were Chief Justice of Madras High Court Sanjib Banerjee, Ministers, Members of Parliament, Members of the Legislative Assembly and leaders of major political parties barring the AIADMK.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/president-hails-madras-legislatures-contribution/article35692225.ece

03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||No agreement yet on Gogra, Hot Springs||The 12th round of Corps Commanders meeting between India and China, held on Saturday, was “constructive”, a joint statement issued on Monday said, though the two sides have not yet reached an agreement for disengagement at Gogra and Hot Springs in eastern Ladakh. “The two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on resolution of remaining areas related to disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Western Sector of India-China border areas,” the joint statement said. “The two sides noted that this round of meeting was constructive, which further enhanced mutual understanding.” The statement further said that the Corps Commanders agreed to resolve these remaining issues in an expeditious manner in accordance with the existing agreements and protocols and maintain the momentum of dialogue and negotiations .  Ensuring stability at LAC The two sides also agreed that in the interim they will continue their “effective efforts in ensuring stability along the LAC in the Western Sector and jointly maintain peace and tranquillity”, it added .  Referring to the point that the talks were constructive, a defence official said several issues pertaining to the disengagement were resolved while a few others remained.  An agreement for the second phase of disengagement has been held up since February after disengagement was completed on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso. Officials had stated earlier that another round of Major General-level talks is scheduled to be held soon. The talks held on Saturday at the Chushul-Moldo border meeting point went on for around nine hours. This round of meeting was held following the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of India and China on July 14 in Dushanbe and the 22nd meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs held on June 25. Both sides had undertaken partial disengagement from Patrolling Points (PP) 15 and 17A in Gogra and Hot Springs last July after disengagement from PP14 in Galwan, but the process was stalled after the aggressive actions on the south Bank of Pangong Tso in August. India has been pressing for comprehensive de-escalation of the situation in eastern Ladakh to end the stand-off that began last year which includes disengagement from all friction points, de-escalation and working out new protocols for patrolling.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-agreement-yet-on-gogra-hot-springs/article35692041.ece
03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delta and its sublineages reduce Covaxin antibodies: ICMR study||Antibodies produced in response to Covaxin were reduced when tested against the Delta variant and its sublineages but continued to be high enough to remain protective, according to a study by scientists at the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology. The antibodies were collected from fully vaccinated individuals, some of whom had reported breakthrough infections, and yet others who had recovered from COVID-19 and tested in the laboratory against lab-cultured coronavirus variants belonging to the Delta, AY.1 and AY.3 lineages. In the vaccinated group, consisting of 42 individuals who never had COVID-19, the neutralising antibodies were reduced by about 23% when tested against the Delta variant; 33% against AY.1 and nearly 47% against AY.3. These reductions were in comparison to a reference variant called B.1. In those vaccinated who had COVID-19, the average number of antibodies produced was much higher, nearly 2.5 times higher than in those who had never had COVID-19. However the reductions were sharper — a nearly 60% reduction when faced with the Delta variant, 70% compared with AY.1 and about 72% with AY.3. The highest average neutralising antibodies were in those individuals with breakthrough infections, or who tested positive despite two doses. Their average antibody levels were nearly thrice than that of the COVID-naive individuals but reduced by nearly 50% when tested against the Delta variant, by 65% against AY.1 and 72% against AY.3. Role of memory cells “This demonstrates the possible role of memory cells in immune boosting with post-infection or infection after immunisation. The comparative analysis of all the groups revealed that the B.1.617.3 (AY.3) variant seems to be less susceptible to neutralisation followed by Delta AY.1 and Delta variants compared to B.1,” the authors, including several senior scientists from the ICMR, noted in their preprint publication, which is yet to be peer-reviewed. Despite these reductions, the authors said the antibody levels remained protective. “However, with the observed high titres, the sera of individuals belonging to all the aforementioned groups they would still neutralise the Delta, Delta AY.1 and B.1.617.3 (AY.3) variants effectively,” they noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lineages-of-delta-variant-reduce-covaxin-antibodies-icmr-study/article35692066.ece
03 August 2021||Patna,||Probe Pegasus issue, make it public, says Nitish||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said there should be an investigation into the Pegasus issue and everything should be made public. He also said that he neither had any intention nor aspiration to become the Prime Minister of the country. “Such things should not be done to disturb and harass people. There should be an investigation into it and the whole thing should be made public,” Mr. Kumar told presspersons after his weekly programme of ‘Janata ke Durbar Mein Mukhyamantri (Chief Minister in People’s Court)’. ‘Thorough examination’ There has been talk of telephone tapping for many days and he has been reading about it in newspapers as well, said the Chief Minister. “The whole thing should be examined thoroughly from each and every aspect and action taken into it,” he said. When asked if the matter should be investigated, he replied, “Of course, it should happen.” Mr. Kumar’s party, the Janata Dal (United), is ruling in alliance with the BJP in the State. To a question what he had to say on the comment of his party leader Upendra Kushwaha that he (Mr. Kumar) “is PM material”, the Chief Minister said neither he had any intention nor aspiration for it. On State BJP leader and Minister in his Cabinet Samrat Chaudhary’s comment that “running a coalition government is a challenging job and the government we run in Bihar is not our independent government. We face several challenges”, he remarked that he had not seen or read his (Mr. Chaudhary’s) comment. At a recent function in Aurangabad district, Mr. Chaudhary, who is Panchayati Raj Minister, also said, “We accepted Nitish Kumar as Chief Minister even when he won 43 seats and we got 74 (in the 2020 Assembly polls).” Mr. Kumar said, “I’m not aware about his comment. Have neither seen nor read it.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/probe-pegasus-issue-make-it-public-says-nitish/article35692021.ece
03 August 2021||New Delhi,||In RS, Oppn. raises Pegasus, farm bills||Opposition protest continued to disrupt the proceedings of the Rajya Sabja for the 10th consecutive day on Monday, with the parties raising objections to the three controversial farm laws besides the Pegasus ‘cyberattack’. While the Trinamool Congress (TMC) continued with the protest on Pegasus, the Congress, Left and others raised a demand to scrap the farm bills. The protests led to two adjournments, and the Inland Vessels Bill, 2021, was passed amid din. The TMC, Congress, SP and the Left parties were in the well of the House, while the NCP, Shiv Sena and the RJD stood at their seats in protest. Many members, sources said, felt that taking a militant position on Pegasus had left other issues unheard. The MPs from Haryana and Punjab especially took up the issue. Meanwhile, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh dialled Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of the Opposition in the House. Sources said it was just a courtesy call. No offer of an all-party meeting on Pegasus was made by Mr. Singh. “The Opposition parties want Parliament to run and discuss three important issues. A: Withdraw the farm bills and have a discussion on the ongoing agitation by farmers. B: A discussion on state of economy and unemployment. C: National Security that is Pegasus. But we have to start with C,” TMC floor leader Derek O’Brien said. All the 15 parties who attended the morning meeting of Opposition parties were all on the same page, he asserted.  The Congress though is still uncomfortable with this position. The sources said that they wanted to pause the protests to be able to participate in the debate on the Inland Vessels Bill. But with raucous protests from the TMC, Congress MP Shakti Sinh Gohil, who was designated to speak on the Bill, could not raise his concerns. The Congress did not join others in the well of the House once the Bill was taken up for discussion. The Bill was passed as the Opposition members shouted “no” from the well of the House. As the Opposition continued to protest, the House was adjourned for an hour, only to resume for a few minutes before being adjourned for the day.

03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||PM Modi launches digital payment solution e-RUPI||Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched e-RUPI, a person and purpose-specific cashless digital payment solution, via videoconference on Monday. Mr. Modi said the e-RUPI voucher was a symbol of how India was progressing by connecting people’s lives with technology. He expressed happiness that this reform initiative had come at a time when the country was celebrating the Amrit Mahotsav on the 75th anniversary of Independence. e-RUPI is a cashless and contactless instrument for digital payment, an official statement said, adding that it is a QR code or SMS string-based e-voucher, which is delivered to the mobile of the beneficiaries. In addition to the government, if any organisation wanted to help someone for his or her treatment, education or for any other work, then they would be able to give an e-RUPI voucher instead of cash, he said.“This will ensure that the money is being used for the purpose for which any help or any benefit is being provided.” He said there was a time when technology was considered a domain of the rich and there was no scope for technology in a poor country like India. “Today we are seeing technology as a tool to help the poor, a tool for their progress,” he said. He asserted how technology was bringing in transparency in transactions and creating new opportunities and making them available to the poor. For reaching today’s unique product, the foundation was prepared over the years by creating the JAM system, which connected mobile and Aadhaar. “Benefits of JAM took some time to be visible to people and we saw how we could help the needy during the lockdown period while other countries were struggling to help their people,” he said. More than Rs. 17.50 lakh crore had been transferred directly to the accounts of people via the Direct Benefit Transfer, he said. “More than 3,000 schemes are using DBT and 90 crore Indians are being benefited in some way or the other through in areas like LPG, ration, medical treatment, scholarship, pension and wage disbursal.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-modi-launches-digital-payment-solution-e-rupi/article35692061.ece
03 August 2021||MOHALI,||Students upbeat in Punjab as schools reopen||Students were upbeat in Punjab after physical classes started on Monday, following the government’s decision to reopen schools for all classes amid the drop in COVID-19 cases. At the Government Primary School in Kambali, students and teachers were jubilant. Most of the children were seen following the COVID-19 norms. “All the classes have started today and the cheerfulness among them is clearly visible. While we had been holding classes online during over the past one year, physical classes are better practice. There are children whose families are not financially very sound and and cannot afford mobile phone or laptop or at times spending on Internet data is a problem,” Parminder Kaur, head teacher, told The Hindu . “We have 394 students enrolled in Classes 1 to 5 and close to 200 students have come today, which is really encouraging. Some parents are yet to give written consent for sending their children. I am hopeful parents will give their consent in the coming days and more students will come to school,” she said. Missed friends Wearing a mask, Sophia, a fifth-grade student, said she was happy to be back on the campus. “During the online classes, studying on mobile was very difficult. Sitting in my class with my friends and studying is better,” she said. At the Government High School in Mauli Baidwan, principal Sanjeev said: “More than 50% have already come to school. We have strength of 415. A sense of fear surrounding COVID-19 is natural among parents but most of them have left their wards on the campus after satisfying themselves of the safety steps we have implemented.” Playing with her classmate in the school playground Jasmeet, a Class three student, said, “I missed my friends. I am happy to be in the school with my friend Rakhi. We will play the whole day and study a little.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/students-upbeat-in-punjab-as-schools-reopen/article35692052.ece
03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Experts warn against mandatory food fortification||In a push back against the Centre’s plan to mandatorily fortify rice and edible oils with vitamins and minerals, a group of scientists and activists has written to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), warning of the adverse impacts on health and livelihoods. They cited multiple studies to show that dietary diversity and higher protein consumption are key to solving undernutrition in India, rather than adding a few synthetic micronutrients which could harm the health of consumers. The letter, sent on Monday to the FSSAI as well as to the Food, Agriculture and Health Ministries and the Ministry of Women and Child Development, was signed by 170 individuals and organisations, including eminent nutritionists, economists, doctors and farmers groups. ‘Inconclusive evidence’ One of the signatories is Veena Shatrugna, former deputy director of the National Institute of Nutrition, who warned that “evidence supporting fortification is inconclusive and certainly not adequate before major national policies are rolled out”. The letter pointed to recent studies published in the medical journal Lancet and in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition which show that both anaemia and Vitamin A deficiencies are overdiagnosed, meaning that mandatory fortification could lead to hypervitaminosis. It also noted that many of the studies which FSSAI relies upon to promote fortification were sponsored by food companies which would benefit from it, leading to conflicts of interest. Studies funded by the Nestle Nutrition Institute and the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition were mentioned as cases in point. The letter explained that a major problem with chemical fortification of foods is that nutrients don’t work in isolation but need each other for optimal absorption. Undernourishment in India is caused by monotonous cereal-based diets with low consumption of vegetables and animal protein. “Adding one or two synthetic chemical vitamins and minerals will not solve the larger problem, and in undernourished populations can lead to toxicity,” it said, citing a 2010 study that showed iron fortification causing gut inflammation and pathogenic gut microbiota profile in undernourished children. The letter also argued that mandatory fortification would harm the vast informal economy of Indian farmers and food processors, including local oil and rice mills, and instead benefit a small group of multinational corporations. Dietary diversity was a healthier and more cost-effective way to fight malnutrition, it said. “Once iron-fortified rice is sold as the remedy to anaemia, the value and the choice of naturally iron-rich foods like millets, varieties of green leafy vegetables and flesh foods will have been suppressed by a policy silence,” it warned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/experts-warn-against-mandatory-food-fortification/article35692068.ece
03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Northeast BJP MPs blame Congress for clash||A group of BJP MPs from the northeastern States met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday and submitted a memorandum accusing the Congress of stoking tensions between Assam and Mizoram. The group, which included Union Minister and former Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, told the Prime Minister that the Chief Ministers of Assam and Mizoram had expressed their desire to resolve the border dispute amicably. The MPs said they were pained to see the violence that took place on the Assam-Mizoram border, but at the same time disapproved of the Congress playing politics over the issue. “A series of confidence building measures have also taken place over the last few days. Yet, the actions of the Congress party remain as devious and mischievous,” the memorandum read. The MPs said the NDA government had carried out “historic and unparalleled” development works in the region, while successive Congress governments had failed to do so. They said the Congress had “zero regard” for the culture of the region, and added that the party and “its ecosystem” had tried to make the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens political issues, but the people had rejected that. “Now, they are stoking tempers between Assam and Mizoram. We, the undersigned, want to state clearly that the nefarious designs of the Congress will not succeed in the northeast. They should stop politicking on issues and focus on development agenda,” said the memorandum signed by Union Ministers Kiren Rijiju, Rameswar Teli and Pratima Bhoumik, among others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mps-from-northeast-blame-cong-for-clash/article35692039.ece
03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Ex-Australian PM Abbott in India to push trade talks||In an effort to restart India-Australia trade talks, former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott landed in New Delhi on Monday for a four-day visit to meet Ministers and business leaders. Mr. Abbott is in India as Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s “Special Trade Envoy for India”. Despite an agreement between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Morrison in June 2020 that India and Australia would “re-engage” on the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), talks on CECA, which have been suspended since 2015, have made no visible progress. “Mr. Abbott looks forward to discussions on the India-Australia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement, which will propel our economic relationship to its full potential, to the mutual benefit of the Indian and Australian people,” Australian High Commissioner Barry O’Farrell said, announcing the visit on Monday, describing bilateral ties at an “historic high”. “This will be an opportunity to progress Australia’s ambitious agenda to energise and expand our bilateral trade and investment relationship with India,” a statement issued by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also said. To meet Modi, Goyal Officials said Mr. Abbott’s schedule is still to be finalised, but he is expected to meet Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and officials of the Commerce Ministry, address business chambers and think tanks in Delhi before he leaves on August 6. Officials did not rule out a meeting with Mr. Modi, who had met Mr. Abbott warmly, calling him a friend during a private visit to India in 2019. During his first visit as Prime Minister in September 2014, Mr. Abbott had been particularly keen to see the CECA to its conclusion. After talks with Mr. Modi who travelled to Australia two months later, the two leaders had announced they hoped to finalise the deal by the end of 2015. No progress “By the end of next year we will have a free trade deal with what is potentially the world’s largest market. And I want to make this declaration here in this Parliament: there are two can-do PMs in this chamber today and we will make it happen,” Mr. Abbott had told the Australian Parliament in November 2014. However, the talks ran into trouble over market access for Australian agricultural dairy products, high tariffs and other issues. After Malcolm Turnbull unseated Mr. Abbott in 2015, progress on the CECA talks slowed down, particularly as talks over the 16-nation ASEAN-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), that included Australia and India picked up. India decided to walk out of the RCEP in 2019, however, and the bilateral CECA negotiations have been pending ever since. Mr. Abbott has been particularly critical of the RCEP agreement, that is expected to come into force on January 1, 2022, calling it the “trade arm of China’s Belt and Road Initiative”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ex-australian-pm-abbott-in-india-to-push-trade-talks/article35692049.ece
03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||5 journalists move SC over snooping||Five journalists, reported to have been under surveillance through Pegasus software, have moved the Supreme Court for a judicial oversight mechanism to be set up to deal with complaints. Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, S.N.M. Abdi, Prem Shankar Jha, Rupesh Kumar Singh and Ipsa Shataksi have moved the top court, saying they were subjected to “deeply intrusive surveillance”. Forensic examination They said a forensic examination done by Amnesty International on mobile phones revealed traces of interference. They said their fundamental rights, primarily of privacy, and dignity, were violated by the snooping. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana is scheduled to hear on August 5 three petitions, including one filed jointly by senior journalists N. Ram and Sashi Kumar, seeking an independent probe headed by a retired or sitting Supreme Court judge into the Pegasus allegations. Mr. Ram’s petition has asked the court to direct the government to come clean on whether the surveillance was done with the government’s knowledge or not. The five journalists have asked the court to direct the government to produce records or documents to show that it had in any way authorised the snooping of private citizens, journalists, activists and even its own Ministers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/5-journalists-move-sc-over-snooping/article35692122.ece
03 August 2021||New Delhi,||Amid protests, LS passes Bill to amend insurance Act||Amid Opposition protests and sloganeering over the Pegasus snooping issue and the three controversial farm laws, the Lok Sabha on Monday passed a law to amend the general insurance business Act without a debate. The Bill – The General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill, 2021 – will allow the government to bring down its stake in State-owned general insurance companies, generate required resources and help public sector general insurers design innovative products. But the Opposition and the Treasury benches got into a war of words as the Bill was being moved for passage. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury accused the government of handing over decades-old institutions to a handful of capitalists and and termed the bill “anti-people and anti-national”. Nirmala’s charge Hitting back at Mr. Chowdhury, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman accused the Opposition of spreading falsehood and asserted that she would respond to his charges if they [Opposition members] agreed to debate the provisions of the Bill. “If they are serious, they should sit down, debate and ask questions. Since you are afraid that truth will come out, you don’t want a discussion,” she stated while moving for the Bill’s passage. The Bill was passed through a voice vote after some of the amendments to it, moved by Revolutionary Socialists Party’s N.K. Pramachandran, were defeated. BJP’s Rama Devi, who was in the Chair, adjourned the House for the day soon after the Bill’s passage. As per the statement of objects and reasons, the proposed amendments to the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Bill seeks to remove the mandatory requirement of the Central government holding not less than 51% of the equity capital in a specified insurer. The Bill stated that certain amendments had become ‘necessary’ to provide for greater private participation in public sector insurance companies, enhance the penetration of the insurance sector, provide social protection by securing the interests of the policyholders better and contribute to faster pace of the economic growth. In her Budget speech for 2021-22, the Finance Minister had announced a ambitious privatisation agenda, including two public sector banks and one general insurance company. Of the public sector general insurance companies — the National Insurance Company Limited, New India Assurance Company Limited, Oriental Insurance Company Limited and the United India Insurance Company Limited — the government will dilute its shareholding in one company. The name of the company, however, is yet to be finalised. The first half of the Lok Sabha proceedings also witnessed protests by the Opposition members, resulting in two adjournments before lunch. While the Ms. Sitharaman introduced the Tribunals Reforms Bill, 2021, after withdrawing an earlier bill on the issue, Mr. Chowdhury accused the government of “bulldozing one legislation after another”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amid-protests-ls-passes-bill-to-amend-insurance-act/article35692026.ece
03 August 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata inaugurates Khela Hobe event||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Monday that the slogan ‘ Khela Hobe ’ (Game is on) will soon reverberate in every State across the country. “ Khela Hobe slogan has become very popular. We have to make it a permanent slogan. Khela Hobe was raised in Parliament. It will reverberate in every State and the entire country,” she said at an event at the Netaji Indoor Stadium. The Trinamool Congress chairperson’s statement came on a day when the party’s general secretary Abhishek Banerjee was in Tripura trying to expand the party’s footprint in the State. Ms. Banerjee had visited Delhi last week and met leaders of several Opposition parties. She said that August 16 would be observed as “Khela Hobe Dibas” across the State. The Chief Minister said funds had been allocated to clubs for extension of sports activities. Ms. Banerjee assured fans of East Bengal that the club would play the upcoming 2021-22 season in Indian Super League (ISL). There were reports of East Bengal officials having certain differences with its new financial patron that is threatening its existence in the country’s top football league, the ISL. The Chief Minister was instrumental in securing financial support for the club.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/khela-hobe-will-reverberate-across-the-country-mamata/article35692030.ece
03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Preventive detention only to forestall public disorder: SC||Preventive detention, the dreaded power of the State to restrain a person without trial, could be used only to prevent public disorder, the Supreme Court held in a judgment on Monday. “Preventive detention is a necessary evil only to prevent public disorder. The court must ensure that the facts brought before it directly and inevitably lead to a harm, danger or alarm or feeling of insecurity among the general public or any section thereof at large,” a Bench led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman observed. The State should not arbitrarily resort to “preventive detention” to deal with all and sundry “law and order” problems, which could be dealt with by the ordinary laws of the country. “Whenever an order under a preventive detention law is challenged, one of the questions the court must ask in deciding its legality is: was the ordinary law of the land sufficient to deal with the situation? If the answer is in the affirmative, the detention order will be illegal,” Justice Nariman wrote. The court said two drunks fighting on a road was a law and order problem, and not ‘public disorder’. The solution here was not preventive detention. Preventive detention must fall within the four corners of Article 21 (due process of law) read with Article 22 (safeguards against arbitrary arrest and detention) and the statute in question, Justice Nariman said. “Liberty of a citizen is a most important right won by our forefathers after long, historical and arduous struggles...We must confine the power of preventive detention to very narrow limits, otherwise the great right to liberty won by our Founding Fathers, who were also freedom fighters, after long, arduous and historical struggles, will become nugatory,” the court noted. “Mere contravention of law, such as indulging in cheating or criminal breach of trust, certainly affects ‘law and order’, but before it can be said to affect ‘public order’, it must affect the community or the public at large,” Justice Nariman stated. The judgment came in an appeal filed by the wife of a man placed under preventive detention under the Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act shortly after he was granted bail in a cheating case. The top court said the State should have contested the bail order in a higher court rather than slap an Executive order of preventive detention on him on the ground that, if set free, he would cheat more people. “This ... certainly cannot provide the springboard to move under a preventive detention statute. We, therefore, quash the detention order,” the court ordered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/preventive-detention-only-to-forestall-public-disorder-sc/article35692046.ece
03 August 2021||New Delhi,||Will remain MP but quit politics: Babul Supriyo||The BJP on Monday managed to persuade Babul Supriyo against resigning as a Lok Sabha member even as the singer-turned-politician insisted that he will no longer be part of active politics. ‘Will leave Delhi house’ Speaking to reporters after meeting BJP president J.P. Nadda, the Asansol MP said he will continue to discharge his constitutional responsibilities as a parliamentarian but withdraw from politics and leave his official residence in the national capital. His decision will be a big relief to the BJP as it would not have liked to be forced to contest a bypoll against the Trinamool Congress, which is upbeat after handing a comprehensive defeat to the party in the recent West Bengal Assembly polls. Upset at being dropped from the Union Council of Ministers by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the two-term MP had announced that he will resign as MP and quit politics. He told reporters on Monday that Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Mr. Nadda had spoken to him, and he has taken a final decision after thinking over their suggestions. He asserted that whatever he had said recently, some of which was seen to be critical of the party’s affairs in the State, was in the interest of the BJP and that he stood by that.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-remain-mp-but-quit-politics-babul-supriyo/article35692314.ece
03 August 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Top PMO official quits||Amarjeet Sinha, advisor in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), has resigned from his post seven months ahead of his two-year tenure. A retired IAS officer of 1983 batch from Bihar, Mr. Sinha, who superannuated as secretary from the Government of India, was appointed in the PMO in February 2020. He was tasked with handling social sector-related subjects. He superannuated as rural development secretary in 2019. Top sources confirmed his resignation without citing any reason. “He resigned from the post and July 31 was the last day,” a senior official said. Third official There was, however, no official reason for his abrupt resignation from the coveted job for any retired civil servant. Mr. Sinha becomes the third top official from the PMO to go before the completion of the tenure after the 2019 parliamentary poll. Earlier, Prime Minister’s Principal Secretary Nripendra Misra stepped down after the 2019 general election. After his resignation, P.K. Mishra, Additional Principal Secretary, was elevated in his place. Subsequently, in March this year, Principal Advisor P.K. Sinha, former Cabinet Secretary, resigned from the PMO. He was appointed in the PMO first as an Officer on Special Duty briefly and then as Principal Advisor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/top-pmo-official-quits/article35692024.ece
03 August 2021||August 03 2021 00:00 IST,||July exports 34% higher than pre-COVID level||“The target for the remaining eight months (requires) an average of $33.68 billion per month,” the Commerce and Industry Ministry said. “While the non-oil exports were robust in July 2021, they remained below the March 2021 level. A spike in oil exports boosted the overall merchandise exports to a record-high level in July,” noted ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar. The economy’s phased reopening has triggered the gold imports surge, she reckoned, adding that they have already crossed $12 billion between April and July and would likely surpass last year’s level of $34.6 billion as festive demand is expected to push up the yellow metal’s inflows. In value terms, India’s exports to the U.S. and China saw the sharpest spurt in July, rising 51.6% and 52.3%, respectively, from pre-COVID-19 outbound trade. Imports from Iraq grew the most in terms of value, rising 76.3% over July 2019. Within the India-China trade basket, the biggest growth was reported in exports of engineering goods, up nearly 261% from July 2019 and petroleum products which surged by almost 98%. Federation of Indian Exporters’ Organisation (FIEO) president A. Sakthivel said July’s exports were the highest in at least nine years and signal a swift recovery in global demand that is swelling exporters’ order books.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/july-exports-34-higher-than-pre-covid-level/article35692036.ece
03 August 2021||August 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Assam takes back case filed against Mizoram MP||Dr. Sarma was one of the accused named in the FIR at the Vairengte police station in Mizoram’s Kolasib district. Mr. Vanlalvena had, after the death of six Assam policemen and a civilian in firing on a disputed stretch of the Assam-Mizoram border on July 26, gone on record saying the Mizoram police should have “killed them all”. “The case against the Mizoram MP has been abated,” Assam’s Special Director General of Police (Law and Order) G.P. Singh said. Dr. Sarma said earlier the withdrawal of the FIR was in response to Mr. Zoramthanga’s desire to settle the border dispute amicably. “However, cases against the other accused police officers will be pursued,” he tweeted while asserting “Assam always wants to keep the spirit of the North East alive”. The Assam and Nagaland police had begun withdrawing from the disputed areas of the border following a memorandum of understanding signed on July 31. “This is one big step towards restoring peace on our borders,” he stated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-takes-back-case-filed-against-mizoram-mp/article35692037.ece
03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Jaishankar likely to attend swearing-in of Raisi||External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar is expected  to travel to Tehran to attend the swearing-in of the newly elected Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on August 5. Mr. Jaishankar had met the President-elect on July 8, when he handed over a letter from Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulating him on the election victory. “Appreciate [Mr. Raisi’s] warm sentiments for India. Deeply value his strong commitment to strengthen our bilateral ties and expand cooperation on regional and global issues,” Mr. Jaishankar had said after calling on Mr. Raisi. The meeting with Mr. Jaishankar was the first interaction between Mr. Raisi and a foreign dignitary since he won the election on June 19. The ongoing exchanges acquire significance in view of the escalating violence in Afghanistan. An MEA source confirmed that the visit of Mr. Jaishankar is yet to be formally announced but hinted that it is on track. India is expected to fast track the remaining parts of work in the Chabahar port as it will ensure access to Afghanistan where the Taliban have gained a temporary upper hand in their battle against the Afghan government. Engaging the new President of Iran also comes in the backdrop of intensifying tension between Iran and Israel.    The high level exchanges will also take place after a pause in energy ties as India had stopped purchasing oil from Iran in May 2019, after the re-imposition of sanctions by the Trump presidency. The freeze in energy ties also affected other sectors of the bilateral ties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jaishankar-likely-to-attend-swearing-in-of-raisi/article35692124.ece

03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Over 100 convicted in Vyapam scam cases||More than 100 persons arraigned by the CBI in connection with the Vyapam scam cases have been convicted so far. Among the latest convicted persons are a candidate in the Madhya Pradesh Police Constable Recruitment Test-2013, Om Prakash Tyagi, and a middleman named Satish Jatav. The CBI had taken over the probe from the State police in August 2015. The agency alleged that Mr. Tyagi had engaged a person to appear in the test in his place. In another case, the CBI recently filed a supplementary chargesheet against 73 of them with respect to a pre-medical test conducted in 2012. While 54 of them have been accused of manipulating digital data and the Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) answer sheets, 19 face the allegation of impersonation. The 19 accused candidates had deliberately left ovals of 120 to 130 questions blank in their OMR sheets following which the digital data of the answer sheets was manipulated by the accused Vyapam officials to assign them marks. In several cases, students from outside Madhya Pradesh were allegedly engaged to appear in the test. The CBI found that 16 alleged impersonators were from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/over-100-convicted-in-vyapam-scam-cases/article35692064.ece

Law enforcement agencies shared equal responsibility to comply with the judgment. They took action against cybercrime offenders as per the law. The Ministries of Information and Technology and Home Affairs had done their best to disseminate knowledge about the Supreme Court judgment in Shreya Singhal case, it stated. Section 66A had prescribed three years’ imprisonment if a social media message caused “annoyance” or was found “grossly offensive”.  The apex court had concluded the provision to be vague and worded arbitrarily. Justice Nariman had agreed with Mr. Parikh on July 7 that the “state of affairs is shocking”. The latter had urged the court to intervene and work out a mechanism to disseminate the Shreya Singhal judgment to every police station and trial court in the country. The PUCL has submitted, “Section 66A of the IT Act has continued to be in use not only within police stations but also in cases before trial courts across India.” The NGO had urged the court to direct the government to collect all the data/information regarding FIRs/investigations under Section 66A and pending cases in the district and High Courts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-questions-states-on-cases-under-66a/article35692022.ece
03 August 2021||New Delhi,||Rahul invites 17 Oppn. leaders to discuss strategy||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi has invited floor leaders of 17 Opposition parties for a breakfast meeting on Tuesday to chart out a joint parliamentary strategy for the Monsoon session. Mr. Gandhi's move is also an attempt to keep Opposition unity intact, as the session enters its third week. Among those invited are DMK, Shiv Sena, NCP, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Aam Admi Party, National Conference, CPI and CPI (Marxist). It is not yet known how many leaders will turn up for the meet. Two weeks of the Monsoon session that got under way on July 19 have been washed out because of the Opposition's insistence on first discussing the Pegasus snooping controversy and the farm laws before other issues. The government has, so far, rejected the demand for a discussion on Pegasus and carried out its legislative agenda amid Opposition protests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahul-invites-17-oppn-leaders-to-discuss-strategy/article35692027.ece
03 August 2021||August 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Manifested life||All beings, with or without faith in the scriptures, are involved in some search that they hope will give them happiness. Naturally, they look for it in the objects of the world. But they do not know that the happiness is within their own self, which is the essence of Sat-chit-ananda, Eternity, consciousness and bliss. This self is the divine presence of the Supreme Self within. So, if one strives to look inwards rather than getting involved in this world and its cyclic activities, it is possible to rise to the level of the bliss, which is the goal of one’s existence, pointed out Sri R. Krishnamurthy Sastrigal in a discourse. This is reiterated in all spiritual texts based on the scriptures, and most explicitly stated by the Lord in the Bhagavad Gita. Sastras exhort people to know, understand and realise the Supreme Brahman who is unseen, unheard, unthinkable, and unknown. Then how is one to go about this quest? They say that sages and rishis have practised austerities and realised Him in the inner self and hence live in a state of bliss. In the fifteenth chapter, and earlier when the Lord revealed His divine form to Arjuna, it is shown that the manifested life is only a part of the Immutable Brahman. None can fathom what lies beyond both the manifest and unmanifest. The Lord’s presence animates all that is perceived as manifest in this entire cosmic universe. So it follows that all beings in this universe, animate and inanimate, moving and unmoving, are sustained by the divine force. All beings belong to this world of manifestation. One has to discern between what is perishable and what is eternal and unchanging. The Supreme Lord is the sole ruler and controller and is above both the mutable and immutable. The highest wisdom is to realise that God is in all objects and worship Him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/manifested-life/article35692050.ece

This demand could have serious ramifications for the JD(U)-BJP relationship. At the party’s national executive held in Delhi on Saturday, it was decided that the MPs will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Sources said Mr. Modi had directed the delegation to meet Mr. Shah. Mr. Singh told reporters that the Bihar Assembly had passed a unanimous resolution on February 27, 2020 and February18, 2019 on the demand.

03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Normal rainfall in August: IMD||The India Meteorological Department has said that monsoon rainfall in August, the second rainiest of the monsoon months, will be “normal” as would be the rainfall in August and September. Normal in the IMD parlance implies a 5% window of error. The normal amount of rainfall during August is 25.8 cm, whereas during August and September it is around 42.83 cm. The updated forecast, however, warns that “below normal to normal rainfall” was likely over many areas of central India and some areas over northwest India. Most parts of peninsula and northeast India are like to register normal rainfall. So far, cumulative monsoon rainfall from June 1 to August is 46.5 cm, or about 1% less than the 47 cm expected during this period. Though rainfall in the second half of June and first half of July was weak, there was a pick up since the 15th of last month which led to the deficit being overcome. A forecast for a “normal” August is predicated on the sea surface temperatures (SST) and atmospheric conditions over the equatorial Pacific Ocean expected to remain at a tepid “neutral” level. However, the IMD said, the SSTs over central and east equatorial Pacific Ocean was showing a “cooling tendency” because of which there could be more rainfall. Other global factors that influence the monsoon are the sea surface temperatures over the the Indian Ocean. “Currently, negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions are prevailing over the equatorial Indian Ocean. The latest forecasts indicate that negative IOD conditions are likely to continue during the remaining part of the monsoon season,” their statement noted. So far, the rainfall in aggregate has been fairly well distributed over India. Northwest India has seen a 1% increase from what is normal. Central India has got exactly the expected average rainfall, and while the northeast has registered a 13% decline, compensated by a high base rainfall, the Southern Peninsula has received 13% more rainfall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/normal-rainfall-in-august-imd/article35692043.ece
03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Father moves SC to extradite woman who joined IS||The father of a woman from Kerala who joined the Islamic State and is detained in an Afghan prison with her seven-year-old daughter when last heard has moved the Supreme Court for their extradition. V.J. Sebastian Francis, 75, from Kochi, is afraid that his daughter, Sonia Sebastian, alias Ayisha, presently lodged in Pul-e-Charkhi prison in Kabul, may be executed amid the fight between the Taliban and Afghan government forces. “Subsequent to the withdrawal of the American forces there may be violent face off and war between Islamic Government and Taliban. Hence there is an imminent threat to the life of the detenues, or that they may be put to trial in Afghanistan and executed there itself,” the petition said. Mr. Francis said it is a violation of their fundamental rights that the Indian government has not initiated any steps for the repatriation/extradition of the mother and daughter. He has urged the court to direct the government to take steps to provide “diplomatic protection/consular assistance to the detenues through its consular /diplomatic office in Islamic Republic of Afghanistan”. The woman was chargesheeted by the National Investigation Agency for various offences under the UAPA. She should face trial in India. Mr. Francis said he had tried in vain to contact the authorities in Afghanistan to get information about them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/father-moves-sc-to-extradite-woman-who-joined-isis/article35692044.ece
03 August 2021||Srinagar,||J&K parties slam denial of jobs, passports to protesters||Political parties from Jammu and Kashmir on Monday condemned the government’s move to deny passports and jobs to people with “adverse police report”, especially protesters and stone-throwers, and termed it against the spirit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech made during the all-party meeting on June 24. “An ‘adverse police report’ cannot be a substitute for being found guilty in a court of law. A year-and-a-half ago, the J&K police were able to create an ‘adverse police report’ to justify my detention under the Public Safety Act that would never have stood up to legal challenge. An executive order cannot replace a court of law. Guilt or innocence must be proven in court and not based on vague unproven police reports,” National Conference vice-president and former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said. Sajad Lone’s Peoples Conference (PC) termed the fresh order of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) as a move “to give arbitrary powers” to the officials of the Special Branch of the CID and “appoint it as judge, jury and executioner”. “It’s in contravention of the spirit of the speech made by the Prime Minister at the all-party meet where he said the distance of hearts between Delhi and Srinagar needs to be decreased. Such orders will certainly increase the alienation of the people towards the institutions of government,” PC spokesman Adnan Ashraf Mir said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jk-parties-slam-denial-of-jobs-passports-to-protesters/article35692047.ece

03 August 2021||Mumbai,||Sena cadre remove Adani board at Mumbai airport||Shiv Sena workers on Monday vandalised and then removed the ‘Adani Airport’ signboard displayed near the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj near the airport in Mumbai, claiming the company was trying to change the name of the airport. “These signboards of Adani Airport were installed yesterday (Sunday) night. The airport’s name is Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport. How can the company, which has been given the job to run the airport, dare to change the name of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj? Moreover, do you expect us to keep quiet on this,” asked Sanjay Kadam, secretary, Bharatiya Kamgar Sena (BKS), the labour wing of the Sena who removed the signboards. On Monday afternoon, a group of 15 to 20 workers marched with sticks and damaged the signboard before completely removing it amid slogans. BKS president and Sena Lok Sabha MP Arvind Sawant said the attempt to change the name of the airport will not be tolerated. “This is nothing but an insult to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj,” he said. The Adani Group released a statement clarifying that it was merely replacing the previous branding. “In light of the incidents around Adani Airports branding at the Mumbai International Airport, we firmly assure that Adani Airports Holding Limited (AAHL) has merely replaced the previous branding with Adani Airports branding and that no change has been made to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport’s branding or positioning at the terminal. The branding at CSMIA is in compliance with the norms and guidelines of the Airport Authority of India (AAI). AAHL will continue to adhere to all the guidelines laid out by the government in the interest of the aviation community at large,” the AAHL statement said.

03 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Work together with common goal, Purohit urges parties||On the occasion of the centenary celebrations of the Tamil Nadu legislature on Monday, Governor Banwarilal Purohit called upon the members of the 16th Legislative Assembly to work together with a common goal of serving the people and for the progress of the State, even if they belonged to different political parties with varying ideologies. “It is through the elected representatives that the sovereign will of the people finds expression in our legislative bodies. The trust and faith which the people have reposed in you need to be justified with sincerity and commitment,” Mr. Purohit said. He noted that the visionary zeal and foresight of stalwarts were instrumental in the enactment of important and historic legislation, which paved the way for the creation of a progressive State. Lauding the leadership qualities of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, Mr. Purohit said he won the hearts of lakhs of people in Tamil Nadu, especially the poor and the downtrodden. The former Chief Minister’s schemes, including the introduction of cycle rickshaws in place of hand-pulled rickshaws, a law for equal property rights for women, Samathuvapurams to eradicate caste discrimination, gas connections for the poor and rice at a subsidised price, spoke volumes about his service towards the upliftment of the poor, he said. The portrait unveiled in the Assembly hall on Monday shows Karunanidhi standing in front of a stack of books, and with a portrait of Thiruvalluvar in the background. His right hand rests on a sculpture of an elephant. The portrait is accompanied by a wooden board with the slogan: Kaalam Pon Pondrathu! Kadamai Kann Pondrathu! (Time is Golden! Duty is like Eyes!) The Governor recalled accompanying Prime Minister Narendra Modi to meet Karunanidhi in November 2017. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin recalled all the significant legislation passed in the State legislature, which received appreciation from across the globe. Stalin on portrait “As Chief Minister, I am happy, and as his [Karunanidhi’s] son, I am moved that the President of India, who is also the first citizen of the country, has unveiled his portrait,” an emotional Mr. Stalin said. He expressed his wish that the legislature should witness several centenary celebrations and enact legislation that uplift the poor and the downtrodden. Assembly Speaker M. Appavu said the State legislature, set up in 1921 in the then Madras Presidency, was the mother of all southern States. He recalled that both Houses of Parliament were adjourned after an obituary tribute to Karunanidhi, who was not even a member of either of the Houses. Deputy Speaker K. Pitchandi proposed a vote of thanks. Leaders of major political parties and organisations, including Dravidar Kazhagam president K. Veeramani, MDMK founder Vaiko, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri, CPI(M) leader K. Balakrishnan, CPI leader R. Mutharasan, Manithaneya Makkal Katchi leader M.H. Jawahirullah and VCK founder Thol. Thirumavalavan were among those present on the occasion. AIADMK leaders chose not to attend the function. However, PMK president G.K. Mani, Tamil Maanila Congress leader G.K. Vasan and BJP leader K. Annamalai — all allies of the AIADMK — took part.

03 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Zones with low seroprevalence on the radar||The Greater Chennai Corporation will give additional focus to vaccination in zones where seroprevalence is relatively lower. The recently released results of the fourth round of a survey conducted in early July showed an overall seroprevalence of 78.2%. The study was done by the Corporation along with the Indian Council of Medical Research’s National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE) and the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT) based on samples collected from 204 streets in 51 wards spread across all zones. Samples were collected from around 7,000 individuals in the age group of six and above. Among the 15 zones, Tondiarpet had the highest seroprevalence of 83.3% and Madhavaram the lowest of 72.5%. While seroprevalence has jumped from 49.2% observed during the previous survey conducted prior to the second wave, officials and experts said this should not lead to complacency. Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said from an administrative perspective, the results should be used to fine-tune preventive strategies. He said a key outcome would be to increase the vaccination coverage in zones like Madhavaram, Alandur and Perungudi, where seroprevalence was low. “The variation is not significant. However, in these zones the seroprevalence is relatively lower, and consequently, they could be more prone to newer clusters of cases,” he said. P. Ganeshkumar, assistant director and scientist D, ICMR NIE, currently supporting the Greater Chennai Corporation on COVID-19, said the survey measured only immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies related to the SARS-COV-2 virus and not the neutralising antibodies, which indicate immunity against COVID-19. Neutralising antibodies “However, detecting neutralising antibodies is a relatively costly affair and not feasible during such surveys. Even if we detect neutralising antibodies, their presence cannot be used to easily estimate the immunity levels in the population as there are more nuances involved,” he said. Highlighting that the presence of IgG antibodies only indicated that a person either had exposure to the virus or was vaccinated, Dr. Ganeshkumar said the purpose of such serosurveys were to observe the trend and equip ourselves better against COVID-19. Apart from targeting vaccination in zones where seroprevalence was relatively low, he said results could also be used in the earlier identification of new variants of SARS-CoV-2. “For instance, if we see new clusters in zones like Tondiarpet where seroprevalence is high, it is likely that a new variant is behind it. We should send samples from such cases to genomic study,” he said. He said serosurveys should not be used to conclude whether herd immunity levels had been reached or not, particularly with the emergence of new variants and the possibility of re-infection and infection after vaccination, although the chances were meagre. The focus on COVID-19 control measures like continuous surveillance, testing, effective contact tracing and strict isolation must continue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/zones-with-low-seroprevalence-on-the-radar/article35692239.ece

03 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Doctor’s phone hacked, Rs. 2.4 lakh stolen from her bank account||In a novel fraud, Rs. 2.4 lakh was stolen from a doctor’s account after she provided her KYC details, to keep her SIM active, through an app sent by the suspect. Not knowing that she was walking into a trap, Dr. Chandini Prabhakar, a dermatologist in Anna Nagar, called what she thought was the customer care number of the mobile phone operator. She was asked to download the ‘QPay’ app and transfer Rs. 10 for confirmation of her identity and continuation of SIM card services. Soon after the money was transferred and receipt issued, Dr. Chandini received SMS messages containing one time password for transfer of Rs. 1 lakh, Rs. 90,000 and Rs. 50,000 within few minutes. “I tried to cut the call but it did not work. The caller seemed to be online and even hacked my phone since he accessed OTP to take away Rs. 2.4 lakh. I could not make any calls from my phone after that and had to raise a complaint with the State Bank of India from a landline phone,” the dermatologist said. Dr. Chandini lodged a complaint in Anna Nagar police station. The number from which the suspect called appeared to be an internet-enabled voice call. “It is surprising that Rs. 10 got transferred into the account of the service provider and then the caller starts accessing my phone. After securing data from the phone, I discarded the SIM.” The dermatologist said she never shared any identity details, debit card credentials, card verification value (CVV) number and OTP with the suspect. “It is clear that once I transferred Rs. 10 via net banking on QPay, the accused took control of my phone even while I was on the call updating him about the payment details,” Dr. Chandini said. A search on Truecaller app showed one of the numbers to be belonging to “Vi Ekyc Office”. Helpline for cyber crime The Ministry of Home Affairs recently launched a Helpline Number 155260 operational 24/7 in eight States, including Tamil Nadu, for reporting cyber crime. The number is operational in all other States between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Police said the personnel at the helpline desk were equipped to stop payments to suspect accounts if the crime is reported within 24 hours. Victims can access the “Citizen Financial Cyber Frauds Reporting and Management System” by visitingwww.cybercrime.gov.into lodge complaints online for immediate action, sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/doctors-phone-hacked-rs-24-lakh-stolen-from-her-bank-account/article35692700.ece

Sekarbabu, Minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, said on Sunday. Addressing mediapersons at an event in Chennai, he said though the chanting of archanai mantras in Tamil was already in practice in major temples a few years ago, it had been forgotten over time. “This is a formal system to ensure that devotees, who want to listen to the potri being chanted in Tamil, can make a request to the priest. We will place signage with the names and contact numbers of priests who can perform the archanai in Tamil at the entrance of temples,” he explained. This would be initially launched in 47 major temples in the State, the Minister said. The present system of chanting archanai mantras in Sanskrit, would however not be disturbed in any manner and only select priests would chant them in Tamil, he said. “They have all taken part in a refresher course conducted recently. These potris would be brought out in book form so that devotees can also learn and chant them,” Mr. Sekar Babu added.

03 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Complete trial against special DGP, SP before Dec. 20: HC||The Madras High Court on Monday directed the Villupuram chief judicial magistrate (CJM) to conclude by December 20 the trial against Special Director General of Police Rajesh Das (now under suspension) on charges of sexually harassing a woman Superintendent of Police in February this year and also against Superintendent of Police D. Kannan (since suspended) on the charge of waylaying the victim officer when she was on her way to lodge a complaint. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh observed that the effectiveness of the criminal justice system would always depend upon completion of trial proceedings at the earliest and the certainty of the accused being either punished or acquitted. Therefore, he ordered conduct of trial in the sexual harassment case on a day-to-day basis. The CJM was directed to frame charges against the accused and hold the proceedings without granting unnecessary adjournments. The judge also made it clear that it would be the duty of the Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID), which filed a chargesheet against the suspended Special DGP and the male SP on July 29, to summon the witnesses without causing any undue delay. “This court must hasten to add that the orders passed at various stages in this suo motu writ petition will not have any bearing on the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Villupuram, while deciding the case on its own merits and in accordance with law. The prima facie findings that were given by this court in the writ petition will not bind the trial court. This important aspect must be kept in mind by the learned CJM while proceeding further with the case,” the judge said. The sexual harassment incident reportedly took place on February 21 when the suspended Special DGP and the victim were providing security cover for the then Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami during his election campaign in Karur, Namakkal, Perambalur and Villupuram districts. Since it involved top officials and could have an effect on the morale of the entire police force, the judge had taken suo motu notice of it on March 1 to ensure a free and fair investigation. Advocate General R. Shunmugasundaram and State Public Prosecutor Hasan Mohammed Jinnah on Monday told the court that the CB-CID had examined 122 witnesses, seized 72 documents, subjected many mobile phones to forensic examination, scrutinised call records and collected CCTV footage from various places before deciding to file a chargesheet. On July 6, the DGP, CB-CID,wrote to the Home Secretary recommending departmental action against the duo and also four other IPS officers in connection with the issue. The communication also sought government sanction to initiate criminal prosecution against the two officials alone and accordingly, the sanction was granted on July 27. Within two days thereafter, the investigating officer filed a chargesheet against both the officers before the CJM, Villupuram. In the final report, the suspended special DGP had been charged under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force against woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354A(2) (sexual harassment), 341 (wrongful restraint), 506(1) (criminal intimidation) read with 109 (abetment) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act of 1998. The suspended male SP had been charged under Sections 341 and 506(1) of the IPC, the court was informed. Appreciating the investigating officer for filing the chargesheet in five months despite COVID-19 and lockdown, Justice Venkatesh directed the High Court Registry to list the suo motu writ petition on December 23. If the CJM could not complete the trial by then, a memo could be filed seeking more time, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/complete-trial-against-special-dgp-sp-before-dec-20-hc/article35692248.ece
03 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Flood channel along ORR mooted||A flood diversion channel could be built along Outer Ring Road and linked to Kosasthalaiyar river to reduce inundation in surrounding areas of Adyar river. This was one of the multiple flood mitigation strategies suggested for the city by the Centre for Water Resources, Anna University. Titled ‘Investigation of multiple flood mitigation strategies for an urban catchment using semi-distributed hydrological modelling’, the study analysed various solutions for flood mitigation during extreme events. It suggested that the 25 m-wide median space of the ORR could be used to carry flood water. The new channel may intersect the Chembarambakkam surplus course near Thirumudivakkam bridge and be linked to Kosasthalaiyar river near Minjur. The natural topography of the area would allow flow by gravity. G. Ravikumar, professor, Centre for Water Resources, who co-authored the study published in Arabian Journal of Geosciences , said the project, though expensive, would be efficient. It would help transfer about 14,000 cubic feet per second of water (cusecs) during floods and reduce the flood volume by 23.48% in Adyar river and its streams. Waterbodies may be developed on either side of the road to harness the flood water as the channel would also ensure inter-basin water transfer from Adyar river to the Cooum and Kosasthalaiyar basins. Different scenarios of flood control measures and its reduction of peak discharge were analysed. The peak flood discharge in the Adyar sub-basin at Tiruneermalai watershed was calibrated to be 95,000 cusecs in 2015, Mr. Ravikumar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/flood-channel-along-orr-mooted/article35692241.ece
03 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Federation of private schools seeks property tax waiver||The Federation of Association of Private Schools in Tamil Nadu (FAPSIT) has filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the government to consider waiver of property tax for school buildings for the years 2020 and 2021. When the matter was listed before Justice Anita Sumanth on Monday, she adjourned the matter to September 2 and asked the petitioner to pursue with the government a representation made by it on May 31 seeking waiver of property tax. Federation secretary D.C. Elangovan said schools in the State remained closed from March 2020 when the first wave of COVID-19 disrupted normal life. During this period, schools conducted online classes to ensure continuity in education. Thereafter, lockdown restrictions were relaxed between January and March this year and limited physical functioning of schools was allowed by the government. Nevertheless, a majority of parents chose not to send their children due to the fear of the pandemic. As feared, the second wave made it impossible to reopen schools fully and online classes continued to be in vogue. In the meantime, private school managements had to struggle to settle loans availed for constructing buildings and purchasing buses. Claiming that only a section of students had paid 75% of the fees, permitted to be collected by the court for online classes, and that the money was hardly enough to pay staff salaries, the federation sought waiver of property tax for school campuses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/federation-of-private-schools-seeks-property-tax-waiver/article35692246.ece
03 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Amid fluctuations, officials keep a close watch on case spikes||COVID-19 cases continue to fluctuate in several districts of the State. Though such fluctuations are expected, each occasion when cases rise is being critically reviewed and closely monitored, according to public health officials. Over the past few days, there has been a marginal rise and fall in fresh infections in a number of districts. The fluctuations have raised the level of alert in the State, with measures like the closure of shops in commercial areas and mandatory RT-PCR negative report for travellers from Kerala, starting August 5, being taken up. “In any pandemic, particularly during the period of recession, fluctuations are quite common, and cases will not come down quickly. The rate of the fall will be slow. Our team is closely monitoring the situation on a daily basis. Each rise in the numbers is being critically reviewed,” T.S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, said. What led to the rise in fresh cases? As Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan pointed out, “Clusters are originating from markets, crowded places and, on occasion, even visits to hospitals.” He told officials that localised mini-containment measures were important when there were more than three COVID-19 cases in a locality, and that contact tracing should be done effectively. “After the relaxation of restrictions, such gradual increases are expected. But we need to ensure that they are reversed. Implementation of Standard Operating Procedures for workplaces, markets, crowded areas and functions may be tightened, while containment in areas where cases are reported is equally important,” Dr. Radhakrishnan said. He added that districts sharing a border with Kerala were told to activate checkposts at all entry points. Another public health official said the western districts were the main areas of concern as of now. The latest serosurvey revealed that less than 50% were exposed to the COVID-19 infection in these districts, he said. Genomic sequencing of COVID-19 samples indicated that it was predominantly the Delta variant. “So far, we have sent 2,614 samples for genomic sequencing and received the results for 1,881. The results indicate that it is predominantly the Delta variant — about 73%,” Dr. Selvavinayagam said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/amid-fluctuations-officials-keep-a-close-watch-on-case-spikes/article35692234.ece

03 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Transgender activist alleges abuse by officials||A group of transgenders, which assembled for a meeting chaired by Gopi Shankar, south representative of the National Council for Transgender Persons, has alleged harassment by the Chengalpattu district administration at Mamallapuram on Saturday night. The members of the council, which comes under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, have complained that the revenue and police officials of Mamallapuram conducted an “inspection” in the Fishermen Colony all of a sudden and sealed the hotel. They alleged that the police officials abused the group, mostly consisting of homeless and jobless transpersons. Mr. Shankar said a revenue official of the Chengalpattu district, along with a team of police officials, came to the place where a group of transgenders had assembled for dinner and asked them to leave immediately. Mr. Shankar complained that the police officials abused the transgenders for assembling without taking permission from the district authorities when the lockdown was in force. The transgender activist said taking up the issue with the Chengalpattu Collector did not help as the latter asked the official to seal the “hotel” without inquiring into the issue. The place where dinner was served was a community kitchen, he said. An official said they received an alert that a group had assembled without taking permission. “On inspection, we found the group having food with drinks and so the place was sealed.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/transgender-activist-alleges-abuse-by-officials/article35692699.ece
03 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK boycotts centenary event, justifies decision||The AIADMK on Monday justified its decision to boycott the centenary celebrations of the Tamil Nadu legislature at Fort St. George. The AIADMK’s grouse was directed more towards the unveiling of a portrait of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi than the centenary celebrations. S. Semmalai, an organisation secretary and former Minister, said the DMK not only boycotted the unveiling of a portrait of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in February 2018, but also approached the High Court against the move. “Under such circumstances, would it be fair on our part to attend the event?” S. Ravi, deputy Whip of the legislature party, wondered how AIADMK legislators could be expected to take part in the event when the DMK, while in Opposition, did not participate in the function held in memory of Jayalalithaa. D. Jayakumar, former Minister, accused the DMK of not having displayed political decency for Jayalalithaa, who was a six-time Chief Minister. In April 2018, the High Court dismissed a public interest litigation petition filed by DMK MLA J. Anbazhagan, seeking a direction to the Speaker and the Secretary of the Legislative Assembly to remove the portrait of Jayalalithaa from the precincts of the Assembly. Mr. Jayakumar also questioned the rationale behind the celebrations. According to him, the constitution of the first Assembly in 1952 only should be taken into account as it was then that the country had become a republic. “How can the establishment of the legislature in 1921 be considered when the country was still under British rule at the time?” he wondered. Rebutting the criticism about the centenary celebrations, R. Avudaiappan, former Assembly Speaker (2006-11), explained that the day’s event marked the completion of 100 years of a system where directly-elected representatives of the legislature were the dominant constituents of the House. The Justice Party, which launched the Dravidian movement in the State, obtained a majority in the Legislative Council as it bagged 63 seats out of the 98 members directly elected by the people. The Justice Party captured power for the first time and, as a result, several measures in the area of social justice were undertaken, including the issuance of “communal G.O.s” and providing reservation in employment to backward sections of society. On the issue pertaining to the unveiling of Jayalalithaa’s portrait, A. Saravanan, joint secretary of the DMK spokespersons’ wing, pointed out that the party had taken the decision “as a matter of principle” because Jayalalithaa was, he contended, a “convicted person”, and the unveiling of a portrait of such a person would set a bad precedent. “We do not indulge in petty politics. This can be borne out by the fact that Amma Unavagams continue to function with the portraits of Jayalalithaa being kept there though it is nearly three months since my party came to power,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-boycotts-legislature-centenary-event-justifies-decision/article35692233.ece

Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu directed Corporation counsel Karthika Ashok to get instructions on the issue. The direction was issued during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition, which insisted upon issuing a direction to the civic body to implement the 2014 Act effectively. The counsel stated that the Corporation had already constituted town vending committees for all 15 zones after conducting elections. However, petitioner’s counsel P. Vijendran told the court that the certificates of vending were yet to be issued and that was the primary reason for problems faced by the vendors. He said the town vending committees are supposed to issue the certificates to individual vendors. The certificates provide a statutory protection to the vendors, the petitioner’s counsel said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/when-will-street-vendors-get-certificates-high-court-asks-corpn/article35692240.ece

Officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said they had been in talks with the State government for a few weeks now to get approval and start this facility at the earliest because those heading to Middle Eastern countries must have a test report. “We recently got the nod from the State government to set this up. We have spoken to the company which is in the process of gathering resources and equipment to start the facility. There are a few logistic issues, and it will be ironed out by the end of this week. We will begin by next week,” an official said. Any passenger from India entering Dubai should take the rapid RT-PCR test four hours before departure. Making sure that the facility is available for passengers is crucial for the airport because there are hundreds travelling to Middle Eastern countries. “Right now, we mostly have people arriving from destinations like Dubai, Kuwait and Abu Dhabhi but if we have this facility, airlines may resume some select flights which will help passengers,” he added. Airports in Kochi and Bengaluru have already set up rapid test facilities. “The tariff has not been decided yet. It may cost around Rs. 3,000-Rs. 4,000, and will be finalised soon,” he added. Right now, the airport has a lab for conducting RT-PCR tests on international passengers for Rs. 900, and they get the results in about 4-5 hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rapid-rt-pcr-test-lab-by-next-week-at-airport/article35692251.ece

Panneerselvam on Monday came down heavily on the State Transport Corporations for charging bus fare from men passengers higher than the government-prescribed level. Pointing out that this was against the order of the State government, Mr. Panneerselvam, in a statement, suspected that the “excess charge” was being collected to compensate for the loss of revenue that the corporations would be suffering on account of free bus travel to all working women and girls pursuing higher education on government buses in cities. Even though the scheme covered the travel only on bus services within cities, it was being followed in suburban bus services too and the amount, which was double the ordinary fare, was being collected from male passengers, he charged. Such violation of rules were being reported rampantly in the routes being operated from Tiruvallur to Uthukottai, Periyapalayam, Ramancheri, Kanchipadi, Thiruvalangadu and Sriperumpudur.

People who travelled on private vehicles were asked for e-registration details at all major checkposts. Swab samples of passengers who did not carry RT-PCR negative report or complete vaccination certificate were taken at checkposts, including Walayar. A police officer said that goods carriers were allowed to enter the district after screening the temperature of the crew at Walayar. While goods carriers were routed through the main road of the highway, private vehicles including cars and two-wheelers were checked at the checkpost on the service road. However, checking of e-registration and COVID-19 negative report/complete vaccination certificate were not followed for hundreds of people who travelled up to Walayar checkpost on buses and crossed the border by foot. The staff screened their temperature alone before allowing them to board buses to Coimbatore. Officials whom The Hindu contacted did not comment why bus passengers were not asked for e-registration and COVID-19 negative report/complete vaccination certificate. District Collector G.S.

03 August 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||CBSE students, parents demand revision in Class XII marks||A few students of a CBSE school here and their parents on Monday petitioned the district administration seeking revision in Class XII marks. In their petition to the Collector, they said the students were awarded low marks. Their inquiries with the school authorities had revealed that the school was forced to reduce the marks following instructions from the Central Board of Secondary Education. The parents claimed that the authorities told them that the Board had asked the school to reduce marks in core subjects – mathematics, physics and chemistry – and compensate the reduction in English and biology. The authorities also told them that the Board had directed the school to keep the marks on a par with what the students of the previous Class XII batches had received. If this was the case, it was quite unfair as the school and Board ought to have awarded students based on their Class X, Class XI and the internal marks in Class XII and not based on what students of other batches had scored. They were at a loss to understand who to approach – the school or the Board. The district administration should intervene on the students’ behalf and take up the issue with the Board, the parents said in their petition. The marks awarded could spoil the students’ dream of getting admission to professional courses, they added. Plea to resume business Street vendors doing business on car streets around the Ranganathar Temple in Karamdai on Monday petitioned the district administration demanding that they be permitted to resume business. The vendors said that under political influence, around 1,000 of them were forced out of the car streets. There was no prior intimation from the Karamdai Town Panchayat officials to remove their goods, they said. They were doing business on streets that were not crowded and evicting them was against law. They had always cooperated with the authorities by moving out their business during festival seasons, the vendors said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cbse-students-parents-demand-revision-in-class-xii-marks/article35692267.ece

In a letter to Minister for Health and Family Welfare Ma. Subramanian, Mr. Subbarayan said the hospital at present functioned as an exclusive COVID-19 treatment centre and people from many districts utilise the service. The hospital is located on 200 acres and upgrading it would serve the people better. The services of 200 workers, including housekeeping and guards, were outsourced from April 17, 2020. The private company that recruited them should pay them Rs. 490 a day. But, the workers were paid less than Rs. 300 a day and there was delay in payment of wages. The letter said that after the intervention of the district administration, the company agreed to pay Rs. 490 a day. But, it failed to implement the revised wages so far, the letter said. The letter said that the Government Order (2D) No: 24 dated March 2, 2018 had fixed Rs. 625 a day as minimum wages for workers in hospitals. The order should be modified so that contract workers also got the minimum wage. The letter also said that Provident Fund and ESI detected from the workers’ wages were yet to be deposited to their account.

03 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Armed patrol units get body cameras||Stepping up its drive against rowdyism and gang rivalry, Madurai city police have provided body cameras to 32 armed patrol teams involved in curbing daytime movement of armed gangsters. The armed police patrol teams with vehicles have been deployed to keep close surveillance on the activities of rowdy elements and to curtail their illegal activities. Commissioner of Police Prem Anand Sinha says the armed patrol teams have been successful in ‘area domination’ and maintaining a tab on the movement of gangsters. Ever since the special two-wheeler patrol was introduced in areas identified as prone to movement of rowdy elements plotting to take revenge on rivals, the number of hurt and attempt to murder cases have come down. “To further make the role of armed police personnel more transparent, the bike riders have been provided with body-worn cameras. Whenever, there is movement of suspects, or some untoward incident takes place, the rider will switch on the camera that will record the incident. The video clipping can be used as evidence for police investigation,” Mr. Sinha contends. The city police have registered cases against 144 rowdy elements and legal action has been initiated against them in July. Further, action under Section 110 Cr.PC was initiated against 232 rowdy elements and crime offenders involved in various criminal offences to ensure their good conduct and bonds were obtained from them. Twenty-three offenders, who violated bond conditions, have been remanded to judicial custody for getting involved in criminal acts. During the last month, notorious rowdy elements such as Murugan alias ‘Load’ Murugan, Kaleeswaran and ‘Glamour’ Kali, Kannan alias ‘Kuttai’ Kannan, Kanakkan alias Muniyasamy, Muthuramalingam alias ‘Kurangu’ Muthuramalingam and Kaleeswaran have been arrested and remanded. Seven rowdies have been detained under the Goondas Act in July and 44 till date this year. A total of 771.47 kg of ganja has been seized during this year including last month’s seizure of 52.435 kg. The Commissioner of Police warns of stern action against rowdy elements and those indulging in illegal activities in the City.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/armed-patrol-units-get-body-cameras/article35692617.ece

It is the statutory duty of the local body to ensure that the area was free from encroachments. If action was not initiated by the authorities, then the court could presume that there was some agenda for not taking action, a Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi observed. The court was hearing a petition filed by V.S. Veeraputhran of Sankarankoil. The petitioner said there were encroachments on Railway Feeder Road in Sankarankoil and authorities should take action to remove them. Perusing the photographs submitted, the judges observed that prima facie the images showed petty shops on the pathway and on a water channel and wondered why the municipality had not taken any action. If the petty shops were selling eatables, it would lead to spread of disease as the area appeared to be unhygienic. Therefore, the municipal authorities should conduct an inspection and remove the temporary stalls or shops forthwit, they said. The petition was disposed of with the direction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/remove-encroachments-hc-tells-municipality/article35692622.ece

A Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi has observed that micro compost centres are the need of the hour. Therefore, they must be established to keep the environment clean. At the same time, the court cannot close its eyes to the action of authorities obliterating the waterbody and reducing the catchment area. It is the duty of the State to protect the water body. The court also took note of the fact that steps have been taken by the government permitting the alienation of the water body in favour of Tamil Nadu Industrial Investment Corporation for construction of Sivakasi Branch office. It is not clear as to whether the Corporation has constructed the branch office. If it has not been constructed, it is time for the government to rethink and reverse its decision. But, if it has been constructed, all that the court can do is to lament the alienation of the water body. The court directed Sivakasi municipality to ensure that a pucca compound wall with adequate revetment is constructed around the centre so that no part of any leachate from the garbage shifted to the centre for segregation gets drained. The municipality shall also ensure that the waterbody is thoroughly cleaned and the encroachments are removed, if there are channels that lead to the water body that may bring water when the dams are opened during the rainy season. The court was hearing a petition filed by C.T. Anand of Sivakasi, Virudhunagar district. He sought a direction to the authorities to protect and restore the Velayudhan oorani in Sivakasi in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-directs-sivakasi-civic-body-to-protect-waterbody/article35692418.ece
03 August 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Plea seeking patta for forest land in Sivaganga district dismissed||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has dismissed a batch of petitions filed by residents of Mithiravayal and Monnani villages in Sivaganga district seeking patta for land that comes under the control of Forest Department. A Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi said the petitioners claimed that since the time of their forefathers, for a period of 75 years, they were carrying out agricultural activities in the land that was indisputably reserved forest area. Though such claims had been made by the petitioners, not a single scrap of paper was produced before the court to at least prima facie show that the villagers and their forefathers had been cultivating the land for 75 years, the court said. The judges observed that the reason why the petitioners would contend that they and their forefathers were cultivating the land for 75 years was to bring themselves within the definition of ‘other traditional forest dwellers’ as per the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights), Act, 2006. The ‘other traditional forest dwellers’ had been defined to mean any member or community who had for the last three generations prior to December 13, 2005 primarily resided in and depended on forest or forest land for bona fide livelihood needs. The claim made for patta for a land that was a wildlife sanctuary was thoroughly misconceived. As per the direction of the Supreme Court, if the area had been classified as forest, no patta could be granted. And if there were encroachments, they had to be removed. That apart, land classified as forest poramboke had to be used only for forestry purposes, the Division Bench added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-seeking-patta-for-forest-land-dismissed/article35692407.ece
03 August 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Smoking tops list of risk factors for lung cancer, says oncologist||Pulmonologists are calling to attention the risk factors for lung cancer given the spike in the number of cases among smokers. On the occasion of World Lung Cancer Day, alarm bells are being sounded to make people aware of the fact that the risk of lung cancer is 24 to 36 times higher in smokers than in non-smokers. In India, lung cancer is the most common form of the disease and causes the highest number of deaths. Long-term active smoking and long exposure to environmental carcinogens the risk of developing it increases manifold. ‘Red signals’ According to Krishnakumar Rathnam, senior consultant, Medical Oncology, Meenakshi Mission Hospital & Research Centre, lungs can be damaged even in women, who are mostly passive smokers. Hence, all should be alert to red signals of affected lungs. The most obvious associated symptoms are persistent cough despite medication, blood in sputum, shortness of breath during exertion, change in voice tonality and excess unintentional loss of weight. Most of these symptoms remain dormant for a long time and patients tend to approach a doctor only after it becomes painful due to spread in bones and other organs. In India, where tuberculosis is endemic, it becomes difficult to distinguish the symptoms and that causes further delay in diagnosis and treament, Dr. Rathnam warns. Whereas a timely intervention with a tissue biopsy through bronchoscopy or scan guidance can help in early detection and treatment for disease control. The oncologist advises mandatory low dose CT scan for smokers once a year to detect any early patches of lung cancer. “But there is no better alternative to quitting smoking at any stage of life to save yourself from this killer disease,” Dr. Rathnam points out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/smoking-tops-list-of-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer-says-oncologist/article35692623.ece
03 August 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||HC Bench directs RPO to re-issue passport to child||Bringing relief to the father of a girl, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the Regional Passport Officer here to consider the application and re-issue the passport to her. Authorities had asked the father, residing in Madurai, to surrender her passport and attend an inquiry as it was not mentioned that the child was adopted. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh took note of the fact that a proper procedure was followed with regard to adoption of the child. The adoption was made from a recognised agency and the competent court had also passed an order recognising the adoption, and the deed was executed before the Sub-Registrar. Based on the court order and after complying with conditions, an application was submitted to authorities and a birth certificate was issued. By virtue of the birth certificate, the parents would have to be treated almost like natural parents and it was not necessary for them to keep announcing to the world that they were adoptive parents, the judge said. The court also took note of the petitioner’s submission that there was no separate column in the application form to declare whether the child was a natural child or adopted. The judge said that in such a case it could not be said that the fact was suppressed in the earlier application. Under these circumstances, the court was told that some misunderstanding between the parents resulted in dissolution of the marriage. The father was the guardian and the child was in his custody. The court observed that no one had complained that the parents acted against the welfare of the child. The passport officer should not have taken the pain to inquire into the issue of the welfare of the child. It was enough if the officer scrutinised the available records. It was not necessary that for every development that would take place in the future, the parents had to knock at the doors of the court, the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-bench-directs-rpo-to-re-issue-passport-to-child/article35692615.ece

Aneesh Sekhar to the Flower Market at Mattuthavani on Monday brought to the fore serious violations of COVID-19 precautionary norms.

Besides, social distancing was not being maintained as people crowded the various shops at the market. At the end of his inspection, Dr. Sekhar ordered closure of the flower market and shifting of wholesale shops to Omni bus stand where they would be scattered.

03 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||A moment of pride for sons of illustrious fathers||The solemn function commemorating 100 years of the Tamil Nadu legislature on Monday was also an occasion that marked a distinct privilege for Chief Minister M.K. Stalin and Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan. It was a special moment for both, as their fathers, too, held seats of importance and stature many years ago, which coincided with the landmark jubilee celebrations of the State legislature. In 1971, when the State legislature celebrated its golden jubilee, Mr. Stalin’s father, M. Karunanidhi, was the Chief Minister. In 1997, when Karunanidhi was Chief Minister, the diamond jubilee celebrations of the Assembly and platinum jubilee celebrations of the State legislature were held. Soaking in similar importance was Mr. Thiaga Rajan. In the 75th year of the State legislature in 1997, his father, P.T.R. Palanivel Rajan, was a DMK legislator, who also served as Speaker from 1996 to 2001. “To be a part of the centenary year is a happy moment for me,” Mr. Thiaga Rajan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-moment-of-pride-for-sons-of-illustrious-fathers/article35692230.ece

Kalaichelvan, 33, was steering a mechanised boat with nine others on board, about 42 nautical miles off Kodiakarai, when a bullet grazed past his head, according to sources in the Fisheries Department. As Mr. Kalaichelvan fell unconscious with bleeding injuries, the fishing team turned back and reached the State’s coast in the early hours of Monday. He was admitted to the Nagapattinam Government Hospital, and is said to be out of danger. District Collector Arun Thamburaj visited Mr. Kalaichelvan at hospital. He said a report into the firing incident would be submitted to the government. PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss said India should summon the Sri Lankan Ambassador to condemn the attack on Tamil fishermen. “In the past month alone, there have been seven attacks on Tamil fishermen. The losses they face due to the destruction of their nets and boats by the Sri Lankan Navy would amount to a few lakhs. Yet, the Centre and the State government are not condemning these attacks. Therefore, the Sri Lankan Navy is emboldened,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fisherman-injured-in-sri-lankan-navy-firing/article35692227.ece

03 August 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Rangasamy remains Puducherry’s poster boy of competitive populism||For those accustomed to the poster mania that surfaces in the city during the run-up to the birthday celebrations of N. Rangasamy, who turns 71 on Wednesday in his record fourth stint as Puducherry Chief Minister, the appearance of a reference to filmmaker Pa. Ranjith’s OTT release Sarpatta Parambarai this year was a no-brainer. Sure enough, one of the posters features Mr. Rangasamy in a boxing ring in the place of the hero of the film, played by Arya, alongside his mentor and inspiration, K. Kamaraj, former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Over the years, more so when he occupied the Chief Minister’s chair, leaders and cadres of the AINRC, a party he founded, have gone to great lengths to display their loyalty in the form of huge banners, cut-outs and hoardings. In the past, the wall-life version of the man they call Makkal Mudhalvar has featured him in the league of Barack Obama, Roger Federer (a nod to Mr. Rangasamy’s routine of playing a set or two at the Gorimedu grounds) or in the avatar of films such as Baahubali and Kabali. This time, the larger-than-life avatars also include that of “Krishna” in the iconic moment in the Kurukshetra battleground from the Mahabharata. In fact, over-zealous loyalists have not spared the Bay of Bengal either putting up posters on wooden pillars off-shore. Citizens are hardly amused at the scale of hero worship and the attendant disfigurement of public spaces in flagrant violation of the Puducherry Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act, 2000. “As a responsible Chief Minister, as I am sure he is, we expect him to honour the ban on posters,” said Sunaina Mandeen, a resident of Kurussukuppam. “The minimum thing required in any society is implementation of the rule of law. Whether it is disfigurement of public spaces or implementing the ban on plastic, the will has to come right from the top,” she said. Puducherry Municipality officials say that the rules had been framed granting exemptions with clearance from the civic body but concede that violations are common. “Any move from our side to crack down on the violations can potentially trigger a law and order issue. From the perspective of finding a sustainable solution, we are mooting an all-party meeting to sensitise stakeholders on the issue and evolve a consensus on voluntarily ending this practice that mars the dignity and the beauty of the city,” an official said. Observers say it will be amiss to dismiss the phenomena as a product of astroturfing as the veteran is one of the few to enjoy a cult status among followers, especially in the Thattanchavady-Indira Nagar belt. “This celebration overdrive is disconnected from the image of simplicity and austerity around Mr. Rangasamy’s demeanour and lifestyle,” said V. Selvam, social scientist. “The very fact that he enjoys such popularity and stature also bestows on him a special responsibility to set an example for his followers. Given the circumstances of the pandemic and a tottering local economy, we would have expected him to instruct his followers to scale back celebrations,” he said. Appeal to followers Meanwhile, AINRC Secretary N.S.J. Jayabal on Monday issued an appeal to followers to not to visit Mr. Rangasamy’s house on his birthday as he would not be in town. The appeal was made to prevent crowding in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This celebration overdrive is disconnected from the image of simplicity around Mr. Rangasamy’s demeanour and lifestyle V.

03 August 2021||RAMANATHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Record collection of Olive Ridley eggs this year||The COVID-19 pandemic may have taken a toll on humans but it has helped to revive marine life to a great extent, according to the coastal line forest rangers in Ramanathapuram district. A record number of 19,667 Olive Ridley eggs were collected from the Mandapam range alone this season as against 5,433 eggs collected in 2020. Due to heavy rains, high winds, tides and water current during the nesting season between December 2019 to May 2020, the egg collection was low last year, according to the Mandapam Forest Range Officer G. Venkatesh. Favourable climatic conditions, reduced fishing activity due to COVID lockdown, minimum disturbance in the marine ecosystem and increased awareness among fisherfolk on sea turtle conservation attributed to the spike in laying and collection of eggs during the corresponding period this year, he said. The eggs were collected from 176 nests along the 25-km stretch between Arichalmunai and Dhanushkodi and hatched at the MR Chathiram and Paradi hatcheries. This year's nesting season started in January. It takes 48 to 55 days for the eggs to hatch. The last batch of 200 newly born Olive Ridley turtles were released into the sea last month. In Thoothukudi and Keelakarai range, 1,960 and 1,054 eggs were collected respectively, adding to a total collection of 22,681 eggs in the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park this year. It was last in 2017, when 26,017 eggs were collected in the region but in the following years, the numbers dropped due to shoreline armouring done to prevent sand erosion and protest coastal properties. In the last four years, the district administration along with the wildlife range staff, local fishers and voluntary turtle watchers took care not to rob the sea turtles of their nesting ground by removing the random rubble-mounted sea walls and making the vast sandy stretch Olive Ridley-friendly. The fishermen were also provided with Turtle Excluder Devices to prevent the animals from getting caught in the fishing nets or killed when they come to the surface for breathing. "The awareness programmes and various schemes of the government should help us to maintain or better the egg collection statistics next year," said Mr.Venkatesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/highest-record-in-collection-of-olive-ridley-eggs-this-year/article35692292.ece

When a police team noticed a lorry parked in front of a house in Moolikulam near Puliyangudi around midnight, it started monitoring the vehicle from a distance. As the lorry driver and a few others started unloading bags from the vehicle and stocking them in the house, the police surrounded them. While the lorry driver was identified as Nataraj, 45, from Salem, the person who had taken on lease the house was Sengan, 50, of Moolikulam. Others were Muthukumar, 32, and Durai, 42, from Kadayanallur, who had come there to buy the tobacco products, and lorry cleaner Govindaraj, 22, of Salem. During interrogation, the police came to know that Sengan, the mastermind behind this illegal lucrative business, had taken on lease the house to stock them and was running this illegal business for the past several years to make huge money. He had brought it from Salem to be stocked at his village of Moolikulam and sell it to his customers from various parts of Tenkasi district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tobacco-products-seized/article35692408.ece

Sivankutty rose to reply to questions. Members of the Congress-led UDF shouted slogans against the Minister and displayed banners and placards. Mr. Sivankutty has been facing demands for resignation after the Supreme Court rejected the State government’s plea to withdraw the criminal case against him and other Left Democratic Front (LDF) MLAs in connection with the vandalism inside the Assembly in March 2015. Though the UDF had been pressing for the resignation of Mr. Sivankutty, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan categorically rejected it earlier. Peaceful start The Question Hour had got off to a peaceful start at 9 a.m. with Minister for Ports Ahammad Devarkovil replying to questions on the status of ports in the State. Mr. Sivankutty was scheduled to reply to the questions next on digital education tools for students.

03 August 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||MBCs oppose 10.50% reservation for Vanniyars||Opposing the Tamil Nadu Government’s decision to give 10.50% reservation for Vanniyar community in education and employment, a group of people from Most Backward Communities submitted petition in the Collectorate on Monday. A group of petitioners said the 10.50% reservation given to a particular community without considering the welfare of 114 other communities would deny them the due reservation in education and employment of the children from their communities. Hence, the Tamil Nadu Government should reconsider the decision to give 10.50% reservation to a particular caste, they said. Another petition with similar plea was submitted by the South India Forward Bloc party, led by its Thoothukudi west district secretary Selvam. The Government should conduct caste-based census and give reservation to each caste-based community on their population. Nurses’ plea A group of nurses, who were hired temporarily when COVID-19 cases rose sharply in the district and terminated from service after the number of cases came down, submitted a petition seeking their reinstatement. They said 200 temporary nurses were hired by the Deputy Director of Public Health to serve for about 7 months during the ‘first wave’ and for 2 months during the ‘second wave’. After the number of cases came down, they were removed from service on July 15, leaving the families of 200 nurses in the lurch. Hence, the district administration should recommend to the government to make their postings permanent, they appealed. Petition submitted Members of Makkal Neethi Maiam submitted a petition seeking the conduct of ‘gram sabha’ meetings in all village panchayats on August 15 after the Collector notifying about the meeting a week in advance. Free house sites sought Seeking free house sites TMC Colony in Selvanayagapuram to the 300-odd families living there for about 60 years, a group of Thamizh Puligal cadres staged a demonstration and submitted a petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mbcs-oppose-1050-reservation-for-vanniyars/article35692409.ece
03 August 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||11,600 doses of Covaxin arrive||Around 5,000 people who had been waiting for the second dose of Covaxin were relieved as special camps to administer the vaccine have been under way over the last few days. On Tuesday too, camps to administer Covaxin have been planned. A consignment of 11,600 doses of Covaxin was delivered to Tiruchi on Monday evening, following which it was distributed among Tiruchi city and the rural parts. A total of 4,000 doses would be administered in Tiruchi city and 7,000 in the other blocks in the district. Speaking to The Hindu , S. Ram Ganesh, Deputy Director of Health Services said that the demand was such that regardless of the number of vaccines delivered, it would be over in a day or two. “The awareness of the importance of the COVID-19 vaccine has increased. Workplaces too have begun insisting on the vaccine. Therefore, the working population, who venture outdoors to earn a living are all taking the jab,” he said. A doctor attached to the health department in the district said that as the number of COVID-19 cases began to dip, the public became complacent. “Now that they are being informed of another wave, they are rushing to get the vaccine,” they said. Vaccine hesitancy continues to be an issue in the peripheral villages around Tiruchi city, they added. “In the city, we targetted groups such as vendors, barbers, etc and told them that they would not be allowed to conduct their businesses otherwise,” they said. It is the working population who would be carriers and spreaders of the infection, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/11600-doses-of-covaxin-arrive/article35692385.ece
03 August 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Headway in Defence land transfer issue||Defence authorities are said to have indicated that they would be agreeable to accept monetary compensation or equal value infrastructure (EVI) in lieu of the land sought by the Highways Department to complete the multi-level road overbridge (ROB) near the Railway Junction in the city The Defence authorities have rejected as “unsuitable” the district administration’s offer to provide land of equal value at the adjacent Tamil Nadu Special Police (TSP) Battalion grounds in exchange for the 65 cents of land sought by the Highways Department to complete the ROB, official sources here said. However, they have agreed to the Highways Department suggestion to delink the transfer of land required for the road over bridge (ROB) from proposals seeking Defence lands for other infrastructure projects in the State as only a small portion of land is being sought for the Tiruchi ROB. A decision to this effect was reached at a recent high level meeting between the Ministry of Defence and State government officials, the sources added. With this, the Defence Estates Officer would have to indicate whether they would accept the monetary compensation or EVI. Either way, the Highways Department would only be required to pay monetary compensation. “Even if they opt for EVI, we can not directly build a new structure that may be sought by the Defence authorities. We would have to deposit the value of such structure with the Military Engineer Services, which takes up such constructions for the Armed Forces,” the sources said. Paying compensation would not be an issue as the State government has already sanctioned about Rs. 5.45 crore for land acquisition. “It is good that the Defence authorities have agreed to delink the trasfer of land required for this project from proposals seeking Defence lands for other infrastructure projects in the State. We will pay compensation as soon as the order from the Defence authorities (indicating their preference) is received,” the sources added. Construction of the overbridge remains suspended for more than two years now following the stalemate over the transfer of the Defence land for the project. Nearly 90% of the first stage of the project has been completed but for the Chennai arm of the bridge, which needs to be connected to a new approach road to be laid across a piece of Defence land. The Chennai arm is the final segment of the first stage of the project. Only upon getting the piece of about 65 cents of land that the first stage of the multi-level bridge, which is planned to be built in two stages, can be completed. The old narrow bridge would have to be dismantled for the construction of second stage of project. The first stage of the bridge was scheduled to be completed by February 2017 and the second by 2019. The project, however, has been delayed due to land acquisition issues.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/headway-in-defence-land-transfer-issue/article35692399.ece
03 August 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||AUT to hold demo on Aug. 5||The Association of University Teachers (AUT) has sought mitigation of the plight of guest lecturers and non-teaching staff in 10 erstwhile constituent units of Bharathidasan University, which have been converted into government arts and science colleges. These staff have not received their salaries from the month of May onwards. The salary dues of 363 guest lecturers, 205 teachers appointed on part-time basis, and 51 teachers appointed through parent-teacher associations, besides the 90 non-teaching staff must be settled either by the State Government or Bharathidasan University, K. Raja, Secretary of AUT Zone - V - Tiruchi, said. Espousing the their cause, the AUT has planned a demonstration on August 5. Since the government had already conveyed that the amount spent by the university for payment of salary to the guest lecturers and non-teaching staff will be reimbursed, it was unfair on the part of the university to withhold the salaries for the months of May, June and July, Prof. Raja said, emphasising that the State Government must issue an order for payment of pending salaries. It was unfortunate that though the workload was the same for guest lecturers, part-time teachers and those appointed by parent-teacher organisations, there were variations in their salaries. The three categories of teachers must be given equal treatment and be paid Rs. 20,000 per month as had been decided by the Government. The AUT will conduct its demonstration with the permission of police department and in compliance with COVID-19 safety protocol, Prof. Raja said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aut-to-hold-demo-on-aug-5/article35692752.ece
03 August 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||‘Allow transportation of sand by bullock carts’||Members of the Tamil Nadu Vivasayigalin Manal Maatu Vandi Thozhilalargal Sangam staged a demonstration here on Monday urging the district administration to allow lifting of sand and their transportation through bullock carts and to direct the officials concerned to reopen the sand quarries at Thalakudi and Madhavaperumal villages in the district. Around 300 members of the association led by their president C. Manikandan assembled at the Collectorate where they staged the demonstration for about 30 minutes, said the police. Mr. Manikandan said lifting of sand and their transportation through bullock carts from the quarries created exclusively for this purpose at Thalakudi and Madhavaperumal were stopped for the past three months citing COVID-19 pandemic. This had caused severe hardship to the association members who were dependent on this activity for their livelihood. The district administration should take necessary steps to reopen the quarries and permit lifting of sand and their transportation through bullock carts to ensure the livelihood of the association members, he further said. A petition containing these demands was submitted to the Collector, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/allow-transportation-of-sand-by-bullock-carts/article35692391.ece

03 August 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Travellers from Kerala tested for COVID-19||The district administration, by creating all medical facilities, is fully prepared to face and neutralise the speculated COVID-19 ‘third wave,’ Collector V. Vishnu has said. During an informal chat with the reporters here on Monday after inspecting the lifting of samples from the travellers entering the district by train from Kerala at Tirunelveli Railway Junction, Mr. Vishnu said passengers coming from the neighbouring State had to undergo the test for COVID-19 if they had symptoms as mandated by the Tamil Nadu Government as Kerala was witnessing a spike in the number of fresh cases. After lifting the samples, all information about these passengers had been collected for taking appropriate action based on the outcome of the results. Informing that more than 3,000 tests were being conducted every day, the Collector said arrangements had been taken to conduct COVID-19 test for all passengers coming from Kerala instead of testing them based on symptoms. The ‘COVID War Room,’ which was established at the Collectorate to coordinate all ongoing anti-COVID operations across the district, was still functioning round the clock even though the number of fresh cases had subsided. Even as the COVID Care Centres had been kept ready to receive any number of patients during the anticipated ‘third wave’, the district administration had formed officials drawn from various departments to monitor the situation, which was very much under control as of now. “The district did not have any medical-grade oxygen plant till the ‘second wave’ and had to rely on the oxygen being brought to the district from other sources. Now, the district has got sufficient number of oxygen generators which will meet the district’s demand for medical-grade oxygen even if the speculated ‘third wave’ strikes,” Mr. Vishnu said. The Collector said more than 3.57 lakh people in the district had received the vaccines. The Collector earlier flagged off a COVID-19 awareness vehicle at the Collectorate and took a look at the COVID-19 awareness rangoli drawn by the employees of ‘Mahalir Thittam’ Department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/travellers-from-kerala-tested-for-covid-19/article35692413.ece

Following instructions from the Tamil Nadu Government, the district administration, in the wake of sudden spike in the number fresh COVID-19 cases, announced on last Saturday that the devotees would not be allowed till August 9 to offer ‘Aadi pooram’ prayers in Sri Nellaiyappar – Gandhimathi Ambal Temple and ‘Aadi amaavaasya’ prayers in Sorimuthu Ayyanar Temple, Papanasa Swami Temple and along the Tamirabharani watercourse in memory of the ancestors.

After the police held talks with them, 5 of their representatives were allowed to submit the petition to Collector V. Vishnu. Mr. Jayakumar, after submitting the petition, said the protest was withdrawn after the Collector assured them that there would be no ban on devotees offering prayers in smaller temples while the ban would continue in the Sri Nellaiyappar – Gandhimathi Ambal Temple, Sorimuthu Ayyanar Temple and Papanasa Swami Temple till August 9.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hm-cadre-stage-dharna/article35692763.ece

The elephant was put inside a “kraal” (shelter used to train elephants) at Vazhaithottam in the buffer zone of the MTR on May 5 after it was found to have got habituated to humans and forest staff. Forest department officials had initially remained non-committal on whether Rivaldo would be freed from captivity, insisting that the elephant required medical treatment and would not be able to survive in the wild if freed. However, after opposition from wildlife and animal welfare activists, including BJP MP Maneka Gandhi, an expert committee was formed to look into whether the elephant could be released back into the wild. Based on the recommendations of the committee members, and after discussions among department officials in MTR, Chief Wildlife Warden, Shekhar Kumar Niraj, Principal Secretary (Environment and Forests), and the State government, it was decided to release Rivaldo back into the wild. On Monday, a radio-collared Rivaldo was put on to a specially-designed truck and taken to an interior region in the core area of the tiger reserve and released. After the release, Supriya Sahu, Principal Secretary (Environment and Forests) told reporters that this was the first time that an elephant was being released back into the wild in Tamil Nadu. “Rivaldo is a wild elephant, and he deserves to have a chance of living out in the wild,” said Ms. Sahu. “This was a very challenging exercise, which began at 3 a.m in the morning. Rivaldo was transported 34 km on the truck with veterinarians and staff monitoring the situation, and released beyond Upper Kargudi,” she added. Ms. Sahu said the radio-collar would provide the location of the elephant to Forest department staff at all times, and thereby help in ensuring that Rivaldo did not stray close to human habitations. A control room has been set up in Theppakadu where the location of Rivaldo will be updated every hour, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rivaldo-released-into-the-wild-in-mudumalai-tiger-reserve/article35692256.ece

03 August 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Govt. warns insurance firm of penalty if cashless treatment is not delivered||The Tamil Nadu government has warned United India Insurance Company (UIIC) that it will invoke a penalty clause if the firm fails to instruct all hospitals empanelled under the New Health Insurance Scheme 2018 to ensure cashless treatment for pensioners/family pensioners. Under the scheme, healthcare assistance up to Rs. 4 lakh is provided to beneficiaries on a cashless basis for a block period of four years for accredited treatments/surgeries in hospitals approved by UIIC. “Any failure to abide by the contract in service delivery will invite the penalty clause, and the amount will be recovered from UIIC and settled with the beneficiaries,” Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Finance, S. Krishnan said in a letter to the Divisional Manager of UIIC, Chennai. The warning comes in the wake of complaints from the State president of the Tamil Nadu Retired Officials’ Association regarding the implementation of NHIS. Empanelled hospitals were seeking large sums of money for providing treatment, and refused to admit pensioners/family pensioners, the association alleged. It requested the government to issue suitable orders to UIIC and empanelled hospitals to provide cashless treatment to patients without any hassle. Mr. Krishnan recalled that instances of empanelled hospitals insisting on payments over and above the insurance claim from the enrolled beneficiaries had also been brought to the notice of the government. ‘Not invoked so far’ Besides, the hospitals also refused to implement cashless treatment, leading to pensioners having to pay the entire amount in view of the emergency, he said. “Though there is a provision of the penalty clause in the agreement executed between the State government and UIIC under NHIS 2018, the State government has not invoked the same so far,” the Additional Chief Secretary said. As per Clause 22 (1) of the guidelines for the implementation of NHIS 2018 for pensioners/family pensioners, it is indicated that in case of deficiency in services or failure to provide services as required by the terms of the scheme, a penalty will be levied, as may be determined by the government, subject to a minimum of five times the amount of the expenditure incurred by the government or beneficiary due to non-compliance. C.E. Kannan, office-bearer of the Tamil Nadu Government Employees’ Association, said even government employees faced such hardship in availing themselves of the benefits of the insurance scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-warns-insurance-firm-of-penalty-if-cashless-treatment-is-not-delivered/article35692228.ece
03 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,TAMIL NADU||Drive away mining firms: CPI(Maoist)||The banned CPI (Maoist) has given a call for a State-wide bandh in Andhra Pradesh on August 10 in protest against the alleged illegal mining of laterite and bauxite in the Agency areas of Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts. In a letter released on Monday, Maoist AOBSZC (Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee) secretary Ganesh appealed to the tribal people in the region and people from all sections of the society to participate in the bandh and make it a success. The Maoists also urged the tribal people in the affected villages to take a militant stand and drive away the mining companies and to destroy the trucks and heavy earthmoving equipment being used for mining. They said that mining of laterite in over 121 hectares at Bhamidikaloddi village in Sarugudu panchayat of Nathavaram mandal in Visakhapatnam district had been allotted to a tribal J. Lakshmana Rao, who actually was a benami of some influential people from the plain areas. According to the Maoists, the mining lease was given in February for a period of 15 years and annually about 10 lakh cubic metres of laterite would be mined. They alleged that bauxite was being mined under the garb of laterite mining in the Yeleswaram forest range in East Godavari district. They accused the YSR Congress Party leaders of conniving with the police and the Forest Department had forming a mining mafia. Mr. Ganesh alleged that the mining company had laid a 32-foot wide road in Yeleswaram to enable trucks to carry bauxite and, in the process, had destroyed thousands of trees and caused huge ecological damage. The road was laid without obtaining permission from the authorities concerned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drive-away-mining-firms-cpimaoist/article35692083.ece
03 August 2021||August 03 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Lockdown restrictions come into force in Coimbatore district||Almost all the retail outlets in the Coimbatore city downed shutters in the evening in compliance with the new restrictions issued by the District Collector to control the spread of COVID-19. By 5 p.m., almost all the shops started asking customers to leave and were rolling down the shutters. Hotels had stopped dining service, gearing up for parcel service till 9 p.m. However, roadside tea shops, small eateries, and pushcarts selling food saw brisk business and in several tea shop,s there were crowds outside the outlets. Though hotels were permitted to offer parcel service, some eateries decided not to do so. Federation of Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sanghams appealed to the Collector to permit grocery outlets to function from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. since essential items such as milk and vegetables were sold at the shops. Coimbatore Corporation on Monday imposed Rs. 2,000 as fine on a tea shop in Race Course for violating COVID-19 safety guideline. It also removed all temporary structures in front of the shop. The day also saw the Corporation officials go around the commercial areas of the city to enforce the new restriction. Collector G.S. Sameeran had said that starting August 2 all shops barring those selling milk, vegetables and medicines should close down by 5 p.m. The announcement it appeared had not reached the shopkeepers who kept their premises open. A few of them on commercial streets adopted a wait and watch approach by keeping the shutters half-open. A few others, however, continued to serve customers as usual. The Corporation officials along with Coimbatore City Police personnel went around all the busy streets like Cross Cut Road, D.B. Road and 100 Feet Road asking the shopkeepers to shut shops. The officials said there was lack of clarity in the new guideline as it was not clear if grocery shops could be kept open beyond 5 p.m. Therefore, they allowed those grocery shops that also sold vegetables to remain open. The enforcement was lax on interior roads and in layouts as neighbourhood shops were open even after 5 p.m. The Corporation officials said Monday being the first day, they were asking the shopkeepers to fall in line with the new restriction. Starting Tuesday, they would start levying fines on shops that were kept open beyond 5 p.m. The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department said the entrance to the Padithurai (ghat) near the Perur Patteeswarar temple was closed on Monday to prevent devotees from entering. Officials said the temple was closed for devotees for three days on Sunday as part of the COVID-19 restrictions, but a few devotees were found entering the Padithurai. Following this, the HR&CE Department informed the Perur Town Panchayat staff, who closed the entrance on Monday, the officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lockdown-restrictions-come-into-force-in-coimbatore-district/article35692278.ece

Pointing out that very few political leaders were so passionate about language, Mr. Kovind said, “For him [Karunanidhi], his mother-tongue was the object of worship. Tamil, of course, is one of the greatest and the oldest languages of humankind. The whole world takes pride in its rich heritage. But it was Karunanidhi who ensured that it was granted official recognition as a classical language.” Recalling that the titan among freedom fighters C. Rajagopalachari, who was the first Indian occupant of Rashtrapati Bhavan, had graced the State Legislature, Mr. Kovind said, “His successors, too, were exemplary political leaders. Among all Rajaji’s successors, however, it is Shri Karunanidhiji who ruled the longest, and thus has left a defining stamp on Tamil Nadu.” Earlier commencing his speech with “ Vanakkam” , the President attempted a few sentences in Tamil to loud applause from the gathering. Governor Banwarilal Purohit, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin and Assembly Speaker M.

03 August 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Bommai met Deve Gowda on the instructions of BJP leadership, says Yatnal||“Janata Dal(S) leader H.D. Deve Gowda has assured Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai that the Janata Dal(S) will support his government in case the former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa were to destabilise it,’’ BJP leader and MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal said in Vijayapura on Monday. “That is why, I think that Mr. Bommai met Mr. Gowda, on the instructions of the BJP high command. That is to ensure that the government remains stable and avoid a situation where the BJP government suffers a minority,’’ Mr. Yatnal told journalists. It seems Mr. Yediyurappa chose Mr. Bommai. Now, it is his moral responsibility to support Mr. Bommai and let him function properly. Mr. Yediyurappa should not, instead, destabilise the government in his efforts to groom his son as his successor. If he does that, the people of the State will not tolerate it. The party high command does not tolerate dynasty politics, Mr. Yatnal said. “I want to tell Mr. Yediyurappa that he should gracefully retire and spend his time playing with his grandchildren at home. The BJP high command has given him a clear signal. He should understand that,’’ he said. “Mr. Yediyurappa has built the party by going on cycle jathas across the State. Now, he is in a position to fly around in his private helicopter. He should retire from active politics now,” he said. “My leaders had asked me not to make statements in public. I have gone by their advice. I don’t aspire to be a Minister. But if the high command makes me a Minister, I will handle it. In fact, I have all the capabilities of managing the State as the Chief Minister. My abilities are not being used. If my talents are utilised, the party will get 150 seats in the next polls,” he said. Mr. Yatnal also said that Mr. Yediyurappa had created obstacles in the way of him becoming the Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bommai-met-deve-gowda-on-the-instructions-of-bjp-leadership-says-yatnal/article35692466.ece

Responding to a distress call, the police rushed to the tanda and rescued the victims. They are admitted in the district hospital in Vijayapura. As per a complaint registered in the Indi Police Station, Santosh Chauhan, a farm worker, tied his wife Anita and her parents Vithal Rao and Surekha to a pole and assaulted them for not giving enough dowry. Some women from his family also accompanied him in beating up the victims. Santosh Chauhan told villagers that Vithal Rao had gone back on his promise of paying him money and jewellery. The police have booked Santosh Chauhan and three of his relatives on the charge of assaulting his wife. Anita, who hails from Inchigeri in Vijayapura district, was married to Santosh Chauhan two years ago.

03 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Submit school staff vaccination data’||Declining to issue any specific direction on reopening of schools due to the possible third wave of COVID-19 being anticipated by experts, the High Court of Karnataka on Monday directed the State government to submit data of vaccination of both the teaching and non-teaching of staff working in government and aided schools. It observed that the process of vaccinating all stakeholders involved in day-to-day running of schools would help in boosting the confidence level of parents as well as staff of the schools as and when the authorities take a call on the reopening. A Division Bench comprising Justice B.V. Nagarathna and Justice P. Krishna Bhat issued the direction while hearing a PIL petition filed by Radha M. and others seeking direction to supply cooked midday meals to students. The government will have to submit by August 12 the data about thr number of teaching and non-teaching staff vaccinated so far. Referring to media reports on a possible third wave of COVID-19 being anticipated by the experts, the Bench orally said it would be an unpopular decision to reopen schools when the daily COVID-19 cases are rising again and there are indications of a weekend lockdown. When the counsel for petitioner pointed out that the government has not yet decided on reopening of schools based on the report of special committee as was informed during the earlier hearing, the Bench sought to know which parent would sent their children to schools now. Stating that the court cannot issue direction to the government to reopen schools, the Bench said that it is for the government to decide based on the advice of the experts while also pointing out that even the recommendations given by experts a week ago may not be applicable now in the fast-changing COVID-19 scenario. The Bench also observed orally that the government needed more time to decide on reopening of schools due to the present fluid situation while also pointing out the absence of a Council of Ministers and a Minister for Education as the new Chief Minister assumed office only a few days ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/submit-school-staff-vaccination-data/article35692181.ece
03 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BJP set to finalise ministerial list today||The countdown has begun for the expansion of Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai’s Cabinet as its composition is set to be finalised by the BJP high command on Tuesday. Mr. Bommai, who arrived in Delhi on Sunday night, held consultations regarding the composition of the Cabinet with party national president J.P. Nadda for more than a hour on Monday night. However, the list could not be finalised in one sitting. Mr. Bommai told reporters after the meeting that the central leaders would hold one more round of consultations on Tuesday to finalise the names, including those of Deputy Chief Ministers. “They are likely to finalise the list by Tuesday evening or night, as they will be busy with the parliamentary session during the day,” he said, adding that the central leaders themselves would announce it. “We have given them two or three lists based on different permutations and combinations on the basis of region and social representation,” he said. He said he would decide on the date of swearing in by consulting party State chief Nalin Kumar Kateel. As a prelude to his meeting with Mr. Nadda, Mr. Bommai held consultations with party national organisational general secretary B.L. Santhosh. Explaining the process involved, Mr. Bommai said the central leadership would give a final shape to the main formula regarding the Cabinet formation. “The formula mainly gives clarity on the number of phases in which the Ministry should be formed, the number of legislators to be sworn in, and regional/social representation,” he said. Mr. Bommai said he had to do a balancing act as he had to take into cognisance the earlier Ministry led by B.S. Yediyurappa and also consider regional and social representation. “Our effort is to take everyone together.” When asked if Mr. Yediyurappa’s son B.Y. Vijayendra would be part of the Cabinet, he only said the list finalised by the party high command would answer such queries. Meanwhile, lobbying for ministerial berths intensified on Monday with nearly a dozen aspirants camping in Delhi to meet the central BJP leaders. In Bengaluru, several aspirants visited Mr. Yediyurappa and appealed to him to recommend their names.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-set-to-finalise-ministerial-list-today/article35692220.ece
03 August 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Is Deve Gowda’s offer of support a hint of Bommai flexing his muscles?||The announcement by former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (S) national president H.D. Deve Gowda that his party would come to the rescue of the BJP in a time of crisis is being seen in political circles as the first indication of new Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai trying to flex his muscles. Soon after Mr. Bommai met Mr. Gowda at his residence “to take his blessings” on Sunday, the octogenarian leader declared that his party would support the BJP government if there was a crisis. The timing of the statement is crucial, just ahead of Cabinet expansion. Referring to the pulls and pressures involved in ministerial expansion, especially in the present situation marked by groupism in the BJP, a senior BJP leader said Mr. Gowda’s statement has lent strength to Mr. Bommai. “Even the remote possibility of anyone, especially some of the 17 MLAs who came to the BJP from other parties, threatening to resign if they do not get a ministerial berth has been nullified as there is an alternative support for the government,” he said. However, he maintained that the government was not facing any instability. “Though the BJP government is strong in terms of numbers, Mr. Gowda’s statement has sent out the message that there is no need for the Chief Minister to yield to pressure tactics from anyone from within the party.” His own man A few other leaders in the BJP also see Mr. Gowda’s statement as an indication that Mr. Bommai, who is being ridiculed by detractors as a “rubber stamp” Chief Minister of his mentor B.S. Yediyurappa, may come out of his predecessor’s clutches. “Mr. Gowda’s statement, despite the smooth transition of power, is obviously a message that there are bound to be troubles ahead for Mr. Bommai if he has to ignore the suggestions of Mr. Yediyurappa and follow the high command’s diktat while making major decisions such as the selection of ministerial candidates. A similar thing had happened with the then Chief Minister D. V. Sadananda Gowda, who was hand-picked by Mr. Yediyurappa himself in 2011-2012. But now, the JD(S) has assured him of ensuring political stability in such a scenario,” said a former Minister and BJP leader. “But the government may not need Mr. Gowda’s support as the statement itself would make fence sitters and Mr. Yediyurappa’s supporters desist from turning rebellious.” Meanwhile, over the past two days, Mr. Bommai has relieved from duty about 30 people appointed by Mr. Yediyurappa in key posts of the Chief Minister’s Office.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/is-deve-gowdas-offer-of-support-a-hint-of-bommai-flexing-his-muscles/article35692216.ece
03 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Gowda’s words have partymen flummoxed||It came as a surprise to his own partymen when Janata Dal (S) patriarch and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda assured support to the BJP government in case of a crisis, after newly sworn-in Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai visited him on Sunday to “seek his blessings”. For, though the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had been seen cozying up with the B.S. Yediyurappa dispensation over the past two years, the octogenarian leader had been silent on the issue, leaving to speculation the party’s stand on the BJP. “Mr. Gowda’s statement has surprised many within the party since he is not known to speak on such sensitive issues unless it helps the party,” a JD(S) source told The Hindu . Another leader said he had called on the family members to ascertain if there was anything “more than what met the eye”. One leader said that Mr. Gowda’s statement lent itself to multiple readings and it was hard to predict what was on the veteran leader’s mind. “You can see this statement as one that gives the Congress, which had in 2018 called the JD(S) the ‘B-team’ of the BJP, more fodder to criticise. On the other hand, it can also be seen as sending out a signal to Lingayats that the JD(S) is with them,” another source said. That Prime Minister Narendra Modi has shown a soft spot towards Mr. Gowda over the past couple of years is known. Despite this, the JD(S) supremo had kept a low profile and had, till recently, been a rallying point for parties opposed to the BJP. However, in what seen as a change of stand by unilaterally declaring support to the BJP government in the State, Mr. Gowda’s statement is being speculated as having a larger dimension in the political spectrum. By announcing cooperation, he is not only seen as helping the BJP high command to keep former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa at bay, but is also covertly emerging as an important political player in the current times. “It is a fact that Mr. Gowda was seen as among those responsible for bringing down the government of S.R. Bommai in 1988. Why would he [Basavaraj Bommai] go to seek his blessings? Why did he not visit any other former CM?” asked Lohia Thinkers Forum president B.S. Shivanna,who was earlier associated with the Janata Parivar. “There is political manoeuvring. Having lost its true regional character, the JD(S) is trying to remain relevant.” However, another senior party leader said Sunday’s statement was situational. “Political developments depend on how the circumstances pan out. The meeting need not be over-analysed when polls are nearly two years away.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/gowdas-words-have-partymen-flummoxed/article35692218.ece
03 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Why levy property tax during lockdown?’||The owner of a mall in the city has moved the High Court of Karnataka questioning the levy and demand for payment of property tax on malls even during the lockdown when the malls were compulsorily asked to shut all their business activities. G.T. Cinemas Pvt. Ltd., Bengaluru, which has built and operating ‘G.T. World Mall’ has sought a direction to the State government and the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) not to demand and collect property tax for the period when the mall was asked to close down in view of the lockdown. Justice M. Nagaprasanna, before whom the petition came up for hearing, adjourned further hearing till August 27 after ordering issue of notice to the government and the BBMP. Meanwhile, the court granted liberty to the petitioner to move the court in the event the BBMP takes any coercive action for non-payment of property tax. The petitioner has pointed out that malls were closed in Bengaluru for 18 days in the financial year 2019-20, for 69 days in 2020-21, and 102 days during the present financial year of 2021-22. “When a property within is not even permitted to operate by the operation of law and is, therefore, compulsively shut down, the levy of a municipal tax on that property even for the period of the lockdown would be a tax that is essentially confiscatory in nature as the return from that property during the period of the lockdown would have halted completely,” the petitioner has contended while seeking a direction to the BBMP not to demand property tax for the lockdown period. When the property tax is levied on the basis of use of the land/building, the authorities cannot levy or demand property tax when they compulsorily stop such usage of building or land, the petitioner has claimed. The petitioner has said that the authorities are silent on its representation seeking exception from payment of property tax for the lockdown period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/why-levy-property-tax-during-lockdown/article35692173.ece

In a circular issued recently, Mr. Sood has said that police officers should maintain discipline and decorum while attending any programme. A police officer has the responsibility of crime prevention and maintaining law and order in the society and his action and behaviour in uniform is a reflection of the entire department and the society, Mr. Sood said . The circular came in the wake of the Hosakote PSI, C.M. Raju, celebrating his birthday and promotion at the station on June 2 with his friends, well-wishers, and the staff, while COVID-19 guidelines were in force.  The event was later circulated on social media and drew huge criticism against the police, accusing them of not practising what they enforce. “Transfers and promotion are part of the administrative procedure. It is natural for the staff to organise a formal send-off and welcome programme,” Mr. Sood said, adding that such programmes are not for the public and should be limited to the staff members . Sources said there were instances of the police participating in programmes with anti-social elements which came to the notice of Mr. Sood, prompting him to issue the set of guidelines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-private-parties-at-police-stations-sood/article35692171.ece

Manjunath said that as people are arriving via road from Kerala and Maharashtra, inspection teams have been deployed at checkposts. RT-PCR test reports from within 72 hours will be verified. In case of no RT-PCR test report, swabs will be collected for tests and travellers will remain in institutional quarantine until the report is received. He said he has already spoken to the Rural SP in this regard, and the inspection work will take place more effectively. BBMP Administrator Rakesh Singh directed officials to create awareness among people and penalise those flouting norms. The city police have been asked to heighten surveillance in the city during the night curfew between 10 p.m and 5 a.m. “Officials must ensure that rules are followed in crowded areas like markets, malls, temples, hotels and restaurants. A team of BBMP officials should work in tandem with police personnel to ensure these are followed and in case they are flouted, a fine must be imposed,” the Chief Commissioner instructed. The BBMP has been taking a number of precaution such as physical triage, contact tracing, and isolation. Areas with three or more cases are made containment zones. Third wave When asked about the third wave, he said that infrastructure put in place earlier has not been dismantled and measures, including deployment of health staff at PHCs, have been prioritised. On the demand for vaccination, he said in July, doses were not received as anticipated. He added that 62% of the eligible population has received the first dose nd 17% have received two doses. Mr. Gupta said there will be higher demand for vaccination in the coming days and he is hopeful of getting more dosages from the government. He said the BBMP has put in place infrastructure to vaccinate up to 1.5 lakh people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/institutional-quarantine-for-those-from-kerala-maharashtra-without-negative-rt-pcr-report/article35692186.ece

The protestors, most of them women, carried empty plastic pots to the Deputy Commissioner’s office to register their protest against irregular water supply. The three villages under Uppina Betageri Gram Panchayat have a population of around 20,000. The residents said that while the demand for water for these three villages was around nine lakh litres per day, only around four lakh litres, which was less than 50% of the demand, was being supplied. This apart, the drinking water supply was irregular and and the villagers are forced to create additional storage facilities to store water for 15 days. And, the water pipelines laid three decades ago were leaking at several points and water was getting contaminated, they said. The protestors complained that on several occasions, water with worms was supplied to the villages which resulted in several falling sick on different occasions. They also said that despite bringing the matter to the notice of the elected representatives and local MLA, the issue remained unresolved. The protestors then submitted a memorandum urging the district administration to look into the issue immediately, take remedial measure and also take steps to lay a new pipeline to supply drinking water to the three villages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/residents-of-three-villages-protest-against-irregular-water-supply/article35692472.ece
03 August 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||People left to fend for themselves, says ex-CM||Whether it is the floods or COVID-19, the people of Karnataka have been left to fend for themselves as BJP legislators have “deserted” them to camp in Bengaluru to lobby for ministerial berths, said Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah on Monday. The former Chief Minister was visiting flood- and rain-affected places in Uttara Kannada district. He told presspersons in Karwar that at a time when stringent measures were required to check the third wave of the pandemic and mitigate the sufferings of flood-affected people, the Chief Minister was repeatedly visiting Delhi for Cabinet formation. “All BJP legislators are camping in Bengaluru to lobby for ministerial berths. Nobody is going to their constituency to help people. For them, becoming a Minister has become more important than people’s lives,” he alleged.    Mr. Siddaramaiah said preventing a third wave of COVID-19 in Karnataka should be the primary job of the State government. “Already, the third wave has entered the neighbouring States of Maharashtra and Kerala. As the number of people visiting Karnataka from these States has increased, there is a need for strict vigil at the borders,” the Congress leader said. He also said he would not criticise Basavaraj Bommai as he had recently become the Chief Minister, but would request him to focus on resolving the problems of Karnataka. He said the government should ensure the situation does not demand the imposition of a lockdown again. “In the last two days, daily infections have been around 2,000. If the number crosses 2,000, it means that a third wave has started,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/people-left-to-fend-for-themselves-says-ex-cm/article35692213.ece

03 August 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||State-wide agitation planned on Aug. 16||Pressing for their various demands, including payment of pending wages, withdrawal of the move to launch Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme for anganwadi children and pregnant women and inquiry into allegations of corruption in egg distribution, anganwadi and mid-day meal employees will launch a State-wide strike on August 16, president of Karnataka State Anganwadi Workers Association S. Varalakshmi has said. “All anganwadi and mid-day meal employees will strike work and join the decentralised agitation that will be simultaneously held in all district headquarters on August 16. If the government doesn’t consider our demands, the employees will march to Bengaluru,” Ms. Varalakshmi, who is also honorary president of Karnataka State Midday Meal Workers Association, said at a press conference in Kalaburagi on Monday. Expressing discontent over the government’s treatment of anganwadi workers who stood in the forefront in the fight against COVID-19 at the grassroots level, the trade union leader demanded that the government pay Rs. 30 lakh compensation as promised to anganwadi workers who died while discharging their duties as Corona Warriors in the State. “As many as 35 anganwadi workers died due to work pressure and 28 more died to COVID-19 while discharging their duties during the first wave of COVID-19. As many as 29 more anganwadi workers died during the second wave of the pandemic. The government has not yet paid the compensation it promised,” she said. Referring to the allegations of corruption in the purchase of eggs meant for anganwadi children, Ms. Varalakshmi said that Vidhana Soudha is a centre of corruption. “The government is not giving money in advance for the purchase of eggs for anganwadi children and it is impossible for poor anganwadi workers to purchase eggs spending from their pockets. We had, therefore, demanded that the government itself purchase and supply eggs. The government authorities then misused the opportunity to misappropriate public money,” Ms. Varalakshmi said and demanded an inquiry into the allegations. Opposing the government’s decision to switch to Direct Benefit Transfer mode in place of providing nutritious foodgrains to pregnant and breastfeeding mothers and mid-day meals to anganwadi children, Ms. Varalakshmi said that such a move will prove to be disastrous as the beneficiaries may use the money received in their bank accounts for other purposes. “It is because of mid-day meals that many children are coming to anganwadis and are having nutritious food and getting educated. If the expenditure incurred on each student for a meal is transferred to their parents’ bank accounts instead of providing food at anganwadis, there are good chances of the money being used for other purposes. The same will be the case with pregnant women and lactating mothers. The government move for DBT will definitely defeat the very purpose of the schemes,” Ms. Varalakshmi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-wide-agitation-planned-on-aug-16/article35692468.ece
03 August 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||DK stops testing at border for people entering State||The Dakshina Kannada district administration on Monday morning stopped RT-PCR tests at 12 border checkposts, including Talapady, stating that its hands were full with containing COVID-19. Those entering the district from Kerala should bring COVID-19 negative certificates not older than 72 hours on their own, Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra said. The action led to traffic blocks and protests at Talapady on NH 66 for a while. The administration had made COVID-19 negative certificate mandatory for people from Kerala entering Karnataka even if they had taken two doses of vaccine with effect from Sunday. The test facility at Talapady was functional since February 18. Over 22,000 samples were tested with a daily average of 500 tests, according to Mangaluru Tahsildar Guruprasad. While there was a long queue of people from Kumble, Manjeshwar and other parts of Kerala to undergo testing at Talapady, the administration decided to stop the facility when about 160 were tested at around 10 a.m. “We stopped testing facility at 11 other checkposts too. We have our own challenges to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Dr. Rajendra told reporters after reviewing the situation at Talapady along with Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar. The health staff deputed at Talapady checkpost were sent to Mangaluru Central Railway Station for testing people coming by trains. The city and district police assisted by Home Guards intensified checking at Talapady and 42 other checkposts in the district. Only those with medical emergencies, goods vehicles and students attending examinations were exempted from producing the RT-PCR negative certificate. This sudden action took many by surprise. “I have already taken both doses of vaccine. I do not know why the COVID-19 negative certificate was made mandatory,” said Manjeshwar resident Dinakar Mayya. Working as a clerk with a grains merchant at Bunder here, he said that he would await instructions from his employer. Sharath S. from Kumble, an employee of a nationalised bank’s insurance wing, said that he found the test facility at Talapady convenient as he was getting reports quickly. “I have undergone RT-PCR tests thrice in the last one month,” said Mr. Sharath, who commutes by bus from Kumble to Mangaluru daily. Snap protest There was a snap protest by activists of Social Democratic Party of India and Indian Union Muslim League from Manjeshwar after the district administration stopped on-the-spot COVID-19 tests at the Talapady border. Activists protesting on the Kerala-side of NH 66 blocked movement of vehicles towards Kasaragod. The Manjeshwar Police booked a case against the activists and dispersed them. Activists of Left Democratic Youth Federation also staged a demonstration. The former president of Varkady Gram Panchayat Harshad Varkady and chairman of Manjeshwar Panchayat Saifulla Tangal said that they would hold a protest on Tuesday. One person, who was said to have been found abusing the Karnataka Police at the checkpost, was taken into custody by the Ullal Police. Additional police and district administration staff were posted for checking at the Talapady checkpost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dk-stops-testing-at-border-for-people-entering-state/article35692183.ece

A machine from Bengaluru was brought to the city on Monday for a demonstration. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) had engaged Python 5000 for pothole filling in Bengaluru and the same machine was brought to Mysuru on a request from the MCC. MCC Commissioner Lakshmikanth Reddy saidsome potholes in the city centre were filled up using the machine. “We are looking into various factors and haven’t decided anything on procuring it. We are studying the feasibility of using it and therefore wanted to see how it functions.” Mr. Reddy said the machine can fill a pothole in less than 10 minutes without the use of manual labour. It can help fill up potholes in each ward in one day. The MCC is studying all factors – how much cost it can save by employing the machine or whether manual labour works out cheaper.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/automated-pothole-filling-machine-brought-for-demonstration/article35692661.ece

The seven-member team led by veteran trekker and adventure sports enthusiast D.S.D. Solanki trekked through lush greenery, and past the crystal clear waters of streams and lakes in the backdrop of snow-capped mountain peaks for five days and four nights in Kullu region starting July 22. They braved incessant rains and cold weather, besides being stranded on the roads during their journey from Chandigarh to the base camp at Chheti in Kullu district and back. They completed their 41-km-long trek from Hampta valley to Spiti valley situated at a height of 14,100 ft. in the Pir Panjal ranges of the Himalayas. The expedition, planned after the second wave of COVID-19 began declining, initially saw an encouraging response with a total of 14 enthusiasts enrolling themselves. “But, as the departure date approached, seven of them withdrew,” said Mr. Solanki. If the pandemic was the reason for some, it was the monsoon and inclement weather for others. Some withdrew due to pressure from their respective families. But, seven trekking enthusiasts coming from diverse backgrounds packed their rucksacks and boarded the flight from Bengaluru to Chandigarh on July 21. From Chandigarh, they drove to Chheti base camp in Naggar village of Kullu district. After an acclimatisation walk on July 22, they boarded a vehicle to Jobri hydro-electric project from where they started their trek through Hampta valley to Chikka amidst maple and oak trees. “Our first camp was at Chikka, second at Balu Ka Ghera, third was at Sheagaru and fourth was Chhatru”, Mr. Solanki said. Though vaccinated with one or two doses, the trekkers maintained social distancing and other COVID-19 protocols. After reaching the summit of Mount Hampta, the trekkers culminated their trek on July 26, which was Kargil Vijay Diwas. Accompanying Mr. Solanki were Adithi R. Rao, a student of architecture; Krishna Murthy, software professional; Manjunath Nayak, entrepreneur; and Manjunath Gowda, all from Mysuru, besides Nagesh Kumar and Harish Kumar from Hassan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/adventure-in-the-mountains-amidst-rains-landslides/article35692666.ece

03 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Tourist sites, temples in Chamarajanagar to remain closed during weekends||The Chamarajanagar district administration has restricted entry of tourists to some popular destinations during weekends as a measure to contain the spread of COVID-19 in view of the alarming spike in neighbouring Kerala. Tourists wishing to stay in resorts or hotels here must carry RT-PCR negative reports not older than 72 hours to get accommodation. With fears of a possible third wave, the district administration has tightened surveillance at border checkposts. Staff have been told to deny entry to travellers from Kerala who fail to produce RT-PCR negative reports. Two doses of vaccination cannot get them entry into the State unless they get the test done and the report comes negative. According to an order issued by Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi, the wildlife safari organised by the Forest Department in the district stands cancelled during weekends to prevent rush of tourists. Barachukki and Hogenakkal waterfalls that draw a lot of tourists from Kerala and Tamil Nadu besides a lot of tourists from within the State, will also be out of bounds for tourists during weekends. The order on the curbs is applicable from August 2 to 15.Bharachukki in Chamarajnagar and Gaganachukki in Mandya district, which are twin waterfalls, come alive during the monsoon. Both the places witness heavy rush, particularly on weekends, as all roads lead to the sites for glimpsing the breathtaking waterfalls. Acting on CM’s diktat Mr. Ravi issued the order following directions from Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai who recently had a meeting with the Deputy Commissioners of districts bordering Kerala. The Chief Minister had asked the district administrations to take appropriate steps over Kerala cases. Accordingly, the district administration considered it fit to impose additional restrictions for checking the pandemic spread. As per the order, all temples will remain open only for ‘darshan’ and no rituals would be allowed. Temples, including the Sri Malai Mahadeshwara Swamy Temple on M.M. Hills, will remain open only from Monday to Friday and would remain closed for devotees during weekends until August 15. However, the temple priests can carry out daily pujas during weekends. Utsavas, services, prasada seva, ‘dasoha’ and ‘mudi’ seve have been restricted. The DC has also asked the department heads against holding programmes such as groundbreaking ceremonies, inaugurations and gatherings within their jurisdictions. The DC , accompanied by Superintendent of Police Divya Sarah Thomas and DHO Ravi, visited the border checkpost at Kekkanahalli and inspected the surveillance measures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tourist-sites-temples-in-chamarajanagar-to-remain-closed-during-weekends/article35692178.ece
03 August 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Liquor sale banned near Kerala border||Sale of liquor within a radius of 5 km in villages bordering Kerala in Kodagu has been indefinitely prohibited as part of measures taken to control the spread of COVID-19 following a spike in the neighbouring State. Deputy Commissioner Charulatha Somal on Monday issued the order banning sale of liquor in standalone outlets, bars and restaurants, clubs and hotels at Karike and Kutta villages, which are located close to the Kerala border. Two checkposts where travellers from Kerala are screened for COVID-19 are located in the villages. The DC warned of action under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, if her order was flouted. Ban in other State People from Kerala cross the border for liquor since it is banned in their State. The liquor sale ban was perhaps aimed at deterring the people from coming to Kodagu villages.

The city and district police assisted by Home Guards intensified checking at Talapady and 42 other checkposts in the district. Only those with medical emergencies, goods vehicles and students attending examinations were exempted from producing the RT-PCR negative certificate. This sudden action took many by surprise. “I have already taken both doses of vaccine. I do not know why the COVID-19 negative certificate was made mandatory,” said Manjeshwar resident Dinakar Mayya. Mr. Mayya, who is working as a clerk with a grains merchant at Bunder here, said that he would await instructions from his employer. Sharath S. from Kumble, an employee of a nationalised bank’s insurance wing, said that he found the test facility at Talapady convenient as he was getting reports quickly. “I have undergone RT-PCR tests thrice in the last one month,” said Mr. Sharath, who commutes by bus from Kumble to Mangaluru daily. Snap protest There was a snap protest by activists of Social Democratic Party of India and Indian Union Muslim League from Manjeshwar after the district administration stopped on-the-spot COVID-19 tests at the Talapady border. Activists protesting on the Kerala-side of NH 66 blocked movement of vehicles towards Kasaragod. The Manjeshwar Police booked a case against the activists and dispersed them. Activists of Left Democratic Youth Federation also staged a demonstration. The former president of Varkady Gram Panchayat Harshad Varkady and chairman of Manjeshwar Panchayat Saifulla Tangal said that they would hold a protest on Tuesday.

03 August 2021||Kalpetta,KERALA||This Wayanad planter sets a model in exotic fruits cultivation||Kuruvila Joseph, 69, of Tharappel, a progressive planter at Meppadi in Wayanad district, has set a successful model in cultivating exotic fruits such as lychee, rambutan and mangosteen. Mr. Joseph turned to exotic fruits cultivation after the massive destruction of pepper vines on his plantation a few decades ago. The low cost of cultivation and maintenance, lower incidence of pest and disease attacks comparing to pepper vines are the major advantages of fruit cultivation in the district, Mr. Joseph said. He is cultivating the fruit plants as an intercrop with coffee and cardamom. The seasonal difference in the harvest of the fruits is an added advantage to the farmers in the district. May to June is the right season for lychee harvesting in other parts of the country but the fruit becomes ready for harvest in Wayanad by the middle of December, he said. Premium price This difference would help farmers fetch a premium price for their produce, he said. As the temperate climate and fertile soil in the hill district are quite suitable for the growth of exotic fruit plants, the cultivation will help provide a sustainable income to farmers, he added. “I have planted as many as 18 lychee plants on my orchard and I am getting an average of 200 kg of fruits from each plant,” he said adding that he was getting an average of Rs. 400 a kg. Rich harvest He has also cultivated as many as 800 mangosteen plants and is getting an average of 50 kg of fruits from each 15-year-old plant. While farmers in other districts harvest the fruit from May to July, the harvest takes place in Wayanad from July to October. While ryots in other districts get Rs. 120 to Rs. 150 a kg for the fruits, farmers in Wayanad get Rs. 300 to Rs. 350 a kg owing to the seasonal difference, he said. His son Joseph K. Tharappel and his partner Maria Kidangalil sell the fruits after quality assurance under the brand Back To Roots through premium outlets of super markets in metros across the country after collecting them from farmers in the district at a premium price. Mr. Joseph is also cultivating avocado, dragon fruit and pulasan on his plantation. Longer shelf life According to him, rambutan and mangosteen are better options for farmers owing to their longer shelf life. ‘We have launched a farmer producer company named Wayanad Innovative Farmers Producing Company and we are planning to set up an exotic fruits auction centre to lend a hand to fruit farmers in the district at a later stage,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/setting-a-model-in-exotic-fruits-cultivation/article35692529.ece

There is no exemption for those who received both shots of vaccine. With the tightening of regulations, interstate bus services appear to face a crisis. Services from Kasaragod were suspended following an order not to allow buses from Kerala to enter Karnataka for a week. Services to Mangaluru, Sullia and Puthur were also suspended. Buses from Mangaluru to Kasaragod too were set to be stopped on the border. Several vehicles were held up at the border check-post, leading to blockades as the authorities allowed only those with COVID-19 negative certificates to cross over to Karnataka. Residents protest Meanwhile, local residents staged a sit-in at the Talapady check-post, which affected the movement of vehicles entering Kerala from Karnataka. The protesters demanded smooth commuting to Karnataka and without mandatory RT-PCR certificate. The Karnataka Police took into custody one person involved in the demonstration. Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra told The Hindu that the police were enforcing stringent checking on the border as per government orders since the number of COVID-19 cases had been on the rise for the past three to four days. The number of cases in Dhakshina Kannada, when compared to Bengaluru that has a larger population, touched the peak on Sunday. “We are redirecting the traffic to 12 check-posts in Karnataka where checking can be carried out properly,” said Mr. Rajendra.

03 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Roller-coaster crash barriers planned on new roads||Curves and other vulnerable spots on roads in the high ranges and beside waterbodies in Kerala will get roller-coaster crash barriers, which help avert fatal accidents by largely absorbing the impact of a crash and deflecting the out-of-control vehicle towards the road. They will be installed in areas where W-beam crash barriers or guard stones at frequent intervals are inadequate. “W-beam crash barriers prevent an out-of-control vehicle from falling off a gradient by redirecting it towards the road. Roller-coaster crash barriers are even safer, since they can absorb more shock and deflect vehicles which ram them back to the road. They also help avoid serious injuries, by considerably absorbing the shock,” said T. Elangovan, Executive Director, Kerala Road Safety Authority (KRSA). It has also been proven in States like Tamil Nadu that damage to vehicles will be lesser when roller-coaster barriers are used. They will also help avoid vehicles turning turtle in the impact of the crash. They will thus be deployed more in new and upcoming road and highway projects, it is learnt. Priority will be accorded to accident-prone areas and curves in hills. Road safety funds have been given to the Public Works Department (PWD). More areas will be covered in a phased manner, sources said. Safe corridor project W-beam crash barriers are being installed on the 80-km Kazhakoottam-Adoor stretch of MC Road under the Safe Corridor Demonstration Project. The project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the best practices in road safety on roads developed under the Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP). Apart from curves, embankments with a level difference of a metre or more than the surroundings will get crash barriers. Unique terrain Road safety expert Upendra Narayan, who founded the Indian Institute of Road Safety, said the unique terrain of Kerala needed extensive use of guard rails (also called crash barriers). “Care must be taken to provide the mandatory deep foundation and proper concreting to ensure that they can absorb the impact of vehicles. Such infra at the notorious Vattapara curve in Malappuram could have prevented a lorry falling off the road, a month ago,” he observed. While offering his services to KRSA, MVD, PWD, and other agencies, Mr. Narayan, a former car-racing driver who was associated with many accident-prevention initiatives in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, called for consultation with field-level experts while readying accident-mitigation plans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/roller-coaster-crash-barriers-planned-on-new-roads/article35692553.ece
03 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Brahmapuram scenario has worsened: SLMC||The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on solid waste management appointed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has reported that the solid waste management in the Kochi Corporation’s Brahmapuram yard is yet to conform to the standards prescribed under the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The condition of the yard has worsened owing to the onset of the south-west monsoon as per the inspection report submitted by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (PCB) on July 24. It showed heavy flow of leachate due to rains from the plastic dumping area, said the report submitted by A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai, SLMC chairman, before the tribunal on July 28, in the case related to the poor waste management scenario in Brahmapuram. It is also reported that the plastic dumping had been extended to the area where the waste-to-energy plant was proposed. “The condition of the plant has worsened since my visit to the site on March 3 this year,” he said. The committee pointed out that the segregation of waste at source had not been ensured as mixed waste continued to be dumped in the yard. Fresh waste materials brought from local bodies depending on Brahmapuram were found dumped over the existing legacy (old) waste. Dilapidated shed A major portion of the windrow composting shed was in a dilapidated condition. Rainwater has been falling over the legacy waste deposited in the damaged facility, leading to the flow of leachate into the nearby Kadambrayar river. Several hundred tonnes of legacy waste were seen accumulated inside and outside the windrow composting sheds, it said. Leachate was found flowing out from the windrow composting sheds. A major portion of the drains intended to carry the leachate was not covered. The leachate flow through the drains was blocked owing to the presence of legacy waste. There were visible discharge routes that appeared to be intentionally created for the discharge of untreated waste, which ultimately would find its way to the adjacent marshy area and then to the Kadambrayar as well as a branch of the Chithrapuzha. Both the rivers have been identified as “critically-polluted” stretches by the Central Pollution Control Board, according to the report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/brahmapuram-scenario-has-worsened-slmc/article35692570.ece
03 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||30.70% dip in accident fatalities||Road accidents in the State decreased by 24.10% and fatalities by 30.70% during the January-June 2021 period, compared to the corresponding period in 2019, due to what road-safety stakeholders termed as a combination of stepped-up enforcement and awareness initiatives. The number of deaths declined from 2,482 in the corresponding period in 2019 to 1,719 in 2021, while the number of accidents decreased from 21,478 to 16,312. Lockdown “A much steeper decline of 40.30% in fatalities and 33.10% in accidents was recorded in 2020, but pandemic-induced lockdown and containment measures were in place for extended durations then. But the fact that the life of about 1,500 road users could be saved in 2020 is an indication that both accidents and fatalities can be considerably reduced in the State through concerted action,” said T. Elangovan, Executive Director, Kerala Road Safety Authority (KRSA). In addition, stepped-up awareness campaigns and augmenting of pedestrian infrastructure helped rein in the pedestrian-mortality rate, which was approximately 28% till 2018, to 23% in the 2019-2021 period. Mr. Elangovan attributed this to a task force being constituted under the KRSA and clear directives issued by the Supreme Court and High Court of Kerala to ensure that footpaths and road shoulders were kept free of encroachments, vehicles, debris, weeds and advertisement/display boards. “The stepped-up enforcement by the Motor Vehicles Department, as part of Safe Kerala Project, and the police too helped rein in accidents.” Blind-spot removal Aimed at further bringing down accidents and fatalities, enforcement agencies have intensified removal of obstructions that create blind spots at junctions and other places. “Accident-prevention measures are on the anvil in front of 50 educational institutions located along highways and smaller roads and black-spots across the State,” a high-ranking MVD official said. Mr. Elangovan said that a total of 238 high-risk black spots and 102 medium-risk ones have been identified in Kerala. “Funds have been sanctioned to take preventive measures like painting road markings, installing reflectors and warning boards, and setting up street lights, in spots where land acquisition is not needed. Land will be acquired for widening narrow, accident-prone junctions and other vulnerable areas.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/3070-dip-in-accident-fatalities/article35692555.ece

The first landings have brought cheers to boat owners, but the demand by fish merchants and commission agents to raise the auction discount to 16% now threatens to disrupt business. It has been a practice to offer discount on the auction price to wholesale fish buyers and agents. If the catch is worth Rs. 100, the actual price received by the boat owner is Rs. 87. The agents are now demanding that the rate be hiked to 16%, with the general business burden suffered by the sellers in the wake of the COVID-19 lockdown. V.A. Nazar of the All Kerala Fish Merchants’ and Commission Agents’ Association said on Monday that other harbours were offering similar discounts. A.M. Shaji, who runs the Kalamukku fisheries harbour, said around 25 boats landed in the early hours of Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/encouraging-landings-cheer-fishers/article35692610.ece

He was speaking at a protest organised by Chellanam residents under the aegis of the Chellanam Kochi Janakiya Vedhi in front of the office of the Deputy Director of Fisheries on Monday. The protesters demanded that the government should not go ahead with the Punargeham project if the intention was to forcibly rehabilitate people. The programme is meant to relocate people living in areas facing serious sea erosion threat. The protesters alleged that the government was slow in acting on the measures to contain sea erosion. While there are reports that work worth Rs. 344-crore to contain sea erosion had received administrative sanction, the promise was that seawall erection using tetrapods would be launched by early August, they said. The coastal segments like Chalakkadavu, Kannamali and Malakhappadi were facing serious sea erosion threat. Though the first government under Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had said that geotextile bags would be used to build protection walls, they were erected only after strong protests from the people, said a communication from the Janakiya Vedhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-for-urgent-steps-to-protect-chellanam-coast/article35692567.ece

In its reply in the case related to the sorry state of affairs at the now defunct plant, the Corporation authorities said the work order was awarded to the firm selected by the government for biomining of legacy waste on July 23. It is learnt that the evaluation of the tender for the waste-to-energy plant is being done at the government-level. The file was under the consideration of the Cabinet, it said. Fund allotted The Plan fund for 2020-21 has earmarked Rs. 1 crore for construction of the collapsed roof and structure of the compost plant shed, and carrying out initial work. A preliminary survey has been completed. The tendering of the work will be initiated soon after the completion of the design work, according to the authorities. Leachate facility The new leachate treatment facility will be set up along with the construction of the new compost plant. The septage will be treated at the septage treatment plant near the site until the new facility becomes a reality. The government’s Suchitwa Mission has directed the Corporation to take up work on the new leachate treatment plant only after the completion of the construction of the damaged roof of the compost plant. An assessment of the actual quantity of leachate generated should also be carried out. The Corporation has submitted an application for authorisation for its solid waste management. The State Pollution Control Board had not issued the authorisation owing to non-compliance of rules by the civic body.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/steps-being-taken-to-resolve-fiasco-corpn-tells-ngt/article35692568.ece

The Bench comprising Justice A.K. Jayasankaran Nambiar and Justice P. Gopinath also directed the municipality to identify areas where street dogs could be rehabilitated and sheltered. The municipality might not be able to discharge its entire obligation as regards the maintenance of such shelter by spending funds at this stage, the court observed. The Bench issued the directives when a suo motu case relating to the killing of dogs came up for hearing. The killing or maiming of street dogs was not the way to make people safer. The better option was to capture the canines and rehabilitate them at animal shelters. The court said a balance had to be maintained between the interests of the residents of the area who felt threatened by the street dog menace and the welfare of the animals. The court also directed the State government to give details of the district-wise animal shelters run by the State and private organisations. The court also asked the State government to give its suggestions on the composition of the State Animal Welfare Board given by the amici curiae . In its report, they suggested that an apex committee and subcommittee could be formed under the Animal Welfare Board. They suggested forming an apex committee comprising a retired judge of the Kerala High Court as chairperson and 19 other members nominated by the government and the court. The sub-committees could be constituted to address the issues regarding animal birth control, the functioning of slaughterhouses, and others. The report also suggested that the captive elephant committee monitor the welfare of captive elephants.

03 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Rehabilitation plan for Kochi street vendors soon||The rehabilitation programme for street vendors in Kochi, whose lives have been battered by the pandemic, will be ready by the end of the month. The town vending committee of the Kochi Corporation, which met the other day, has decided to finalise the vending zones and approve the final list of street vendors, who are conducting business within the Corporation limits, by mid-August. The civic body would adopt a humanitarian approach to the street vendors who had been hit hard by the economic crisis, said J. Sanilmon, chairman of the town planning committee. The Corporation would not resort to the earlier practice of demolishing the makeshift structures set up by the traders and deny them livelihood options. Instead, it would chalk out plans to rehabilitate the traders considering their plight and the looming economic crisis, he said. Festival sales Incidentally, a major share of the income of the street vendors come from festival-related sales. This year, Muharram falls on August 19 and Thiruvonam on August 21. The continuous lockdown following the second COVID-19 wave and the weekend lockdowns have badly affected the street vendors in the city. The Corporation planned not to interrupt their business during the festivals, indicated civic authorities. The civic body’s decision comes in the wake of the Kerala High Court setting a deadline for the rehabilitation programme of 2,916 persons identified as street vendors under the Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending Act. The Corporation had also given an undertaking that the town vending committee shall meet before August 12 for finalising the by-laws prepared for street vendors. The High Court has directed the civic body to put up a final list of street vendors, as approved by the town vending committee, on its notice boards on or before August 12. There shall not be any delay in convening the meeting of the town vending committee and the publication of the final list, the court directed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rehabilitation-programme-for-street-vendors-to-be-ready-soon/article35692557.ece

When the petition came up for hearing, Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar directed the State government to respond to the petition. Meeting on Wednesday The government pleader submitted that a meeting to review the COVID-19-related restrictions was likely to be held on Wednesday. The court also asked the petitioner’s counsel to look into the new decisions to be taken by the government at the review meeting and point out the decisions that the traders might find unreasonable. In its petition, samiti president Raju Apsara and other traders pointed out that experts had opined that the restrictions on the functioning of the shops should be withdrawn to avoid overcrowding when shops were opened on alternate days. In fact, allowing them to operate on all days would help avoid crowding. Financial crisis They said 11 merchants had committed suicide due to the financial crisis faced by them following the imposition of the restrictions. In fact, the shops in the neighbouring States, including Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, were not closed down even during the peak periods of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-adjourns-traders-plea-to-friday/article35692607.ece

The 34-year-old twins were identified as Nissar Khan and Nazeer, sons of Puthupparambil Abdul Salam and Fathima. According to the police, the duo was found hanging from the ceiling in two separate rooms inside their house during the wee hours of the day. Preliminary investigations attributed the suicides to financial crises in the family. The twin brothers, who had been previously employed in crane service unit and a vehicle garage respectively, were forced to leave their jobs a year ago following COVID-19, said the police. “Having availed themselves of Rs. 13 lakh as loan from the Manippuzha branch of the Kottayam Urban Cooperative Bank, they had defaulted the repayment for more than two years. A few days ago, a team of bank officials reportedly approached the duo seeking immediate repayment of the loan amount,” said an official. The bank authorities, meanwhile, dismissed allegations of exerting undue pressure on the duo for repayment. “Of the total loan amount sanctioned on May 2, 2019 for the purchase of a 4.5 cents property, they could repay only about Rs. 19,000. On July 23 this year, our officers visited them and advised to pay back at least Rs. 2 lakh so as to regularise the loan and stop it from being listed as a non-performing asset,” explained a bank official. The brothers had reportedly attempted to settle the loan by selling off the property of their sister in Palakkad, though to no avail.

A retired police officer, who was part of the Janamaitri scheme, said the main objective of the project was to reduce unwanted litigation-related investigation in police stations after registering the First Information Report and the subsequent legal proceedings. The pending-under-investigation cases on compoundable offences were also expected to be settled through mediation, he said. In all stations An order issued by the then State Police Chief Loknath Behera had called for opening such centres at all police stations under the supervision of a four-member panel headed by the respective Station House Officer. Though there was instruction to form a panel comprising community relation officers, beat police officers, and members from legal circles, it had failed to become a reality. The weekly meetings for settling such grievances had also failed to take off. The order stated that mediation centres would address complaints related to family matters, marriage, divorce, parenting, matrimonial disputes, partition suits, neighbourhood disputes, and development related issues. The only restriction was to keep away from all types of mediation attempts involving cognizable offences. In the absence of such a mechanism, many stations had been found to have registered FIR even in non-cognizable offences or be dealing with such issues with untrained police mediators. According to the guidelines, all mediation attempts by the approved centres should follow six changes which begin with the verification of the opening statement and end with the formal registering or recording of the whole proceedings in a confidential manner for future reference. It was also part of efforts to end off-the-record negotiations. Public awareness “The lack of public awareness was also found to have crippled the execution of the project. At many locations, community policing officers were found handling the job without following the official format ,” said a lawyer, who was part of a sponsoring social organisation. He also said the directive to use own funds for arranging office facilities also delayed project execution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/community-mediation-centres-yet-to-take-off/article35692541.ece
03 August 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Singer Kalyani Menon no more||Kalyani Menon, who passed away in Chennai at the age of 80 on Monday, was a Carnatic vocalist and playback singer who rendered some memorable songs in a long career. Her voice may have become more familiar to the listeners of popular music after she began to sing for A.R. Rahman in her second innings, but she had made a mark decades ago through her songs in Malayalam and Tamil. Though the late legendary composer V. Dakshinamoorthy gave her a break in playback singing with a few Malayalam songs in the early 1970s, that was a time when P. Susheela, S. Janaki and Madhuri reigned supreme, and it was to those three voices that the leading ladies mostly lip-synched. Yet, with songs such as Kanneerin mazhayathum... (Dweepu) and Rithubheda kalpana...(Mangalam Nerunnu) , Kalyani showed what she was capable of. In Tamil too, she did well whenever she got opportunities. Nee varuvaai ena naan... , a lovely melody composed by M.S. Viswanathan for the 1980 film Sujatha , is proof of that. It was in the latter part of her career that her songs reached out to more people, with songs such as Pavanar a ch e uzhuthunnu...(Vietnam Colony), Jalashayyayil... (Laptop), Kan n anaamunniye... (T.D. Dasan Standard VI B) and Unnikkanna vaayo... (Kakkakkuyil) .  The arrival of Rahman, and his willingness to experiment with different voices, brought Kalyani back into focus in Tamil film music. After singing the peppy female duet with Sujatha, Vaadi saathukodi... (Pudhiya Mannargal) for Rahman, she sang the Malayalam portion Omana thinkal in the chart-topper Kuluvalile... (Muthu) and then the title track of Alaipayuthe. Among her last popular songs is Kaathalae kaathalae... (96) . She was the mother of director and cinematographer Rajiv Menon, in whose film Kandukondein Kandukondein she played a small role. “She was a talented, knowledgeable singer, but never got her due,” composer Sreevalsan J. Menon told The Hindu. “Her voice should have been used a lot more and she was disappointed that it wasn’t.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/singer-kalyani-menon-no-more/article35692603.ece
03 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Pets in shops left starving during lockdown||Some of the wholesale pet traders in the district are accused of not feeding animals and birds in their custody in the name of lockdown regulations. Rescue workers in the field have exposed two such incidents in which animals were found starving or dead. In one of the latest incidents reported from Nadapuram, several ornamental birds, fish and rabbits were found dead inside a pet shop. Some of the local traders from Nadapuram said the pet shop located near Parakkadavu was not opened after the declaration of triple lockdown within the panchayat limits a few days ago. They came across the plight of animals after inspecting the stinking shop. Police sources said the shop operator would be booked for laxity. The first incident, which took place at a shop near the Link Road, was exposed by a group of animal rescue activists nearly two months ago. Those who took part in the rescue operation said the condition of the animals, including dogs kept for breeding, was pathetic. With the quick intervention and medication support, the lives of some of the starved animals could be saved. Rescue volunteers in the field said the lack of surprise inspections by the Animal Husbandry Department or local self-government squads in wholesale pet shops was making the situation worse and giving a free hand for such traders who were only concerned with the profit margin from the business. There should be stronger punishments for those who are part of such cruelty towards animals, they said. “Cruelty towards animals has also been noticed on the part of some of the local handlers who abandoned their aged dogs and cats along the road during the lockdown period. Some of such animals survived only because of the mercy of voluntary rescue teams,” said a woman animal rescue worker from Vengeri. She also pointed out that it was time to set up quality rescue shelters for such abandoned animals. Meanwhile, some of the Station House Officers in the city said the cruelty towards animals would invoke serious punishments under Section 428 and other sections under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. Those who come across such incidents should inform control rooms or reach out to nearby police stations, they said.  Rescue volunteers say it is time to set up quality rescue shelters for such abandoned animals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pet-shop-owners-accused-of-not-feeding-animals-during-lockdown/article35692546.ece
03 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Strike by resident doctors hits OP services at Kozhikode MCH||A 12-hour Statewide token strike by postgraduate medical students in medical colleges affected the functioning of outpatient services at the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Kozhikode, on Monday. They have warned of an indefinite strike in the coming days if their demands are not met. The resident doctors boycotted all duties, except emergency services and COVID treatment. Other services were disrupted between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Functionaries of the Kerala Medical Post Graduate Association (KMPGA) said that apart from their status as tertiary medical care institutions, medical college hospitals were also training future doctors in various specialities. However, for the past one-and-a-half-years, they were being used only for COVID care. They are apprehensive if the current rise in fresh cases were an indication of an impending third wave, of the infection, which would necessitate setting up of more Intensive Care Unit wards and emergency wards, where resident doctors would be posted. That would again affect their academic work. KMPGA leaders said that major medical colleges in the State were short of at least 500 doctors because the third-year PG students were busy preparing for their exams and there had been a delay in conducting National-Eligibility-cum-Entrance test to take fresh batches. There was serious manpower shortage, they pointed out. Decentralisation They are demanding that the COVID treatment be decentralised to other government hospitals by training doctors and other staff there. More senior resident seats be allocated in line with the seats in postgraduate courses. They claimed that the Finance Department had not notified the allocation of posts of 76 senior residents. Restoration of hike The KMPGA functionaries sought restoring of the 4% hike in their stipend and appointment of doctors in medical colleges on contract basis. The posting of 2016 batch of MBBS house surgeons should be made as soon as their practical exams are over. The resident doctors also urged the government to set up a committee involving medical students in order to study how the pandemic affected medical education in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/resident-doctors-strike-hits-op-services-at-mch/article35692536.ece
03 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Vigilance committees resume functioning on city outskirts||Noticing a spurt in illicit liquor brewing and drug abuse cases on the outskirts of the city, a number of neighbourhood groups have resumed the operation of their local vigilance committees to prevent them. Residents’ associations, cultural organisations and youth wings of political parties are part of the committees. Janamaithri beat officers within the limits of city police stations are also supporting the committees. Aerial surveillance using high-end drone cameras is under the consideration of the police to support the local volunteers. “We decided to revive the group after noticing the entry of drug addicts from even distant places to the isolated wetland areas along the Conolly Canal. Some of the local youths were also found colluding with such persons,” said a vigilance committee volunteer from Moorkkanad. He said a gang had even assaulted a local resident for questioning their activities. Local vigilance committee members said they had connections with the local police, excise and other enforcement squads to quickly request field-level support. On Sunday, an illicit liquor brewing unit was destroyed with the support of an excise squad near Moorkkanad in Puthiyangadi, they said. Residents’ forums and the newly formed vigilance committees have also come up with a demand to increase night patrol in the interior areas of Elathur and Nadakkavu police station limits. According to them, the wetland areas within the two police station limits had many secret gathering spots for miscreants. The strange increase in the number of thefts and damage to public properties too prompted local residents to reconstitute the vigilance committees. To give digital evidence to the police, a few residents’ associations have even purchased closed-circuit television cameras to be installed in vulnerable areas.

03 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Focus on better care at secondary hospitals||The Health Department has decided to strengthen COVID-19 care facilities in secondary and periphery hospitals in the State, including ICU infrastructure, in order to reduce the burden of medical college hospitals (MCHs), which have been functioning as exclusive COVID-19 hospitals since the beginning of the pandemic. At a review meeting called by Health Minister Veena George here on Monday, it was decided that the ICU care facilities in the secondary hospitals be linked online with the MCHs so that medical college doctors can help the district/general hospitals with decision-making as far as COVID-19 patients in ICUs are concerned. This, it is hoped, would help deliver better care to patients at the periphery without having to shift them to medical college hospitals. Ms. George directed hospital administrators to increase oxygen beds and ICU/ventilator facilities and asked the Director of Health Services, the Director of Medical Education and district medical officers to ramp up the facilities in the respective institutions. Adequate stocks She also directed the officials to ensure that hospitals had adequate stocks of medicines and consumables and to see to it that the newly upgraded paediatric care facilities were fully functional. She also suggested that these activities be carried out without disrupting the normal functioning of hospitals. It was pointed out at the meeting that despite the rise in total COVID-19 case numbers, ICU/ventilator occupancy was not rising. The government would increase testing so that cases could be detected early and isolated. Oxygen generation units are being made functional soon and the work on 33 units would be completed this month itself. Hospitals have also been asked to update the information on the exact number of beds, oxygen beds and ICUs each had. The issue of human resource shortage would be addressed, said Ms. George, adding that the heads of departments are required inform the vacancies that arise to the PSC on time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/focus-on-better-care-at-secondary-hospitals/article35692614.ece

Across the State, 2.64 lakh houses have been completed, with Palakkad district in the second position with 30,506 houses. Pathanamthitta district is in the last position on the list with just 6,786 houses completed, while Kasaragod and Kottayam too have low numbers with 9,497 and 9,512 houses respectively. The figures for Thiruvananthapuram include 3,075 houses constructed under the Scheduled Caste Department and 1,455 houses under the Fisheries Department. In addition, work on three LIFE tower projects has begun in the rural areas. The process for procuring building permit is progressing for a four-storey complex with 44 housing units at Poovachal. At Madavoor and Azhoor, earthwork has been completed for similar complexes with 36 and 44 housing units respectively. The local bodies in the district have also identified plots for housing complexes at five locations. The Pallikkal grama panchayat has identified a one-acre plot that will be funded by the Cooperative Department’s Care Home project. The Pulimath grama panchayat has identified 2.09 acres of land, the Nedumangad municipality has identified 1.38 acres of land, the Kattakada grama panchayat and the city Corporation 0.5 acres of land for LIFE towers. Prefab technology The work on other flat complex projects in the State are at various stages of completion. Since the construction is using prefabricated technology, the work is now progressing at a faster rate. The projects will have livelihood-enabling training centres added to them. Land, a problem Identifying land for flat projects in urban areas is a concern for the LIFE Mission. Scarcity of land as well as the reluctance of land owners to sell at lower prices have contributed to the delays in urban projects. Last year, plots owned by government departments had been identified for constructing apartment complexes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/capital-tops-list-of-finished-life-houses/article35692739.ece

As per the agreement, the first phase should have been completed on December 3, 2019. Although the Adani Group had sought clearance for 19 quarries for sourcing rock, clearance was provided for only three.

The team is said to have drawn attention to the State’s home care and isolation, which, according to it, needed better supervision and management. The State might need to evolve a new strategy for containment and checking disease transmission. Other focus areas Contact tracing and targetted testing were also focussed upon. The team also raised the possibility of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant in circulation in the State. However, it was pointed out that the State was regularly sequencing virus samples, and all samples tested till date have yielded only the Delta variant. The expert committee said by just looking at the total COVID-19 case numbers, the true pandemic situation in the State cannot be assessed. The State has to study the disaggregated data — how many of the new cases being reported now are reinfections; the proportion of people who have received one dose/two doses of vaccine amongst the new infections.

Mohamed Riyas has said. Replying to questions in the Assembly on Monday, Mr. Riyas also announced his department’s plan to launch an app to introduce unexplored destinations in the State. The revolving fund, the Minister said, would benefit people employed in accredited Ayurveda centres, homestays, grihasthalis, serviced villas, amusement parks, green farms, adventure tourism ventures, restaurants, people employed under the Responsible Tourism Mission, accredited microenterprises, artistes, and artisans. Around 15 lakh people were dependent on the sector, Mr. Riyas said, adding the revolving fund was the first of its kind in the country in the tourism sector. The State’s tourism sector had suffered a loss of around Rs. 33,000 crore due to COVID-19, he added. For the revival of the sector, the department would embark on a ‘Kerala is Safe’ campaign and explore the possibility of boosting domestic tourism, he said. “Foreign tourist arrivals have plummeted due to COVID-19. We have no idea when it will be back on track. The department will soon launch an app to introduce unexplored destinations in the villages of the State to India and the world,” he said. Accreditation extension As part of offering a measure of relief to the ailing sector, the government had also decided to unconditionally extend the accreditation of Ayurveda centres, restaurants, amusement parks, homestays, serviced villas, grihasthalis, green farms and tour operators till December 31, he said.

In a letter to the Assistant Director, FFRC (Food Fortification Resource Centre), over 170 individuals and organisations, along with the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA Kisan Swaraj), described the move as pro-corporate and unnecessary. The long-term costs of fortification will be profound and irreversible, they added. ''Mandatory fortification will lead to irreversible infrastructural and market shifts, including consolidation of corporate power,'' they said, adding that current fortification schemes will create a market of over 3,000 crores for just five big companies. Draft regulations In January, the FSSAI issued draft regulations on mandatory fortification of edible oil and milk with vitamin A and D. It has also proposed to make rice fortification mandatory with vitamin B12, iron, and folic acid starting 2024, ASHA Kisan Swaraj said in a statement. The FSSAI decision will have serious economic impacts on consumers and informal players such as small-time rice millers, cold-press oil mills, farmers and local enterprises who will not be able to make the heavy investments required, the statement noted. “In undernourished populations such as India’s, the key problem is calorie and especially protein inadequacy as a result of monotonous cereal-based diets along with low consumption of vegetables and animal protein. Adding one or two synthetic chemical vitamins and minerals will not solve the larger problem, and in undernourished populations can lead to toxicity, including gut inflammation,'' it said. The letter warned the government against opting for a blanket approach to address the issue of malnutrition. The simple and complete solution would be to improve diets and diversify them via widely available nutrient dense vegetables, millets, animal protein, dairy, the statement said.  The long-term costs of fortification will be profound and irreversible, say civil society groups and individuals||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-to-drop-move-to-make-food-fortification-mandatory/article35692551.ece

Sivankutty has said. Replying to a calling attention motion by P. Nandakumar of the CPI(M), Mr. Sivankutty accused the Centre of introducing the four new codes without considering the concerns and objections raised by several States, in spite of Labour being a subject in the Concurrent List of the Constitution. The codes, which also contravened the principles of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), were meant to cater to the interests of employers alone. They had subsumed as many as 29 labour laws that existed in the country, he said. Central rules He added that the government had already initiated steps to frame the State rules, even while the Central rules were not yet notified to implement the labour codes. These would be finalised also after consultations with all stakeholders. No anti-labour laws would be implemented in the State. The government was committed towards both ensuring labourers’ welfare and maintaining healthy labour relations, the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-will-protect-interests-of-workers-sivankutty/article35692696.ece

The driver of the SUV Hamidullah had a miraculous escape as the lorry hit the SUV at the left corner. Gooty circle inspector D. Ramu said that the accident took place at 4.30 a.m. near the Kothapeta flyover, where the road takes a small curve. The deceased were identified as Ashraf Ali, 68, and Layak Ali, 45 of Gulbarga and Khasim Mohammed of Kurnool. The lorry driver fled the accident scene. The lorry seems to have come suddenly in the wrong direction to fill diesel at a nearby petrol pump and the collision was so powerful that the SUV got flung onto the median and the victims got trapped in the badly damaged vehicle.

03 August 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Congo national’s death triggers row||A Congo national, who was arrested in a drug case, died allegedly of a cardiac arrest in J.C. Nagar on Monday, leading to outrage among the community. Following the news of his death, members of an African association gathered in front of the J.C. Nagar police station and staged a protest, demanding a detailed inquiry into the incident. The police had to resort to a lathi-charge to disperse the protesters after accusing them of turning violent and attacking the police. Many protesters sustained minor injuries and were taken to hospital for treatment. According to the police, Joel Shindani Malu, 27, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, complained of a sudden chest pain and was shifted to a nearby hospital. After administering treatment for almost one hour, he was declared dead owing to a suspected cardiac arrest. Drug peddling Earlier, on Sunday night, based on information, a team of police laid a trap to nab Joel, an alleged drug peddler, near Banjara Layout. The police team kept watch and waited till the wee hours of Monday. Due to the sudden presence of police, Joel allegedly changed the location of his trade to Babusapalya in Hennur police station limits. Around 12.30 a.m., two foreign nationals were passing by on a scooter and police informants identified the pillion rider as Joel, following which the police in mufti apprehended him. In the scuffle, as Joel was trying to flee, a few small plastic packets, containing a white substance, fell to the ground. It was later revealed to be 5 grams of MDMA, the police said. The other foreign national escaped. After following due procedure, the police team brought Joel to the station along with the seized substance and the bike for questioning. An FIR was registered and he was kept in the station to ascertain his identity and for further inquiry and legal action. The police said around 5.10 a.m. on Monday, the in-charge station house officer informed that Joel suddenly started complaining of chest pain. He was shifted to a nearby private hospital for treatment at around 5.30 a.m. On preliminary medical examination, he was diagnosed with bradycardia and was administered several rounds of CPR and other interventions. Around 6.45 a.m., he was declared dead owing to suspected cardiac arrest, the police added. In the absence of any proof regarding the identity of the deceased, Bosco, president of the Pan African Federation, was informed about the incident. On further inquiry, it was found that Joel was a national of Democratic Republic of the Congo. Available information also suggested that his student visa expired in July 2015 and his passport expired in December 2017, the police added. “A case of unnatural death has been registered and investigation is being conducted as per guidelines of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC),” Dharmendra Kumar Meena, DCP, North Division, said . “We have considered this as a custodial death and informed the agencies concerned while ordering for a detailed probe,” Kamal Pant, City Police Commissioner, said. The CID has taken over the case. Claims countered However, the African association countered police claims and said that Joel was pursuing BBA and was at a birthday party at his friend’s house in Hennur, when the police raided the place, and picked him up . Incidentally, this May a 38-year-old Nigerian national Peter Ofor was found dead in a canal of Kalkere lake in Ramamurthynagar police limits. The association had protested his death seeking a detailed inquiry. A few members of the association alleged that Ofor, who had come to India on a business visa and lived with his family in Banjara Layout, was last seen being chased by a group of men presumed to be police in mufti. ‘Drive against drugs’ Responding to the incident, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, speaking to reporters in New Delhi, said the State had been conducting a drive against drugs since the last two years and arrests have been made in the course. “Many have been found to be overstaying. In this case, the crowd had turned violent and the police countered it. Inquiry is on,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/congo-nationals-death-triggers-row/article35692079.ece
03 August 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||How many school staff got vaccine, asks HC||Declining to issue any specific direction on reopening of schools over a possible third wave of COVID-19 anticipated by experts, the High Court of Karnataka on Monday directed the State Government to submit data on vaccination of teaching and non-teaching staff of government and aided schools. The Court observed that the process of vaccinating all stakeholders in day-to-day running of schools would boost the confidence of parents and school staff, as and when the authorities take a call on reopening. A Division Bench comprising Justice B.V. Nagarathna and Justice P. Krishna Bhat issued the direction while hearing a PIL petition filed by Radha M. and others seeking a direction to supply cooked midday meals to students. The government must submit by August 12 the data on vaccinations. Referring to media reports of a possible third wave, the Bench orally said it would be an unpopular decision to reopen schools when the daily cases were rising again and there were indications of a weekend lockdown. When counsel for petitioner said the Government had not yet decided on reopening based on the report of a special committee, as the Court was informed during an earlier hearing, the Bench asked which parent would send children to schools now. The Court could not issue directions to the Government to reopen, the Bench said, adding that it was for the Government to decide based expert advice. It felt that even expert recommendations given a week ago may not be applicable now in a fast-changing pandemic scenario. The Bench observed orally that the Government may need more time to decide on reopening and took note of the absence of Council of Ministers and a Minister for Education, as the new Chief Minister assumed office only a few days ago. Karnataka on Monday logged a lower level of 1,285 cases and 25 more deaths. The test positivity rate (TPR) was 0.96%. Kerala’s cases dipped sharply on Monday, with the State reporting 13,984 new infections. Testing over the weekend dipped sharply to 1,27,903 samples. The TPR on Monday was 10.93%. The State added 118 recent deaths on Monday to its toll. Thrissur district reported the highest case numbers at 2,350. In Telangana, Karimnagar district saw a surge with 75 infections on Monday. Telangana logged 591 coronavirus cases and two deaths. After recording a marginal rise in fresh COVID-19 cases for four days in a row, Tamil Nadu saw a slight dip on Monday as 1,957 people tested positive for the infection. However, cases continued to fluctuate in a number of districts, including Chennai. When compared to the daily caseload on Sunday, cases fell in a number of districts, including Chengalpattu, Coimbatore, Erode, Thanjavur and Tiruppur. Coimbatore, where infections dropped from 230 to 219, continued to account for the most number of cases in the State. Chennai followed with 189 cases as against 175 on the previous day. In Erode, cases fell from 180 to 168. Chengalpattu recorded a dip from 133 to 127 cases, while Thanjavur recorded 123 cases. In Salem, 82 people tested positive for the infection, while 75 tested positive in Tiruchi. There was a slight increase in cases in both districts. The fresh cases took the State’s tally to 25,63,544. As many as 2,068 people were discharged after treatment.

He was in the process of finalising the list with party national president J.P. Nadda at the time of this report going to press. Explaining the process involved, Mr. Bommai told reporters before meeting Mr. Nadda that the party’s central leadership would give a final shape to the formula regarding the Cabinet formation. “The formula will give clarity on the number of phases in which the Ministry should be formed, the number of legislators to be sworn in, and regional/social representation. Once it is finalised, the number and names of legislators to be sworn in will be decided. Clarity on Deputy Chief Minister posts too will emerge,” he said. Mr. Bommai said he had to do a balancing act in the formation of Cabinet as he had to take into cognisance the the earlier Ministry led by B.S. Yediyurappa and consider regional and social representation. “Our effort is to take everyone together.” The indications are that 15 to 20 legislators may be sworn in in the first phase. The expansion exercise is likely to be taken up either on Wednesday or Thursday. Meanwhile, lobbying for ministerial berths intensified on Monday with nearly a dozen of aspirants camping in Delhi to meet the party’s central leaders. In Bengaluru, several aspirants visited Mr. Yediyurappa and appealed to him to recommend their names to the party high command.

04 August 2021||NEW DELHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||SC offers mediation in Krishna dispute||Chief Justice of India (CJI) N.V. Ramana on Monday offered to send a water dispute case filed by Andhra Pradesh against Telangana for mediation, while saying, in the background of the Assam-Mizoram border flare-up, that the people of the two States were “brothers”, who should not even “dream” of doing harm to each other. The CJI’s remark came in response to an indirect allusion made by senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for Andhra Pradesh, to the Assam-Mizoram violence. “Looking at what happened in the Northeast...” Mr. Dave began. Interjecting at this point, the CJI said: “Do not think like that even in your dreams... We are all brothers”. During the hearing, he said he hailed from both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. He could not adjudicate the case legally. So, the CJI gave the parties an option. “If you want to settle the issue through mediation, I will send it for mediation. On the other hand, if you want the case to be adjudicated or to be heard legally, I will list it before another Bench,” CJI Ramana addressed the parties. Mr. Dave said the CJI’s suggestion was “eminently fair”. This was a “political issue”, he stated and sought time to get instructions from the State government. The case concerned Andhra Pradesh’s petition accusing Telangana of depriving its people of their legitimate share of water for drinking and irrigation. Andhra Pradesh said Telangana was refusing to follow the decisions taken on river water management in the Apex Council constituted under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act of 2014. Senior advocate C.S. Vaidyanathan, for Telangana, said the issue had become infructuous. The Centre on July 15 notified the Godavari and the Krishna river management boards in order to maintain neutrality and to ensure effective river water management between the two States. The focus of the current petition is a Telangana government order of June 28, 2021, notifying that “to tap more hydel generation in the State, the government has taken a decision to generate hydel power up to 100% installed capacity”. The order directed the Telangana State Power Generation Corporation Limited (TSGENCO) to hence “generate the hydel power up to 100% installed capacity in the State.” A.P. said the notification was issued only days after the Ministry of Jal Shakti, in its communication on June 17 to Director (Hydel), TSGENCO, urged the latter “to stop further release of water immediately through the Srisailam Left Power House and follow the water release orders issued by the KRMB, except in case of extreme grid urgency”. “The Chief Minister of A.P. in this regard has written to the Prime Minister on July 1 and July 7, seeking his intervention,” the petition noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sc-offers-mediation-in-krishna-dispute/article35692087.ece

The rape survivor from Kottiyoor had also filed a separate petition seeking his interim bail for a few months so they could marry and legitimise the child. Appearing before a Bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari, advocate Amit George, for convict Robin Vadakkumcherry, said the marriage would lend a “veneer of legitimacy” to the child. Mr. George even said his client had a “fundamental right to marry” which could not be thwarted by the authorities. Both the convict and the rape survivor had appealed to the Supreme Court after the Kerala High Court had refused him bail. “What is the age difference between you and the victim,” the Bench asked the lawyer at one point. Justice Maheshwari, after perusing the files, said the High Court “has consciously taken note of everything in the case... We find no reason to interfere with the High Court decision”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sc-refuses-to-entertain-former-priests-bail-plea/article35692085.ece

Congress-led United Democratic Front Opposition legislators walked out of the House, accusing the government of dashing the hopes of PSC test-qualified youth. They said the government had hobbled PSC recruitment to protect “party favourites it had appointed via the backdoor.” Outside Assembly Simultaneously, outside the Secretariat, scores of women who had made it to the PSC rank list for recruitment as police constables cut their hair in protest against the government’s move to appeal against the Kerala Administrative Tribunal order to extend the validity of the current PSC rank lists by at least three months. In the Assembly, Leader of the Opposition V. D. Satheesan accused Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of “slamming the door” on lakhs of job aspirants. The government had reduced the PSC to a “party service commission”. It had perverted the PSC selection process to inject party persons into public service, he alleged. CM’s reply Mr. Vijayan, replying to an adjournment notice by Congress legislator Shafi Parambil, said the government was hard-pressed to extend the validity of the current PSC rank lists published in 2018 beyond August 4. The government could do so only if a recruitment ban or some extraordinary circumstance prevailed. No such condition prevailed in Kerala. The government had reported vacancies to the PSC and effected appointments as per its advice. Mr. Vijayan said not every person on a PSC rank list could expect to get the advice memo. The PSC published expanded lists to meet the social reservation criterion.  Mr. Vijayan said the UDF was driving job aspirants to desperation by giving them false hopes. They should stop the potentially dangerous gambit. Mr. Satheesan said Mr. Vijayan was vengeful towards the PSC rank holders for challenging his writ.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/psc-rank-holders-woes-echo-in-house/article35692081.ece

03 August 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP accuses govt. of financial mismanagement||Accusing the YSRCP government of raising loans in violation of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) norms, BJP State general secretary and MLC P.V.N. Madhav has said that a delegation of his party would complain to the Union Finance Minister and the RBI Governor about the ‘financial mismanagement’. Mr. Madhav described what Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy had been doing for the last two years as ‘magic’. “The Finance Minister has been painting a rosy picture of the State’s finances by glossing over some misdeeds for which he apparently has no proper explanation,” the MLC told the media here on Monday. Mr. Madhav alleged that the State government was diverting about Rs. 4,100 crore given by the Central government for the welfare of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (Sts) to schemes such as the Jagananna Vidya Deevena and the YSR Cheyutha. “Other funds sanctioned by the Centre are also being misused. The State government is resorting to massive borrowings for implementing welfare schemes including its flagship Navaratnalu programmes,” he said. Mr. Madhav said that the Central government had relaxed the FRBM rules to help the States grapple with the impact of coronavirus pandemic. However, the State government is taking aadvantage of it and it is evident from a Rs. 19,000-crore debt mobilised in April alone,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-accuses-govt-of-financial-mismanagement/article35692682.ece

03 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Mayor, corporators stage protest against privatisation of steel plant||Mayor Golagani Hari Venkata Kumari and corporators of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) staged a dharna near the Gandhi statue, opposite the GVMC, on Monday in protest against the decision of the Union government to privatise the Visakhaptnam Steel Plant (VSP). The corporators, setting aside their party affiliations, participated in the protest and raised slogans against the proposal and seeking allotment of captive mines to the plant. The protest was meant to express solidarity with the steel workers and trade unions leaders, who are staging a dharna in Delhi. The Mayor drew an analogy between the VSP and a large joint family. The VSP was like the head of Visakhapatnam city and when the head was lost, the whole family would suffer, she said. The plant apart from providing employment to over 40,000 persons, directly and indirectly, was responsible for the growth and development of the city, she added. When there was a short supply of medical oxygen in Maharashtra and other parts of the country during the COVID-19 pandemic, the VSP rose to the occasion and supplied Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO), the Mayor said. She appealed to the Centre to reconsider the decision. The State government had passed a resolution in the Assembly against the decision and sent the resolution to the Centre. Rajya Sabha Member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy undertook a padayatra against the decision, she said. Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao, CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna and New and Renewable Energy Development Corporation(NREDCAP) Chairman K.K. Raju expressed their solidarity. The Tourism Minister said that the steel workers have been on a relay hunger strike for the past 170 days. The State Assembly and the GVMC council have passed resolutions against privatisation of VSP and the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) was supporting the agitation privatisation both within the House and outside, he said. He said it was wrong to say that the plant would be sold as the Centre has taken a decision. He said that the State government was extending solidarity with the strike by steel workers in Delhi. Mr. Ramakrishna alleged that the Union government was creating problems for the steel workers in Delhi by getting the rooms, which were booked at hotels, cancelled. He said that he would leave for Delhi later in the day and participate in the protest on Tuesday. CPI(M) city secretary and corporator B. Ganga Rao said that all political parties, except the BJP, were supporting the agitation for continuation of the VSP in the public sector. The agitation would be taken to the panchayat-level, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mayor-corporators-stage-protest-against-privatisation-of-steel-plant/article35692818.ece
03 August 2021||visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||Maoists call for State bandh on Aug. 10 against ‘illegal mining’||The banned CPI (Maoist) has given a call for a State-wide bandh on August 10 in protest against the alleged illegal mining of laterite and bauxite in the Agency areas of Visakhapatnam and East Godavari districts. In a letter released on Monday, Maoist AOBSZC (Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee) secretary Ganesh appealed to the tribal people in the region and people from all sections of society to participate in the bandh and make it a success. The Maoists also urged the tribal people from the affected villages to take a militant stand and drive away the mining companies and to destroy the trucks and heavy earthmoving equipment being used for mining. They said mining of laterite in over 121 hectares at Bhamidikaloddi village in Sarugudu panchayat of Nathavaram mandal in Visakhapatnam district had been allotted to a tribal J. Lakshmana Rao, who actually was a benami of some influential people from the plain areas. According to the Maoists, the mining lease was given in February for a period of 15 years and annually about 10 lakh cubic metres of laterite would be mined. They alleged that bauxite was being mined under the garb of laterite mining in the Yeleswaram forest range in East Godavari district. They alleged that YSRCP leaders in connivance with the police and the Forest Department had formed a mining mafia and urged the tribal people to take up a violent agitation if required to throw them out. They promised to extend their support to the agitation. ‘Illegal road’ Mr. Ganesh alleged that the mining company had laid a 32-foot wide road in Yeleswaram to enable trucks to carry bauxite and, in the process, had destroyed thousands of trees and caused huge ecological damage. The road was laid without obtaining permission from the authorities concerned, including the Forest Department, and it was against the Forest Conservation Act. They also alleged that the mining company had been bribing local tribal leaders and social media activists to make sure that there were no protests and the mining went on smoothly. According to them, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had revoked GO 97 on bauxite mining but passed GO 89 to facilitate it. They called it ‘double standards’. The Maoists urged tribal people not to allow the police to organise volleyball tournaments and medical camps in interior villages, as on that pretext they were trying to protect the roads constructed to facilitate mining and aid the company. They urged the tribals to oppose the NGT’s joint committee stating that the enquiry would be a farcical affair.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/maoists-call-for-state-bandh-on-aug-10-against-illegal-mining/article35692690.ece

Addressing the workers, union State president Baby Rani alleged that the anganwadi workers were being pressurised by the Union and the State governments to upload the data pertaining to the height and weight of children online, from time to time, though they were not given Internet facility. The mobile phones provided by the then government in 2017, were of inferior quality and were not working properly, she said. Some of the workers had purchased mobile phones with their own money, she said and demanded provision of new mobile phones. The officials were insisting on biometric system but there were connectivity issues in far-flung rural and tribal areas due to lack of mobile towers, Ms. Baby Rani said. She sought bringing out of an app so that the system could be done in offline mode. Union general secretary M. Nagaseshu said that the anganwadi workers were made to run around the Project Office every day for online work. Later, a memorandum was submitted at the ICDS office on the demands. CITU district president V.

Addressing the media on the sudden eviction of about 16 vendors in the Old Town area, here on Monday, he said that these vendors had been earning their livelihood by setting up makeshift stalls at that location for the past three to four decades. “Forcibly evicting them in the early hours without even giving a notice was inhuman and undemocratic,” he said. He blamed GVMC Commissioner G. Srijana for taking such a drastic step and putting the vendors and the family members on to the road, without any livelihood. According to Mr. Ganesh, the GVMC officials brought heavy machinery and pulled down shops without even giving a notice or time period to remove the shops. Most of the shops are makeshift arrangements and can be dismantled and moved to another place. “But instead of that, the GVMC officials destroyed the shops by pulling them apart. We demand that they be compensated for the loss,” he said. On the accusation that the vendors were indulging in illegal activities, the MLA said, “If that was so, what were the police doing? The shops are located barely 400 metres from the One Town Police Station. If some irregularities are found, take action and punish them, but depriving them of their livelihood cannot be a solution.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rehabilitate-vendors-before-evicting-them-says-vasupalli/article35692819.ece

VMC Municipal Commissioner S.S. Varma and Assistant City Planner K. Venkateswara Rao have been seeking public opinion as the VMRDA had extended the deadline of submitting objections till August 7. Mr. Venkateswara Rao told The Hindu that the opinions of public representatives and others would be consolidated and sent to the VMRDA. “With the cooperation of property owners, we developed a 66-feet road from Three Lamps to Venkateswara Theatre junction a few years ago. Now, people are not keen on the development of a 100-feet road as it would have a serious impact on the entire market area. The opinion of the public and VMC Council’s resolutions are being sent to the higher authorities,” he said. BJP’s Vizianagaram constituency in-charge K. Subba Rao said that the government should build a massive new market if it was intent on developing a 100-feet road in the existing market area beginning from the Three Lamps Junction to the Collectorate. “Having a futuristic vision and development in accordance with the Master Plan-2041 is good. But at the same time, the government should also protect the interests of the property owners,” Mr. Subba Rao said. Vizianagaram Rotary Club Central former president D.S.P. Lingam said he was worried that the entire market area would be affected by the development of the proposed 100-feet road. He added that there was no need for a long ORR which was proposed to cover Pradeep Nagar, BC Colony, Ayyannapeta, Gajularega, YSR Nagar and Polytechnic College of Vizianagaram-Nellimarla Road. “Over 50,000 people will be affected by this proposal. That is why people are strongly opposing the ORR proposal,” he said. The district unit president of the Congress, Saragada Ramesh Kumar, asked VMRDA and VMC to hold awareness programmes on the new proposals as their confirmation in the master plan would also have an impact on the public. “Property owners cannot sell their lands if the proposals are approved in the master plan. So, the government should take the opinions of everyone before finalising the master plan,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vmc-calls-for-suggestions-objections-over-master-plan/article35692713.ece

He said at least 100 eligible families in all the 119 Assembly constituencies in the State will receive the benefit in the current year. And 2022 onwards, the scheme benefit to remaining families will be transferred in a phase-wise manner. The Chief Minister, who was addressing leaders and locals at Haliya of Nagarjunasagar constituency, said the scheme was his brainchild to uplift Dalit lives, and since the announcement of the scheme last month “many are unable to digest it,” he said in an obvious remark on the Opposition. “They are having palpitations and increased blood pressure from the fear of losing their constituencies because of the scheme. They are also creating apprehensions and doubts. But I will achieve and show 100% Dalit Bandhu, like I had achieved separate Telangana at a time when they did not have faith in me but only ridiculed,” he said. Mr. Rao said 12 lakh eligible Dalit families, out of some 17 lakh families, in the State would benefit. The scheme also does not require any bank linkage process and the direct benefit transfers of Rs. 10 lakh will only aim at improving the lives of Dalit families by way of entrepreneurship, he clarified.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/will-achieve-and-show-100-dalit-bandhu-in-state/article35692519.ece
03 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Peculiar COVID stability in flood-hit Nirmal district||COVID-19 is a serious risk in flood areas as finding one’s way out of an inundated locality takes precedence over everything else. Surrounded by swirling waters, one barely thinks of wearing masks or maintaining physical distancing, even though contracting the virus is very much a possibility. However, curiously enough, COVID cases in the State have not seen a spike despite the recent floods. Nirmal is one of the districts which witnessed deluge nearly 10 days ago. The district administration, along with volunteers, used rafts to rescue people from submerged localities on July 22 and 23. National Disaster Response Force personnel also participated in the rescue operations. Yet, the district continues to record single digit cases post-floods just like it has been since mid-July, indicating a strange stability in infection rates. Hyderabad floods The same, peculiar situation was observed when several localities in and around Hyderabad were flooded in October last year. Experts had feared a spike in coronavirus cases as people’s focus shifted from COVID safety norms to survival. Rapid Antigen Tests were conducted on people who were rescued and taken to rehabilitation centres. However, surprisingly and much to everyone’s relief, the cases did not rise in the aftermath of the floods. Fever survey Nirmal District Medical and Health Officer Cherupally Dhanraj said multiple health programmes are being conducted to track people’s condition. “Fever surveys are being conducted regularly. National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme is also under way to understand the prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases. Health camps were organised in inundated localities. Around 1,000 tests are conducted in a day. All of this helps us know if someone has fever and needs further medical tests. We are, however, recording only single-digit COVID cases,” Dr Dhanraj said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/peculiar-covid-stability-in-flood-hit-nirmal-district/article35692482.ece
03 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Challenges persist for IT firms to call employees back to office||Information technology (IT) firms in Hyderabad are keen on getting employees back to office but going slow in the face of multiple challenges, including half of the workforce not residing in the city, everyone yet to be fully vaccinated as well as rising attrition rates. “The intent, sentiment of our members is to bring employees back to office. It is something that has to happen, but taking time,” says Bharani K Aroll, president of Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association (HYSEA). The reason is to not only to help the ecosystem around, but very importantly, employees who are stressed out sitting in front of computers, with no in-person collaboration with colleagues ever since work from home (WFH) began, he said in an interaction recently. Asserting that IT firms are sensitive to the fact that livelihood of those in the support ecosystem such as housekeeping staff, cab drivers and security guards are dependent on functioning of their facilities, he said one factor that is bound to accelerate the switch from WFH is vaccination. An estimated 60% of IT employees have got one shot of vaccine. The number of those who have got both the shots will be less than 10%. Besides employees, the support staff also have to be vaccinated. By September-end, things are expected to look up, he said. Vaccination, however, will not pave the way for return of all IT employees as those in the GICs (Global Inhouse Centres) will remain to be guided by decisions their firms take for the global workforce. Small IT firms already have 50-60% of the employees back in office since WFH is not viable for such entities, while medium-sized entities are making the switch gradually. Overall, the number of employees working from office is less, influenced by the decision of large companies, who are also large employers, to continue with WFH. An increase in attrition rate is only making matters difficult for many companies. Lateral hiring is on the rise with companies bagging new projects and many employees prefering to join companies that assure WFH for a few more months to come. Among reasons for employees not in favour of returning to office is a fear of further COVID-19 waves, the comfort level they have developed after moving to their native places where the cost of living is also less as well as the fact that schools and crèches are yet to reopen, thus making it difficult for them to leave children alone at home. “Most importantly, 50% of the employees are not in Hyderabad; they are scattered all around and [will] take time to come back,” Mr.Aroll said, adding more details on return to office are expected from a survey HYSEA has commissioned. HYSEA has more than 300 members who between them account for nearly 90% of Telangana’s IT/ITeS industry revenue and employee headcount.  50% of the employees are not in Hyderabad; they are scattered all around and [will] take time to come back.

03 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Telangana village first to become COVID-resilient’||Rajannapet village in Rajanna-Sircilla district has become the first ‘COVID-resilient’ village in the country, thanks to efforts of locals and healthcare workers (HCW), claimed members of Project Madad, adding that they have implemented five public health measures to achieve the status. Universal immunisation against COVID-19 was one of the measures. Project Madad is a voluntary group of doctors and professionals from India and the Indian diaspora who are working towards fighting the pandemic in their personal capacities. The five measures include active countering of COVID misinformation in vernacular language; empowerment and equipping of rural HCWs; innovative methods to encourage socially responsible behaviour and increase vaccine acceptance; targeted delivery of vaccines to achieve universal coverage; use of technology to address specific dimensions of the COVID challenge. Vaccination A four-day campaign, which ended on July 31, was conducted to vaccinate 1,328 out of the 1,700 adults in the village eligible for the COVID jab, following 10 weeks of public health innovations. The rest opted for vaccination elsewhere. The beneficiaries are yet to receive the second dose. Some were not vaccinated owing to health complications while a few others had recently recovered from the infectious disease. This was announced at a virtual press meet on Monday. Project Madad lead Raja Karthikeya said it is a model which forged government-private sector-civil society collaboration in public health, and is being replicated in other villages of India. The group involved elected representatives, religious leaders, youth organisations and businessmen, who decided how to implement the COVID measures, and disseminated the information. Government HCWs were also involved. Door-to-door visits Rajannapet sarpanch M. Shankar said 10 groups consisting of Accredited Social Health Activists, Anganwadi workers and others were formed and they went door to door to track co-morbidities among residents and number of members in a family to be vaccinated. He added that concerns and misinformation among people regarding vaccination were addressed too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/telangana-village-first-to-become-covid-resilient/article35692480.ece
03 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CSIR-NGRI helps water level rise up||“This is fantastic! This is what scientists look forward to where their work helps the community at large,” gushed CSIR Director-General Shekhar C. Mande. A group of villagers from neighbouring areas gathered as he surveyed the five acre percolation tank inside the sprawling 100 acre campus of the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) housing the geomagnetic observatory at Choutuppal, about 65 km from here, on the weekend. The aquifer recharge project in the water scare rocky area taken up more than five years ago has transformed the socio-economic profile of the area which earlier used to be dependent solely on groundwater with high levels of dissolved flouride. CSIR-NGRI Director V.M. Tiwari, senior scientists D. Srinagesh and J. Nandan informed that extensive hydro-geophysical surveys in villages of Mandollagudem, Thoorpugudem and Singarayacheruvu were taken up to provide precise locations for groundwater exploration. Percolation tank, which falls in the microshed area covering these villages, was built with funds from MNREGS, which improved the groundwater level up to five metres. “We used to grow crops in one acre only on an average till recently forcing many to migrate to the city. In the last couple of years, we have been raising crops like paddy in 10-15 acres each with sufficient water coming in - resulting in reverse migration,” claimed sarpanch B. Krishna Reddy. Chips in fellow villager Y. Yoganand: We even used to go to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh for work but nowadays they are coming here for work. From about 400 acres, more than 1,000 acres is being used to raise crops. Another farmer B. Narasi Reddy said: “Despite proximity to the city, our land prices used to barely fetch Rs. 1 lakh an acre and it has gone up by 10 times.” Groundwater has reached the surface this year so much so that the scientists had to raise foundations of the structures housing the instruments, said Mr. Srinagesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/csir-ngri-helps-water-level-rise-up/article35692500.ece
03 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Dalit Bandhu will take 112 years to cover all: Ponnala||Former president of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) Ponnala Lakshmaiah has sought to know from Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao as to what is the fate of the latter’s promises for the last seven years and why he is not reviewing them, instead of focusing on Huzurabad by-election. Speaking to reporters here on Monday, he said there is no progress with regards to the Chief Minister’s promises to Warangal, on podu lands to tribals, conducting praja darbar, 12% reservation to tribals and minorities and others. On Dalit Bandhu scheme, he said it was purely announced keeping in mind the by-election to Huzurabad. He sought to know what is the status of three acres land to every landless dalit family and double-bedroom houses to all homeless families. He pointed out that implementing Dalit Bandhu for 11,900 families every year at 100 families every constituency would take over 112 years to cover all 13.5 lakh dalit families in the States. Further, the Chief Minister is trying to deceive dalits again in the name of Dalit Bandhu. Instead of spending at least Rs. 30 lakh per family on three acres land each and a double-bedroom house, he is talking about giving just Rs. 10 lakh per family, Mr. Lakshmaiah alleged. The amount required for implementing three acres land and double-bedroom houses to all dalit families would require a whopping Rs. 4.05 lakh crore and the rate of spending just Rs. 1,190 crore per year, it would take about 341 years to cover all, he explained. Dalit meetings Meanwhile, TPCC vice-president Mallu Ravi stated that the party would conduct ‘atma gaurava dandora shaba’ (meets of dalits’ self esteem) from August 9 to 14 in all 119 Assembly and 17 parliamentary constituencies. As announced already, TPCC president A. Revanth Reddy would hold ‘dalita, girijana atma gaurava dandora sabha’ on August 9 at Indravelli.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/dalit-bandhu-will-take-112-years-to-cover-all-ponnala/article35692509.ece

In a counter affidavit filed in Telangana High Court, which was hearing a PIL petition over Mariamma’s custodial death case, the Rachakonda police said cameras were installed in all 18 police stations of Bhongir zone by September 2020. In Addagudur police station, the cameras had a back-up facility for 20 days. Cameras here stopped functioning from this May 27 due to cable damage. They got repaired and resumed working from June 25. These details were presented in a counter affidavit filed by Malkajgiri Assistant Commissioner of Police N. Shaym Prasad Rao in the PIL petition seeking judicial inquiry into Mariamma’s custodial death. The petitioner sought a direction, among others, to secure video footage of the police station on June 18 when Mariamma was brought there along with her son Shankar and his friend. Police brought them there on charge of involvement in theft of Rs. two lakh from a church priest’s house where Mariamma was working as maid. Advocate General B.S. Prasad informed the bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy that body of Mariamma, which was buried in Khammam, was exhumed and a re-post-mortem examination of the body was conducted as per the HC direction. Already, the first autopsy was conducted by a team of doctors. The autopsy report was awaited. The AG said the government had already dismissed from service Addagudur sub-inspector V. Maheshwar and constables Janaiah and Rasheed Patel. Their role was established in assault and wrongful confinement of Mariamma and her son Uday Kiran, the counter affidavit said. The judicial inquiry by Alair First Class Magistrate into the custodial death, ordered by the HC, was in progress, he said. Compensations of Rs. 15 lakh to Kiran and Rs. 10 lakh to each of Mariamma’s two daughters were paid by the government in addition to a job to Kiran in Social Welfare department as subordinate. The bench posted the matter to September 15 for next hearing and directed the government to furnish the reports of the second autopsy and the Alair First Class Judicial Magistrate in the matter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/addagudur-ps-cameras-were-not-working-police-tell-hc/article35692515.ece

03 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TS for full board meet of GRMB before coordination panel meet||In a yet another twist to the ongoing issue of notification of the purview of the two river boards for supervising all major and medium irrigation and hydro-electric projects in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Telangana has expressed reservations over the coordination committee meeting of Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) scheduled on Tuesday. In a letter addressed to Chairman of GRMB J. Chandrashekhar Iyer, Engineer-in-Chief (General), Irrigation Department, of Telangana C. Muralidhar said on Monday that the matter related to notification of the purview of GRMB covering projects in the Godavari Basin has serious consequences on Telangana and AP and required to be discussed in detail and decided in a full-board meeting. “Without having an opinion and guidance of the full board meeting, it is not possible to discuss any issue and decide directly in the coordination committee on operationalisation of various clauses of the gazette,” Mr. Muralidhar wrote and requested the GRMB Chairman that the coordination committee meeting may be convened after having a detailed full board meeting. Meanwhile, Member Secretary of GRMB B.P. Pandey, in an almost instant reply to Telangana, underscored the need to of coordination committee meeting stating that it is to facilitate the river board office and the concerned departments of the two Member States in the time-bound implementation and operationalisation of various clauses of the gazette notification. Citing a letter addressed by Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Jal Shakti (MoJS) to the river board on July 28, Mr. Pandey said coordination panel meeting was necessary considering strict timelines given in the notification. Further, the Ministry had also asked GRMB to send a detailed plan of action giving dates and other relevant information on the operationalisation of the gazette notification. The full board meeting of GRMB shall be convened immediately after the coordination committee meeting after the activities of the board were given shape, Mr. Pandey suggested and requested Telangana ENC to attend the meeting positively on August 3. On the other hand, even the opposition parties in the two States, except BJP, have opposed the notification on the purview of the two river boards stating that it was unnecessary to bring all projects into the board’s purviews except those linked to the two States in the matter of water storage, release and hydel generation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ts-for-full-board-meet-of-grmb-before-coordination-panel-meet/article35692510.ece

03 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Non-COVID services at Gandhi from today||Non-COVID services are set to resume at Gandhi Hospital here from Tuesday. It had been turned into an exclusive COVID-care facility when the State saw an upsurge in coronavirus infections during the second wave around the third week of April this year. Gandhi Hospital is the only State-run tertiary care health facility apart from Osmania General Hospital where super speciality services are provided free of cost under one roof. Orthopaedic (bones), Nephrology (kidneys), Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Paediatric (health issues of children), and several other specialist doctors provide services there. During the first wave too, it was the only healthcare facility across the State where coronavirus patients were admitted until private hospitals were given the permission to attend coronavirus cases. At that time, it was turned into a COVID-only hospital and non-COVID services resumed only in November third week. That changed again when the second wave started peaking. Now, after more than three months, non-COVID out-patient, in-patient, and emergency services will resume from Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/non-covid-services-at-gandhi-from-today/article35692483.ece

03 August 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Group rivalry in TRS comes to the fore||The simmering group rivalry in the ruling TRS in Palair Assembly constituency took a new turn on Monday with a host of second rung leaders of the TRS levelling serious allegations against the followers of Palair MLA Kandala Upender Reddy of the TRS charging the latter with “implicating” them in “false cases” for not toeing their line. A delegation of the TRS leaders and cadres from Palair constituency, believed to be staunch followers of former minister Tummala Nageswara Rao, submitted a memorandum to Khammam Police Commissioner Vishnu S Warrier seeking appropriate action against those allegedly responsible for foisting ‘false cases’ against them in various police stations in the constituency. In the memorandum, the aggrieved TRS leaders alleged that they were being targeted and harassed by the followers of the MLA with selfish political motives. ‘Politically motivated’ Meanwhile, sources close to the MLA refuted the allegations saying they were “politically motivated.” It may be mentioned that the followers of Mr Nageswara Rao and Mr Upender Reddy have been at loggerheads with each other in Palair constituency ever since the latter joined the TRS from the Congress in March 2019. Mr Reddy won from Palair constituency on Congress ticket in 2018 Assembly elections, defeating Mr Tummala Nageswara Rao of the TRS.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/group-rivalry-in-trs-comes-to-the-fore/article35692724.ece
03 August 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Historical temples of old Medak district cry for attention||The erstwhile Medak district has a number of temples that are over a 1000-years-old. The glorious Kashi Visweswara temple on the outskirts of Kalabgur in Sangareddy mandal, some 5 km from the district headquarters town and just 60 km from the State capital, belongs to the 11th century and was built by the Kakatiya kings. What makes this temple more interesting is that while the main deity is Lord Siva, the idols of Venugopalaswamy and Ananta Padmanabha Swamy are on the same platform. This trikutalayam had caught the interest of the then district Collector Ronald Rose, who had made some efforts to promote it as a tourist destination. Sadly, his successors have not evinced interest in promoting the place. Unique construction Another ancient temple in the district is the Ramalingeswara Swamy temple at Nandikandi in Sadashivpet mandal. It is reported to have been built by the Chalukyas in the 6th century. The unique construction of the temple has the rays of the morning sun filter through the toranam (entrance gate) and light up the sanctum sanctorum. The temple gopuram is shaped like a lotus. This historical temple that was reportedly ransacked and the locals say there are scars visible on the presiding deity. The Ramalingeswara Swamy temple is hardly one km from National Highway 65 and some 10 km from the district headquarters. Some of the old sculptures of the temple are locked up in a storeroom. A guesthouse has been built near the temple with a play area for children. Now the area is being used as a parking place by the locals. Parts of the temple premises is overrun by weeds and bushes. Another historical site is Alladurg mandal headquarters in Medak district. It was once famous as Shilamkot and was reportedly a major centre for carving sculptors and orders were received from far off places like Delhi. Here one can find idols of various shapes and sizes everywhere and in fact anyone digging for foundation for building a house is bound to uncover some or the other idol. The beautiful Tumbureswara temple at Velpugonda in Tekmal mandal of Medak district,, located adjacent to a tank, is reported to have been built during the reign of first Pratapa Rudra. All these historical locations needs attention from the government for their upkeep and for promoting them as tourist destinations. Adding to the history are some locations in Marpadaga village in Kondapaka mandal in Siddipet district which date back to some 2,000 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/historical-temples-of-old-medak-district-cry-for-attention/article35692723.ece

A local BJP MLA on Monday said the Shiv Sena should keep in mind the support given to the party by the people of Parbhani while a social organisation held a protest demanding that the IAS officer, Achal Goyal, be given the charge. “Everyone was curious who would succeed Deepak Muglikar who retired on July 31. We learnt that Ms. Goyal was posted here and the news of her appointment was published in newspapers. But on July 31, Mr. Muglikar was told by the State government to hand over the charge to additional collector Rajesh Katkar. This has happened due to some politicians, which is shameful,” Jagrut Nagrik Aghadi president Madhuri Kshirsagar told reporters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ias-officer-not-allowed-to-take-charge-as-collector/article35692360.ece

03 August 2021||Mumbai,||Why can’t those fully vaccinated be allowed to use trains, asks HC||The Bombay High Court on Monday asked the Maharashtra government on why people who had received both doses of COVID-19 vaccine could not be allowed to travel by local trains in Mumbai. The court was hearing a bunch of public interest litigation petitions filed by advocate Chirag Chanani and others through advocate Shyam Devani. Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni told a Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni: “The State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) is reluctant to permit all lawyers, judicial clerks and court staff to resume local train travel. Currently, only frontline health workers and government staff are permitted to use local trains.” Senior advocate Milind Sathe, appearing for one of the petitioners, said since the High Court and other courts are now conducting physical hearings all lawyers need to commute by local trains. Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, representing the Railways, said that all three railway lines authorities — Western, Central and Harbour —had agreed to issue monthly, quarterly or half-yearly travel passes to lawyers and court staff. Mr. Kumbhakoni said, “The SDMA, however, is a bit reluctant. This time (during the second wave of COVID-19) only frontline health workers and government staff are permitted to use the train.” The Bench said, “The difference between the first situation and now is that the situation has improved because of the vaccine. All lawyers are above 18 years of age and permitted to receive the vaccine now. So, a decision needs to be taken. Otherwise, what is the benefit of the vaccine? One is not supposed to sit at home even after taking the vaccine. Lawyers need to come to court at some point.” The Bench went on to say, “The Railways is also cooperating, so please use your good office. We must make a beginning. Spread the net wide. Not only for lawyers, but also people coming from other walks of life. A comprehensive plan is needed, otherwise it is affecting everyone.” The matter will be heard again on August 5.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/why-cant-those-fully-vaccinated-be-allowed-to-use-trains-asks-hc/article35692375.ece
03 August 2021||Mumbai,||Deshmukh skips ED summons again||Former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Monday skipped the summons issued to him by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for a fourth time saying it was shocking that he was being summoned despite the fact that a Writ Petition (WP) filed by him was pending in the Supreme Court which is to hear the matter on August 3. Mr. Deshmukh and his son are being probed by the central agency over alleged money laundering and allegations that bar owners in Mumbai had paid him money. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader in his letter to the ED reiterated that the agency has neither furnished a copy of the ECIR nor the list of documents sought from him and he was available for audio-video electronic mode. “It appears that the subject summons have been issued solely with an aim to create a prejudice so as to either serve the media or sensationalise the matter before the Hon’ble court by alleging purported non-compliance thereof by me,” he said, in the letter. Mr Deshmukh said he was committed to the rule of law and shall not shy away from joining any inquiry or investigation which is not only fair and just but also manifestly appear to be so. The NCP’s alliance partner Congress slammed the ED saying the step to summon Mr. Deshmukh at a time when the apex court was hearing the matter was nothing but a part of conspiracy to defame the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. “The ED sent the summons on July 30, when the court was hearing the matter. The next hearing is planned on August 3. Why can’t the agency wait till the hearing is over? This is nothing but an attempt to defame the government,” said Maharashtra general secretary Sachin Sawant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/deshmukh-skips-ed-summons-again/article35692367.ece
03 August 2021||Mumbai,||Pornography case: HC reserves order on Raj Kundra’s petition||The Bombay High Court on Monday reserved its order on a plea filed by Raj Kundra challenging his arrest and seeking immediate release from Arthur Road Jail in the pornographic racket case. A single Bench of Justice A.S. Gadkari was hearing a petition filed by Mr. Kundra, businessman and husband of actor Shilpa Shetty, and his business aide Ryan Thorpe. The court conducted a physical hearing. Chief public prosecutor Aruna Pai argued that a notice was initially issued by the Mumbai Police under Section 41A (notice of appearance before police officer) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which Mr. Kundra refused, but Mr. Thorpe accepted. She said Mr. Kundra was the admin of Hotshot, the app used to produce and circulate pornographic content. He refused to sign the notice and did not cooperate. She said a lot of incriminating material was found against them and they had to be arrested because they had started deleting messages from WhatsApp groups, thereby destroying evidence. Therefore Section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was added. She went on to say that there was a hard disk in the office which had over 100 porn videos and Mr. Kundra’s laptop had a film script with sexual content. Senior advocate Aabad Ponda, appearing for Mr. Kundra, contended that he was not issued a proper notice and was arrested in the garb of recording his statement. The duo was booked under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force on woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 292 (sale, etc., of obscene books, etc.) of the IPC and several relevant sections of the Information Technology Act and the Indecent Representation of Women Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/pornography-case-hc-reserves-order-on-raj-kundras-petition/article35692363.ece

A division bench of Justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar was hearing a plea filed by advocate Sudha Bharadwaj and other accused in the case. The petition alleged that judge KD Wadane, who granted an extension to the Pune police to file the charge sheet and took cognizance of it, was not authorised to do so. Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, representing the NIA, told the court that no prejudice was caused to the rights of the accused just by Justice Wadane taking cognizance of the charge sheet. He said the Central agency took over the case from the Pune police on January 24, 2020 and, hence, there was nothing wrong in a sessions court and not a special NIA court taking cognizance of the charge sheet filed by police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/no-prejudice-caused-to-bhima-koregaon-accused/article35692368.ece
03 August 2021||New Delhi,||Covishield first dose back after a break||Covishield vaccine was available on Monday for people who wanted to take the first dose after a break, but only in a limited number of slots. On July 22, due to a shortage of vaccines, the Delhi government had ordered that Covishield would be available only for people who need the second dose of the vaccine till July 31. More slots On August 1, the government issued a new order that 20% of Covishield slots will now be available for the first dose and 80% will be reserved for the second dose. On Monday, some people complained that they cannot find a slot online for their first dose of Covishield. Walk-in facility is not available for the first dose in the city in most centres and only people who have registered online can get the first shot. Around 3 p.m. at Navyug School in Pandara Road, which has been turned into a government vaccination centre, 34-year-old Prakash Chandra was seen pleading with an official to allow his wife to get the first dose of the vaccine without an online booking. “We cannot do anything as it is all online. Her name has to be on the list to get the first dose of the vaccine,” the official told him as she walked away. “I have taken the first shot, but my wife is yet to take the vaccine. I have been trying to book a slot for her for a month now, but there are no slots available,” said Mr. Chanda, who works at a private company. Only 20% of the 200 slots at the centre are available online for the first dose and people are coming to the centre after booking online, officials at the centre said. At a CGHS Ayurvedic Hospital in Aliganj, which has a vaccination centre administering Covaxin, Dharam Singh, 40, who irons clothes for a living, was waiting with his wife to get their first dose of the vaccine. “We don’t know how to book it online. A woman, for whom we iron clothes, works here and she booked it for us. We are waiting for her,” Mr. Singh said. Officials at the centre also confirmed that people have to register online before coming to the centre to get the first dose of the vaccine. Sunday’s order also increased the number of slots for the first dose of Covaxin to 40% of the total slots, up from 20%. “Earlier only 45-50 people used to get slots for first dose of the vaccine. From Monday, it has been increased to 90. People are coming even for the first dose. But we are doing first dose only through appointment and second dose even without appointment,” an official at the centre said. The vaccine stock of the city will last for five days and there are 4,76,610 doses of Covishield vaccine and 3,96,990 doses of Covaxin, as per a bulletin released by the Delhi government.

03 August 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi govt. prohibits cross-gender massages in spas||In an attempt to curb sexual abuse at spas and massage centres in the city, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday approved new guidelines that prohibit cross-gender massage, and require larger facilities employing over 10 people to set up an internal complaint committee to deal with sexual harassment issues. The new rules will govern the issuance of health trade licences at these centres. The guidelines seek to check sexual abuse and trafficking in addition to putting safeguards in place to ensure the security of customers as well as employees, the government said. The issue of abuse and harassment at these facilities was flagged in a report by the Delhi Commission for Women. Following this, a task force was constituted to investigate, take appropriate legal action, and review the functioning of such establishments. Other provisions include self-closing doors, prohibition on latches and bolts inside massage centre chambers, and keeping external doors open during working hours — 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.  Separate sections The centres will also need to have separate bathrooms and changing rooms for men and women. They will also have to employ only people aged above 18 who possess a degree, diploma or certificate in physiotherapy, acupressure or occupational therapy. In addition to police clearance certificates for all employees and police verification of the premises, mandatory conditions for obtaining a licence to operate such a facility include prohibition on engaging in any form of sexual activity on the premises. Cross-gender massages are prohibited and facilities must have separate sections for men and women. Customers will have to provide ID cards and facilities must keep a register containing their contact details, including phone numbers. CCTV cameras with recording facility will need to be installed at the entrance, reception and common areas of the centre and recordings will need to be retained for at least three months. An internal complaint committee under the Prevention of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act will also need to be established in centres where more than 10 employees are working.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-govt-prohibits-cross-gender-massages-in-spas/article35692354.ece

Lowest paid legislators According to government sources, the salary of Delhi MLAs has been capped at Rs. 30,000, making them “the lowest paid legislators in the country.” Due to the move, the salary plus allowances of the city’s MLAs has been restricted to Rs. 90,000 by the MHA, sources claimed. ‘No hike since 2011’ The salaries of MLAs, the Delhi government claimed, have not been increased since 2011 and the Delhi government had requested the MHA to raise Delhi MLAs’ salaries to be at par with MLAs of other States. “A proposal to this effect had been pending with the MHA for the last five years. The Capital, unlike other States, does not give added incentives to its legislators such as house rent allowance, for instance, so it was sought to increase salaries given the high cost of living in Delhi,” a source said. “But the ministry has decided not to do so. The issue will be taken up for discussion by the Delhi Cabinet on Tuesday in a meeting which will be chaired by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal,” the source added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mha-restricts-salary-hike-for-delhi-mlas/article35692349.ece
03 August 2021||New Delhi,||HC notice to Delhi govt. on implementation of Mental Healthcare Act||The Delhi High Court on Monday issued notice to the Delhi government on a plea seeking to implement the Mental Healthcare Act 2017 at schools and colleges for the benefit of the student. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh also sought response from the Institute Of Human Behaviour & Allied Sciences on a petition by a 17-year-old student seeking to mandate the presence of clinical psychiatrists, counsellors, social workers and mental health professionals in all schools and colleges. The petition relied on the National Mental Health Survey of India 2015-16 to argue that children and adolescents are vulnerable to mental disorders and the health systems do not prioritise mental health. Psychological impact The petition also said the pandemic has had a huge psychological impact on the students in schools. “Mental health in children manifests in many ways, from insomnia to eating disorders to emotional swings to self-harming, all of which can be treated given the right interventions,” it said. “But in many homes, disturbing behaviour patterns in young person are rarely seen as warning signs; rather they are dismissed as just acting up or, in young children, being extra difficult,” the plea said. “Stress, anxiety, fear, panic, depression, insomnia, isolation, disconnectedness, loneliness, trauma, lack of self-confidence, positivity and resilience etc. are issues widely prevalent in students. However, the same go unnoticed and unattended.” The plea said studies have revealed that most mental disorders emerge by early adulthood and are associated with a substantial delay in treatment. “Untreated or inadequately treated mental illness is associated with progression to more complex disorders, school dropout, addiction, and self-harm etc.,” it said. “Thus, schools and universities need to take a lead role in the development of an integrated system of student mental health care.”    The plea said persons with mental disorders are not only known to be associated with a wide range of social and societal problems but are also associated with a considerable amount of stigma in Indian society, leading to neglect and marginalisation. It said though the National Mental Health programme was initiated in the early 1980s in India, mental health has been often accorded a lower priority amidst competing health and social priorities. The High Court will hear the petition again on September 16.

Justice Rekha Palli also asked the Delhi government to consider allowing more weekly markets to operate as “there is a strata of society that only purchases things from these markets since they cannot afford other shops”. Weekly markets Currently, the Delhi government has allowed weekly markets to open but only with 50% of vendors, and one market in each municipal zone. “It is also expected that street vendors will take proactive steps to get vaccinated so that we can avoid the third wave and Delhi is not faced with a surge,” Justice Palli said. The court was hearing a petition by Saptahik Patri Bazar Association, which has challenged the authorities’ decision to open malls and markets but not weekly markets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/street-vendors-must-get-jab-says-delhi-hc/article35692347.ece
03 August 2021||New Delhi,||AAP says civic bodies owe Rs. 6,500 crore to city govt.||The Aam Aadmi Party on Monday alleged that the BJP-governed municipal corporations have to pay back about Rs. 6,500 crore to the Delhi government. “North corporation owes Rs. 2,407 crore to the Delhi government that they had borrowed in the form of a loan, yet it has decided to give funds of Rs. 50 lakh to its councillors. BJP-ruled corporations waste money on corruption and do not pay salaries to the employees so that they will sit on strikes and the municipal bodies can extort money from the Delhi government,” said AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj. He alleged that giving Rs. 50 lakh to their own councillors while “withholding” salaries of doctors, nurses, and sanitation workers for six months clearly shows BJP’s mentality. Mayors meet L-G The statement came on a day when the mayors of the three municipal corporations in Delhi jointly met Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal and sought his intervention in seeking release of funds “due” to the civic bodies from the city government. Delhi BJP Spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the Delhi government has to pay pending dues of around Rs. 13,000 crore to the civic bodies as per the yet-to-be implemented recommendations of the third and fourth Delhi Finance Commissions. “There are some loans on the civic bodies but they were given prior to 2015 before Mr. Kejriwal came to power,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/aap-says-civic-bodies-owe-rs-6500-crore-to-city-govt/article35692355.ece

Some passersby found the man lying motionless in the car at Mankoli junction in Bhiwandi on Sunday and alerted the police, the official from the city police control room said. The police sent the body for post-mortem, the official said, adding that the man was allegedly strangulated. The victim earlier worked as a manager at a powerloom unit in Bhiwandi. However, he lost his job following the novel coronavirus-induced lockdown and had been working as a driver with a cab aggregator for the last one month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mans-body-found-in-car-in-thane-murder-suspected/article35692361.ece
03 August 2021||Beijing,||Millions under lockdown in China||Millions of people were confined to their homes in China on Monday as the country tried to contain its largest coronavirus outbreak in months including seven positive tests found in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in late 2019. China reported 55 new locally transmitted cases on Monday as an outbreak of the fast-spreading Delta variant reached over 20 cities in more than a dozen provinces. The Wuhan cluster came after the official daily tally was released, but it was confirmed by state media, which said the infections had been traced to a train station. “The seven were identified as migrant workers,” Xinhua reported, citing COVID-19 prevention and control officials. Major cities, including Beijing, have now tested millions of residents while cordoning off residential compounds and placing close contacts under quarantine. Authorities in the capital met and agreed on the need to “raise vigilance, take strict precautions and defend (the city) to the death, sparing no expense,” in comments put out by the Beijing government. ‘Situation grim’ Elsewhere, over 1.2 million residents were placed under strict lockdown for the next three days in the central city of Zhuzhou in Hunan province on Monday, as authorities roll out a citywide testing and vaccination campaign, according to an official statement. “The situation is still grim and complicated,” the Zhuzhou government said. China had previously boasted of its success in bringing domestic cases down to virtually zero after the coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/millions-under-lockdown-in-china/article35692010.ece
03 August 2021||New York,||J&K is integral & inalienable part of India, says Tirumurti||Jammu and Kashmir is an integral and inalienable part of India and if there needs to be a change in status it is the vacation of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), India’s Permanent Representative to the UN and president of the UN Security Council for the month of August T.S. Tirumurti said on Monday. India, currently a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the 2021-22 tenure, assumed the rotating presidency of the powerful UN organ for the month of August. Briefing reporters at the UN Headquarters on Monday, Ambassador Tirumurti said India would host signature events on the key themes of maritime security, counter-terrorism and peacekeeping. In response to a question on Jammu and Kashmir and the abrogation of Article 370, Mr. Tirumurti said, “Right at the outset, I do want to make something very clear that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral and inalienable part of India. I think it’s important to recognise that. And the issues relating to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir are internal affairs of India. In fact, even the members of the Security Council, when this was brought up, almost all of them agreed that this issue was not for the Council to discuss.” In response to another question on UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ statement of August 8, 2019, on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Tirumurti said, “As I told you, Jammu and Kashmir is an integral and inalienable part of India. If there needs to be a change in status, it is the vacation of the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.” The Secretary General’s 2019 statement had recalled the 1972 agreement on bilateral relations between India and Pakistan — the Simla Agreement — which states that the final status of Jammu and Kashmir is to be settled by peaceful means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/jk-is-integral-inalienable-part-of-india-says-tirumurti/article35692121.ece
03 August 2021||Hong Kong,||Hong Kong Cantopop star charged for poll rally singing||A prominent Hong Kong popstar was charged on Monday with corruption for singing at an election rally of a pro-democracy politician, authorities said, the latest figure critical of China to face prosecution. Anthony Wong Yiu-ming, a local Cantopop singer and one of the city’s most visible LGTBQ activists, was arrested by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), which answers to the city’s leader. The watchdog said they charged Mr. Wong and former lawmaker Au Nok-hin with engaging in corrupt conduct by providing “entertainment to induce others to vote for the candidate” at a rally Mr. Au held on March 3, 2018 in the run-up to local legislature elections. The arrests come as Hong Kong authorities carry out a widespread crackdown on dissent following huge and often violent pro-democracy protests two years ago. “At the rally, Wong performed two songs on stage. At the end of the performance, he appealed to the participants of the rally to vote for Au at the election,” the ICAC said. The offence can lead to up to three years in jail and a fine of up to HK$200,000 ($26,000). Both Mr. Wong and Mr. Au will appear in court on Thursday to plea. Hong Kong’s anti-corruption watchdog has begun taking a more proactive role in bringing prosecutions against the city’s pro-democracy opposition. Last week, they announced corruption charges against jailed dissident Benny Tai and two others relating to pro-democracy adverts placed in newspapers five years ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hong-kong-cantopop-star-charged-for-poll-rally-singing/article35692004.ece
03 August 2021||Peshawar,||Pak. polio vaccination team attacked, police officer killed||Gunmen on Monday shot and killed a police officer assigned to protect a polio vaccination team in northwestern Pakistan, an official said. It was the third attack in two days on Pakistani policemen assigned to protect polio workers. The deadly attack took place in the town of Kolachi in the Dera Ismail Khan district. Officer Dilawar Khan was on his motorcycle, heading to escort polio workers taking part in a nationwide campaign aimed at making Pakistan a polio-free state. ‘Western conspiracy’ The gunmen fled the scene and a police search is underway, according to Mohammad Aslam, a local police official. Pakistani militants often target polio teams and police assigned to protect them, claiming the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Two attacks targeted police working with polio teams on Sunday. In Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, gunmen killed a policeman returning home after security duty with polio workers. And a roadside bomb went off near a police van escorting a polio vaccination team in the district of South Waziristan, wounding an officer. None of the medics on the polio teams were hurt in these attacks. No one immediately claimed responsibility for any of the attacks. Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan are the only two remaining countries in the world where polio is endemic, after Nigeria was last year declared free of the virus. Last week, Prime Minister Imran Khan's government launched another polio vaccination drive in an effort to eradicate the crippling disease by the end of the year. According to authorities, as many as 23.6 million children are to be vaccinated in this latest anti-polio drive. On Sunday, Aimal Khan, a spokesman for the anti-polio programme in northwestern Pakistan, said the vaccination effort would continue despite the challenges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pak-polio-vaccination-team-attacked-police-officer-killed/article35692011.ece

The Henan provincial government said 302 people died and 50 remain missing. The vast majority of the victims were in Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, where 292 died and 47 are missing. Ten others died in three other cities, officials said. Record rainfall inundated the city on July 20, turning streets into rushing rivers and flooding at least part of a subway line. Video posted online showed vehicles being washed away and desperate people trapped in subway cars as the waters rose. Fourteen people died in the subway flooding. The previous death toll, announced on Friday, was 99. Authorities said 189 people were killed by floods and mudslides, 54 in house collapses and 39 in underground areas such as basements, garages and subway Line. The worst came after Zhengzhou was hit by 20 cm of rain in one hour starting at 4 p.m. on July 20, overwhelming the already drenched city. Children were trapped in schools, and stranded people stayed in their workplaces overnight.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/death-toll-triples-to-over-300-in-china-flooding/article35692000.ece
03 August 2021||Kuala Lampur,||Malaysia MPs protest Parliament closure||Police blocked Opposition lawmakers from marching on Monday to protest a two-week lockdown of Malaysia’s Parliament, which they consider another ploy for the embattled prime minister to dodge a no-confidence vote. With a crucial parliamentary session due, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin instead postponed it and Parliament will be shut for two weeks. The Health Ministry said Parliament was deemed a high-risk venue because four of 11 COVID-19 cases detected among staff and others were suspected to be the fast-spreading delta variant. Lawmakers and activists questioned the timing of the announcement of Parliament’s closure, which came after the King rebuked Mr. Muhyiddin’s government on Thursday for misleading Parliament on the status of ordinances it issued during the seven-month coronavirus state of emergency. The opposition immediately filed a motion of no-confidence against Mr. Muhyiddin that was expected to have been raised Monday. Dozens of lawmakers gathered near Parliament held a banner calling for the resignation of Mr. Muhyiddin and his Cabinet. Mr. Muhyiddin has led an unstable, unelected alliance since March 2020 after he initiated the downfall of the reformist government that won the 2018 elections. Parliament has been shut down for several months just after he took office.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/malaysia-mps-protest-parliament-closure/article35692006.ece
03 August 2021||Washington,||Democrats call on Biden to extend eviction ban||House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the House Democratic leaders called on the Biden administration to immediately extend the nation’s eviction moratorium, calling it a “moral imperative” to prevent Americans from being put out of their homes during a COVID-19 surge. An estimated 3.6 million Americans are at risk of eviction, some as soon as Monday. Congress was unable to pass legislation swiftly to extend the ban, which expired at midnight Saturday, and the Democratic leaders said in a statement that it was now up to President Joe Biden’s administration to act. They called on the administration to extend the moratorium through October 18. ‘Moral imperative’ “Action is needed, and it must come from the Administration,” Pelosi said Sunday night in the statement signed by Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Whip James E. Clyburn and Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark. “Science and reason demand that they must also extend the moratorium in light of the Delta variant. Doing so is a moral imperative.” The White House, which has urged localities and states to tap aid already approved by Congress, had no direct response to the Democrats’ call for action. Some Democratic lawmakers said they were caught by surprise last Thursday when Mr. Biden announced that he would not extend the moratorium again in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling that suggested congressional action was necessary for another extension. Lawmakers were left with only days to act before the ban expired, creating frustration and exposing a rare rift with the administration. On Sunday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said that Democrats had to “call a spade a spade” and pointed to her own party. “We cannot in good faith blame the Republican Party when House Democrats have a majority,” she told CNN. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats joined Rep. Cori Bush, who camped outside the Capitol over the weekend in protest. Another source of frustration for lawmakers is the slow pace of pandemic relief approved by Congress — nearly $47 billion in federal housing aid to the States — getting to renters and landlords owed payments. Mr Mr. Biden has called on local governments to “take all possible steps” to disburse the funds immediately. “There can be no excuse for any state or locality not accelerating funds to landlords and tenants that have been hurt during this pandemic,” Mr. Biden said in a statement Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/democrats-call-on-biden-to-extend-eviction-ban/article35692013.ece

03 August 2021||August 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Fathoming serosurvey data, with caution||The past two weeks have seen the release of the Fourth National Seroprevalence Survey for COVID-19 (https://bit.ly/3lklMzJ), as well as the reporting of data of serosurveys independently conducted by State governments such as in Tamil Nadu. The data from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) conducted national serosurvey are truly remarkable, indicating that between December-January, when the third serosurvey was conducted, and June-July 2021, at least 40% of the population of India, over 500 million people, were exposed to the novel coronavirus of which a small proportion have antibodies because they were vaccinated. The data also show for the first time that over half of all children tested have already been infected, which is expected and reassuring. Not from infection alone Such a high rate of infection seems incredible, and if true, needs to serve as a warning to India and the world because it shows the consequences of a combination of variants, inappropriate population behaviour and delayed implementation of public health measures. It is, of course, evident, that all of the seropositivity did not come from infection alone, but given that the seropositivity rate was 67% and the serosurvey reports that a quarter of eligible adults were vaccinated, a large proportion of the antibodies resulted from detected and undetected infections in the first or second waves, with the sharp seropositivity rise indicating that the bulk must have occurred during the second wave. With less than 32 million positive cases, of which many may be positive more than once, and the likelihood of waning antibodies leading to some of those previously infected testing negative subsequently, the seropositivity of 67% is an under-estimate. There are other caveats as well. Although the serosurvey methodology is similar to previous rounds and sampled individuals in 70 districts in 21 States, it is not clear how representative the survey really is — given the reported two-dose vaccine coverage of 13% in adults which is much higher than the national coverage at the time, and the known high heterogeneity between and within States. This is where State-level data can be useful, and the third Tamil Nadu serosurvey, conducted in over 26,000 participants and compared to previous rounds allows comparison of at least district-level information. Data from the States The National Serosurvey data indicated that Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Gujarat have over 75% seropositivity, while only Maharashtra, Assam and Kerala were below 60%, with Kerala the lowest, at 44.4%. Although heterogeneity across districts is likely, the fact that the national serosurveys were repeated in the same districts allows for some comparison of seropositivity rates over time. For example, in Kerala, when the national rates were approximately 0.7%, 7% and 24%, the corresponding rates were 0.3%, 0.9% and 11.6% during the first three rounds of serosurveys, showing a consistently lower exposure than the national average, but a large increase between the third and fourth serosurveys. If we examine the data from Tamil Nadu, where the State-led serosurveys were done in October 2020, April and July 2021, some figures jump out. There appeared to be no change from October to April at the State level, with 31% and 29% positivity, but then there was a massive increase to 66%. Comparing the ICMR survey in three districts with the 38 district surveys of the Tamil Nadu Directorate of Public Health, shows that the ICMR serosurveys found a seropositivity of 43%, 24% and 31% in the districts of Chennai, Coimbatore and Thiruvannamalai in the serosurvey in December 2020-January 2021. The corresponding figures from the State serosurvey were 41%, 22% and 36% in October 2020, 49%, 20% and 34% in April 2021, which rose to 82%, 43% and 68% in July 2021. Some districts showed marked variability, with the central and southern districts showing significant declines in antibodies between October 2020 and April 2021 followed by a large increase in July 2021. For example, Madurai went from 40% to 19% to 79% and Thoothukudi from 39% to 21% to 72%. Explaining variation What explains these variations and how can these data be used at the national-State levels? First, there was inconsistency in the assays used for antibody estimation, with the ICMR using an ELISA test that measured antibodies to inactivated virus in its first round and then switching to a method that measured antibodies to nucleocapsid and spike proteins. Tamil Nadu used a chemiluminescence method for all its assays, while serosurveys in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and other local serosurveys have used different methods — which means that some of the variations may be due to the testing methods which have varying sensitivity and specificity for antibodies directed against different viral antigens. Second, the sampling methods across serosurveys have differed with the ICMR using a cross-sectional survey in 70 districts that were decided/based on reported cases with some lack of clarity on how villages/wards were chosen, while others have used population proportional to size, directed and convenience sampling. Third, the age groups have varied across surveys and with time and not all serosurveys have reported age-stratified results. Fourth, antibodies decay with time, as illustrated in the data from Tamil Nadu’s first and second serosurveys. So, analyses need to account for the underestimation of exposure. There are many other considerations for analysis, such as the proportion of people included who have reported previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure or the proportion vaccinated. But in general, serosurveys more accurately reflect the experience of the population with an infectious agent than reported cases. This is especially true in India, where without targeted effort and sometimes despite detailed search, it is not possible to discern the reasons for testing, the numbers of individuals that have contributed to cumulative testing, the locations where tests were done or the types of tests used — all of which are essential to understanding the strengths and limitations of the data on reported cases, and the test positivity rate. Reported cases represent the tip of the iceberg for a virus that can cause asymptomatic infection or result in mild symptoms that are not distinguishable from other respiratory viral infections. Serological data has value for public health because knowing where and how many have already been exposed to the virus gives a clearer picture of how and when infection has penetrated the population. The data from the ICMR’s Fourth National Seroprevalence Survey therefore, have clear implications for the situation in India today. The Kerala example When Kerala is reporting the bulk of the country’s positive cases and has a reproductive rate of infection of greater than 1, how concerned should we be? Seroepidemiology shows that the State has over 18 months been able to limit the exposure of its population, and vaccination data indicates that the State is outperforming most others. In general, the health-care infrastructure has not been overwhelmed, deaths are low, and shortages of oxygen and hospital beds have not been reported. Relaxation of restrictions over Eid on July 21 are likely to have resulted in cases which should peak in the first week of August, but there is a need to ensure continued population compliance with restrictions, particularly with Onam approaching and a need to ramp up vaccination. In fact, given Kerala’s success in controlling the virus so far, a key consideration should be whether States and districts with the lowest seroprevalence should receive a greater proportion of the vaccines while supplies are limited. The immunity gap identified in Kerala demonstrates the value of serosurveillance and the need to ensure that we continue to use this very valuable tool not just to record the history of viral circulation in India but also to inform decisions going forward. At the State and district levels, what can be changed based on serosurvey data? Increasing vaccination in areas with the lowest exposure in parallel with ensuring high testing levels and health-care system preparedness in areas with high vulnerability are immediate responses. However, serosurveys need to be continued and the data integrated with testing, vaccination and clinical data. These are needed to understand ongoing infection rates, age distribution of infections and cases, where variations could be driven by seasonal coronavirus exposure, vaccination and the effect of waning antibodies, all of which will be essential to inform policies on the need and use of booster doses and long-term system preparedness.

03 August 2021||August 03 2021 00:00 IST,||The hacking of Indian democracy||The Pegasus revelations reflect an attack on Indian democracy and Indian citizens. Was the government directly responsible for the surveillance of a select group of Indian activists, politicians and journalists and others? Or was the surveillance at the instance of a private player? With the government in denial, a commission of inquiry by a sitting Supreme Court judge can alone unravel the mystery. National security is important, but it can have an impact on human rights and civil liberties. The use of surveillance has serious implications for privacy. But the list of people targeted prima facie shows that national security is a pretext to suppress political and societal dissent in India. Acting according to conscience Pegasus is a technology sold to governments to fight terrorism. The Israeli Supreme Court, in September 1999, said in Public Committee Against Torture in Israel v. Israel that shaking, waiting in the ‘Shabach’ position, the frog crouch, excessively tight handcuffs and sleep deprivation were illegal. It held that they granted General Security Service investigators “the authority to apply physical force during interrogation of suspects suspected in involvement of... terrorist activities, thereby harming suspects’ dignity and liberty”. This, it said, “raises basic questions of law and society, of ethics and policy and of the rule of law and security.” Speaking for the Court, President A. Barak declared, “This decision opened with a description of difficult reality in which Israel finds herself... We are aware that this decision does make it easier to deal with that reality. This is the destiny of a democracy... A democracy must sometimes fight with one hand tied behind its back. Even so, a democracy has the upper hand. The rule of law and the liberty of an individual constitute important components in its understanding of security.” He concluded, “We are aware of the harsh reality of terrorism in which we are, at times, immersed. The possibility that this decision will hamper the ability to... deal with terrorist and terrorism disturbs us. We are, however, judges... in deciding the law we must act according to our purest conscience.” NSO Group and the Indian government must be reminded of these words. In the name of fighting terrorism, democracy cannot be undermined. Indian democracy is founded with the cherished ideals enshrined in the Constitution. It belongs to the people and not to political parties. The surveillance of the target group raises doubts about the functioning of democracy in India. The chilling effect, if the government were to succeed, would be to turn democracy into a dictatorship. The government has a constitutional duty to protect the fundamental and human rights of its citizens, irrespective of who they are. Even if the government is not complicit in the surveillance, it has miserably failed in discharging this duty. There is clear evidence that the rule of law has been undermined. More evidently, this reflects extremely poor governance. The Intelligence Bureau, the Research and Analysis Wing, and the National Security Council Secretariat should have forewarned the government and citizens against such surveillance seriously violating privacy and fundamental rights. Their silence speaks volumes about either complicity or poor governance. This being the case, an inquiry at the highest level under the supervision of the judiciary is a constitutional necessity. If this does not take place, India will cease to call itself a democracy. The Supreme Court, in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017), declared privacy a constitutionally protected value. The right to privacy is not absolute and its curtailment can take place only under a law which is just, reasonable and fair and subject to constitutional safeguards. India is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 12 provides that “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.” The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, also signed by India, in Article 17 states, “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.” In K.S. Puttaswamy , the Supreme Court noted India’s commitments under international law and held that by virtue of Article 51 of the Constitution, India has to endeavour to “foster respect for international law and treaty obligations...” The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 is a fallout of this commitment. Recommendations of UNHCHR The annual report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) in 2014 made fundamental observations and recommendations on “digital communications technologies”. It said, “by amplifying the voices of human rights defenders and providing them with new tools to document and expose abuses, these powerful technologies offer the promise of improved enjoyment of human rights.” But “communications technologies also have enhanced the capacity of Governments, enterprises and individuals to conduct surveillance, interception and data collection....” Earlier, due to concerns of member states, the General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/167 affirming that rights held by people offline must also be protected online and called upon all states to respect and protect the right to privacy, including in digital communication. The UNHCHR report also stated, “Judicial involvement that meets international standards relating to independence, impartiality and transparency can help to make it more likely that the overall statutory regime will meet the minimum standards that international human rights law requires. At the same time, judicial involvement in oversight should not be viewed as a panacea...” It recommended an independent oversight body to keep checks and stated, “The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires states parties to ensure that victims of violations of the Covenant have an effective remedy....” The report also dealt with the role of businesses and stated that when a state requires that an information and communications technology company provide user data, it can only supply it in respect of legitimate reasons. Surprisingly, NSO, in its Transparency and Responsibility Report 2021, informed interested parties that it “strives to guarantee that our products are used... safely, effectively and ethically.” If described options available if one of its customers “has acted in bad faith, or used one of our tools to target the electronic communications of someone who falls outside the prescribed target scope.” It outlined the range of options available to it if this happened, including “completely ending a customer’s access to our systems, as a situation may warrant.” It stated, “We very much see today’s release as a newly added necessity to the complex, ongoing international debate over electronic surveillance. We are opening our own processes to even deeper scrutiny...” Was this report prepared fearing the worst in the wake of the ongoing international debate? Indians have a right to call upon NSO to terminate the agreement, if any, with the Indian government or any private player and to cooperate with citizens to unravel the truth.

03 August 2021||August 03 2021 00:00 IST,||A disconcerting picture behind the headline numbers||The third annual round of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data conducted during July 2019-June 2020 was released recently (https://bit.ly/3flSDAx). The PLFS captures key indicators of the labour market such as the labour force participation rate (LFPR) — the proportion of population working or seeking work; worker-population ratio (WPR) — the proportion of population that is working; and the unemployment rate (UR) — the proportion of population in the labour force that is seeking but unable to find work. It also provides data on the earnings of different segments of workers. The PLFS 2019-20 was expected to provide official estimates of the labour market distress that followed dwindling GDP growth and a lockdown following the novel coronavirus pandemic that brought several economic activities to a standstill. The data, however, show a decline in the unemployment rate to 4.8% in 2019-20 — the lowest in three years. While the headline numbers may seem pleasing, a detailed analysis paints a rather disconcerting picture. Falling unemployment rate The LFPR, WPR and UR are measured using two approaches — usual status and current weekly status. The usual status considers the activity of an individual over a relatively long period during the last 365 days, whereas the current weekly status is based on activity performed during the reference period of the last seven days. The unemployment rate, as measured by the usual status, fell from 6.1% in 2017-18 to 4.8% in 2019-20. This is because even as the LFPR increased from 36.9% to 40.1%, the WPR increased from 34.7% to 38.2% during the same period. In other words, while there was an increase in the share of the population in the labour force over the last three years, there was an even higher increase in the share of those who were able to find work, and hence unemployment fell. A fall in the unemployment rate would be heartening, except, it seems puzzling as it comes at a time of unprecedented economic distress. The quarterly GDP growth declined for successive quarters, sliding from 8.2% in January-March 2018 to 3.1% in January-March 2020, after which the economy contracted by 23.9% during April-June 2020. Workforce composition How were more people able to find jobs when economic activities were slowing down? The answer lies in the changing composition of the workforce. The PLFS categorises the workforce into self-employed (which includes own account workers, employers and unpaid helpers in family enterprises); regular wage/salaried workers and casual labourers. Own account workers run small enterprises without hiring any labour but may take help from family members, while employers hire workers. Of all the worker categories, only the proportion of unpaid family workers has gone up significantly in the last three years. In fact, between 2018 and 2019, while the workforce increased by 2.9%, the proportion of all other employment categories in the workforce declined, except unpaid family helpers. Over the same period, almost the entire rise in the workforce was accommodated by agriculture. Agriculture continues to perform the function of a sink — absorbing the workforce that cannot find remunerative employment elsewhere. There is also a gendered dimension to the changing composition of the workforce. The category of unpaid family workers is dominated by women. The story of the declining unemployment rate can largely be explained by a movement of women from primarily being engaged in domestic work to agriculture and other petty production activities as unpaid family helpers, possibly in the hope of increasing family income in the times of unprecedented distress and lack of alternative employment opportunities. The usual status is based on a loose definition of work that underestimates open unemployment. This is where the alternative measure of unemployment is relevant. Using the current weekly status approach, the unemployment rate was estimated to be 8.8%, unchanged during the last three years. Impact of the lockdown The PLFS survey for April-June 2020 overlapped with the national lockdown. The current weekly status unemployment rate in this quarter was 14%, and the urban unemployment rate was around 20%. Corrected for inflation, the average monthly income for the salaried increased by 2% in April-June 2020 over April-June 2019. The monthly earnings of the self-employed declined by 16% and the daily wage for casual workers declined by 5.6% over the same period. The real monthly per capita consumer expenditure declined by 7.6%. The rise in the average income of salaried workers and the muted impact on consumer expenditure, as estimated from the PLFS, do not concur with other data for the lockdown period. Private final consumption expenditure declined by 26.7% in April-June 2020 over the same quarter in 2019. Numerous small-scale surveys also reported massive earnings loss during the lockdown. There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that the PLFS data may underestimate the loss of earnings and fall in consumption during the lockdown. This is a missed opportunity for the official survey to capture the labour market dynamics during the lockdown. Strengthen statistical system There is no official data on poverty after 2011-12 or on farm income after 2013, and no recent data on migrant workers. While the consumer expenditure data for 2017-18 was buried, the data on situation assessment of agricultural households are not yet released, despite being conducted between January-December 2019, before the latest PLFS. Minor tweaks in future PLFS surveys can fill the data gaps. Currently, the PLFS captures incomes from agriculture and monthly consumer expenditure, but the questions on these aspects lack credibility. The predecessor to the PLFS, the National Sample Survey employment and unemployment surveys, collected data on consumer expenditure using a detailed schedule. There is no reason why the PLFS cannot do the same. Adding questions on costs and returns from cultivation and related activities can also capture more accurate data on agricultural incomes. Lengthening the questionnaire has its costs — but the costs of the absence of reliable and timely data on important policy-relevant indicators are far higher.

03 August 2021||August 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Criminalising welfare issues||The Supreme Court recently issued notice on a writ petition on the condition that the petition’s prayer seeking a direction to “restrain beggars and vagabonds/homeless from begging on traffic junctions, markets and public places to avoid the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in all the States and Union Territories across India” be modified to focus on the rehabilitation of those forced to beg for a living. In doing this, the court rightly observed that being compelled to beg was a socio-economic issue that could not be remedied by directions of the kind originally sought. It required, instead, a welfare response from the state. This order points to the largely ignored nexus between coercive measures and welfare issues, which can be a useful guide to making and implementing criminal law in three ways. What should be criminalised? First, when decisions about criminalisation are being taken by the legislature, an important point of consideration should be whether the issue sought to be addressed might be better suited to a welfare response. Salient examples of welfare issues against which the coercive force of criminal law has inappropriately been deployed serve to illustrate the point. In holding the criminalisation of beggary under the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959 (as extended to the NCT of Delhi) unconstitutional, the High Court of Delhi, in Harsh Mander & Anr. v. Union of India (2018), had noted that the criminalisation of beggary served only to invisibilise beggars without doing anything to address the structural deprivations that drove people to beg. Similarly, the criminalisation of triple talaq by the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, purportedly to ‘protect’ Muslim women, does nothing to address the structural gender inequality, social stigma, poor employment options, and lack of state support which actually cause the deprivations associated with divorce (and not just with triple talaq). Second, socio-economic marginalisation and poverty may frequently make people susceptible to exploitation, whether through poorly paid/unpaid labour, trafficking and sex work, or indeed, begging. A criminal response to those who seek to take advantage of such vulnerability (but never the vulnerable themselves) might be appropriate, but it would amount to little more than lip service to the predicament of the exploited without accompanying welfare measures. In other words, it is important to ensure that pimps, brothel owners, and traffickers are held criminally liable for sexually exploiting a person. Equally important is to create alternative, well-paying and dignified employment, to make such employment accessible by imparting requisite education and skills, and to have social security nets to ensure that no person feels that sex work is their ‘least worst’ option. This is essential not only to prevent exploitative practices, but also to rehabilitate those who have been rescued (and/or those who would like an exit option) from such practices. To ‘rescue’ a sex worker is meaningless unless they have a legitimate way out of such work, an option that is materially (not morally) better for them. Focusing on the welfare aspect of exploitative practices also sheds light on structural forms of impoverishment, and on who is most likely to be exploited as a result. It is, thus, largely those marginalised and discriminated against based on gender, caste, class and even age who occupy the ranks of beggars, sex workers, bonded labourers, and child labourers. Such a focus also exposes the culpability of the state and society in creating or enabling the vulnerabilities of those prone to exploitation. This recognition is reflected in the apt remarks of the High Court in Suhail Rashid Bhat v. State of Jammu & Kashmir and Others (2019), “Begging is also in fact evidence of the failure of the Government as well as the society at large to protect its citizens from debilitating effects of extreme poverty and to ensure to them basics of food, clothing, shelter, health, education, essential concomitants of the right to life ensured under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.” Criminal law for whom? Finally, when evaluating the function or necessity of a criminalisation response to something that is essentially or even partly a welfare issue, it is crucial to question whose interests the law does, in fact, serve. Does it help the vulnerable and/or the exploited, or is it a tool of persecution? Does it cater to the morality and sensibilities of the powerful? Does it hide the failures of the state? Or is it a quick fix that allows the government to abdicate and divert attention away from its welfare responsibilities? Only by following these interests can we, as citizens, hope to hold the state accountable in its use of the power to criminalise conduct.

03 August 2021||August 03 2021 00:00 IST,||We need more creators||The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has rightfully identified 21st century skills as fundamental to developing creators. Critical thinking and problem solving, communication and collaboration, creativity and innovation, flexibility and adaptability, initiative and self-direction, social and cross-cultural interactions, and productivity and accountability all strengthen the individuals’ abilities at the workplace. Relying on traditional literacy and numeracy alone will not suffice and tends to marginalise differently abled learners. Educators could consider a design-based approach where students concentrate on a subject for two-three weeks to examine how it can be applied in the real world. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who studied happiness and creativity, said that creation requires ‘deep work’. An individual must be motivated enough to remain immersed in a specific activity to be creative and happy. Teacher training But does our current classroom and content-heavy syllabus enable deep work? Also, how do we retrain teachers who have been trained in traditional systems? They know terms like ‘constructivism’ but do not know how it should be used in a classroom that is focused on exams rather than learning. And how ready are our future educators? In a semester-long study that used Wikipedia as a pedagogical tool for teacher training, 65 pre-service (B.Ed) teachers were asked to improve the pages on Wikipedia related to educational concepts. Excluding a few, the content created by most participants was either sent back to them or deleted by neutral editors of Wikipedia. The content, it was found, was plagiarised, did not provide citations, lacked basic writing and grammar skills, etc. After three iterative cycles that were emotionally intense, the teachers were able to contribute content to over 75 Wikipedia articles in English and over 50 articles in Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Malayalam, Gujarati, Assamese and Punjabi. All the content was related to educational technology. The critical feedback from various Wikipedia editors was crucial because it was unbiased. This feedback forced the learners to re-evaluate their skills. This shows that constant engagement, an emotional connect, and immersive learning are important parts of education. Using technology EdTech apps can deliver content that caters to multiple learning styles, learning curves and pace of learning. The pandemic has shown that traditional teacher and brick-and-mortar schools may become obsolete if radical pedagogical changes do not follow. However, over-reliance on technology comes at a cost. Technology tools are forcing human beings to remain consumers rather than become creators. For example, social media forces you to scroll mindlessly rather than contemplate or engage meaningfully. Entertainment channels create addictive content that makes you suspend reality till all the seasons are done. And with the pandemic shutting down schools, children have lost all personal contact with their social group and parents are forced to rely upon technology to provide their children constant gratification to keep them engaged. With so many immersive distractions from deep work, is it even possible to develop creators? Can technology replace emotional and social engagement? The disruptive nature of digital tools has thrown up interesting challenges to the traditional education system. Educators will have to find ways to upgrade their engagement strategies while integrating technology into their approach through hybrid learning. And while the NEP is catchy, policymakers will have to look again at the school education system if 21st century skills are to be truly actualised.

03 August 2021||August 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Being Bommai||The new Chief Minister of Karnataka, Basavaraj Bommai, has to reconcile several conflicting factors while appointing his Council of Ministers. His predecessor B.S. Yediyurappa was ejected by the Bharatiya Janata Party high command that wants a new start in the State. The new Chief Minister is seen as aligned to Mr. Yediyurappa and both belong to the Lingayat community that is strong, numerically and economically. Mr. Yediyurappa’s heyday might be behind him, but he continues to hold significant sway among voters. Given the circumstance, the challenge before Mr. Bommai is to strike a balance between the imperatives of change and continuity. Mr. Yediyurappa had little moral scruples in pursuing political power and the Bharatiya Janata Party rode on his shoulders until recently. But the baggage that came with it has been heavy. He masterminded large-scale defections from the Congress and the Janata Dal (S) to aggregate an Assembly majority for the Bharatiya Janata Party that it had not won in the election. Allegations of nepotism and corruption shadowed his tenure. The steadfast support that he enjoyed among the Lingayats, who remain the backbone of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s social base in Karnataka, was intimidating for the party central leadership. And when it finally managed to effect a change, it ensured that the baton was handed over to his nominee and not to any of his many detractors in the party. Mr. Bommai has to demonstrate to the Lingayats that he is one among them while trying to reach out to other communities and expand the party’s base. He has to balance various interest groups within the Lingayats. He has to shake off the debris of the past without earning the wrath of Mr. Yediyurappa. He has to demonstrate a capacity to govern better than his predecessor but keep various factions and interest groups that held sway during the previous regime happy. He has to deliver on the priorities of the Bharatiya Janata Party high command on the one hand and also balance his known personal convictions with the requirements of Hindutva politics into which he converted as late as 2008, at the age of 48. Even after taking over as Chief Minister, Mr. Bommai spoke about his father and former Chief Minister S.R. Bommai’s “principled politics” that he said was inspired by Left leader M.N. Roy. Mr. Yediyurappa has said it is the Chief Minister’s prerogative to choose his Council, but also expressed confidence that the defectors will be protected. All this at a time when it remains unclear whether the Bharatiya Janata Party’s plans for him are for the longer term. Having come this far without alienating any section within the party or his support base, it is likely that Mr. Bommai will pass the test.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/being-bommai/article35691843.ece
03 August 2021||August 03 2021 00:00 IST,||The cusp||August has begun on a disconcerting note in India’s coronavirus story. The seven-day weekly average of cases hovers around the psychologically important 40,000 mark and there is an uptick in daily new cases with the latest numbers a little over 41,000. A major concern that has assumed national proportions is the trajectory of cases in Kerala. With nearly 20,000 fresh cases being added every day, it is of concern that if a State with an admirable track record during the earlier wave is under siege now, then many other States could be particularly vulnerable against new variants at the start of a third wave. In Kerala, the rise in cases is concomitant with a rise in testing that has increased from 130,000 a day on July 25 to 162,000 as of Monday, indicating that the infection may be rapidly spreading. Nearly 11 States are now showing a weekly increase in cases. Kerala is not the only point of concern. The national situation has prompted the Health Secretary to write to States that all districts reporting a positivity rate of more than 10% in the last few weeks ought to consider strict restrictions to curtail the movement of people and formation of crowds to prevent the spread of infection. Apart from Kerala these include Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Assam, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Andhra Pradesh and Manipur. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has also expressed concern that 46 districts are showing more than 10% positivity while another 53 districts are showing a positivity between 5%-10%. India’s positivity rate is around 5%, that could well descend into a runaway climb in serious infections if unchecked. The ICMR’s flag-waving comes in the context of the agency’s Fourth National Serology Survey finding that nearly 40 crore Indians likely lacked antibodies to the virus and were particularly vulnerable. On its own, the rise in infections would have been less of a concern had a substantial number of Indians — particularly those over 45 — been double vaccinated. As in previous waves, the elderly continue to be the most vulnerable. Nearly 80% of the mortality was from these vulnerable age groups and only 11% of the eligible adults have been fully vaccinated, which means significant numbers of the population are yet to get sufficient protection. India has so far administered 47.1 crore doses since the beginning of the vaccination drive in January. The Centre has said it will vaccinate all adults, 94.4 crore approximately, by the year-end. This target requires a daily inoculation of 90 lakh to 100 lakh doses per day. For most of July, the average inoculations have ranged from 30-60 lakh. States whose districts are most vulnerable ought to be given preference and there should be accelerated campaigns to double inoculate the elderly. Every effort should be made to break the link between infections and hospitalisation and deaths.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-cusp/article35691844.ece

Mr. Guha drew the Minister’s attention to the reported statement of President Yahya Khan broadcast by Radio Australia that Pakistan was “on the verge of a total war with India” and sought his comment. Mr. Indrajit Gupta wanted to know what information Government had about the military build-up by Pakistan not only on the eastern side but also on its western borders with India. He asked if reports that Pakistan was intensifying the build-up were true and whether they indicated that Pakistan was preparing for committing aggression on India. The Defence Minister, Mr. Jagjivan Ram, intervened to reply that whenever it came to India’s notice that Pakistan was deploying its forces on any part of the border, “we also make our preparations.” Mr. Gupta asked whether the reports of concentration of troops by Pakistan on India’s border were really true. Mr. Jagjivan Ram: “I do not think it will be possible to give more information.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/india-reacts-to-yahyas-statement/article35691856.ece
03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||PMI hints at manufacturing recovery||India’s manufacturing sector stopped shedding jobs for the first time in 16 months in July even as it rebounded from June’s sharp contraction to post its best performance in three months, IHS Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Index survey showed. Manufacturing PMI, which had slipped into a contraction for the first time in 11 months at 48.1 in June, recovered to 55.3 with a marginal increase in employment last month, the research firm said, adding that it was, however, premature to call it a complete rebound in the manufacturing jobs market. “Although marginal, the rise in employment was the first since the onset of COVID-19,” Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit, said in the PMI release. “With firms’ cost burdens continuing to rise, however, and signs of spare capacity still evident, it’s too early to say that such trend will be sustained in coming months,” she cautioned, adding, however, that the industry’s recovery from the June blip was ‘encouraging’. “Output rose at a robust pace, with over one-third of companies noting a monthly expansion in production, amid a rebound in new business and the easing of some local COVID-19 restrictions. Should the pandemic continue to recede, we expect a 9.7% annual increase in industrial production for calendar” 2021, she said. Improving global demand helped bolster manufacturers’ order books with IHS Markit noting that new export orders expanded markedly in July, following a moderate contraction in June. “Rising sales supported a recovery in output, which increased in July after falling for the first time in 11 months during June. The rate of production growth was sharp and outpaced its long-run average,” the firm said. In tandem with rising production requirements, manufacturers hired extra workers in July. The increase in employment, while ‘mild’, ended a 15-month sequence of job shedding, it noted. Sentiment still ‘subdued’ Producers still remain concerned about the pandemic’s path and positive sentiment ‘remained historically subdued’, the firm said. “With demand for inputs outstripping supply, there was another substantial increase in purchasing prices. The rate of cost inflation remained above its long-run average, but eased to a seven-month low,” IHS Markit noted, based on its survey of 400 manufacturing sector purchasing managers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/pmi-hints-at-manufacturing-recovery/article35691834.ece
03 August 2021||MUMBAI,||HDFC net dips a tad; ‘second wave impacts NPAs, collections’||Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd. (HDFC) on Monday said first-quarter standalone net profit was marginally lower at Rs. 3,000.67 crore compared with Rs. 3,051.52 crore a year earlier, on account of lower dividend income and declining profit on sale of investments. However, consolidated net profit for the quarter rose 31% to Rs. 5,311 crore. Profit on sale of investments stood at Rs. 263 crore compared with Rs. 1,241 crore a year earlier; dividend income stood lower at Rs. 16 crore compared with Rs. 298 crore. Net interest income (NII) rose 22% to Rs. 4,147 crore. The collection efficiency ratio for individual loans improved to 98.3% in June compared with 98% in March. “Individual NPAs increased due to slippages on account of the impact of the second wave of the pandemic,” vice-chairman and CEO Keki Mistry said in a conference call. “Collection efforts were hindered due to recovery teams being unable to do field visits during the lockdown,” he added. “Also, various court orders temporarily curbing recovery efforts of financial institutions, including refraining [from] possession activities under SARFAESI hampered the collection efforts,” he said. Gross non-performing loans stood at Rs. 11,120 crore, or 2.24% of the loan portfolio. Provisions as on June 30 stood at Rs. 13,189 crore. Individual loan disbursements grew 181% to Rs. 25,518 crore from a year earlier. Home loans grew both in the affordable housing segment and high-end properties. There was a preference for ready-to-move-in properties, Mr. Mistry said. Housing demand stayed ‘strong’ and business had ‘reverted to normalcy in June and July’, HDFC said in a filing. “Key risks to business [are] a third wave and variants of the virus,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/hdfc-net-dips-a-tad-second-wave-impacts-npas-collections/article35691822.ece
03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Willing to hand over VIL stake’||Vodafone Idea chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla has told the Centre he is ‘willing’ to hand over his stake in the struggling telco to any public or private entity that would ensure the firm’s survival. In a June 7 letter to Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, a copy of which has been seen by The Hindu , Mr. Birla said potential foreign investors were hesitant to invest in Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL) due to lack of clarity from the government on issues such as adjusted gross revenue (AGR) liability, moratorium on spectrum payments and floor pricing. Mr. Birla emphasised that without the government’s immediate support on these three issues, VIL’s financial situation would drive its operations to an “irretrievable point of collapse”. He added that though VIL had been trying to raise Rs. 25,000 crore to sustain operations and pay governmental dues, potential investors — mostly non-Chinese — wanted to see “clear government intent to have a three-player telecom market... through positive actions on long-standing requests such as clarity on AGR liability, adequate moratorium on spectrum payments and most importantly, a floor pricing regime above the cost of service”. Mr. Birla holds more than 27% in VIL while the U.K.’s Vodafone plc holds in excess of 44%. Despite efforts to raise efficiency over the past year, VIL’s financial condition “(particularly the liquidity position) has sharply deteriorated,” he wrote. According to official data, the telecom services provider’s AGR liability is about Rs. 58,254 crore, of which it has paid Rs. 7,854.37 crore. In addition, as of March 31, the company owed Rs. 96,270 crore in deferred spectrum payment obligations and Rs. 23,000 crore to banks and financial institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/willing-to-hand-over-vil-stake/article35691832.ece

03 August 2021||CHENNAI,||CG Power turns Rs. 44.5-cr. net, costs impact margin||CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd. has turned a standalone net profit of Rs. 44.5 crore for Q1 of FY22. The firm, acquired by Tube Investments of India (TII) last year, had posted a net loss of Rs. 421.8 crore in the year-earlier period, the firm said in a filing. Revenue from operations surged more than fourfold to Rs. 954 crore. The results included an exceptional item of about Rs. 5 crore on account of foreign exchange losses. Material costs impacted margins on account of the continuous rise in prices of key commodities such as steel and copper. However, the company was able to partially mitigate the impact through prior procurement and pricing strategies. There was no material impact on the group due to COVID-19, it added. However, it said that during the quarter, operations at its plants were impacted due to lockdown and movement restrictions imposed in the wake of COVID second wave. During the quarter, one of the erstwhile lenders to an erstwhile subsidiary had demanded entire outstanding amount of corporate guarantee worth Rs. 148.5 crore against principally agreed terms of settlement and this is being contested, the company said. The company has made a provision of Rs. 33.63 crore in relation to such settlement.

03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Govts. must help cut car buying cost to lift sales’||Expressing concern over a steady decline in the growth of car sales in the last decade, Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL) chairman R.C. Bhargava said the industry was unlikely to witness reasonable growth rates unless the Central and State governments work towards reducing the initial acquisition cost of cars. “The slowing in the demand for cars is largely because the cost of acquisition by consumers has increased due to various reasons like regulatory changes, depreciation of the rupee, increase in cost of raw materials and taxes imposed by State governments,” he said in the company’s annual report. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) on cars, based on past excise rates, was much higher than in other major countries, he added. On the outlook for Maruti, he said, while in March the company was quite optimistic about the prospects for FY22, the suddenness and ferocity of the second wave of the pandemic was a surprise to all and led to lockdowns and restrictions in most parts of the country. The performance in the next three quarters, he said, would depend largely on how effectively citizens follow the government’s directions on vaccination and observe safety protocols. “If we can avert the third wave, or substantially reduce its effect, and there are no further waves, economic activities and sales of cars can improve significantly over what was achieved last year,” he said. He said Maruti Suzuki expected to be able to work smoothly and without disruptions as more than 90% of its employees and their families were expected to have been vaccinated by the end of August. There was a need to reduce import of oil and harmful emissions, he said, adding that in India, the use of CNG, particularly for small cars, had proved highly acceptable to customers. “Your company will also seek to improve the technology for CNG cars. Hybrid technology also leads to a significant reduction in fuel consumption and emissions and is another area for our engineers to work. Thus, these two technologies, coupled with biofuels, gives the country a means of moving towards the final goal of net-zero emission,” he said. ‘Unprecedented rise’ In the report, the company’s MD and CEO Kenichi Ayukawa added that the challenges in FY21 were not only limited to human safety and business continuity, but also extended to delay in new model development and significant cost pressures led by an unprecedented rise in the prices of commodities throughout the year. Foreign exchange movement remained adverse during the year. Given uncertainty around the sustenance of demand, the company had undertaken a ‘cautious approach’ in raising car prices, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/govts-must-help-cut-car-buying-cost-to-lift-sales/article35691830.ece

In a written reply in the Lok Sabha, MoS (Finance) Pankaj Chaudhary said the arbitral tribunal, which had its seat in the Hague, had on December 31, 2020, ruled in favour of Cairn. “It has asked India to pay Cairn an award amount of $1.2328 billion plus interest and $22.38 million towards arbitration and legal costs,” he said. “An order has been passed by a French court freezing certain Indian Government properties in Paris,” the Minister said. “The same has been communicated through diplomatic channels.” Asked if Cairn had offered any kind of amicable solution to the dispute, he said, “No formal proposal for a solution within the country’s legal framework has been received.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/no-formal-proposal-from-cairn-to-settle-dispute/article35691839.ece

03 August 2021||HYDERABAD,||‘I am sure TPGL will be a trend-setter’||The temptation to wield the club was irresistible on the greens of the Hyderabad Golf Association (HGA) course adjacent to the historic Golconda Fort here. Even for someone like former India cricketer V.V.S. Laxman, who was present during the announcement of 16 teams who successfully bid in the auction for the first edition of Sreenidhi University Telangana Premier Golf League (TPGL) to be held from September 12. Laxman, who was at the golf course for the first time though it is just couple of kilometers away from his residence, initially looked reluctant to take the club and have a try. But when convinced, Laxman finally couldn’t say no. Not surprisingly, after the first attempt to putt the ball from close range, he, like any newcomer to the golf course, looked enthusiastic and excited to play a few more strokes. After the first feel of the golf course it was obvious that this will not be his first and last visit to the venue and he will be a regular. “The atmosphere here is amazing and the Hyderabad Golf Club culture is unique with not much commercialisation,” he said. Being the best “I heard a lot about this course from Venkatapathi Raju. Being professionals, we always try to be the best in any field we choose. I am sure youngsters will take up the sport in a big way thanks to the TPGL with my good friend Dr. Mahhe, chairman, Sreenidhi Education Group, supporting as the title-sponsor, and well-known commentator Charu Sharma being there to lend his experience and expertise,” Laxman added. “I am sure this league will be a trend-setter.” Dr. Mahhe, HGA president Dayakar Reddy, Capt. Bhaskar Reddy and secretary B.V.K. Raju spoke about the plans to promote golf in the days to come.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/i-am-sure-tpgl-will-be-a-trend-setter/article35692505.ece
03 August 2021||Tokyo,||Indian women tame mighty Australia, march into semifinals||The Indian women’s hockey team punched above its weight to beat World No. 2 Australia 1-0 and storm into the semifinals of the Tokyo Olympics. The Indians continued their fairytale run and joined the men’s team in the last-four stage. On Wednesday, the women will face Argentina, which beat Germany 3-0. The Aussies — table-toppers in Pool A — served India an early warning as Ambrosia Malone hit the post in the second minute. But, thereafter, the Indian defence grew in confidence as Gurjit Kaur and Monika kept the opposition at bay. Savita Punia enjoyed a fantastic outing in goal, coming up with nine brilliant saves. Near miss Skipper Rani Rampal came close to putting India ahead in the ninth minute when she parried Vandana Katariya’s pass but was denied by the post. The first penalty corner of the game came in the 20th minute when Nisha was penalised for a push on Ambrosia. The defence was up to the task as it blocked three attempts. India went ahead two minutes later. Gurjit Kaur, who had failed to convert her last nine penalty corner attempts, rose to the occasion when it mattered, and her fierce drag-flick went between a defender’s legs and took a touch of another’s stick before nestling into the bottom of the goal. Salima Tete made a scintillating run shortly after and skipped past two defenders but failed to keep her attempt on target. The momentum had slowly shifted in India’s favour and Australia was struggling to get a hold of the ball. But, in the 33rd minute when Australia did have possession, it let slip three penalty corner chances. And a shot on goal found Savita blocking the way. Australia, the three-time Olympic champion, fought tooth and nail in the final quarter. It won a penalty corner in the 51st minute that was blocked by Savita and Monika made a goal-line save in the next minute. Rising tension The tension in the camp increased as Australia won penalty corners in the 56th and 57th minutes, but Savita booted away the first and pulled off a sprawling save on the second. The women have moved into the medal round for the first time since finishing fourth in 1980. Coach Sjoerd Marjne had earlier said his side’s defence needed to turn up and they did so in style, keeping a clean sheet against the Aussies who had scored 11 goals in the group stages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indian-women-tame-mighty-australia-march-into-semifinals/article35692095.ece

World No. 2 Axelsen beat China’s defending champion Chen Long 21-15, 21-12, taking control early and never loosening his grip in a relentless performance. Axelsen, who won bronze at the 2016 Rio Games, followed in the footsteps of compatriot Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen, the Atlanta Games champion and the last winner from outside Asia. In attendance Hoyer-Larsen, now world badminton’s president, was in the arena to watch Axelsen match his achievement. World No. 6 Chen was bidding to emulate fellow Chinese Lin Dan in retaining his title. But Axelsen held his nerve with the prize in sight, then broke into disbelieving sobs when Chen hit the final shot long. Earlier, Greysia Polii and Apriyani Rahayu won the women’s doubles, breaking a Chinese stranglehold and claiming Indonesia’s first title of the Games. The pair beat China's Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan 21-19, 21-15. China had won every women's doubles gold but two since badminton's debut at the 1992 Games, but the Indonesians came flying out of the blocks and never let up until the final point.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/axelsen-dethrones-chen-for-gold/article35692104.ece
03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Anjum Moudgil backs young shooters||In the run up to the Games, Anjum Moudgil had won the women’s air rifle silver at the World Championship in Changwon. It also won her the Olympic quota. Yet, an Olympic entry in women’s air rifle slipped her grasp, partly because the statistics were not in her favour. The 27-year-old took it in her stride and tried her best in the rifle 3-position event — in which she missed the final by four points — and the mixed air rifle, in the Tokyo Olympics. With a disappointing performance in terms of winning medals for the second successive Games, Anjum, who holds a Masters degree in psychology, understands the repercussions, and thus jumped up to lift the dropping spirits. In an attempt to boost the confidence of the young shooters, Anjum had a message to them keep getting better and keep smiling. “No matter the results, we know the amount of effort and hard work that has been put into it. Let us just keep the fire within us alive. Don’t let any negativity or trolling affect you,” wrote Anjum. Acknowledging the single minded devotion of the youngsters towards Olympic preparation, Anjum recalled how the young guns worked hard every single minute to make the nation proud. “Not oversleeping, no over eating, making sure to rest well, train well, train for hours and hours in the range, and then do dry firing in hotel rooms, staying away from family for months. You are all special lot of youngsters,” Anjum observed. Appreciative In her message, Anjum was particularly appreciative of the efforts of the younger shooters, like Manu Bhaker, Divyansh Singh Panwar, Saurabh Chaudhary, Elavenil Valarivan and Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar. “Accept your performance and let us get started from now to best ourselves soon,” she signed off, expressing her respect for her team mates, and goading them to “keep smiling”, despite falling short of their target.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/anjum-moudgil-backs-young-shooters/article35692209.ece
03 August 2021||Chennai,||Thumping win for Madurai Panthers||The momentum shift arrived in the last six overs of the Siechem Madurai Panthers innings. The surge fetched the batting side 88 runs. The brutal onslaught by J. Kousik and skipper N.S. Chaturved blew away iDreams Tiruppur Tamizhans. The turning point. Madurai had the total it sought; 184 for four. These runs sunk Tiruppur that went down by 81 runs in the TNPL clash at Chepauk on Monday. Early strikes Tiruppur lost early wickets. R. Silambarasan, worked up speed and cleaned up the left-handed S. Dinesh. Then he scored a direct hit from deep to run out S. Aravind. Under pressure, Tiruppur continued to lose wickets. Left-armer V. Gowtham, sharpish on occasions, deceived the in-form Maan Bafna with a slower delivery and K.B. Arun Karthik took a gem in the deep. Left-arm spinner Aushik Srinivas got the ball to hang in the air and Francis Rokins was held at long-off. It was only a matter of time — R. Rajkumar biffed a 28-ball 42 — before Madurai romped home. Sizzling knock Earlier, Kausik sizzled. Growing in confidence and relishing responsibility, the all-rounder is wading into the bowling with bright shots, clearing the field, firing the ball through the gaps, and bowling his seamers cleverly. Kaushik (40, 20b, 3x4, 2x6) and skipper Chaturved (41 n.o., 23b, 1x4, 4x6) sent the Tiruppur fielders on a leather hunt. Chaturved used his feet, and his timing and placement came to the fore. He delivered the big blows too. Having his revenge Earlier, after Tiruppur elected to field, the busy P. Sugenthiram struck Aswin Crist over mid-wicket for a six. The combative Aswin had his revenge, sending back Sugenthiran, (20 off 12) with a delivery that moved away. Arun Karthick, baffling many, did not open. When he arrived in the last over, he struck couple of lusty blows. Productive shots Despite a few productive shots, opener P. Praveen Kumar could not quite force the pace during his 37-ball 35. The left-handed B. Anirudh, an underrated smooth-stroker who can coax the ball through unusual angles on the field, chipped in with a 25-ball 33 that injected urgency. Tiruppur was weighed down by a pile of runs.  The scores:   Siechem Madurai Panthers 184/4 in 20 overs (P. Praveen Kumar 35, R. Sugenthiran 20, B. Anirudh 33, J. Kousik 40, N.S. Chaturved 41 n.o., A. Karuppaswamy 2/14) bt iDreams Tiruppur Tamizhans 103 in 17.4 overs (R. Rajkumar 42, R. Silambarasan 2/8 V. Gowtham 2/14, Aushik Srinivas 2/25).

03 August 2021||Tokyo,||‘Put every drop of energy into the next 60 minutes’||The heavens wept and so did the Indians. When the hooter went off some sank to their knees, others looked to the heavens in disbelief and the bench ran onto the pitch. It was perhaps the fastest 50m dash of their lives. The women’s hockey team had done the unthinkable, beating three-time Olympic champion Australia for a place in the semifinals. Super proud “I seriously don’t know what to say. I am super proud of the team. Before the game we told each other ‘just give everything you have on the pitch today. Don’t look ahead, it’s the next 60 minutes that count. Put every drop of energy into the next 60 minutes and stick to your roles’,” skipper Rani Rampal said. The women executed the plan with surgical precision. They split open the Australian backline at will, scored the all-important goal and stitched it up with a leakproof defence. The match-winning goal came from Gurjit Kaur, one of the seniors in this young squad. Gurjit had been under pressure throughout this campaign — the defence had shipped in 14 goals ahead of the quarterfinals and she had not converted any of her penalty corners. But on Monday, she struck gold. “We had only one penalty corner and it was important to convert that. It was great that my team created the chance for me and each of us gets credit for it,” she said, humble in victory. Another heroine, goalkeeper Savita said the team had been primed to play Australia. “We wanted to face Australia in the quarterfinal because we have played them earlier and know that we can play our natural game against them. They give us space and we took advantage of that today,” she said. Coach Sjoerd Marijne said he had never lost faith in the squad despite the three successive losses at first. Self-belief “We believed in ourselves and the dream that these women have chased. We don’t concern ourselves with the ‘what ifs’. We focus on our job as a team and as individuals, and that’s why we have made it so far,” he said. This bunch of 16 women have dared to dream. And we’re living the dream with them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/put-every-drop-of-energy-into-the-next-60-minutes/article35692091.ece
03 August 2021||August 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Allman dances her way to discus gold as Kamalpreet finishes sixth||As a little girl, American Valarie Allman was a very good dancer and excelled in ballet, tap, jazz and contemporary dance. Impressed with her height and coordination, her high school coach advised her to take up athletics. She attempted the sprints and high jump and came to discus throw by accident, trying the event with an eye on the throwers’ annual spaghetti dinner. Allman danced her way to the discus throw gold with an opening-round effort of 68.98m that left the others fighting for minor medals at the Tokyo Olympics on Monday. Indian hearts were wildly dancing too but in the end, Kamalpreet Kaur — who had raised hopes of bringing the country’s first-ever medal in athletics — finished sixth with a third-round 63.70m on a rainy night which left the throwing circle slippery midway through and the throwers were given a short break. Kamalpreet’s national record 66.59m, which came in the Indian GP in June, would have fetched her the bronze. But that was not to be. The 25-year-old Punjab athlete’s other two legal throws were 61.62 and 61.37. Her sixth place equalled Krishna Poonia’s sixth place at the 2012 Olympics, the best by an Indian discus thrower.  Dutee Chand (PB: 23s, 2018 Asiad silver) finished last in her heat, and 38th overall, in the women’s 200m in 23.85s. It was her first run over that distance this year. Greece’s Miltiadis Tentoglou, this season’s world leader with 8.60m, took the men’s long jump title with a last-round effort of 8.41m. That put him on level terms with Juan Miguel Echevarria’s third round effort but the Greek triumphed as his next best jump (8.15) was better than the Cuban’s (8.09). Moroccan Soufiane El Bakkali ended Kenya’s winning streak by taking the men’s 3000m steeplechase gold (8:08.90s) while Ethiopia’s Lamecha Girma and Kenya’s Benjamin picked the other two medals. And Dutchwoman Sifan Hassan, who is aiming for a distance treble, won her first, the 5000m in 14:36.79s after a patient waiting game while Jasmine Camacho-Quinn took the women’s 100m hurdles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/allman-dances-her-way-to-discus-gold-as-kamalpreet-finishes-sixth/article35692098.ece
03 August 2021||Tokyo,||Kamalpreet hints at cricket career||Kamalpreet Kaur is not too fond of the rain, especially when she competes. But as Mother Nature would have it, the Tokyo Olympic Stadium was drenched with a heavy spell as the 25-year-old discus thrower finished sixth in her maiden Olympics. The downpour made Kamalpreet anxious as she was afraid of falling and getting injured. “I was nervous from the first throw. It began to rain as soon as I started to feel better and that drained my confidence again because I have never performed well in wet weather,” she said. “I am not at all happy. I was hoping to go home with a medal,” she said. Kamalpreet was, however, thrilled to share space with Sandra Perkovic, who won gold in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. “She’s my inspiration. When I qualified for the final, she saw me in the dining hall and came up to congratulate me. It was a dream come true. I felt a little bad that she finished fourth today,” she said. She hinted at swapping the discus for a cricket bat. “I like cricket more. I’ll tell you something that nobody knows — I played cricket in January. “I am fond of batting. Though I like fast bowling, the bowling action and discus action are different and there is a scope for injury. I yearn to play for the Indian women’s cricket team one day.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kamalpreet-hints-at-cricket-career/article35692127.ece
03 August 2021||Nottingham,||‘You need relentless madness’||India captain Virat Kohli on Monday said it takes “relentless madness” and single-minded pursuit of excellence to win a Test series in England. Led by Kohli, India will take on Joe Root’s England in a gruelling five-match Test series, beginning here from Wednesday. “I will answer your second question first, it takes relentless madness and pursuit of excellence every day over a five-Test series, to tell yourself I want to do the hard work and I want to get into situations, which are tough in every Test match on every day. “And you are going to be ready for that kind of workload, and that kind of mental load,” Kohli told ‘Sky Sports’ when asked by former India wicket-keeper Dinesh Karthik on what it takes to win a Test series in England. For Kohli personally, winning in England is nothing more than winning anywhere else and it is all about the team culture of going for a win. “To answer your first question, for me personally, it means nothing more than winning a Test match or a Test series anywhere else in the world.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-pursuit-of-excellence-kohli/article35692102.ece

03 August 2021||August 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Important to start well: Rahane||India vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane has stressed on the importance of starting well in order to achieve a first Test series win in England since 2007. “The conditions are completely different. We played them at home [earlier this year] where the conditions were familiar to us,” Rahane said on Monday, ahead of the first Test in Nottingham. “We have played a lot of cricket here, but getting used to the conditions is the key. Being in the present moment matters a lot. So for us, starting well here at Nottingham is very important.” A majority of India’s core group has toured England thrice but has not been able to repeat the heroics of Rahul Dravid’s team in 2007. To add to that, India has been hit by a series of injury concerns ahead of the series. Rahane himself missed the tour game in Durham with a hamstring injury. Referring to it as a “niggle”, the 33-year-old said he has recovered fully. “I am completely prepared. The preparation has been really good so far for me,” Rahane said. “Even though I didn’t play the three-day game, I was practising on the side. Here in Nottingham, we have had a couple of good practice sessions, so I am completely ready.” Pujara at No. 3 Asked whether Cheteshwar Pujara could be asked to open in the absence of Shubman Gill and Mayank Agarwal, Rahane said, “Pujara is our No. 3 batsman. Who will open our innings, we are finalising our combination. Pujara has been really solid for us as a No. 3 batsman and he will continue to bat at No. 3. “As for the opening batsman, the captain, coach and management will decide the combination and you will get to know soon.”  The conditions are completely different. We played them at home [earlier this year] where the conditions were familiar to us||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/important-to-start-well-rahane/article35692110.ece

Other big names Twice Worlds medallist Chinese Pang Qianyu, 55kg American World champion Jacarra Winchester, Swedish World and Olympic medallist Sofia Mattsson, double World champion Vanesa Kaladzinshaya from Belarus are the other big names. Second-ranked superstar Bajrang, who has consistently got medals in elite events in the last few years, is another strong medal contender. Russian top seed and World champion Gadzhimurad Rashidov, former World champions Japanese Takuto Otoguro and Azerbaijani Haji Aliyev will also be there in one of the most-competitive fields. Rated highly Fourth-seeded Ravi Dahiya (57kg), a Worlds bronze medallist who is rated highly, is keen to prove his worth. His field comprises World champion Yuki Takahashi of Japan, Worlds medallists Suleyman Atli of Turkey and American Thomas Gilman among others.

03 August 2021||MUMBAI,||Concussed Mayank to miss opener||Mayank Agarwal, who was tipped to open India’s innings against England, has been ruled out of the first Test after suffering a concussion during a training session in Nottingham on Monday. “Agarwal was hit on the helmet while batting during India’s nets session at Trent Bridge on Monday,” the BCCI said in a statement. “The BCCI Medical Team assessed him, and a concussion test was conducted. Stable “He has shown signs of concussion and is ruled out of the opening Test. The 30-year-old is stable and will remain under close medical observation.”  The Hindu has learnt that Agarwal was hit on the helmet by a Mohammed Siraj bouncer at the nets. Agarwal’s injury two days ahead of the first Test has added to the uncertainty over Rohit Sharma’s opening partner. Front-runner  After Shubman Gill’s return to India, having aggravated a shin injury during the World Test Championship final, Agarwal was the front-runner to walk out with Rohit. During the three-day tour game in Durham last month, Rohit and Agarwal had opened the first innings while Cheteshwar Pujara had partnered Agarwal in the second. Prithvi Shaw and Suryakumar Yadav, who were added to the squad as back-up, are set to arrive in London on Tuesday. They have completed the mandatory isolation after being identified as close contacts of Krunal Pandya, who tested positive, in Colombo. Shaw, Suryakumar to quarantine again But the duo will have to quarantine again after arrival and are set to be unavailable for the first two Tests. As a result, it will be interesting to see whether K.L. Rahul, who scored a century batting at No. 5 in the tour game, is preferred over reserve opener Abhimanyu Easwaran in Nottingham.

03 August 2021||(Providence,||Windies-Pakistan third T20 washed out||The third Twenty20 International between the West Indies and Pakistan was abandoned following torrential rain, which left the outfield sodden, at the National Stadium on Sunday.  Just eight balls were bowled at the start of the match with the home side reaching 15 without loss before rain drove the players off the field and intensified to such an extent that it left the ground waterlogged in a matter of minutes. Extensive mopping up operations by the ground staff failed to improve conditions for the play to resume. The match was called off 10 minutes before the scheduled cut-off time which would have allowed for the minimum requirement of a five overs-per-side match. Pakistan leads the series 1-0 going into the final match on Tuesday at the same venue. The first match of the series was also rained out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/windies-pakistan-third-t20-washed-out/article35692195.ece
03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Winning back to back medals special’||For P. V. Sindhu, the pain of missing an opportunity to have another crack at the Olympic gold medal now stands replaced by the joy of adding a bronze to her collection. In the space of less than 24 hours, the World champion experienced extreme emotions this weekend. In tears “After the loss in the semifinals (to Tai Tzu Ying), I was really sad. I was in tears but my coach (Park Tae-sang) said it was not over yet. Park reminded me that there is a lot of difference between winning the bronze and coming fourth. That really hit me and I started focusing hard on the match (against He Bingjiao)” Going on to share the moment when she won the bronze-medal point, Sindhu said, “I was blank, my coach was literally in tears, it was a big moment. I hugged him and said ‘Thank you’. I didn’t know what to do for 5-6 seconds. I shouted, so all emotions came together at that moment. Winning back to back medals was very special.” Virtual meet On Monday, Sindhu and her coach Korean coach held a virtual press conference from Tokyo and they were joined by the Badminton Association of India secretary Ajay Singhania. Highlighting the biggest decision that helped her win a medal in Tokyo, Sindhu said it was the decision to train at Gachibowli Stadium early this year. It may be recalled that Sindhu and her coach moved out of the Gopi Chand Academy to train at a nearby stadium to get accustomed to the ‘drift’ that was likely to exist at the venue in Tokyo. “We had this opportunity to play in conditions similar to those in the Olympics. So from February we have been playing there. The drift factor It really helped us because drift played a big role (in the playing hall in Tokyo) and I learnt a lot in Gachibowli. In the last few months, I learnt to control the shuttle better. “Gachibowli has international standard courts with air conditioners, which is important. So I feel it was the best decision.” Park jubilant For Park, Sindhu’s bronze medal meant the world. “For the first time in my coaching career, my player has won an Olympic medal,” said the jubilant Korean, a men’s singles quarterfinalist in the 2004 Athens Olympics. “When I took over, Sindhu was already a big Olympic star. We worked very hard on her defence and we were really going for a happy result. I believed in her. “After the loss in the semifinals, Sindhu was sad. But I thought, if Sindhu wins the bronze, it will be a very big medal. She played very well. So, I am really very happy and I thank Sindhu.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/winning-back-to-back-medals-special-sindhu/article35692101.ece
03 August 2021||MUMBAI,||‘Stokes’ absence a huge plus for India’||The five-Test series against England, set to begin in Nottingham on Wednesday, is being billed as a litmus test for Virat Kohli and Co. Ahead of the series-opener, former India captain Sunil Gavaskar discussed some of the key storylines. Excerpts:  Who should partner Rohit Sharma in the first Test? With K.L. Rahul scoring a hundred in the three-day game, he should be considered. With a hundred under his belt, I think Rahul will have lots of confidence. He is the person I would look at opening the batting, not having Pujara going up to open. Also, don’t forget, the last Test match that Rahul played in England [in 2018], he got a hundred at The Oval. With that in mind, it might be a good idea to look at Rahul as an opener. Will Ben Stokes’ absence make it easier for India? Oh, definitely. Stokes has been the game-changer with both bat and ball, so him not playing is a huge plus as far as India is concerned. There’s also the absence of Jofra Archer and Chris Woakes. Woakes, who had scored a hundred and taken five wickets [sic: four] in 2018 in the second Test. So with the absence of these three players, definitely England have weakened. It actually is very helpful for India. No doubt about that.  Does Pujara need to tweak his approach while batting? Pujara has got to the international level playing a certain way, he has got to trust that method. If the team doesn’t trust that method, I think they have to look for somebody else. But this is a method that’s worked for him, has worked for India. He has held the fort at one end while the stroke-players at the other end have been at liberty to play their shots knowing that there is a solid player at one end. He has got to believe in himself and carry on playing as he knows best because he has done a fantastic job for India over the years.

Finch aggravated a knee injury in the lead-up to the recent T20 series in the West Indies that Australia lost 4-1, and did not travel to Bangladesh. Wade led Australia against India in December when Finch was injured. He has also captained Victoria, Tasmania and the Hobart Hurricanes. He said he was optimistic after Australia recovered from the T20 drubbing to beat the West Indies 2-1 in the ODI series. Wade will lead a depleted side that is missing Steve Smith, David Warner and Glenn Maxwell. Australia will also be without fast bowler Riley Meredith, who suffered a side strain and was ruled out of the series on Monday. Young Tasmanian paceman Nathan Ellis has been brought into the squad. McDermott recovers Batsman Ben McDermott, however, has recovered from the ankle injury he suffered having crashed into sideline advertising boards in Barbados. Australia will play five T20s against Bangladesh at Dhaka’s Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium starting Tuesday behind closed doors. Bangladesh has never won a T20 match against Australia.

Brett Lee, the former Australian great, feels that bench strength has been crucial to India’s success in recent years. “A word here about the Indian bowling attack, which I feel has been fantastic,” Lee said. “They have experienced bowlers and some good young guys coming through. They have enough pace, are excited and enthusiastic, ready to take over from the likes of Bumrah and Shami. This trend may help India do well for the next 10, 15 or even 20 years,” Lee told the ICC website. After making it to the final of the inaugural ICC World Test Championship, India will kick off the 2021-23 edition with a five-match series against England, with the first Test starting on Aug. 4. “The bench strength is crucial for a team to do well and India’s performance in Australia bears testimony to that,” said Lee. “It’s about having 16 to 17 players of same quality and that has made the difference. Teams are not of just 11 players any more. There are some 16-17 of them and it is about having others who are good enough to stand up at the world level at any given time.”  The bench strength is crucial for a team to do well and India’s performance in Australia bears testimony to that||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indias-bowling-attack-fantastic-says-lee/article35692507.ece

New design by Aug. 7 At a meeting of the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation last month, directions were issued to ensure that as many as 107 cycle rickshaws, which will be allowed to ply on the pedestrianised stretch soon, be on the road by September 30.  “The rickshaws are being refurbished with a more user friendly design in addition to being RFID-enabled, according to one of the two models presented by IIT-Delhi. The final design will be approved by August 7,” said a government source. The stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid is now a vehicle-free zone (between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.), but non-motorised vehicles are allowed. The width of the road carriageway is 5.5 metres, there is 5-10 metre wide pavement on either side of the road. Also, there is a 2.5-metre wide footpath on either side of the road. Only manual rickshaws are to be allowed on the redeveloped stretch. They will be marked, regularised, and colour-coded. Their operators will also be given badges. Meanwhile, the Transport Department was directed to set the ball rolling to ensure that vintage-look golf carts are operational on the stretch by September 30. “The department will float a tender for the procurement of such vehicles and select a service provider,” the government source said, adding that a police booth, a toilet, as well as a fire tank will need to be completed by August 31, September 15 and September 30, respectively. Sanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vayapar Mandal, flagged the issue of encroachment on roads. “The authorities are yet to take any action against illegal hawkers and vagabonds in the area. Both issues continue to cause problems for shopkeepers and visitors,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/kejriwal-may-launch-revamped-chandni-chowk-by-august-15/article35692345.ece
03 August 2021||JAIPUR,||Cong. leader’s Jaipur visit triggers speculation on Cabinet reshuffle||An unannounced visit of senior Congress leader Kumari Selja to Jaipur, where she met Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, has triggered fresh speculations about a Cabinet reshuffle in the State. Ms. Selja arrived here on Sunday night and left for New Delhi on Monday morning after holding a meeting with Mr. Gehlot. Though the Pradesh Congress Committee did not issue any official statement on Ms. Selja’s visit, the political observers here postulated that she had travelled to Jaipur to convey a message from the Congress’ central leadership. Ms. Selja, who headed a screening committee to select candidates for the 2018 State Assembly election, is considered close to Mr. Gehlot. The Congress has been trying to evolve a consensus on the impending expansion and reshuffle of the State Cabinet amid the demands raised by rival factions in the ruling party. All India Congress Committee general secretary Ajay Maken, who was in the State Capital for three days last week, had hinted that some Ministers might be dropped to make way for fresh faces. Ms Selja, Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee chief, is also considered a confidante of party president Sonia Gandhi. In a bid to keep her Jaipur visit a secret, the ruling party arranged the vehicles registered in Haryana to take her from the Sanganer airport to the Chief Minister’s official residence. Mr. Maken — the AICC in-charge of Rajasthan — visited Jaipur last week to interact with the Congress MLAs and Independents supporting the Congress in order to get their feedback on the State government’s performance. Several legislators reportedly expressed dissatisfaction with some Ministers and accused them of being inaccessible. ‘Exercise in futility’ Sikar-based political analyst Ashfaq Kayamkhani described the repeated visits of senior Congress leaders as an “exercise in futility”. Mr. Kayamkhani said no party leader could gather courage to challenge Mr. Gehlot, who was unwilling to yield space to former Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot and his supporters, and the Cabinet reshuffle was not likely to take place anytime soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cong-leaders-jaipur-visit-triggers-speculation-on-cabinet-reshuffle/article35692327.ece
03 August 2021||Agartala,||‘TMC will defeat BJP in Tripura’||Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee announced on Monday that he will be visiting Tripura frequently henceforth to ensure the defeat of the BJP in the Assembly election due in early 2023. He claimed that people of the State were eager to replace the BJP-led coalition government with that of Ma, Mati and Manush (Mother, Motherland and People) — the official plank of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamta Banerjee’s party. “I am coming to Tripura again after two weeks. I may visit the State four times a month to prepare the ground to unseat BJP from power,” Mr. Banerjee said at a news conference here. Earlier in the day, Mr. Banerjee tweeted a video to claim that his car was hit by the BJP workers on his way to Tripureswari temple. The State BJP, however, dismissed the charge. Mr. Banerjee later posted another message on his twitter handle: “Despite using all his might, @BjpBiplab SHALL NOT be able to stop me from reaching out to the people of #Tripura who deserve to see the light of Democracy!” The slogan ‘ Ebar Tripura’ [This Time Tripura] was displayed at the press conference venue. Mr. Banerjee said party chief Ms. Banerjee had given him the responsibility to make certain that TMC won in the 2023 Assembly election. “We are certain to do that,” he said. He made two major political announcements: one, the TMC would not ally with the CPI(M), and two, the party would not engineer defections in the BJP for a backdoor entry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/tmc-will-defeat-bjp-in-tripura/article35692331.ece
03 August 2021||Dhanbad/Ranchi,||243 suspects detained, 17 arrested in Jharkhand judge death case||Police detained 243 suspects and arrested 17 persons in connection with the death of judge Uttam Anand in Jharkhand’s Dhanbad district, besides seizing 250 auto-rickshaws, a senior officer said on Monday. Two police officers were also suspended, including one for making the CCTV footage of the incident public, he said. Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Sanjiv Kumar said that 243 persons were taken into custody after raids in different police station areas of the district on Sunday evening. They are being interrogated, he added. “Police have also searched 53 hotels of the district and arrested 17 persons in connection with the incident. FIRs have been lodged against them in different police stations,” Mr. Kumar said. Though the police recovered the autorickshaw that hit the judge when he was out on morning walk, in a special drive, 250 autorickshaws that had documents irregularities were seized, the officer said. Sub Inspector Adarsh Kumar was suspended for making the CCTV footage public, Mr. Kumar said. Pathardih police station in-charge Umesh Manjhi was suspended on Saturday for lodging FIR about an autorickshaw theft two days after the accident, he said. CBI probe ordered Chief Minister Hemant Soren had on Saturday decided to hand over the probe to the CBI. The leaked CCTV footage showed that the judge was jogging on one side of a fairly wide road at Randhir Verma Chowk on Wednesday morning when an auto-rickshaw veered towards him, hit him from behind and fled the scene.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/243-suspects-detained-17-arrested-in-jharkhand-judge-death-case/article35692329.ece
03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Bollywood movie producer held for duping businessman of Rs. 32L||A Bollywood movie producer has been arrested for allegedly duping a businessman of Rs. 32 lakh on the pretext of getting him a loan at a cheaper rate, the police said on Monday. DCP (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said the accused has been identified as Ajay Yadav, who was arrested from Uttar Pradesh’s Mathura. He was previously arrested by the Special Cell of Delhi Police and the Kandivali unit of Mumbai Crime Branch. The accused is the director of Serene Pvt. Ltd. and producer of six Bollywood movies — Overtime, Bhadash, Love Fir Kabhi, Ran-Banka, Suspense and Shakshi. He invested all the cheated amount in producing movies but most of them flopped due to which he suffered huge losses, they said. A businessman from Okhla Industrial Area, Rahul Nath, approached the accused, saying he wanted to expand his business and was in need of a loan of Rs. 65 crore. “The accused presented himself as the director of Serene Films, a reliable Mumbai-based financial consultant. Yadav assured Mr. Nath that the loan would be approved against his property in Delhi’s Satbari for 10 years on 10% interest per annum,” Mr. Thakur said. Yadav sought registration fee of documents from Mr. Nath. He visited Delhi multiple times on Mr. Nath’s expenditure. Fake address After taking the amount, the accused switched off his mobile phone. The address given by him was also found to be fake. The accused had duped multiple people using different names in a similar way, the officer said. During investigation, it was found that a film named Sakshi, produced by the accused, had released recently. A police team was sent to Mumbai. It then came to light that the accused was in Madhya Pradesh’s Indore. He was subsequently found to be in Mathura after which a raid was conducted and he was nabbed. Accused is found to be involved in 11 criminal cases, said an officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/bollywood-movie-producer-held-for-duping-businessman-of-rs-32l/article35692340.ece
03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Minor raped, murdered and cremated; 4 held||A 9-year-old girl was allegedly raped, murdered and then cremated in south-west Delhi’s Cantonment on Sunday night, the police said on Monday. Four persons have been arrested in connection with the case, they said on Monday. DCP (South West) Ingit Pratap Singh said they received a PCR call at 10.30 p.m. regarding rape and death of a minor girl. The police were also told that she was being cremated. On reaching the spot, the police found that around 200 villagers had gathered in the area and the cremation was almost over. They were told that around 5.30 p.m., the girl informed her mother, a ragpicker, that she is going to fetch water from a cooler at the crematorium. “At 6 p.m., a priest at the crematorium, Radhey Shyam, and two-three other persons [all acquaintances] called her mother to the spot. They told her that she got electrocuted while drinking water from the cooler. There were burn marks on her left wrist and elbow,” Mr Singh said. An officer said the priest told her mother that if she reports the matter to the police then the body would be sent for post-mortem and her organs would be stolen. The girl’s body was then cremated. “The parents of the girl then alleged that the minor was cremated without their consent,” the DCP said. Mr. Singh said the crime team was called to the spot for inspection. The mortal remains were sent for post-mortem. A case under section 304 (causing death by negligence), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC was registered at Delhi Cantonment police station. Later, IPC Sections I302 (punishment for murder) and 376 (punishment for rape) and relevant sections of SC/ST and POCSO Act were added. Radhey Shyam, Kuldeep, Laxmi Narain and Saleem were arrested. A neighbour of the victim’s family said: “By the time, the mother reached crematorium, the girl had already been cremated. They poured water to douse the fire. The locals and family are upset over the issue,” she said. CCTV footage The neighbour also claimed to have seen CCTV footage in which the girl can be seen being walking naked. The neighbour claimed that the minor’s mother was being forced to say “it is not a case of rape and murder”. Mr. Singh said technical evidence will be obtained and examined. He also said the minor’s mother has given her statement before the magistrate as well. On Monday, locals gathered and staged a protest at Pankha Road.

03 August 2021||New Delhi,||HC allows woman to terminate pregnancy||The Delhi High Court on Monday permitted a woman to undergo medical termination of her 22-week pregnancy as the foetus was suffering from serious abnormalities. Justice Rekha Palli gave the direction after considering the report of medical board of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). “Considering the report of experts ..., I am of the view that the petition deserves to be allowed. The petitioner [woman] is allowed to terminate the pregnancy,” the High Court said. In India, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act stipulates a ceiling of 20 weeks, for termination of pregnancy, beyond which abortion of a foetus is statutorily impermissible. The 32-year-old woman, who completed 22-week gestation period, had sought permission to undergo medical termination of her pregnancy as her foetus was suffering from various defects and abnormalities. ‘A substantial risk’ Advocate Sneha Mukherjee, representing the woman, said continuation of the pregnancy to its full term not only carried a substantial risk of serious physical handicap to the offspring but also a high chance of morbidity in the foetus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-allows-woman-to-terminate-pregnancy/article35692333.ece

Lakhs of traders will get relief due to the elimination of the mandatory GST audit, considering the audit added a lot of financial burden on the traders,” Mr. Sisodia said. “Earlier, if the GST 3B (self-declared summary of returns) was late, interest was attached to the entire output tax. Now, after the change in Section 50, interest will have to be paid only on the net cash liability.” Similarly, there was a provision to pay tax and fine in case of detention or confiscation of goods. Now, traders and transporters have been given relief from that.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sisodia-briefs-traders-on-changes-in-gst-law/article35692651.ece

Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar ordered that the bail application be listed before Justice Yogesh Khanna on August 6. “List before said bench on August 6 subject to obtaining order of the Chief Justice,” the judge said. Senior advocate Mohit Mathur, appearing for Mr. Hussain, informed the court that as many as 11 FIRs have been registered against his client in connection with the riots and bail applications in three such FIRs from police station Dayalpur were already coming up for hearing later this month before another Bench. He informed that all FIRs have a common allegation of conspiracy and Tahir Hussain purportedly being the mastermind behind the violence. Apprehending “dilatory tactics” by the prosecution if one matter is kept isolated from the other pending pleas, Mathur submitted that the present bail application be also sent to Justice Khanna. “The charge is the same [that] I am the mastermind and people gathered at my house. All others have been released,” said the senior advocate who appeared along with advocate Rizwan Nizami. Advocate D.K. Bhatia, appearing for the prosecution, opposed sending the present bail to the other bench on the ground that the FIR, as well as the role ascribed to Hussain, was also different from other cases. The present FIR pertains to the alleged commission of rioting and other offences under the Indian Penal Code in Dayalpur area. The other two cases pertain to the injuries suffered by two people on account of a riotous mob pelting stones, throwing petrol bombs and firing gunshots from the terrace of Hussain's house and allege commission of offences of attempt to murder and rioting, and violation of Arms Act.

03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Green tribunal pulls up authorities over ‘failure of constitutional obligation’||Following a plea seeking remedial action against discharge of untreated sewage into an irrigation canal in Noida, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) pulled up authorities over “failure of constitutional obligation”. It observed that the officers responsible should be held accountable. Taking note of a report earlier submitted by authorities, an NGT Bench headed by Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said: “Unfortunately, not a single person is shown to have been prosecuted in spite of categorical observations in the reports of statutory regulators. There is no dearth of statutory powers of Noida Authority, District Magistrates, SEIAA, Uttar Pradesh and State Pollution Control Boards as well as Uttar Pradesh Police.” The Bench said: “The said authorities have failed to realise that they are occupying the position of high trust and are meant to protect the public health and environment and not to just enjoy position and perks at the cost of miseries of innocent citizens...Sufferers are helpless citizens...” The green panel has also directed officials of the district administration and Noida Authority to take coercive action against violators. “Action should include accountability of the erring officers, preventing discharge of pollution in th drain, coercive measures against violators – housing societies or others by registering criminal cases, initiating prosecution, assessment and recovery of compensation for the past violations, black listing of the concerned entities such as construction companies, in exercise of their statutory powers following due process of law,” the Bench said. CPCB told to file report The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) was also directed to file a separate report on standards applicable to discharge drains or canals and whether standards of fresh water or flood water applied to such situation in the light of relevant environmental norms. The directions came when the green panel was hearing a plea moved by petitioner Abhisht Kusum Gupta who alleged that untreated sewage was being discharged into the canal by deficient sewage treatment plants in 95 high rise buildings in Noida, industries as well as waste water from upstream from Delhi and Ghaziabad.

03 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Illegal pesticide firm busted, two in custody||The Delhi Police have busted a spurious pesticide manufacturing plant in Mundka and arrested two men, said officials on Monday. The accused — Mohan Lal and Aman — had rented two godowns at Hiran Kudna village two months ago for manufacturing the fake pesticides, an officer said. The duo had made an initial investment of Rs. 9 lakh. A complaint was received from a representative of a pesticide manufacturing company, alleging that someone was infringing the firm’s trademark by producing spurious products. A raid was conducted on July 30 and a large quantity of spurious material bearing the names of several companies was found stacked at the plant in Mundka, the police said. Fake branding DCP (Outer) Parvinder Singh said the accused — Lal, Aman, Vijay and Rajender — were engaged in manufacturing and selling spurious pesticides and fungicides with the branding of different companies. They also used to sell seeds of different crops treated with these fake pesticides. Fake raw material and machinery found at the plant were seized, he said. During questioning, it was revealed that Lal’s son-in-law Naveen runs a pesticide shop in Indra Market, Tis Hazari road. Aman also ran a pesticide shop in the same market, Mr. Singh said. Vijay is also a supplier of spurious pesticides and his accomplice is Rajender. The two are major stakeholders in this business, he said. “Vijay came in contact with Lal in Indra Market. Aman was also roped in by him,” the DCP said. Vijay was responsible for supply, Rajender was tasked with packaging and arranging infrastructure while Lal and Aman looked after production. A manhunt is on for the rest, the police added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/illegal-pesticide-firm-busted-two-in-custody/article35692342.ece
03 August 2021||August 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Growing up non-binary in today’s India||“I knew I was different. I didn’t fit into what boys used to like or what girls used to like, but I didn’t know the words,” says Rubani Singh, 19, a budding pastry chef from Mumbai, who identifies as non-binary and prefers to be addressed by the pronouns they/them instead of she/her. Confused? If the usage of pronouns on social media bios, and the number of young people contacting therapists are any indication, an increasing number of children, teenagers and young adults are identifying themselves as non-binary — an umbrella term for people who do not see themselves as fitting into the gender binaries of exclusively male or female. They may not identify with any particular gender (agender), may not have fixed which gender they identify with most or may not want to be restricted by any gender (genderfluid), may encompass a bit of both genders (bigender), or may identify completely with the binary that’s across from them (someone born female could identify with the male gender and, therefore, chooses to be a trans man). The incongruence sets in because the world doesn’t see them the way they see themselves. Publicly listing the pronouns they are comfortable with on their social media handles is one step towards bridging this. “I don’t see it as a phenomenon, something fashionable or cool. I think it’s because young people have found the language to express what they are experiencing,” says Shelja Sen, Child & Adolescent Psychologist, who counsels gender non-conforming youngsters at Delhi’s Children First, along with her husband, psychiatrist Dr Amit Sen. Children First offers clinical and counselling services. Access to the internet, online support groups that offer safe spaces to communicate, lived experiences, and representation via OTT shows, books and movies, have all helped non-binary people find a voice. Popular celebrities such as singer Miley Cyrus, actors Amandla Stenberg and Elliot Page, and songwriter-singer Sam Smith speaking up has also helped. Perhaps what Smith said in a BBC interview explains it best: “I’ve always had a little bit of a war going within my body and my mind… I’m not male or female, I think I flow somewhere in between. It’s all on the spectrum.” “I can see a clear cultural shift and an acceptance [within a younger age group] of a spectrum of gender identities,” says Dr Amit Sen. “However, what we are witnessing is only in small pockets and the stigma still runs deep.” Fighting on the frontlines to make this change happen is Delhi-based Air Cmde (Dr) Sanjay Sharma (Retd), CEO and MD of ATHI (Association for Transgender Health in India). His journey from commanding Air Force hospitals to taking premature retirement to set up ATHI has been paved with years of personal struggle as his first-born male child — now a 26-year-old trans woman — started exhibiting a non-binary narrative early on. Like most parents, they had initially dismissed it as a phase. “It started with him wearing my wife’s heels, trying on her make-up, and asking me to buy Barbie dolls for his sister which he would then play with. As puberty hit, there was bullying, and as the male features became pronounced, he started withdrawing, became impulsive,” recalls Dr Sharma, who is also a board member of WPATH (World Professional Association for Transgender Health). “At age 14, he came out to his mother thinking he was homosexual. However, he did not fit into that peer group and the mental health issues began getting worse. One day, he bought insulin and tried to inject himself.” Meetings with several mental health professionals followed, but neither that nor medication helped, and the self-harm continued. One day, Dr Sharma got a call from his very disturbed son, wanting to end his life. “I had to make a decision and I decided to stand by my child.” Post-surgery, Tia now works with her father at ATHI, which aims to provide holistic care for trans people.  Finding acceptance at home  The realisation of gender or the questioning of ‘who am I’ starts fairly early. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, by age two, children become conscious of the physical differences between boys and girls, and by the time they turn four, they have a pretty good idea of their gender identity. “When people referred to me as a girl, it never resonated with me,” says Vibha Hegde, 22, a BBA student from Bengaluru who identifies as non-binary. “Sometimes, when I look in the mirror, I can’t recognise myself. My chest makes me very uncomfortable, and I feel like my head has been photoshopped on to my body.” They went through the usual labelling of ‘tomboy’ for their masculine gender expression via clothes and hairstyles, and initially thought they were a trans man. Once they knew, they told their mother. “She didn’t understand at first, but is now very understanding. She told my dad too, but he’s never brought it up. He’s very conservative and I don’t have the courage to talk to him,” they admit. Emotional distress, especially non-acceptance from parents, can lead to several problems. “Many years ago, we had an eight-year-old girl who had strong gender dysphoria and eventually developed severe psychological problems because of it. Anxiety, depression, suicidal tendencies, self-mutilation, massive guilt, confusion, could all be outcomes,” says Dr Amit Sen. Usually dysphoria gets aggravated at puberty, he adds. Parental acceptance is key to a child leading an emotionally and psychologically fulfilling life. But parents often find it hard to come to terms, often blaming themselves and their parenting. Hemangi Vyawahare, a queer affirmative psychotherapist practising in Mumbai and Bengaluru, says several parents call her, worried about whether society would accept their child, would their child be bullied, sexually abused, and so on. “The realisation that the future they have envisaged for their child is not going to be the same now, is what engulfs them,” she says. It’s difficult for young people, too. “The journey can be painful and long. There is confusion and doubt, it takes time to accept, to speak to your parents, to find your tribe. But for a child to hear from their parent ‘I have your back, no matter what’, makes a huge difference,” says Shelja Sen.  Taking it to schools  “I didn’t know I was non-binary,” says Rubani. Growing up, they were equally excited by an older cousin’s make-up and skirts, and a male cousin’s toys. At 13, they used to like wearing shorts but with a palazzo underneath. It was only when their supportive brother showed them a poem that deeply resonated with them that they started searching for online support groups (Pause for Perspective helped), and spoke to their parents. “I feel very privileged that everyone has been so supportive,” they say. Rubani doesn’t feel the need to change their name as it is gender-neutral, and though “there are a few parts I want to dispose of”, they want to understand their body better. They shaved their head during the pandemic but the only permanent step they’ve taken is a fresh tattoo designed by them, featuring the non-binary gender sign. “It’s a big achievement for me.” Not everyone is so fortunate. “Many children who come to me have been dismissed, invalidated, and are coming from a place of hurt. They first ask me if I’m queer-affirmative; what they are basically asking is ‘is this a safe space?’” says Vyawahare.
