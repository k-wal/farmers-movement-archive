27 August 2021||Kabul,||Suicide blasts kill 13 outside Kabul airport||Two suicide bombers and gunmen targeted crowds gathered near the Kabul airport on Thursday, killing at least 13 and leaving 15 injured in the waning days of the massive airlift that has drawn thousands trying to flee the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. A U.S. official said the complex attack was “definitely believed” to have been carried out by the Islamic State group, whose affiliate in Afghanistan grew out of disaffected Taliban members who hold an even more extreme view of Islam. The Russian Foreign Ministry reported the first official casualty count after the attacks. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby also confirmed the blasts, saying one was near an airport entrance and another was a short distance away near a hotel. The U.S. official said members of the U.S. military were among the wounded. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations. Late on Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy had warned citizens at three airport gates to leave immediately due to an unspecified security threat. Australia, Britain and New Zealand also advised their citizens on Thursday not to go to the airport, with Australia's Foreign Minister saying there was a “very high threat of a terrorist attack”. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied that any attack was imminent in the wake of those warnings. Even as the area was hit, the official said evacuation flights continued to take off. One explosion went off in a crowd of people waiting to enter the airport, according to Adam Khan, an Afghan waiting nearby.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/suicide-blasts-kill-13-outside-kabul-airport/article36130392.ece
27 August 2021||Kabul,||Twin blasts kill 20 outside Kabul airport||Two powerful explosions outside the Kabul airport killed at least 20 people on Thursday, just hours after Western nations warned of an imminent terror threat while thousands of people gathered hoping for a flight out of Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban’s main spokesman, said that “between 13 and 20” people were killed and 52 wounded in the blasts, while Kabul hospitals reported six dead and up to 90 wounded. The Taliban condemned the blasts, saying they were in an area under U.S. military control. At least 12 U.S. service members were killed, including 11 Marines and one Navy medic, the Associated Press quoted two U.S. officials as saying. A second U.S. official said the complex attack was believed to have been carried out by the Islamic State group. One of the bombers struck people standing knee-deep in a wastewater canal under the sweltering sun, throwing bodies into the fetid water. Graphic video shared on social media showed bodies lying in a canal adjacent to the airport, where thousands had gathered hoping for a flight out. India said the attacks reinforced the need for the world to stand united against terrorism and those providing sanctuaries to terrorists.

27 August 2021||MANGALURU,||Seven arrested for producing fake RT-PCR certificates||In two cases, the police have arrested seven persons, including two students, on the charge of producing fake RT-PCR test negative certificates at the Talapady border check-post on National Highway 66 for entering Dakshina Kannada from Kerala. The police gave the names of those arrested on Wednesday as Abdul Tameem (19), Haseen (31), Hadil (25), Ismail (48) and Kabir A.M. (24), all from Kasaragod district in Kerala. Mohammed Sharief (34) of Padil in Mangaluru and Aboobacker (28) of Kasaragod district in Kerala were arrested on Thursday. All the seven have been booked under provisions of Indian Penal Code and under the Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Act. The check-post at Talapady is among the 17 established on the border to screen those coming from Kerala for RT-PCR test negative certificate not older than 72 hours. The authorities do not insist upon people to produce this certificate in medical emergencies. And, students arriving for examinations are exempted. A team headed by Police Sub-Inspector Chandrashekaraiah and Health Department official Pradeep on Wednesday found seven persons, including three women, with fake RT-PCR test certificates. The team scanned the QR code and found that the details were different from what was on the certificates that were produced. The three women, who said that they did not know anything about the fake certificates, were released, while the four were arrested. Based on their information, the police arrested Kabir A.M., owner of a car accessories shop, on the charge of creating the fake RT-PCR test negative certificates. On Thursday, a team headed by Police Sub-Inspector Shivakumar and Social Welfare Department officer Nitin found Sharief, a tiles businessman, and Aboobacker, a Saudi Arabia returnee, with the fake RT-PCR test certificates. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar told reporters on Thursday that the city police are yet to trace the person from whom Sharief and Aboobacker procured the certificates. The police are investigating whether there is any link between the fake certificate creators and the agencies that are carrying out the swab test on the borders. Mr. Kumar said that he has shared information about the fake RT-PCR certificates with his counterparts in Kerala Police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/seven-arrested-for-producing-fake-rt-pcr-certificates/article36130846.ece
27 August 2021||LUCKNOW,||Yogi Adityanath reaches out to farmers||In a bid to woo agrarian communities at a time when farmers in western Uttar Pradesh have been protesting for months against the three new farm laws, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has promised to withdraw cases lodged against them for stubble burning while also considering an increase in the procu-rement price for sugarcane. Mr. Adityanath’s efforts to reach out to farmers, especially those in western U.P., come days before the scheduled panchayat called by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a body of farmer unions leading protests around the national Capital for the last eight months, in Muzaffarnagar on September 5. ‘Withdraw stubble fine’ The Chief Minister said his government would not only take steps to withdraw cases and fines imposed on farmers for stubble burning but also ensure that electricity connections of farmers are not cut. Fines imposed on farmers for stubble burning have been a major cause for anger among the community. In another important announcement, Mr. Adityanath said his government was considering increasing the procurement price for cane and a step would be taken after a discussion with all the stakeholders. “The farmer should not worry or come under any influence,” he said on Wednesday at an interaction with farmers under the banner of ‘Kisan Bhaiyo se Samvad’. At a time when farmers in western U.P. could upset the BJP’s poll calculation in the region, Mr. Adityanath vowed to protect the rights of the farmers. “We will not let you have any problems,” he said. From 2010 to 2017, U.P. had pending cane arrears and since the BJP came to power, its government paid dues worth Rs. 1.42 lakh crore, said the Chief Minister. He also promised that sugar mills in western U.P. would start running from October 20, those in central U.P. by October 25 and eastern U.P. by the first week of November. Responding to the Chief Minister’s announcements, Rashtriya Lok Dal president Jayant Chaudhary, whose party has been at the forefront of the protests, tweeted: “Why did you not increase the procurement price for cane? You had promised to pay the dues in 14 days but now you say this will break the back of the mill owners.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/will-withdraw-cases-filed-against-farmers-up-cm/article36130562.ece
27 August 2021||Kolkata,||In Bengal, govt-at-doorstep camps a smooth affair so far||The conduct of ‘Duare Sarkar’ — government at your doorstep — camps across West Bengal has been by and large smooth so far, surprising applicants for various schemes who had expected a tough time. On Thursday, Asha Lata and Tanuja — both employed as cooks in the Golf Gardens area of south Kolkata — walked into a camp held at a neighbourhood park at 11 a.m. and were out, their jobs done, by 1.30 p.m. They both successfully submitted their applications for the government’s ‘Swasthya Sathi’ — health insurance — scheme. “Separate counters had been set up for each scheme. No one from the party [Trinamool Congress] was allowed into the park. The local councillor continuously asked people to follow COVID-19 protocols. No one without a mask was let in,” said Asha Lata, 23. “We were told that people [from adjoining slums] had been queuing up from three in the morning, but we were lucky,” said her friend Tanuja Mudi. “There was a counter — a sort of help desk — that gave out only forms. We had to fill up forms here and go to the registration counter, where the queue was the longest and managed by the police. After getting registered, people headed to the counters set up for each scheme.” At the ‘Swasthya Sathi’ counter, an official made online entries of the details submitted by them and gave them receipts. The two women were told that they would receive text messages informing them of the date of distribution of the cards. Equally smooth was the experience of Bisakha Majhi and Shanti Sardar, except that they stood in the queue much longer, considering that both were applying for the highly sought-after Lakshmir Bhandar scheme, which entitles women without job to Rs. 500 a month (women from the reserved categories will get Rs. 1,000). Shanti additionally applied for Scheduled Caste certificates for her children. The ‘Duare Sarkar’ outreach camps started across the State on August 16 and will go on till September 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/in-bengal-govt-at-doorstep-camps-a-smooth-affair-so-far/article36130822.ece
27 August 2021||Belagavi,||Lingayat organisations unhappy with BJP, Congress over ticket distribution||Some Lingayat organisations have said that both the national parties, the BJP and the Congress, have neglected candidates from the Lingayat communities. Members of Jagatika Lingayat Mahasabha and Akhil Bharata Veerashaiva Mahasabha held a series of meetings in various areas in the new city, to discuss the issue. Veerashaiva Mahasabha held a meeting at Lingayat Bhavan in Belagavi on Wednesday. District president of the Veerashaiva Mahasabha Rathnaprabha Bellad expressed displeasure over distribution of party ticket. She said that the meeting unanimously decided to “teach a lesson to the two parties” in the city corporation polls for this neglect. The meeting also discussed various poll strategies, she added. Veerashaiva Mahasabha secretary Annasaheb Korabu, Shaila Samsuddi, Chetan Angadi, Rajkumar Topannanavar, Mahantesh Vakkund, Sujit Mulgund and Arvind Patil and others were present. Jagatika Lingayat Mahasabha members also held a few meetings in Belagavi on Wednesday and Thursday. Jagatika Lingayat Mahasabha president Basavaraj Rotti criticised the leaders of both the parties for neglecting Lingayats, who, according to him, form one sixth of the city’s population. “There are over one lakh Lingayats in Belagavi city. They need to be properly represented. There are around 70,000 Lingayats in Belagavi North Assembly seat that has around 30 wards, but only five Lingayats have been given ticket by these parties. The number of Lingayats in Belagavi South Assembly seat is around 30,000 but only one Lingayat has been given ticket from there. This is unacceptable,” he said. Loyalty Mr. Rotti, who is also senior advocate and BJP leader, has campaigned for the BJP in the earlier Lok Sabha and Assembly polls. He accused the BJP of betraying the community. “Our loyalty to the BJP has been taken for granted. We have been reduced only to party cadre and campaign workers. We are not getting political opportunities that we deserve,’’ he said. He said that he and other Jagatika Lingayat Mahasabha members will take this message to the voters in the urban local body polls. “We have seen that some BJP leaders have monopolised the ticket distribution process and given them away to their followers who are not mass leaders. This has worked against the interest of our community,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/lingayat-organisations-unhappy-with-bjp-congress-over-ticket-distribution/article36130666.ece
27 August 2021||MYSURU,||Minister faces villagers’ ire over reshuffling of APC staff in Bandipur||Forest Minister Umesh Katti on Thursday faced the ire of villagers near Bandipur for the recent reshuffling of more than 200 Anti-Poaching Camp (APC) staff deployed in the tiger reserve. The Adivasi women from Melkamanahalli complained to the Minister that guards and anti-poaching camp personnel recruited from their village had been redeployed at camps 60 km to 70 km away. The move was justified by the Bandipur Tiger Reserve Director S.R. Natesh on the grounds that a majority of them were stationed in the same camp for years and a redeployment was an administrative exercise. But the State wildlife board member Joseph Hoover had questioned it, saying that the guards were lowly paid and hence transferring them to distant places would have a demoralising effect on them. Family members of APC personnel decried the transfer, saying the wages paid were low and now a portion of it had to be set aside for travelling which would further eat into their monthly earnings. The Minister said he would discuss the issue with senior officials of the department and set right the anomaly, if any. Bandipur is home to nearly 130 to 140 tigers and the anti-poaching camp is critical for the conservation of wildlife as its presence has a deterring effect on poachers. Though the authorities justified the reshuffling, wildlife activists pointed out that apart from protection duties, APC personnel were also the key interface between the Forest Department and the local community. Deploying guards drafted from local villages helped in intelligence collection, apart from dousing frayed tempers during human-animal conflict situations, the activists say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/minister-faces-villagers-ire-over-reshuffling-of-apc-staff-in-bandipur/article36130879.ece
27 August 2021||CHITTOOR,||Forest employee on remand in red sanders case dies||The death of a forest department driver, who was remanded in judicial custody in a red sanders smuggling case, on Wednesday night created flutter here. However, the police on Thursday clarified that the accused, Jayappa (52) was a chronic diabetic with multiple heath issues. The Chittoor police said that Jayappa was among the four forest personnel who were arrested by the K.V. Palle police of Valmikipuram circle in the district in a red sanders smuggling case in the second week of August. Jayappa was shifted to the local sub-jail here on August 19. The four forest department personnel allegedly facilitated free movement of vehicles carrying red sanders logs through the check-post they were manning and allegedly collect hefty bribes. Chest pain On August 24, the accused reportedly complained of chest pain and was taken to the Government Area Hospital here and was treated as an outpatient. Again on August 25, he was admitted to hospital after complaining of chest pain, where he reportedly died of cardiac arrest. Two Town Circle-Inspector P. Yugandhar, who conducted the preliminary investigation, said Jayappa had a known history of diabetes and hypertension and other health problems. The post-mortem was conducted on Thursday and the body was handed over to the family members at Piler, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/forest-employee-on-remand-in-red-sanders-case-dies/article36130348.ece
27 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Government looking for suitable place for setting up SHRC in Kurnool||In yet another clear indication of its determination to develop Kurnool as the ‘Judicial Capital’, the State government on Thursday informed the Andhra Pradesh High Court that is was looking for a suitable place there to set up the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) as per a decision taken by the Cabinet. Advocate-General (A-G) S. Sriram told a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice N. Jayasurya, during the hearing on a writ petition which prayed for shifting the SHRC from its present location in Hyderabad to Andhra Pradesh, that the required amendments to notifications under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 and the consequential notifications were due to be issued in a day or two. When counsel for the petitioner (AP Civil Liberties Association) objected to the location of SHRC in Kurnool, the court said the decision had been taken by the government and it would only direct that the commission should be within the State. The court then adjourned the matter for four weeks to enable the government to give an update in that regard. Pleas pending It may be noted that some writ petitions which challenged the proposed shifting of the principal seat of the High Court itself to Kurnool are pending disposal. The Cabinet decision to move the Institution of Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta to Kurnool, instead of Vijayawada, which was prayed for in separate petitions, is still in the process of adjudication. Stay on order Besides, a G.O. that was issued for shifting the offices of the Commissioners of Vigilance and Enquiries to Kurnool was contested in the court and a stay had been imposed. The government had incorporated the idea of a capital city for judicial functions in the A.P. Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Act, 2020. The cases related to ‘three capitals’ had been adjourned to November 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-looking-for-place-for-setting-up-shrc-in-kurnool/article36130354.ece
27 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Can PM-Cares help COVID orphans, asks SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Union government if it can immediately release money from the PM-Cares Fund for the education of children who have been orphaned or have lost legal guardians or either of their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. A Bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose highlighted that education was a fundamental right of children. Children needed to stay in school. The Bench was especially anxious about the future of children who studied in private schools where the fee may be on the higher side and had lost their parents after the COVID-19 virus began disrupting lives since March 2020. “Children should not lose the benefits of education because of the pandemic… Can the PM-Cares Fund come forward and immediately release some funds for the education of these children at least for the year? Is there any facility for that,” Justice Rao asked Additional Solicitor-General Aishwarya Bhati. He said the Centre could coordinate with the States and help with the funds for education of children. He told Ms. Bhati to enquire with the Central authorities about the release of funds later in the day so that the court could pass an appropriate order. The Bench observed, “We can say that the States can contact the Central government for funds for the education of these children…” . Justice Rao asked whether children who were eligible for financial help under the PM-Cares Fund had so far been identified. Three categories Ms. Bhati said, “The children have been separated into three categories — those who have lost both parents, those who have lost either parent and those who have lost their legal guardians”. The onus of identifying the children had been given to the district magistrates concerned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/can-pm-cares-help-covid-orphans-asks-sc/article36130394.ece
27 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Inaccessible UIDAI system leaves Aadhaar users in lurch||The IT systems of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) have been down over the past week, sending Aadhaar holders into a tizzy as deadlines loom to link their UIDAI identity details with their Employees’ Provident Fund accounts and the Income Tax Department’s Permanent Account Number (PAN). That the new Income Tax portal is yet to become fully functional, has compounded problems for those seeking to link their Aadhaar to PAN by September 30. Separately, by August 31, all EPFO members are required to link their Aadhaar cards to continue to get their monthly PF contributions deposited. Down since last week Even those who just want to update their Aadhaar particulars to correct mismatches with other identity documents are at their wits’ end, with several users complaining that attempts to update details were not possible online or at Aadhaar centres due to technical issues. An official source confirmed that there were some glitches due to which the systems were down last week. “The system downtime impacted multiple cities,” he said. However, it could not be ascertained if this was a national outage and whether the systems are now back online. Queries to the UIDAI on the issue did not elicit any response till the time of going to press. When contacted, a senior officer at the NIC, the Government of India’s IT arm, said they were not aware of any such issue. Pune resident Indraniel Bhattacharya told The Hindu that he has been trying to update his address on Aadhaar for at least a week. “After multiple failed attempts to put in a request to change my address online, I was asked by the UIDAI customer care executive to visit the physical centre,” he said. “I went to a post office in Pune, and then a private bank… but at both places, I was told the Aadhaar systems are down nationally and they have no information on what the issue is or when the systems will be back online.” Some users also took to social media to register their complaints. As per the UIDAI website, in order to link Aadhaar with PAN, ideally, the citizen's demographic details such as name, gender, date of birth, should match in both the documents. In rare cases where the Aadhaar name is completely different from the one in PAN, then the linking will fail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/inaccessible-uidai-system-leaves-aadhaar-users-in-lurch/article36130398.ece
27 August 2021||New Delhi,||Cong. calls Baghel to Delhi again||Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has been summoned again by the Congress central leadership, and he is expected to be in Delhi on Friday, amid the continuing power struggle between him and State Health Minister T.S. Singh Deo. Party sources did not rule out a change of guard in the State, though Mr. Baghel is resisting it. Ahead of Mr. Baghel's meeting with former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, several Ministers and MLAs are camping in the capital. More are expected by Friday. Sources say a show of strength is expected in Delhi with MLAs supporting Mr. Baghel could be paraded at the party headquarters. The Baghel camp is against a change of guard, and argue that replacing a Chief Minister from the Other Backward Classes will cost the Congress in a State that has predominant population of the community. They say a majority of the MLAs are with the CM. Mr. Baghel returned to Chhattisgarh on Wednesday to a rousing welcome at the airport by his supporters. On Thursday, more than 30 MLAs paid him a visit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cong-calls-baghel-to-delhi-again/article36130400.ece

Polling for 82 wards in the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation elections is scheduled to be held on September 3. Nomination papers of a total of 486 candidates were declared valid after scrutiny on Tuesday.

27 August 2021||New Delhi,||Privacy invasion: HC comes to rescue of actor||The Delhi High Court has observed that ‘right to privacy’ includes the right to be forgotten and the right to be left alone while directing various online platforms, including YouTube, to take down certain objectionable video clips of a Bengali actor. Justice Asha Menon was of the opinion that “the right to privacy of the plaintiff (woman) is to be protected, especially when it is her person that is being exhibited, and against her will”. The woman, who claimed to be a well-known actor in Bengali films, said she was approached by Ram Gopal Verma Studios for filming a web series. She said on the promise made to her of giving her the lead role in the web series, she was lured into participating in a demonstration video/trailer, comprising explicit scenes of complete frontal nudity. However, the project fell through and the web series was never produced. In December 2020, the woman came across the videos, which had been uploaded by the producer on his YouTube channel and website. On her request, the producer later removed them. However, without her consent, several other websites uploaded those videos. ‘Anonymous callers’ “Some of them also superimposed objectionable and obscene commentaries on the videos. As a consequence of such action, the plaintiff was constantly subjected to anonymous callers and also subjected to insults,” the plea said. Justice Menon rejected the argument made by some of the websites that the videos had been shot with the consent of the woman and hence she would not be entitled to any relief. “The plaintiff in this case has not permitted even the producer of the videos to publish them on his YouTube channel and website and the producer has respected her decision by taking down the videos,” the judge said. “In the present case, it is explicit videos that are being circulated, having a clear and immediate impact on the reputation of the person seen in the videos in a state of nudity,” the court said while directing removal of the videos, footage, clip audio from the Internet till further order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/privacy-invasion-hc-comes-to-rescue-of-actor/article36130556.ece
27 August 2021||MYSURU,||Forest Minister Umesh Katti against road-widening in Bandipur||Forest Minister Umesh Katti has said that the existing road passing through Bandipur is in good condition and there is no need for its widening. His remarks come in the wake of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) seeking clearance from the government for diversion of 24 acres of land for road-widening work for highway connecting Gundlupet with Ooty. Speaking to reporters during his visit to Bandipur in Gundlupet taluk of Chamarajanagar district on Thursday, Mr. Katti said that the Forest Department would not permit road-widening within Bandipur Tiger Reserve nor would it allow night traffic through the forests. The NHAI had submitted a proposal to widen the road from Melkamanahalli to Kekkanahalla checkpost to a distance of 13.2 km. But senior officials in the Forest Department said the proposal was yet to reach them and only an online application for forest clearance was made. But it had been returned to the authorities concerned on the grounds that the application was not in order, said S.R. Natesh, Director, Bandipur Tiger Reserve. However, activists argue that the proposal for road-widening itself is antithetical to environmental and wildlife conservation and hence should be rejected at the conception stage itself. Wildlife activists have pointed out that a sub-committee on framing guidelines for roads in protected areas recommended in 2013 that the status quo of the roads passing through national parks and core critical tiger habitats “shall remain the same” and should be maintained or repaired in their “current form and width”. Besides, Bandipur has an eco-sensitive zone notified and any widening can be taken up only after a proper Environment Impact Assessment. Wildlife activists have expressed concern that if the NHAI is allowed to take up widening of the road which already has heavy traffic, it would jeopardise the safety of wildlife.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/katti-against-widening-of-road-in-bandipur/article36130456.ece
27 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,||Gas leak from pharma firm creates flutter near city||A gas leak from Admiron Life Sciences Private Limited, a pharmaceutical company, located in Jawaharlal Nehru Pharmaceutical City in Parawada mandal in Visakhapatnam district, created a flutter among the residents of Tadi village that borders the pharma city, here on Thursday. According to the residents of Tadi village, the gas reportedly leaked in the morning and is said to be spread across a radius of 5 to 7 km. “With the 2020 styrene monomer vapour leak from LG Polymers still fresh in our mind, we immediately rushed out of our homes and drove away to the neighbouring villages. The smell was pungent and we were afraid,” said a resident of Tadi. However, CEO of JNPC Lal Krishna claimed it was a minor leak from one of the valves and the leak was plugged within 30 minutes. “We are yet to ascertain the type of gas that leaked, but it was not harmful and their was no injury, death or sickness to the workers,” he said. However, CPI(M) leader K. Lokanadham and Ch. Narasinga Rao alleged that the gas was strong enough and the residents of Tadi felt suffocated. The villagers have been urging the district administration to shift and rehabilitate them to another place, as everyday is a nightmare for them. There about 100 companies in JNPC and at least 20 of them deal with hazardous chemicals and products. In the last five years, there were at least 30 minor accidents that left a number of people dead or injured. “We have been asking the government to shift the village and conduct a proper safety audit and take action against the companies violating norms. But so far, no audit has been done and no action has been taken, even against the erring companies, where there were accidents,” said Mr. Lokanadham. According to them, the promoters or JNPC, the Ramky group, had violated the norms of buffer zone and green belt. The Parawada police confirmed that there was a gas leak, but everything was under control and there were no loss to men or material.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gas-leak-from-pharma-firm-creates-flutter-near-vizag/article36130388.ece

The onus will fall on the employers to ensure 100% vaccination of their working staff either at the government and BBMP vaccination centres or at private hospitals at the employers’ cost. Employees will have to maintain proof of vaccination status at the workplaces. “They may be required to produce the proof as and when enquired,” said BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta in a circular issued on Thursday. Marshals and health officials will be authorised to check for compliance from September 1. Any violation is liable for penalty and punishable under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, as defined in the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897. Mr. Gupta, in the circular, said the decision to ensure mandatory vaccination was takenduring a meeting chaired by the Chief Minister earlier this month as it had been scientifically established that the risk of COVID-19 transmission was higher in closed spaces. P.C. Rao, president of Bruhat Bengaluru Hotels’ Association, welcomed the move, saying that many hotels and restaurants had already vaccinated their staff. “Many establishments have also put-up signs, stating all staff have been vaccinated. The BBMP must ensure that street food vendors, people working in juice/ tea shops and bakeries are also fully vaccinated,” he said. BBMP’s Special Commissioner (Health) D. Randeep told The Hindu that already more than 70% of the 91 lakh eligible population in the city had been vaccinated with at least the first dose. “We are reaching a stage where vaccination is becoming universal, except in a small percentage of the population who are exempted due to medical reasons,” he said.  Vaccination mela  Special Correspondent Bengaluru The civic body has organised a vaccination mela on Friday, with the aim of vaccinating at least 1.25 lakh people. A press release said the State government was launching the vaccination campaign across Karnataka as well.

Mr. Randeep said there was sufficient stock of vaccines available. “Just for the mela, outreach camps and mobile teams will be in place.

27 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Drone rules aim to help start-ups, SMEs||The Civil Aviation Ministry has notified the Drone Rules, 2021, under which the weight of a fully loaded unmanned aircraft system has been increased from 300 kg to 500 kg to include heavy payload-carrying craft for use in the logistics and transportation sectors. The rules will also cover drone taxis. The key features of these rules include the development of drone corridors for cargo deliveries. An unmanned aircraft systems promotion council will be set up to facilitate a business-friendly regulatory regime. PM hails rules Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the rules would usher in a landmark moment for the sector. He tweeted, “The new Drone Rules will tremendously help start-ups and our youth working in this sector. It will open up new possibilities for innovation & business. It will help leverage India’s strengths in innovation, technology & engineering to make India a drone hub.” Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said the rules were aimed at simplifying the procedures and reducing compliance burden for drone operation. The IT sector body, NASSCOM, welcomed the move, stating that it would enable start-ups and small and medium enterprises to create innovative-use cases and applications in various sectors such as e-commerce, agriculture, mining, healthcare, emergency response and logistics. No security clearance Under the new rules, no security clearance will be required before any registration or licence issuance for drones. The number of forms or permissions has been reduced from 25 to just five. No pilot licence will be required for operating nano drones and micro drones for non-commercial use. The Director General or an entity authorised by it, on the recommendation of the Quality Council of India or an authorised testing entity, will issue a type certificate for drones. No type certificate, unique identification number, prior permission and remote pilot licence will be needed for research and development entities. The import of drones will be regulated by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade. There will be no restriction on foreign ownership in Indian drone companies. Digital Sky Platform Importing and manufacturing drones purely for exports are now exempt from type certification and unique identification number. Manufacturers and importers will be able to generate their drones’ unique identification number on the Digital Sky Platform through the self-certification route. The online registration of all drones will happen through the Digital Sky Platform. An interactive airspace map with green, yellow, and red zones will be displayed on the Digital Sky Platform. The yellow zone has been reduced from 45 km to 12 km from the airport perimeter. No permission will be required for operating a drone in the green zones and up to 200 feet in the area between eight and 12 km from the airport perimeter. Safety features like ‘no permission-no take-off’, real-time tracking beacon, geo-fencing, etc., will have to be notified soon. A minimum six-month lead time will be given for compliance. A remote pilot licence holder enlisted on the Digital Sky Platform will only be allowed to operate a drone covered under the Rules. The training and examination will be conducted by an authorised drone school. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation will prescribe the training requirements, oversee the schools and provide pilot licences online. Carriage of arms, ammunition, explosives and military stores and so on on drones has been prohibited. “No person shall carry dangerous goods on unmanned aircraft unless such operation is in compliance with the Aircraft (Carriage of Dangerous Goods) Rules, 2003,” said the notification. Any accident involving drones should be reported within 48 hours. The maximum penalty for violations had been reduced to Rs. 1 lakh. Vipul Singh, Co-founder and CEO at drone firm Aarav Unmanned Systems, told The Hindu that the new rules were a major breakthrough for the Indian drone industry, and would make India an over $5 billion drone market in the next three years.

27 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||India on wait and watch on Afghanistan: Centre||Minister for External Affairs S. Jaishankar on Thursday described the situation in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover as critical, adding that India, like the rest of the world, was following a “wait and watch” policy. At an all-party meeting on the situation in Afghanistan held at Parliament House, Mr. Jaishankar said the priority of the Government of India at this point was the evacuation of Indian nationals and Afghan partners from the war-torn country. “It is an evolving situation and I request everybody to be patient so that once the situation normalises, we can tell you what India’s stand is,” the Minister said, addressing presspersons after the meeting. 37 leaders attend The meeting went on for three-and-a-half hours, and was attended by 37 leaders from 31 political parties, including Congress leaders Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Mallikarjun Kharge and Anand Sharma; Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Pawar; Trinamool Congress leaders Saugata Roy and Sukhendu Sekhar Roy; former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda; Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MPs Tiruchi Siva and T.R. Baalu; Telangana Rashtra Samithi’s (TRS) Nama Nageswara Rao; Telegu Desam Party’s (TDP) Jayadev Galla; and CPI MP Binoy Viswam. Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla and India’s Ambassador to Afghanistan Rudrendra Tandon were also present at the briefing, as was Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha Piyush Goyal. Mr. Jaishankar briefed the MPs on the evacuation of Indian Embassy staff and the closing down of India’s consulates in various cities, and added that a team has been deployed at the Kabul airport after the closure of the Embassy to facilitate evacuation. Mr. Jaishankar said the government had evacuated 175 Embassy personnel, 263 other Indian nationals, 112 Afghan nationals and 15 third country nationals, with the total figure at 565 in six evacuation flights so far. His presentation to the MPs clarified the tough conditions under which the evacuations were taking place, including a lack of a central command and control, the takeover of Kabul by the Taliban earlier than expected and the bringing forward of the date of U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The presentation also went into details of the various talks held on the Afghan issue and what went on in parallel in terms of the developments on the ground. Opposition MPs present at the meeting said the government interlocutors also conveyed that the Kabul airport could also be attacked by suspected Islamic State (IS) terrorists, a fear even the Taliban had. Speaking after the briefing, Mr. Jaishankar said, “On this [Afghanistan] matter, all political parties have similar views. We approached the issue with a spirit of national unity.” Opposition leaders, while appreciating the briefing, had tough questions for Mr. Jaishankar over the deportation from India a few weeks ago of a woman Member of Parliament from Afghanistan. Mr. Jaishankar expressed regret at the incident, calling it a decision taken by “overcautious” immigration officials at the Delhi airport. According to sources, this issue was raised by Mr. Kharge, who is also the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. In reply, Mr. Jaishankar, while expressing regret, said it was an isolated incident and that India had rescued many other Afghan parliamentarians. Fielding many questions from the Opposition on India’s future engagement with the Taliban in Afghanistan, Mr. Jaishankar said India, like rest of the world, was following a “wait and watch” policy. Mr. Kharge also raised a series of questions on the government’s contingency plan to evacuate Indians if they were stranded beyond the August 31 deadline, and the exact number of Indians yet to be evacuated. Sources claimed that the government did not share the exact number yet to be evacuated. The Congress delegation also asked about the government’s counterterrorism measures, especially in Jammu and Kashmir, in the wake of the rise of the Taliban. While raising the issue of the Taliban’s impact on security in the region, Mr. Kharge stressed that the political process should be restarted by restoring Statehood for Jammu and Kashmir. PM’s absence Questions were also raised about the absence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the meeting, adding that it was a courtesy that his predecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, always extended to the Opposition. Mr. Kharge, according to the sources, said Mr. Modi should have been present at such a meeting. Mr. Gowda said a similar period of uncertainty in Afghanistan had prevailed during his premiership, and that the current government needed to foreground the issue of internal security. The Revolutionary Socialist Party’s (RSP) N.K. Premachandran, Mr. Viswam and the CPI(M)’s P.R. Natarajan cornered Mr. Jaishankar on what they called the “grand isolation” of India. Mr. Natarajan, as per sources, said U.S. President Joe Biden, in his campaign speeches, had announced that America would be withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan. Despite prior warning, why was India not prepared, the MP asked. He also questioned whether the U.S. had kept India in the loop when they decided to advance the withdrawal of their forces. The Left and the Trinamool Congress, which was represented by Mr. Saugata, also questioned the government on safeguarding Indian investments in Afghanistan. “There are 500 projects, including the Afghanistan Parliament, in which India has made some serious investments. We asked what the government’s plan was to secure this investment. But Mr. Jaishankar did not give us a credible reply,” an Opposition member said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-on-wait-and-watch-on-afghanistan-centre/article36130137.ece
27 August 2021||New Delhi,||There is no COVID-19 vaccine shortage now: Health Ministry||India is not facing any shortage of COVID-19 vaccine right now, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on Thursday. He was responding to a question about some COVID vaccines that have got their Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) still not available for the Indian population. At a Health Ministry media conference on Thursday, Mr. Bhushan said that India currently had surplus stock. The Central government had asked the States to improve the rate at which vaccination is being done. India has currently granted EUA to Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, Serum Institute’s Covishield and the Russian vaccine Sputnik V, all of which are available to the Indian population. The EUA has also been granted to Moderna’s vaccine (to be imported by Cipla), the Johnson & Johnson single dose vaccine and Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D. ZyCoV-D may be available by October. The Union government has noted that it is in talks to bring in the other vaccines into Indian markets soon. Mr. Bhushan said that India was currently in a comfortable place in terms of availability of vaccines, and noted that states had surplus vaccine stock at present. He, however, cautioned that the second wave was not over in India, and urged people to continue adherence to safety norms. He said that 58.4% of the total COVID cases last week were reported from Kerala. “Overall, a declining trend has been observed across India in weekly positivity since the week ending May 10 and the weekly positivity less than 3% for the eighth consecutive week. Forty-one districts in India are reporting more than 10% weekly positivity,” he said. N.K. Arora, chairman of the COVID-19 Working Group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), said that vaccine effectiveness data was being reviewed on a regular basis. He noted that currently there was no proposal for a change in the dosage interval for Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V. The Health Ministry, in a release, stated that Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday took over charge as Chairperson of the Stop TB Partnership Board.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/there-is-no-covid-19-vaccine-shortage-now-health-ministry/article36130333.ece
27 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||JeM planning attacks, say reports||Nearly 100 members of the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) have rejoined the the banned terror outfit after being released from Afghan prisons by the Taliban, according to information gathered by security agencies. The outfit is planning to carry out fresh attacks in India, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir. The agencies have come across JeM-linked social media posts about the outfit chief, Masood Azhar, exhorting the cadres to prepare for attacks in Jammu and Kashmir following the Afghanistan victory. “At the institutions controlled by the terror outfit, sermons given to the followers last week revolved around the same theme,” said a security agency official. “Senior functionaries of the JeM and the Taliban have already held meetings. The JeM has been assured of all the support in carrying out its activities targeting India. The developments in Afghanistan will also embolden Pakistani forces, which facilitate infiltration of terrorists,” the official stated. Several eliminated The alert security forces have eliminated several JeM cadres in J&K this year so far. “Two key Pakistani commanders of the outfit, Mohammed Ismail and Abdul Rashid Ghazi, were killed in an encounter in the Hangalmarg forest of the Tral area in Pulwama on July 31. They were the masterminds behind the Pulwama terror attack on February 14, 2019, and wanted by the National Investigation Agency,” the official said. Ismail and Ghazi were said to be involved in a series of attacks and had recruited several local youth to the JeM fold in the Kashmir Valley. “Their killing by the security forces was a setback for the JeM operations in J&K. However, the recent developments in Afghanistan have again emboldened the outfit,” the official noted. JeM was proscribed by the United Nations Security Council on October 17, 2001, for its deep links with Al-Qaeda and Taliban, in terms of financing, supplying weapons, planning and facilitating terror attacks by them. Masood Azhar is also a U.N. designated terrorist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jem-planning-attacks-say-reports/article36130118.ece
27 August 2021||New Delhi,||Cong.’s Parivartan Yatra from Sept. 3||The Congress is set to start its campaign for the Uttarakhand Assembly election on September 3 with a Parivartan Yatra, beginning from Khatima, the constituency of Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami. As a show of unity, the entire senior leadership in the State will travel together in a bus for the yatra. Mr. Dhami is the fourth Chief Minister that the State has seen in the last four years. The COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating for the hospitality industry, a mainstay for the majority of the population in Uttarakhand. The State has also reported the highest rate of unemployment in the country. These factors could provide a fertile ground for the Congress to return to power. However, its own house is not in order, with infighting between Harish Rawat, the campaign committee chief for the State, and Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Pritam Singh. The two leaders have disagreed publicly more than once. Recently, Mr. Rawat announced a subsidy of Rs. 200 on gas cylinders if the Congress came to power. Mr. Singh, however, publicly rejected the idea, saying that it was up to the manifesto committee of the party to frame poll promises. The party also distanced itself from Mr. Rawat’s declaration that it would fight the polls with the war cry “ Jai Ganesh ”. “In 2016, Mr. Rawat, as the Chief Minister, had allowed a two-hour break for government staff to offer namaz on Fridays. He continues to be haunted by the right wing for that decision and is now making such pronouncements only to neutralise this attack,” a senior party leader said. The central leadership had made an effort to rein in the factions by reshuffling party functionaries after the death of senior Congress leader Indira Hridayesh. Mr. Rawat had his way when Mr. Singh, a Rahul Gandhi nominee, was removed as the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president and was replaced with his own man, Ganesh Godiyal. Mr. Singh was appointed the Leader of the Opposition. However, the precarious balance that the party leadership sought to craft is already tottering. But Mr. Rawat’s sharpest critics are not taking him lightly. “He is the most astute politician in the State. And if the Congress is to win the elections this time, he wouldn’t want to be overlooked since he believes it is the last chance that he has,” a senior Congress leader from Kumaon said. State in-charge Devendra Yadav said there may be a difference of opinions, but it would not come in the way of the unity of the party. The Congress was also clear that it would not project a chief ministerial face just yet, though Mr. Rawat, being the campaign committee chief, de facto becomes the face of the campaign.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congs-parivartan-yatra-from-sept-3/article36130142.ece
27 August 2021||CHENNAI,||DU’s move is part of erasure, say writers||The Delhi University English Department’s decision to remove works by two Tamil women writers, Sukirtharani and Bama, whose writings on Dalit women and their struggles have been celebrated by the literary world, has come for criticism from several quarters. Speaking to The Hindu , Ms. Sukirtharani said that she was “not surprised at all” by the university’s decision. Her works Kaimaru and En Udal that were dropped speak about injustices faced by women. “I was not surprised at all. Dalit voices such as myself and Bama’s are speaking for all oppressed women, not just Dalit women. Our works have been included in the college syllabi of several States at an all-India level,” Ms. Sukirtharani said. “I don’t see this necessarily as an exclusion of just Dalit writers as we have seen how progressive writers whose works speak against caste, Hindutva, and fundamentalism have also been removed in the recent past. These things will happen in our society, but we cannot be ignored. Our works have been translated in several languages abroad before they became familiar in India,” she said. “We should have been formally informed about why our works were removed. At the same time, we should also appreciate those who decided to include it in the first place. I am not going to seek an explanation. My work is for the society, for all oppressed women. My work Kaimaru (Recompense) is about manual scavenging. We are sending human beings to space etc. but we still allow manual scavenging to continue in our society. They want to project an image of India wherein there are no caste and religious inequalities, our works point out that caste and religious inequalities exist in our society. So, it is obvious that they want such works removed from the syllabus.” More angry than upset Ms. Bama said she was “more angry than upset”. Stating that she wasn’t sure which of her works — Karukku or Sangati – have been removed, Ms. Bama said, “ Karukku and Sangati have been taught in colleges in many States all over India and abroad. Sangati talks about the lives of Dalit women who stood against caste atrocities and discrimination, and it is about people who were very brave amidst oppression and violence. Karukku is an autobiographical work and talks about the politics of Dalit people. For more than 25 years, it has been celebrated by students and many other people,” she said. [The DU has removed Sangati .] She added, “For more than 2,000 years, we have been segregated, our histories have not been written. This government is trying to strangulate our voices, but we will shout.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dus-move-is-part-of-erasure-say-writers/article36130149.ece
27 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Ajay Bhalla reviews situation in Kerala and Maharashtra||Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla on Thursday reviewed the measures being taken by the governments in Kerala and Maharashtra for checking the spread of COVID-19. During the meeting held via videoconferencing, Mr. Bhalla said the State governments should continue with their vaccination programmes and in case they required more vaccines, the same would be provided to the extent possible. “However, efforts must be made to consume the vaccine doses received,” said a Ministry of Home Affairs statement. Mr. Bhalla observed that more efforts would be required to arrest the increase in infections. “This would require adequate intervention in geographical areas having higher infection, through measures such as contact tracing, vaccination drives and ensuring COVID-appropriate behavior,” he said. The State governments should explore the possibility of placing night curfew in the areas having high positivity. “Events with the potential of having mass gatherings during the coming festive season must be avoided. Testing must be ramped up in areas in the two States where positivity rates are being found to be on the higher side. Focus should also be placed over the next few months to suppress the levels of transmission of the virus,” said the Ministry. The meeting was attended by senior government functionaries, including the NITI Aayog Member (Health), the Union Health Secretary and the Chief Secretaries and Directors General of Police of Kerala and Maharashtra.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ajay-bhalla-reviews-situation-in-kerala-and-maharashtra/article36130336.ece
27 August 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Gujarat govt. to approach SC on anti-conversion law||The Gujarat government on Thursday said it would approach the Supreme Court challenging the stay granted by the High Court on certain Sections of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021, which seeks to stop religious conversion through interfaith marriages using force or allurement or fraudulent means. “We are committed to stop the love jihad in the State. This amended Act is not a political tool for us. It is meant to ensure that women are not cheated or lured into marriages by changing names or surnames or symbols of Hindu religion,” Minister of State for Home Pradipsinh Jadeja said on Thursday. He said the anti-conversion law of 2003 was amended by the legislature to add Sections to stop instances of religious conversion through marriages using allurement, fraudulent means or force. “We will approach the Supreme Court in appeal against the stay,” Mr. Jadeja said. In its interim order delivered on August 19, the High Court Division Bench stayed Sections 3, 4, 4(A) to 4(C), 5, 6 and 6(A) of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, 2021, pending further hearing, adding they “shall not operate merely because a marriage is solemnised by a person of one religion with a person of another religion without force or by allurement or by fraudulent means and such marriages cannot be termed as marriages for the purposes of unlawful conversion”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gujarat-govt-to-approach-sc-on-anti-conversion-law/article36130124.ece
27 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Will hear plea for life ban on convicted MPs, MLAs at length’||The Supreme Court has decided to hear “at length” a plea that convicted parliamentarians and State legislators, former and sitting, should be disqualified and banned for life from contesting elections to Parliament or Assemblies. A Bench led by Chief Justice N.V. Ramana said the plea raises a “vexed question” with “far-reaching ramifications and consequences”. “We deem it necessary to hear the matter at length on an appropriate date, after giving opportunity to all the stakeholders,” the top court observed in a 12-page order published on Thursday. As of now, convicted politicians are banned from polls for six years. The plea for a lifetime ban was suggested by senior advocate Vikas Singh. The senior lawyer had pointed out that “if bureaucrats can be fired if caught stealing Rs. 10, politicians convicted of heinous offences should be banished from contesting elections”. The CJI Bench further said more special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) courts need to be set up in places where more than 100 cases were pending “to ensure easy accessibility to the witnesses and de-congestion of existing special/CBI courts”. The court directed the Centre and the States to provide High Courts infrastructure facilities to set up new CBI courts. The order is based on the alarming pendency rate of CBI cases as per a status report submitted by the premier agency in a sealed cover in the Supreme Court on August 10. The report showed that 121 cases against sitting and former MPs were pending trial in various CBI courts across the country. Trial in another 112 CBI cases against MLAs, present and former, was also pending. In fact, 37 CBI cases against MPs and MLAs were still at the investigation stage. The oldest of the 37 date back to October 2013. Some cases go as far back as 2000. Crimes include offences punishable with life imprisonment or even death penalty. Problems include non-appearance of the accused, delay in framing charges, etc. “We are deeply concerned with the current state of affairs with respect to these cases,” the apex court observed in the order. The Supreme Court said it may not be humanly possible for CBI judges to deal with the volume of work piled on them. “The High Courts shall constitute Special/CBI Courts wherever such additional courts are required to be set up for expeditious disposal of pending trials. In the event of any non-cooperation by the Central or State governments, the High Courts shall send status reports to this court for further necessary action,” the Supreme Court order directed. The court order also recorded the assurance given by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to “take up the matter” of pending investigations and criminal trial in cases involving MPs and MLAs with the CBI Director. Similarly, the apex court order observed that a status report by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on August 24 shows that “no effective steps” have been taken in cases pending against MPs/MLAs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-hear-plea-for-life-ban-on-convicted-mps-mlas-at-length/article36130134.ece

The Greater Male Connectivity Project ( GMCP) will consist of a 6.74-km-long bridge and causeway link between Male and the nearby islands of Villingli, Gulhifalhu and Thilafushi. Indian construction giant AFCONS has been tasked with completing the project. “Delighted that the contract for the Greater Male Connectivity – Male to Thilafushi Link Project has been signed between the Ministry of National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure and AFCONS Infrastructure Ltd. This is a defining moment in the development journey of the Maldives,” said Abdulla Shahid, Foreign Minister of the Maldives. He described the project as an “enduring tribute to the strong Maldives-India partnership”. The signing ceremony was attended by Mohamed Aslam, Minister for National Planning and Infrastructure; Faiyyaz Ismail, Minister for Economic Development; Ibrahim Ameer, Minister for Finance; and Minister for Transport Aishath Nahula. Indian High Commissioner Sanjay Sudhir and senior representatives from AFCONS represented the Indian side. AFCONS is known for its “extreme engineering” projects that also include the Chenab Railway Bridge. The project is funded by a grant of $100 million and a line of credit of $400 million from India. An official press release noted that the GMCP project would be bigger than the Sinamale Bridge built with Chinese assistance that connects Male with Hulhumale and Hulhule and was completed in 2018. Jaishankar’s visit to Male The project is the result of bilateral consultation between India and the Maldives and has been under discussion since the visit of External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to Male in September 2019. A major feature of the project will be that it will connect Male with the planned international port of Gulhifalhu and the industrial zone at Thilafushi. “GMCP comprises three navigation bridges of 140 m main span across the deep channel between each island, 1.41 km of marine viaduct in deep water and 2.32 km of marine viaduct in shallow water or on land and 2.96 km of at-grade roads,” said an official press release.

27 August 2021||CHANDIGARH,||‘Haryana govt. not paying heed to peoples’ welfare’||Leader of the Opposition in the Haryana Assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Thursday hit out at the ruling BJP-Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) government in the State for not paying heed to the welfare of the people, especially the farmers. “The coalition wants to run the government only through event management and advertising. Every section is oppressed by the policies of the present government as this government is constantly engaged in attacking the rights of the farmers. The government delivered a blow to the rights of the farmers during the recently concluded monsoon session of the Assembly,” Mr. Hooda said here at a press conference. “The Land Acquisition Bill was introduced in the monsoon session. Under this, the government has systemically abolished all provisions passed during the Congress government that protected the interests of the farmers. The purpose of the new law is to hand over farmers’ land to capitalists without their consent. The government has now abolished all the rules like getting the consent of 70% farmers, giving residential plots with compensation in lieu of land, etc. This is not in the interest of farmers,” he said. Mr. Hooda said the ruling BJP-JJP government had an indifferent attitude towards the interests of the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/haryana-govt-not-paying-heed-to-peoples-welfare/article36130145.ece

He was later compelled to retract his remarks after a reprimand from Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai.

27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Can PM-Cares help COVID orphans, asks SC||He said the Centre could coordinate with the States and help with the funds for education of children. He told Ms. Bhati to enquire with the Central authorities about the release of funds later in the day so that the court could pass an appropriate order. The Bench observed, “We can say that the States can contact the Central government for funds for the education of these children…” . Justice Rao asked whether children who were eligible for financial help under the PM-Cares Fund had so far been identified. Three categories Ms. Bhati said, “The children have been separated into three categories — those who have lost both parents, those who have lost either parent and those who have lost their legal guardians”. The onus of identifying the children had been given to the district magistrates concerned. Justice Rao, at this point, highlighted that information about these children had been uploaded by the States on the website of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR). “With this information available on the NCPCR, you can see that the benefits of PM-Cares Fund can be given to the children,” Justice Rao added. During the hearing, Justice Rao observed that some States such as Gujarat and Maharashtra had tied up with NGOs to aid the cause of education of children personally affected in the COVID-19 days. The court urged the States to take care of the children, saying they were vulnerable and should fall into “undesirable hands”. Addressing advocate Mehfooz A. Nazki, counsel for Andhra Pradesh, Justice Rao said: “They do not have the means to protect themselves. The State has to protect them,” In one instance, while hearing the welfare measures adopted by various States, he told advocate Diksha Rai Goswami, for Assam, “take care that children are not thrown out of schools”. Govt proposal In a June hearing, advocate Gaurav Agarwal, who is amicus curiae in the suo motu case, pieced together media reports and explained to the court that the government, through the PM-CARES Fund, proposed to help children impacted by COVID-19 continue their education. “It would fund whatever educational requirements, in the form of uniforms, textbooks, etc. The scheme would also offer financial help to children for their higher education.” Mr. Agrawal said a corpus of Rs. 10 lakh was set aside for each child. The child would get the corpus amount in lump-sum on reaching the age of 23. “This may be so that he or she would have some money when they start on their own… There is also health insurance till the age of 18,” he submitted. The pandemic had wreaked havoc in the lives of many children who had either lost both parents or guardians to the virus, he pointed out. Quoting newspaper report, he said there had been a marked increase in child trafficking, especially of girls. The government had an obligation to protect children, he noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/can-pm-cares-help-covid-orphans-asks-sc/article36130122.ece

Pune resident Indraniel Bhattacharya told The Hindu that he has been trying to update his address on Aadhaar for at least a week. No information “After multiple failed attempts to put in a request to change my address online, I was asked by the UIDAI customer care executive to visit the physical centre,” he said. “I went to a post office in Pune, and then a private bank… but at both places, I was told the Aadhaar systems are down nationally and they have no information on what the issue is or when the systems will be back online.” Some users also took to social media to post their complaints. As per the UIDAI website, in order to link Aadhaar with PAN, ideally, the citizen's demographic details such as name, gender, date of birth, should match in both the documents. “In case of any minor mismatch in the name provided by the taxpayer when compared to the actual data in Aadhaar, a One Time Password (Aadhaar OTP) will be sent to the mobile registered with Aadhaar. Taxpayers should ensure that the date of birth and gender in PAN and Aadhaar are exactly same,” the website states. In rare cases where the Aadhaar name is completely different from the one in PAN, then the linking will fail and taxpayer will be prompted to change the name in the database of either Aadhaar or PAN.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/uidai-system-leaves-aadhaar-users-in-lurch/article36130129.ece

In April, the order was relaxed to the extent that foreign-registered Boeing 737 Max aircraft, which were grounded in India due to the ban, were permitted to fly out of the country. Also, overflying foreign registered Boeing 737 Max aircraft were allowed to fly over Indian airspace. However, commercial operations in the country remained prohibited. The decision now to allow the operation of the aircraft was taken after the Federal Aviation Administration issued an Airworthiness Directive on November 18, 2020, mandating actions for the aircraft to return to service. The European Aviation Safety Agency issued the Airworthiness Directive on February 17, 2021. The move followed certain design changes by Boeing. “World-wide 17 regulators have permitted operation of Boeing 737 Max airplanes.

Mr. Adityanath’s efforts to reach out to farmers, especially those in western U.P., comes days before the scheduled panchayat called by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a body of farmer unions leading protests around the national capital, in Muzaffarnagar on September 5. He said his government would not only take steps to withdraw cases and fines imposed on farmers for stubble burning but also ensure that electricity connections were not cut. Mr. Adityanath said the government was considering increasing the procurement price for cane. “The farmer should not worry or come under any influence,” he said on Wednesday at a meeting with farmers under the banner, ‘ Kisan bhaiyo se samvad .’ At a time when farmers in western U.P. could upset the BJP’s poll calculations in the region, Mr. Adityanath vowed that his government would protect the rights of farmers. “We will not let you have any problems,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/adityanath-reaches-out-to-farmers/article36130138.ece

27 August 2021||Mumbai,||Elagar Parishad accused say letters are scanned||Ten of the accused in the Elgaar Parishad case have written to Maharashtra’s Home Minister alleging that Taloja Central Jail’s Superintendent Kaustubh Kurlekar scans and saves copies of letters written by them to their family and advocates. The letter written on Thursday has been signed by Anand Teltumbde, Gautam Navlakha, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Mahesh Raut, Sudhir Dhawale, Surendra Gadling, Rona Wilson, Sagar Gorkhe and Ramesh Gaichor. In the letter, they have said, “Mr Anand, Mr Gaichor and Mr Ferreira were served notice and accused by Superintendent Mr Kurlekar invoking powers vide of Rule 20 of Chapter 31 (Facilities to Prisoners) of the Maharashtra Jail Manual. Dr Anand for two articles, Mr Gaichor for a poem as an obituary for cultural activist and Ambedarkite Vira Saathidar and Mr Ferreira for an essay in memory of Father Stan Swamy. They were intimated that what they wrote was ‘objectionable, creating doubts relating to the investigation of Bhima Koregaon offences and propagating naxal ideology’.” The letter, a copy of which is with The Hindu, reads, “Rule 20 which refrains the prisoner from writing any ‘matter likely to become the subject of political propaganda’ was struck down as violative of fundamental rights by the Bombay High Court in 1992.” ‘Not true’ When contacted, Mr. Kurlekar refuted the allegations and said, “Why should I keep the letters? What will I get out of them?” He also denied having issued any notice against the three accused. Sources said, although Mr. Kurlekar has demitted office and been transferred from the prison he continues to take charge of all the administrative work. Mr. Kurlekar however, has recently forwarded an application to NIA court in Mumbai objecting to all letters by the accused and termed it as “misconduct by them”. The letter goes on to say, “Not satisfied with this illegal ‘political censorship’ the superintendent scans/saves letters we write to family, friends and correspondence to advocates (which amounts to breach of privileged communication). We believed that some if not all are being shared with the police and prosecution.

He was later compelled to retract his remarks after a reprimand from Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai. Mr. Jnanendra, speaking to the press on Thursday morning had questioned the timing of the victims’ visit to the popular tourist site. “They [victims] went to a desolate spot, at 7.30 p.m. They should not have gone there at that time..,” he said Later, accusing the Congress of “politicising” the incident, Mr. Jnanendra said in Bengaluru: “Rape has occurred there [Mysuru]. But Congress is trying to rape the Home Minister here.” When asked to explain his statement, he said he meant it as a “joke”. Mr. Bommai stated categorically that he did not endorse the Home Minister’s statements.

Justice Mukta Gupta asked the agency to clarify in its reply how the journalist was connected with the allegedly illegal financial transactions. “Please tell your [ED] officers to justify the connection with the petitioner. If he is in receipt of money from shell companies, it is an illegal offence. But there has to be admissible evidence to connect him,” the court remarked. Counsel for the Enforcement Directorate argued that Mr. Sharma received cash from a shell company run by the Chinese and further investigation was on.

27 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Hybrid SC hearings likely from Sept.||The Supreme Court may try a mixed mode of physical and virtual court hearings from the first week of September. Discussions are on within the court to continue with the virtual mode of hearings, which began with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, on Mondays and Fridays for hearing miscellaneous cases. In regular matters, which may require detailed arguments and perusal of documents, the court may consider physical sessions. The regular cases usually come up on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. However, no final decision has yet been taken. The court is keeping in mind reports about the third wave of the pandemic. It does not want to launch the “mixed mode” and then abort it midway in case of a prospective rise in COVID-19 cases.

Ramana said on Thursday mentioned the plight of police officers caught between rival political parties who come to power one after the other. The Bench led by Chief Justice Ramana highlighted how police officers become targets of political vendetta. “When a political party is in power, police officers side with a particular party. Then when a new party comes into power, the government initiates action against those officials,” the CJI said orally. The court said this trend needed to be checked in its tracks. The oral remarks came during the hearing of a plea by suspended Additional Director-General of Police Gurjinder Pal Singh for protection in a sedition case registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the Anti-Corruption Bureau, which alleged that documents seized during a raid showed he was involved in a conspiracy against the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cji-mentions-plight-of-police-officers/article36130135.ece

In a video clip, apparently from 2018, Mr. Thackeray, who was not the Chief Minister at the time, can be heard saying he wanted to hit Mr. Adityanath with chappals for garlanding a picture of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji, wearing sandals. “Yogi [Adityanath] wore chappals while offering a garland to the Chhatrapati. I felt like hitting him with the same chappal,” Mr. Thackeray can be heard saying. Mr. Raut said, “This statement was made over an insult to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. No one garlands Shivaji Maharaj in Maharashtra while wearing slippers. It’s our culture and tradition and the deep respect we have for the warrior king.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/raut-defends-cms-chappal-remark-in-clip/article36130140.ece

27 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Preventive health checks begin slow resurgence in Chennai||Preventive screenings took the back-seat due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After slowing down or being suspended during the first and second waves, preventive healthcare services are slowly picking up pace across city hospitals. Fear of contracting COVID-19 in a hospital setup kept many away from undergoing master health check-ups. Nevertheless, doctors underlined the need for such preventive checks for early detection of diseases and better treatment outcomes. As routine screenings went for a toss, a number of hospitals, keeping in mind the changing needs of people, have redesigned their preventive healthcare packages, bringing in post-COVID related tests. The Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) saw a drastic fall in the number of persons seeking preventive health check-ups at the Master Health Check-up Centre. “From 70 to 80 persons a day before the pandemic, the numbers dropped drastically to five to six a day after the first wave. We have resumed preventive health checks, and are receiving 25 to 30 persons a day now. We want to improve the inflow to what it was before the pandemic or even more by bringing in newer packages,” said K. Indumathi, assistant professor of pathology and in-charge medical officer of master health check-ups, RGGGH. The newer packages would be system specific, she said. “Till now, we were offering three packages to people at Rs. 1,000, Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 3,000. Now, we will have newer packages at affordable rates to keep in line with the changing needs of the people,” she added. The hospital has already roped its consultants to its master health check-up scheme to provide speciality consultation. Though the master health check-ups had to be suspended during the pandemic, the Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) Clinic at the Government Stanley Medical College (SMC) Hospital continued to function. Previously, about 100 persons walked in for preventive health checks a day. “The number of people who came to the NCD clinic was minimal. Yet, we continued to screen them, including for various blood investigations, liver and renal function test, breast examination, ultrasound scan of the abdomen, ECHO and ECG, mammogram and pap smear,” said Vidhya A., senior assistant professor and medical officer of the NCD Clinic, SMC. Once the pandemic comes to an end, the hospital plans to restart the centre and is hoping to screen 200 to 250 persons per day, she said, adding: “The awareness on preventive health checks has definitely improved when compared to 10 to 20 years ago. Right now, people have become more aware of health.” “Before the pandemic, we used to review 400 to 500 preventive health checks a month. During the pandemic and lockdown, people who missed their routine check-ups started to come in from November. In December 2020, we had about 200 people, followed by 250 in January and 360 in February. But the numbers rose drastically and peaked at about 850 in March,” said Kavitha Sundaravadanam, senior family physician, Kauvery Hospital, Chennai.  Redesigned packages She added that they had redesigned packages to offer age-appropriate tests. “Now, we are seeing mostly those aged 60 and above coming for screenings. Basic checks can detect diseases early by 75% to 80%. For instance, an unnoticed breast lump can be picked up. Early cancers of the cervix, endometrial and breast cancers can be detected,” she said. Sathya Sriram, chief executive officer, preventive health, Apollo Hospitals, said the number of preventive health checks were steadily rising now, registering a week-on-week increase. “The pandemic has helped people realise that fitness is not the same as being healthy. There is a shift to be proactive and not wait for triggers or age-related symptoms to push you for checks,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/preventive-health-checks-begin-slow-resurgence-in-city-hospitals/article36130483.ece
27 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘0.83% govt. school students got into Anna varsity in 2020-21’||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Thursday said the Bill to provide 7.5% horizontal reservation to students from State government schools was brought about considering the challenges they faced in obtaining admissions into professional programmes in the State. While introducing the Bill, Mr. Stalin said due to certain socio-economic conditions not all students were able to obtain admissions in the professional programmes they wanted. It was hard for students from State government schools to compete with those from private schools. Only 0.83% of students from government schools were admitted into engineering programmes in Anna University in 2020-21, he said. It was 6.31% and 0.44% in State-run engineering colleges and State-aided engineering colleges respectively. Low numbers In veterinary programmes, their admission was 3% in 2020-21 — less than the previous year. The same was the case in fisheries programmes, which stood at 3.7% last year, he said. Only 4.89% of students in agriculture programmes were from State government schools. In the Tamil Nadu National Law University in Tiruchi, which admits students based on an entrance exam, the number of students from State government schools was under 1%. In 1997, the Tamil Nadu government reserved 15% seats for students from schools in rural areas considering the less number of such students getting admitted into professional programmes [eventually scrapped by the judiciary]. It also granted a concession to first-generation graduates in the payment of tuition fees. Exam scrapped Later in 2006, the State government scrapped the entrance exam conducted for admissions into professional programmes. Since 2007-08, students are being admitted into these programmes based on marks obtained in Class XII examinations. Last year, the State passed legislation to reserve 7.5% seats in undergraduate medical admissions for government students who have qualified National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET).

This is the highest one-day number of vaccinations the Corporation has achieved so far, a press release said. The Corporation, in a bid to increase the number of vaccine doses administered, conducted 400 special vaccination camps under the drive, with two camps in each of the 200 wards across the city on Thursday, targeting a total of 1 lakh beneficiaries. The number of those vaccinated, however, exceeded the target the civic body had set for itself. Under instructions from the Chief Minister, the Corporation has been paying special attention to vaccinating differently abled persons, those suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes, pregnant women, lactating mothers and persons with tuberculosis. In addition, residents of slum areas were targeted under the drive, the press release said.

In a tweet on Thursday, the Corporation urged residents to get vaccinated by visiting 105 centres on Friday. Residents have been requested to book vaccination slots at https://gccvaccine.in The Corporation has also announced that the online portal for booking vaccination slot for August 27 is open. As many as 45 centres in slums, 15 urban community health centres and 45 centres in schools in residential areas will be open for vaccination on Friday. A special drive has been launched for those with hypertension and diabetes at some of the mini-clinics of the Corporation. Chief Secretary V. Irai Anbu has been following up on the vaccination drive closely. The Corporation Commissioner said doctors and paramedical staff visited residential areas to organise vaccination camps under the guidance of IAS officers Vishu Mahajan, Manish, Simranjeet, Sharanaya, Sneha and city medical officer Hemlatha and city health officer Jagdeesan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-125-lakh-get-the-jab-in-mega-drive/article36130486.ece

However, cases once again topped 200 in Coimbatore, as 216 people tested positive, against 181 the previous day. Chennai, along with 22 districts, reported no deaths due to COVID-19. In Chennai, 175 people tested positive, compared to 170 on Wednesday. While cases dropped from 130 to 115 in Erode, the caseload rose from 90 to 113 in Chengalpattu. There were 77 cases in Tiruvallur, 73 in Tiruppur and 65 in Salem. Infections dropped to 59 from 84 in Thanjavur. Five districts logged fewer than 10 cases each. The fresh cases took the State’s tally to 26,07,206. Another 26 deaths were reported, taking the toll to 34,814. Of these, Coimbatore, Erode, Kancheepuram and Thanjavur recorded three deaths each. The deceased included a 31-year-old man from Kancheepuram, who had diabetes and systemic hypertension, and was admitted to a private hospital in Chengalpattu with difficulty in breathing on August 24.

27 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CWMA may discuss link canal scheme||The Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA), which is scheduled to hold its meeting on August 31, may discuss the Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar link canal scheme being executed by the Tamil Nadu government, apart from Karnataka’s Mekedatu dam project. The meeting assumes importance for more than one reason as it is going to be held in New Delhi in the conventional way after a gap of 18 months. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 last year, seven meetings were held through videoconference. Additional Chief Secretary (Water Resources and Public Works) Sandeep Saxena is likely to represent the State at the meeting, which would be the 13th since the constitution of the Authority in June 2018. Sources said that though the Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar link scheme was listed as one of the items on the agenda for the previous meeting of the Authority held two months ago, it was not taken up. The approval of the CWMA has become a pre-requisite for Tamil Nadu to secure financial support from any external agency or Central government body. As of now, the idea is to get the scheme implemented through NABARD Infrastructure Development Assistance (NIDA). On February 21, a few days before the announcement of the schedule for the Assembly election, the then Chief Minister, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, laid the foundation stone for the first phase of the Cauvery-Agniyar-South Vellar-Manimuthar-Vaigai-Gundar link canal scheme. Currently, the first phase is being executed using the State’s funds as the previous AIADMK regime had sanctioned around Rs. 330 crore. According to the State government, the scheme intends to make use of the surplus water available. The proposed canal, beginning from the Kattalai barrage (about 138 km downstream of the Mettur dam) in Karur district, will connect the rivers from the Cauvery to the Gundar over a length of 262 km. It is estimated to cost about Rs. 6,941 crore. On Mekedatu As for the Mekedatu project, the State government will reiterate its opposition to it if the Authority deliberates on the matter. The CWMA will also review the realisation of Cauvery water by Tamil Nadu since June 1. As of Tuesday (August 24), the State received about 51 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft), as against its share of 76 tmc ft, leaving a shortfall of around 25 tmc ft. In the current month, it should have got approximately 35.6 tmc ft, but its realisation was 15.3 tmc ft.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cwma-may-discuss-link-canal-scheme/article36130494.ece

Disposing of a public interest litigation petition, Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu ordered that hygienic practices, such as wearing clean hand coverings, should be implemented strictly in hotels, restaurants and other such places. The PIL was filed by advocate B. Ramkumar Adityan of Thoothukudi to prevent those who pack food in restaurants, eateries, bakeries and so on from using their saliva to separate paper or plastic covers, since there was a possibility of the spread of COVID-19. In reply, the court was told that the Food Safety Commissioner had already issued instructions to all Collectors to hold awareness campaigns in this regard. After recording the submission, the judges insisted that hygienic practices must continue for all time to come. During the course of hearing, the Chief Justice said people should not give up the practice of washing hands regularly and using sanitisers, even after the threat of COVID-19 dies down. These practices should stay on forever, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/follow-hygienic-practices-hc-orders-the-food-industry/article36130516.ece

27 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘More women need to opt for regular health check-ups’||In three years, the Amma Master Health Check-up Centre at the Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital (TNGMSSH) has screened 26,900 persons. While steady patronage is a reason to cheer for doctors, they want the preventive health checks to reach more women, as when compared to men, fewer women have undergone screening. “In particular, we want the awareness to reach more women. Some of the packages are specifically designed for women, giving additions in the form of mammograms and pap smears that can help in early detection of breast cancer and cervical cancer respectively. By including cancer screening in the basic Rs. 1,000-package, we have reiterated the importance of the welfare of women,” V. Anand Kumar, nodal officer, TNGMSSH, said. About 15,000-odd men and 12,000 women had undergone preventive check-ups at the centre, he said. Model centre This centre, in particular, has turned into a model over the years. Teams from Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have visited the centre to replicate it back home. “We were closed for four months during the first wave of COVID-19. After resuming activities, we launched the Platinum Plus package at a cost of Rs. 4,000 recently. The package is doing extremely well. In fact, most prefer higher cost packages worth Rs. 3,000 (Platinum) or Rs. 4,000 as these tests cost Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 25,000 in private sector. We have included cardiac fitness and based on cardiologist opinion, we take eligible persons for the treadmill. This package also covers lung spirometry and eye check-up,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/more-women-need-to-opt-for-regular-health-check-ups/article36130478.ece
27 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK walkout against merging of varsities||AIADMK MLAs, led by their floor leader Edappadi K. Palaniswami, staged a walkout from the Assembly on Thursday, protesting a decision of the State government to merge Dr. J. Jayalalithaa University in Villupuram with Annamalai University. Mr. Palaniswami said it was Jayalalithaa who had upgraded schools and opened colleges to benefit the poor, and the university was launched to honour her. “There was a change of regime after we made the announcement. We are walking out to condemn the decision to merge it with Annamalai University,” he said. Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudi said launching more universities would in no way improve the quality of education. “Even if there is one university, it can benefit the students only if it offers quality education,” said Mr. Ponmudi, defending the government’s decision while responding to AIADMK member K.P. Anbazhagan, who held the higher education portfolio previously. Mr. Ponmudi said Annamalai University was 100 years old and merging other universities with it was a matter of pride. The government had nothing against Jayalalithaa University. “There is already a fisheries and music university in her name,” he said. Earlier, the Chief Minister said the government was not working with vendetta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-walkout-against-merging-of-varsities/article36130502.ece
27 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Robotic angioplasty is an evolving technology’||Noting that robotic angioplasty was an evolving technology, Y. Vijayachandra Reddy, senior consultant and interventional cardiologist, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, said the robotic system made it possible for precision in measurement of the lesion and in accurately positioning the stent, which can benefit the patient. At a webinar on ‘Forging New Paths in Complex Coronary Angioplasty and Stenting’ held as part of The Hindu Wellness Series and presented by Apollo Hospitals on Thursday, Dr. Reddy discussed the advances in the field. Robotic angioplasty was an evolving technology with very few centres across the world having the equipment and expertise. Speaking on coronary artery diseases, he said normally with ageing, a little bit of cholesterol deposit forms in the lining of blood vessels. Due to certain reasons, such as high blood pressure, sugar level, cholesterol, sedentary lifestyle, smoking and other risk factors, the deposits are too much in the wall of the artery. When the blood flow is not enough, patients developed symptoms, he said. In some cases, the lining of the blood vessel over the plaque gets ruptured, and the contents are exposed to the blood, forming a clot. This resulted in the interruption of blood flow, leading to heart attacks, or sometimes, sudden cardiac death, he said. “Once blocks reach a level of severity, bypass surgeries, angioplasty and stenting come in,” he added. He spoke on various categories of patients, including pregnant women, young and elderly persons, and safe angioplasty/stenting. He noted that in intensive care units, more than 40% of patients were less than 50 years of age and around 25% below 40. “There are various reasons, including a sedentary lifestyle. There is a small subset of health-activity related heart attacks,” he said. In his presentation, he highlighted a number of scenarios, including primary angioplasty, heart attack failed thrombolysis angioplasty, unstable angina angioplasty, calcific vessel angioplasty, rotablator calcific vessel angioplasty, ostial lesion angioplasty and branching vessel angioplasty, with physiology, imaging guidance and robotic system. “Procedurally, angioplasty and stenting have become quite simple now. Even the more complex scenarios have become easily handleable issues. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Every advancement aids us towards that direction,” he said.

Responding to VCK legislator J. Mohamed Shanavas (Nagapattinam), who raised an issue in the House, Mr. Poyyamozhi said the said NGO was only sponsoring the setting up of a smart lab. “We will not allow NGOs that attempt to propagate any ideology within our educational system to do so,” he said. Mr. Shanavas had said that an NGO named Agastya and some others were attempting to propagate ideologies within the State’s education system. He underlined that the State government should streamline the appointment of vice-chancellors in State-run universities. The legislator said there were some people, who were against social justice, holding significant posts dealing with the State’s education system. Some had even included thoughts against the Dravidian movement in publications, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ngos-cant-propagate-ideologies-in-education/article36130504.ece
27 August 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||‘Having 9 Ministers in 10 years impacted learning’||School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi on Thursday said learning proficiency of school students was negatively impacted because Ministers handling the school portfolio were frequently replaced during the erstwhile AIADMK regime. Replying to a debate on the demand for grants by his department, in the Assembly, Mr. Poyyamozhi said the learning efficiency among government school students had come down because there were “nine School Education Ministers in 10 years” in the AIADMK government and it was like a “musical chair” [the reshuffling happened before February 2017]. In a different context, he said, “Students were confused. The entry of students into Class X and Class XI in government schools has come down to 53% from 76%. There is a need for change,” he said. Pointing out that learning outcomes had come down since students could not attend schools due to the pandemic, the Minister said the government had already announced the Rs. 200-crore Mission Mode Project to address learning losses. Responding to Tamilaga Makkal Vazhurimaikatchi leader T. Velmurugan’s complaints that a government library had disappeared, Mr. Poyyamozhi quipped “Tamil Nadu has disappeared after the death of [former Chief Minister] Jayalalithaa and our Chief Minister is taking steps to retrieve it.” The Minister also announced a programme to teach spoken English to government school students for half-an-hour every day after school hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/having-9-ministers-in-10-years-impacted-learning/article36130507.ece

Only 353 manufacturing units are operating with approval in the State. About 4,000 crusher units are functioning without license, the members said. At a press meet held in the city, S. Yuvaraj, the association’s president, said several loads of M-sand were being transported to Kerala and Karnataka, daily, despite a court order discouraging such transport to other States. About 4,000 such loads are illegally sent to Karnataka from Hosur belt, he said. As only a few river sand quarries are operated in the State, M-sand lorry loads are being supplied for construction activities. On average, the demand for M-sand is nearly 25,000 lorry loads every day. This has led to the mushrooming of unapproved manufacturing units, incurring severe losses to the State government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/m-sand-lorry-owners-appeal-to-government/article36130521.ece

27 August 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vehicles sold from Sept. 1 should have five-year insurance cover: HC||The Madras High Court has directed the State Transport Secretary to ensure that all motor vehicles sold in Tamil Nadu from September 1 get bumper-to-bumper insurance cover, along with coverage for driver, owner, passengers and third parties for a period of five years. Justice S. Vaidyanathan issued the direction while setting aside a motor accidents claims tribunal’s order directing an insurance company to pay Rs. 14.65 lakh to the family of a dead car passenger, though the insurance covered only third-party liability and not passengers. The judge said the claimants could seek compensation only from the car owner and not from the insurer. He also expressed dismay over people showing interest in purchasing expensive cars, but unwilling to shell out a small amount of money towards comprehensive insurance. “It is saddening to point out that when a vehicle is sold, the purchaser is not clearly informed about the terms of insurance policy and its importance. Similarly, at the time of buying the vehicle, the buyer is also not interested in thoroughly understanding the terms and conditions of the policy, as he/she is more concerned about the vehicle’s performance and not about the policy,” he wrote. He directed the Transport Secretary to ensure that all new motor vehicles sold from next month get comprehensive insurance policy cover for five years.

Speaking at the monthly farmers’ grievance redressal meeting through virtual mode, he said that by paying a premium, the crop can be insured under the Prime Minister’s National Crop Insurance Scheme and the farmers can go ahead with agricultural activity without fear. In a volatile situation, when the weather forecast is changing, the government has a responsibility to protect the farmers. Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam district president N Permal said that the Gandhi Market in Dindigul was yet to be opened and appealed to the Collector to intervene as it would benefit the farmers to bring and sell their produce to end consumers.

While around 6,000 were registered with the Differently Abled Welfare Department, the district inoculated a total of 11,649 people, officials here said. The initiative was kicked off following instructions from the Chief Minister, who urged the Differently Abled Welfare Department to conduct door-to-door vaccination of PwDs. Collector Kavitha Ramu conducted a review meeting and instructed officials to identify and vaccinate all differently abled people in the district. Along with a list provided by the District Differently-abled Welfare Officer, health and revenue officials went door-to-door to locate and vaccinate. “Field-level officers, village health nurses, staff at primary healthcare centres and revenue officials led by tahsildars identified at least 5,000 people,” B. Kalaivani, Deputy Director of Health Services, Pudukottai told The Hindu . Of the 11,649, who were vaccinated, at least 7,000 were given the jab at their doorstep by mobile health teams. Only around 3,000 of them visited vaccination camps, while the remaining were unable to travel due to lack of transport or caretakers. Each block in Pudukottai had three such teams consisting of a medical officer and a nurse equipped with a van to travel to the homes of those who required vaccination. Efforts were taken by Pudukottai Government Medical College in screening and vaccinating people who suffered from epilepsy and other illnesses also contributed to the achievement, Dr. Kalaivani said. “We aim to soon vaccinate cent per cent pregnant women and other vulnerable groups” she added.

27 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Periyar bus stand will open in a month: Su. Venkatesan||The renovated Periyar Bus Stand would be commissioned in a month, said Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan. After inspecting the renovation work under way under the Smart City project, along with Corporation Commissioner K. P. Karthikeyan, on Thursday, Mr. Venkatesan said the work that was started in January 2019 had been inordinately delayed. “Women, children and the elderly people are being put to lot of inconvenience as a result of the delay,” he said. Mr. Venkatesan was, however, critical of the design of the renovated bus stand. While Smart City projects lay emphasis on increasing the facilities and decongesting the cities, the planners here had made a huge blunder in providing less space for buses and and more space for commercial buildings, he said. “Both Periyar Bus Stand and the Shopping Complex Bus Stand put together had 50 bus bays in the past. Under the Smart City project, it should have been increased manifold. But, the number of bus bays has been increased to just 57, whereas the number of shops and also the commercial space building has been increased manifold,” he said. Asked if city buses bound to Thirupparankundram, Thirunagar and Thirumangalam would be operated from outside the new bus stand, Mr. Venkatesan said all the buses would be operated from the bus stand. The Smart City Advisory Committee meeting would be held on September 17 where in the quality of work and the reason for the wrong design would be taken up for discussion, he said. One-way system Meanwhile, officials have planned to introduce one-way traffic on Ellis Nagar road overbridge (ROB). “The signal (at Kattabomman statue junction) would be done away with and vehicles would not be allowed to turn towards Ellis Nagar ROB. Instead, they will go through South Veli Street and take the ROB through the road inside the bus stand to ease traffic at the junction,” said Mr. Karthikeyan. Similarly, a pedestrian tunnel has been proposed to link the bus stand with Madurai Railway junction so that passengers can have a safe passage without having to cross the road. “The work on the commercial buildings in the bus stand is expected to be completed by December 2021”, the MP said. City Engineer (in-charge), Suganthi, Executive Engineer, Karuppathal, Assistant Commissioner, Suresh Kumar, were among those who were present.     The Smart City Advisory Committee will meet on Sept. 17 where in the quality of work and reason for the wrong design will be taken up for discussion Su.

27 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Books tracing history of women freedom fighters should be included in school curriculum’||Releasing a book on women stalwarts titled Penne Peraartral , former MLA and Communist Party of India (Marxist) State executive committee member K. Balabharathi suggested that the Tamil Nadu government should include books on women as part of the school curriculum.  Penne Peraartral recounts the lives of 120 women – many had played a significant role in the freedom movement, while others had played an important part in the society much before Independence. Speaking at the function on Thursday, Ms. Balabharathi said that dissemination of the sacrifices and services of women during the early years of Indian independence by teachers would help the next generation of students understand various issues in a better way. “The Social Welfare Department should take a pivotal role in spreading this knowledge to the children, especially, girl students,” she said. Thanking the author for bringing out the book, the Communist leader said that awareness among girl students at an early age would lead to more women in the Legislative Assemblies and Parliaments. Today, though women voters outnumber men in Tamil Nadu, the number of women representatives in the Legislature and Parliament were meagre. “If this has to change, students should know more about the history and such books may be the medium to bring about a tangible change,” she said. The former MLA appealed to institutions like the Chellamuthu Trust and Research Foundation to create awareness and educate the people on social evils such as child marriage. Female infanticide, which was rampant once, had been prevented to a great extent only after formal education was given to large number of people from rural areas, she pointed out. Social activists should discuss the features and merits of books like Penne Peraartral in social media and not just confine themselves to sensational topics, Ms Balabharathi suggested. M. S. Chellamuthu Trust Executive Director R. Rajakumari released the book and Ms. Balabharathi received the first copy. Justice Shivaraj Patil Foundation Director Selvagomathi, Ekta - (an NGO in Madurai) Director Bimla Chandrasekar, advocate Balasundari and others felicitated. Author B. Thirumalai said that it was his 42nd book and he had taken about a year to compile all the information from various sources. Chellamuthu Trust Director K. P. S. Janardhan Babu welcomed the gathering and publisher M. Murugesan proposed a vote of thanks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/books-tracing-history-of-women-freedom-fighters-should-be-included-in-school-curriculum/article36130637.ece
27 August 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||HC asks Industries Dept. to consider application by Palani temple||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the State government to consider an application made by Palani Dhandayuthapani Swamy Temple authorities seeking exemption for the temple’s panchamirtham production unit from getting registered under the provisions of the Factories Act. Justice R. Suresh Kumar directed the Industries Department to consider the application that was made in 2019 by the temple authorities seeking exemption from the purview of the Factories Act under Section 86 (Power to exempt public institutions). The matter should be decided within eight weeks, the judge said. The Joint Commissioner/ Executive Officer of the temple filed the petition before the court in 2019. The temple challenged the notice issued by the Deputy Director, Industrial Safety and Health, asking the temple to apply under the provisions of the Factories Act to get the registration and permission to run the unit. Operating the unit without getting the permission from or registration with the authorities concerned would be treated as an offence under various provisions of the Factories Act, it said. Aggrieved over the notice, the temple EO filed the petition before the High Court. During the pendency of the petition, the temple administration applied for exemption. The temple authorities said the panchamirtham production unit did not come within the meaning of factories as it was not a commercial establishment. Panchamirtham was not prepared for commercial purposes but to meet the demand from devotees. The cost of production of panchamirtham was more than its selling price, the temple said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/consider-application-by-palani-temple-hc-tells-industries-dept/article36130642.ece
27 August 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Re-allocation of NEET-PG exam centres for candidates from T.N. sought||As the Centre has increased the number of NEET postgraduate examination centres by four, Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan has demanded re-allocation of centres for candidates from Tamil Nadu who were earlier issued admit cards for centres outside the State. In a memorandum addressed to Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare Mansukh Mandaviya, Mr. Venkatesan said initially 14 centres were allocated in Tamil Nadu. However, following the request from the MP seeking an increase in the number of centres in February 24, to Executive Director of National Board of Examinations Dr. Pawanindra Lal, four new centres were allocated at Virudhunagar, Dindigul, Chengalpet and Tiruppur. “Yet, students who were earlier, issued admit cards for centres outside Tamil Nadu have not been given new admit cards for centres within Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Since the date of examination is scheduled on September 11, they have to be given an option for changing the centre from other State to the one in Tamil Nadu at the earliest,” the MP said. This will ensure that students need not undertake long travel when the risk of getting infected by coronavirus was still not over. The Minister should ensure that all candidates from Tamil Nadu were accommodated in the centres within the State itself.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/re-allocation-of-neet-pg-examination-centres-for-tn-candidates-sought/article36130638.ece

Under the Centrally sponsored Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) ‘C’ scheme, which proposed solarisation of 10 lakh grid-connected agriculture pump sets, 60% of the cost of installation of solar-powered irrigation pump sets (up to 11 Kilowatt) would be extended as a subsidy, the Collector said in a press release. Further, if the beneficiaries were not able to bring in the remaining 40% from their own funds, they would be assisted to avail the remaining amount as loan from banking institutions at a lower interest rate, he added. Existing free farm power supply connection and consenting to link the solar-powered pump set facility with the electricity grid were prime criteria to be fulfilled by beneficiaries. Claiming that linking the pump set facility with the grid would help realise around Rs. 40,000 per year, , Mr. Dinesh said the beneficiaries would continue to receive free farm power supply. Further, it would help farmers take up cultivation in a larger extent and tapping of solar energy to run irrigation pump sets would reduce dependency on conventional power generation and supply network for agriculture activities, the Collector added.

27 August 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Protest hits movement of buses||Movement of buses from the temporary bus stand here was hit for more than 30 minutes on Thursday after traders and autorickshaw drivers blocked the buses leaving the terminus. As the reconstruction of the old bus stand is going on under the Smart City project, the temporary bus stand has been functioning from nearby SAV School Grounds for the past two years. The buses that enter the terminus via nearby Meenakshipuram Road leave the place via Jayaraj Road. Since Jayaraj Road is undergoing makeover under the Smart City project, the buses were using Meenakshipuram Road for entering and leaving the temporary bus stand for the past few days that triggered traffic snarl throughout the day. After relaying of a portion of the Jayaraj Road is completed, the renovated portion was opened for traffic. As the height of the renovated Jayaraj Road has been increased now, ‘sand ramp’ was created as a temporary measure to enable the buses to reach the renovated road from the low-lying existing road and the buses could be manoeuvred smoothly with this temporary arrangement. When the ‘sand ramp’ was removed on Thursday without any prior announcement, the buses had to be operated via Meenakshipuram Road to cause serious traffic congestion again. Agitated over this, the traders having shops in the traffic congestion spot and the auto drivers stopped the buses coming out of the bus terminus on Thursday. After the police officials held talks with the protestors and made alternative arrangements for the vehicular movement, the protest was withdrawn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/protest-hits-movement-of-buses/article36130640.ece

The move to reopen the conservatory, a popular leisure destination in Tiruchi, comes in the wake of relaxations announced by the State government recently. A forest official said COVID-19 safety protocols were being adhered to while allowing visitors inside the conservatory. The visitors were subjected to thermal scanning and advised to sanitise their hands with sanitiser kept at the entrance of the conservatory. They were also being asked to wear masks and ensure personal distancing inside the facility. Although the visitors footfall on the first day of reopening was low, Forest officials exuded confidence that it would gradually rise in the coming days. The 27-acre conservatory sandwiched between the Cauvery and the Coleroon had recorded 125 butterfly species and 118 bird species since it was opened in November 2015. The conservatory remained shut for over seven months ever since the lockdown was clamped in March last following outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. It was reopened to visitors in mid-November last year. A battery-operated vehicle with three cars to carry 10 adults and children at a time was introduced early this year as part of improving amenities at the lush green conservatory which had an indoor conservatory, amphitheatre, information centre, children's park and Nakshatra Vanam .

27 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Tiruchi Corporation begins establishing roadside rainwater harvesting pits||In an effort to prevent waterlogging in vulnerable spots and recharge groundwater, Tiruchi Corporation has launched a drive to establish roadside rainwater harvesting pits in different parts of the city. Water logging during the rainy season has been a major issue in the city for several years. It often exposes the poor stormwater discharge whenever the city experiences rain. Several roads and streets are inundate with water by rain spanning just 30 minutes. If the rain is heavy, it invariably requires the intervention of Corporation workers to remove silt and blockages in drainages to drain out water from the affected areas. To address the issue in a natural way, the Corporation has begun erecting rainwater harvesting pits in the city. According to sources, Rs. 1.80 crore has been sanctioned for the project. The civic body has sourced its fund through the Smart City Mission. It will be implemented in Area Based Development (ABD) zone. Under the project, pits will be dug to a depth of 50 square feet along roadsides identified as stagnation prone. At the centre of the pit, a bore well is dug to a depth of about 10 to 12 meters. An array of three to six plastic pipelines will be laid. The pits will then be covered with gravel, mud, filter and slabs. During rainy days run-off water will go down into the earth through the rainwater harvesting structures. It ultimately prevents water inundation besides recharging the groundwater. The civic body has so far erected about 10 structures in Thillai Nagar and Woraiyur. They will come up at seven spots in Puthur. Madurai Road, West Boulevard Road and Thennur are among the areas selected for the project. Corporation Commissioner P.M.N. Mujibur Rahuman told The Hindu that it had been planned to erect 135 RWH pits in different parts of the city. Most of the shortlisted places were identified as rainwater inundation-prone spots. The project had been initiated after studying the functioning of a few model pits established in the city. Around 50 RWH pits had so far been completed. The project would be completed within a month. It would enable the city to harvest rain during the northeast monsoon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruchi-corporation-begins-establishing-roadside-rainwater-harvesting-pits/article36130985.ece
27 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||BDU guest faculty demand unpaid salaries||Guest faculty in the 10 government arts and science colleges that were earlier constituent units of Bharathidasan University staged a demonstration in front of the office of the Regional Joint Director of Collegiate Education, demanding settlement of unpaid salaries for the months of May, June and July. The guest faculty and the non-teaching staff questioned the rationale behind the university refusing to pay the salaries even after receiving instruction from the Higher Education Ministry to that effect. The Higher Education Ministry, in deference to a representation made by Association of University Teachers on behalf of the guest lecturers and the non-teaching staff, directed the State Universities to settle the salary dues for the three months with an assurance that the amount will be reimbursed by the State Government at a later stage. The guest faculty under three categories comprising 363 guest lecturers, 205 hourly-basis lecturers, and 51 teachers appointed by Parent-Teacher Associations, receive monthly salaries of Rs. 12,000 to Rs. 15,000, Rs. 12,000 and Rs. 5,000 respectively. The Government, while converting four constituent units of the university during 2019 and six during 2020 into government arts and science colleges, had announced that the salary expenditure will be borne by the State. Order issued An order was also issued during January increasing the salaries of guest lecturers to Rs. 20,000 per month. The State government must prevail upon the university to settle the salaries of guest lecturers for three months as also the arrears as per the enhanced extent, AUT State General Secretary M.S. Bala Murugan, former State president K. Pandiyan, and other functionaries emphasised during the demonstration. They also demanded common consideration of the three categories of guest faculty in terms of pay and service conditions. About 150 guest faculty, including 75 women, took part in the protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bdu-guest-faculty-demand-unpaid-salaries/article36130612.ece
27 August 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Tiruchi farmers for expeditious implementation of Mettur-Sarabanga-Ayyar canal link scheme||Welcoming the State government’s plan to implement the Cauvery (Mettur Dam)-Sarabanga-Thirumanimuthar-Ayyar canal link scheme, farmers representatives in Tiruchi district have called for its expeditious completion as it would be of immense benefit in the dry belts of Uppilliyapuram, Thuraiyur and Thathaiyengarpet unions. According to a policy note of the Water Resources Department, tabled by Minister Duraimurugan earlier this week, it has been proposed to divert about five thousand million cubic (TMC) feet of Cauvery surplus water from Mettur Dam by excavating a new canal to Salem, Namakkal, Perambalur and Tiruchi districts. The scheme will be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, a link canal is proposed to be excavated for a length 132.305 km from Mettur dam to Pavithram tank. Under the second, a link canal from Pavithram tank to the Ayyar will be dug for a length of 36.995 km. The project is estimated to cost about Rs. 10,236 crore. The preliminary detailed project report for phase-I has been prepared for an estimate of Rs. .9,176 crore. For implementation, 2164.87 acre of patta land and 283.03 acre of forest land have to be acquired. The first phase will benefit about 31,263 acres of ayacut area. The preliminary DPR for the second phase has been prepared at an estimate of Rs. 1,060 crore. For this phase, 600.56 acre of patta land and 42.71 acre of poramboke land will have to be acquired. The second phase will benefit 6,479 acres of land. Farmers representatives say the scheme will benefit rainfed areas in Uppilliyapuram, Thuraiyur and Thathaiyengarpet unions in the district. “This is a scheme for which we have been waiting for a long time. We do not even want water for irrigation from the scheme; it is enough if the tanks in the three unions are fed with surplus water. It will help improve ground water table and contribute to immense improvement in agriculture,” says N. Ganesan, joint secretary, Tamil Nadu Milk Producers’ Welfare Association. Raja Chidambaram, State secretary, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam, who raised the issue at the farmers grievances meeting held through video conference on Thursday, says farmers are seeking diversion of surplus flow from Mettur reservoir only when the storage is above 100 feet. It will feed about 31 tanks in the district in the three unions. The former Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa, had announced in the Assembly the government’s intent to implement it, but it was put in cold storage after investigation by PWD. The government must implement the scheme expeditiously, he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruchi-farmers-for-expeditious-implementation-of-mettur-sarabanga-ayyar-canal-link-scheme/article36130627.ece

It was found that tax was not paid for the ornaments carried by the two passengers. The approximate value of the gold ornaments was a little over Rs. 1.5 crore.

27 August 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Channel will be desilted, Collector tells farmers||As the farms in the tail-end areas of North Kodaimelazhagiyan channel are yet to get water though water was released in this channel 80 days ago from Papanasam dam, Collector V. Vishnu has promised to desilt the channel being chocked with construction debris and encroachments. As the North Kodaimelazhagiyan channel, the first channel of the Tamirabharani irrigation system, feeds over 1,000 acres of land in Papanasam, Vickramasingapuram, Sivanthipuram, Kodarankulam, Vagaikulam and Mannarkovil, he inspected the ranches in the tail-end regions of this channel after the farmers complained that their fields were yet to get water. So, the paddy raised on over 100 acres in Vaagaikulam and Manaarkovil, which get North Kodaimelazhagiyan channel water via Seerpathakulam, Gnanapattarkulam, Puthukkulam and Sumaithangikulam are withering now. When he inspected the channel on Thursday, the farmers told him that the 18 km-long North Kodaimelazhagiyan channel had been blocked by debris and garbage. Though 55 cusecs of water was released in the channel, the water was yet to reach the tail-end regions. “The North Kodaimelazhagiyan channel fields, which once had two crops every year, is struggling to see the light of the day. So, the officials concerned should be given the task of desilting the channel at the earliest and the farmers who have suffered crop loss given due compensation,” said the farmers. He assured the farmers that due action would be taken to desilt the channel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/channel-will-be-desilted-collector-tells-farmers/article36130641.ece

27 August 2021||TIRUVANNAMALAI,TAMIL NADU||Tiruvannamalai police reach out to tribals to facilitate surrender of guns||The Tiruvannamalai district police are reaching out to the tribals in Jawadhu hills to get them to voluntarily surrender their country-made guns in return for an amnesty. This message was conveyed to 11 heads of village panchayats from the hills at an interactive session held at the Jamunamarathur police station in Tiruvannamalai. The village elders have been given a week to discuss the amnesty offer with their fellow residents and convince those in possession of the illegal guns to surrender them. Interestingly, the district police have also made it clear that such a surrender of weapons could be done at public places like temples or through common people, and the weapons need not be directly handed over to the police. This is to dispel fear among those in possession of illegal guns about exposing their identity. “We have given time to the village heads to discuss the issue of illegal guns with their residents and get back to us. If they don't surrender voluntarily, we will have to conduct door-to-door searches for such weapons in the hills,” A. Pavan Kumar Reddy, Superintendent of Police, Tiruvannamalai, told The Hindu . The district police recently found country-made guns during a routine vehicle check in the hills, prompting the SP to organise the meeting with the tribal elders. Currently, the district police do not have any data on the total number of country-made guns in the hills. From time to time, such weapons are being seized. The most recent incident was in 2020, when two persons were arrested for possession of unlicensed guns in Thanipaid near Tiruvannamalai. Surrounded by thick forest, Jamunamarathur taluk is located on the northern side of Jawadhu hills, comprising 11 villages, including Amirthi, Senbagathoppu, Veerappanur, Puliyur, Melpattu, Kovilvur, Kuttakarai and Pattaraikadu in Tiruvannamalai district. Most of the residents of these tribal villages are farmers who cultivate saffron, sugarcane, banana, brinjal, tomatoes and green chillies. In 2016, a similar amnesty was offered to tribals in Jawadhu hills.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruvannamalai-police-reach-out-to-tribals-to-facilitate-surrender-of-guns/article36130931.ece

27 August 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Kumkis brought to chase away elephants raiding crops in Pandalur||Encroachers in Pandalur and Nadugani, illegally farming along corridors used by elephants to move between Nilambur and the Nilgiris are leading to problematic human-elephant interactions in Gudalur and Pandalur. With two elephants, a bull and a pregnant female, having been accused of damaging houses in Pandalur and Nadugani over the last week, three kumki elephants were brought to the division to help chase away the animals from human habitations. Sources in the Forest Department also said that they were considering capturing and translocating the elephants due to pressure from the public, who have staged various protests calling for the elephants to be captured. A Gudalur-based environmentalist, speaking to The Hindu , said that many of the people living in Pandalur and Nadugani, who have had their houses damaged, have been growing crops on land which is under dispute between residents and the government. The elephants were entering the habitations due to the presence of the farms in the region, the environmentalist added. B. Ramakrishnan, assistant professor at the Department of Zoology and Wildlife Biology at the Government Arts College in Udhagamandalam, said that renowned naturalist E.R.C. Davidar had identified 11 elephant corridors connecting Mudumalai and Nilambur that pass through Gudalur. “We will have to compare the corridors which were identified by Mr. Davidar and see if this region, too, would comprise one of the corridors used by elephants,” said Mr. Ramakrishnan. Three kumki elephants from the Theppakadu elephant camp had already been brought to Nadugani to drive away the elephants. Another kumki, Vijay, was added to the team of elephants and forest staff have been dispatched to drive away the elephants from the area. The elephants are said to be staying around Devalahatti and illegal gold mines are operating in the area. Local activists said that elephants pass through this region while travelling between Nilambur and the Nilgiris regularly, with the previous problematic interaction between humans and elephants in the region having taken place in February this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kumkis-brought-to-chase-away-elephants-raiding-crops-in-pandalur/article36130535.ece

The checking was intensified at Walayar, the busiest inter-State checkpost in the district, from Thursday morning. A joint team of the police, Health and Revenue Departments checked private vehicles from Kerala and allowed passengers into Coimbatore only if they produced proof of having taken both doses of any COVID-19 vaccinate, or a COVID negative report (RT-PCR) taken within 72 hours prior to the journey. A senior police officer said the checking of these documents was being done from August 2. It was, however, intensified after the rise in fresh cases in Kerala on Wednesday, the officer said. The police sent back several vehicles at Walayar checkpost as many passengers did not carry any of these documents. While two-wheelers and four-wheelers were stopped for checking, goods carriers were exempted. The officer added that people who travelled up to Walayar checkpost on KSRTC buses and crossed the border on foot were also checked for these documents before allowing them to board TNSTC buses to Coimbatore. E-registration facility was arranged at the checkpost for those who had not done it. Revenue Department staff imposed fines on the drivers of cars that were found carrying more than three persons. Only three persons, including the driver, are allowed, provided they possessed the mandatory documents, said another official. Similar checks continued at other inter-State checkposts, including Velanthavalam, Meenakshipuram and Anaikatti.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/passengers-from-kerala-turned-away-at-inter-state-checkposts-in-coimbatore/article36130544.ece
27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||7.5% quota in UG courses for govt. school students||“Though education is important to all students to enrich their knowledge and to help them lead a reasonable and meaningful life, the students from government schools, forming a distinct class, require more attention from the State for preferential treatment in higher education when compared to the students of private schools, who are provided a better environment and a different and conducive atmosphere for pursuing their education,” the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bill said. Considering the socio-economic condition, the disadvantage suffered and the past enrolment of government school students, the Commission recommended that no less than 10% of seats in engineering, agriculture, veterinary, fisheries, law and other professional courses be set apart to provide preference in admissions to government school students “without affecting the rule of reservation in force in the State”. The Justice D. Murugesan Commission was constituted to analyse the reasons for the lower number of government school students getting admission into engineering, agriculture, fisheries, veterinary and law courses at universities, self-financing colleges and government colleges, and recommend remedial measures. When Mr. Stalin sought the permission of the House to move the Bill, all parties supported the legislation. Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudi said the quota for government school students would not be applicable to deemed universities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/75-quota-in-ug-courses-for-govt-school-students/article36130498.ece

27 August 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||NEP to be implemented in all colleges under Rani Channamma University||Rani Channamma University will implement National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 across all the 398 affiliated colleges from this academic year. “The new policy is framed in such a way that a whole new generation of youth will be prepared for the challenges of the 21st century. We will strive to equip students academically, professionally, socially, economically and politically,” Vice-Chancellor M. Ramachandra Gowda said in Belagavi recently. “NEP is based on the spirit of Vishwamanava and Vasudaiva Kutumbakam. It is in this backdrop that the role of education has assumed tremendous significance. Education today needs to bridge the barriers between nations and uphold human values, integrity and harmonious relationships transcending borders,” he said. The NEP, among others, envisages: Students in this current year have to choose between two discipline cores available in the respective colleges for BA or B.Sc degrees. At the beginning of the third year, one subject can be selected as a major and another subject as a minor or two subjects can be chosen as major subjects. Along with two chosen discipline cores, students must select open electives and discipline electives in accordance with curriculum structure along with Kannada language and another language. For those students who have not learnt Kannada language in pre-university or 10+2 or who do not have Kannada as mother tongue, Kannada syllabus needs to be framed and taught. Students need not select the discipline core pertaining to subject related Bachelor’s degrees (B.Com, BCA, BBA, BVA and BPA). They only need to select Kannada language and another language along with open electives and discipline electives in accordance with curriculum structure. In the first year, if any student studies syllabus specified in National Skills Qualifications Framework Level 5 and earns the required credits and for varied reasons exits from the course, he will be issued a certificate. In the second year, if any student studies syllabus specified in National Skills Qualifications Framework Level 6 and earns the required credits and for varied reasons exits from the course, he will be issued a diploma certificate. In the third year, if any student studies syllabus specified in National Skills Qualifications Framework Level 7 and earns the required credits and for varied reasons exits from the course, he will be issued a bachelor degree certificate. Students can pursue their fourth year in the same college with their chosen subjects if the National Skills Qualifications Framework Level 8 is available in that college. If they complete the fourth year course and earn the required credits and complete the course, they will be issued bachelor honours degree certificate. In the fourth year, if their study includes research projects, then, such graduate honours degree holders are eligible to directly join doctoral (Ph.D) studies. If the student does not have bachelor’s honours degree classes in the college where he is studying, then he may enrol in another college where it is available for the fourth year graduate honours degree. There is no compulsion for colleges to run fourth year graduate honours degree classes. If the student discontinues studies at any stage due to various reasons, then, he can continue his studies in the same stage later. The maximum 40% of the credits that a student must earn in any stage of his study can be earned by him through official online course which will be credited to the academic account of the student. The student must obtain at least 50% credits from the university from which he wants to graduate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nep-to-be-implemented-in-all-colleges-under-rani-channamma-university/article36130674.ece

He told journalists that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman were selling public assets in the name of monetising them. The Union government is trying to hoodwink the people of the country by misleading them that they are not selling them, but only leasing them out. This is far from the truth, he said. “These assets will be sold to private companies and we will be forced to pay to use all public utilities that we have been using for free all these decades. This is a clear signal to the poor that they have no place in this country,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sale-of-public-assets-opposed/article36130675.ece
27 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Bylaws allowing hoardings to be revoked||The State government has made it clear that commercial hoardings will not make a comeback in Bengaluru and has decided to revoke the new ad bylaws that were set to pave the way for their return. This comes less than a month after the Urban Development Department issued a notification on the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Advertisement Rules, 2019, allowing advertisement hoardings under sections of the new BBMP Act, 2020. The decision to revoke the notification was taken at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai earlier this month to review development works taken up in the city. Hoardings were discussed in much detail during the meeting, following which it was resolved to revoke the new bylaws and instead implement the BBMP Outdoor Signage and Public Messaging Bylaws, 2018. Sources privy to the development said city Ministers who were part of the meeting had expressed their concern over the hoardings ruining Bengaluru’s aesthetics. The new bylaws, they pointed out, seemed to favour the advertisement mafia, while revenue to the civic body was also questionable. Sources added that a proposal to revoke the notification allowing advertisement hoardings was being prepared and would be submitted to the State government for approval shortly. Hoardings have been the centre of great debate in the city, with activists and citizen groups alleging that the government was trying to bring them back. In 2018, the BBMP Council passed a resolution banning advertisement hoardings for a year, but that was only after the High Court of Karnataka came down heavily on the civic body. Nearly a year later, the Urban Development Department published the draft BBMP Advertisement Rules, 2019, in an attempt to bring back hoardings. Following this, the civic body passed a resolution opposing the draft rules. However, the term of the council ended on September 10, 2020. Earlier this year, the previous government, headed by Chief Minister B.S. Yeddiyurappa, accorded permission to the bylaws and issued a notification on July 26. Incidentally, this was just a few days before Mr. Yeddiyurappa stepped down as Chief Minister. The move had taken many, even those within the BJP, by surprise as the party, in its election manifesto, had supported the ban on hoardings. The court is still hearing a PIL petition on advertisement hoardings.  Reason for decision Sources said city Ministers had expressed their concern over the hoardings ruining Bengaluru’s aesthetics. The new bylaws, they pointed out, seemed to favour the advertisement mafia, while revenue to the civic body was also questionable||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bylaws-allowing-hoardings-to-be-revoked/article36130443.ece
27 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Residents of layout complain about contaminated water||For more than a month, people living and working at Raghavendra Layout, an industrial pocket in Yeshwantpur, have been fighting for water that is clean and not a health hazard. The small locality, which has many industrial units, scrap yards, garment factories, and offices, has reportedly been getting contaminated water since July 21. Sadatan M.R., who owns a commercial building in the locality, claimed that repeated complaints to the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) had not yielded any results. Multiple inspections had also been conducted and assurances of setting the problem right were made by the board officials, he said. “We have also written to the BWSSB chairman. We have been made to run from pillar to post and forced to buy tanker water. We have bought more than one lakh litres of water so far. No alternate arrangement has been made by the BWSSB either,” he added. According to Anwar, who works in a scrap yard in the locality, the water supplied by the BWSSB smelled foul. He said he has been buying drinking water every day. This problem and the lack of a solution is making a few building owners hesitate before applying for a new water connection. “The neighbouring buildings have been complaining about the contaminated water despite paying bills. We are wondering if we should even seek a water connection now,” said a building owner, who has yet to apply for a connection. When contacted, the jurisdictional BWSSB official told The Hindu that a blockage in the main underground drainage line has been identified as the cause. “This major line is more than six metres underground. The BWSSB’s wastewater management division is trying to locate the blockage. The line is also slated to be replaced with a bigger pipeline and a tender has been floated for the same,” the official said. The official added that because of the blockage, there is sewage percolation in the water supply pipeline to Raghavendra Layout. “We have collected water samples from the layout and sent them for testing. We have also asked the building owners and businesses located there to use BWSSB water tanker service whenever required,” the official claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/residents-of-layout-complain-about-contaminated-water/article36130442.ece
27 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||COVID-19 incidence, mortality linked to air pollution status, say experts||There is worldwide evidence that both COVID-19 incidence and mortality are linked to the air pollution status of a place/people, said Arvind Kumar, chairman, Institute of Chest Surgery and founder and managing trustee, Lung Care Foundation. Speaking on Thursday, the first of the two-day India Clean Air Summit (ICAS 2021) organised by the Centre for Air Pollution Studies (CAPS) at the Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP), he said the linkages between air pollution and COVID-19 had been at the forefront of discussions from the beginning of the pandemic. “Air pollution is a national health emergency today. Earlier, only about 5% of my lung cancer patients were non-smokers, now almost 50% of them are non-smokers. However, everybody in India is a smoker today, including newborn babies, because they are breathing in polluted air. We need more awareness on this. Only then can there be awakening and action,” he said. He also termed “smog towers” a “colossal waste of public money”, and said whatever money was spent on towers needed to be spent on preventing air pollution. Daniel S. Greenbaum, president, Health Effects Institute, said the seasonal nature of the air-pollution problem is particularly intense. “It lets people think it is over and the political will slows down. These are not simple decisions. We need to identify the sources which have the greatest impact, in terms of not just air pollution, but its health effects,” he added. Almost 6% of global deaths are due to outdoor air pollution. India is in the range of 8-10%, and increasing. This is a cause of concern. While many countries are making progress on this front, we are not, said Vivekanand Jha, Executive Director, The George Institute for Global Health India, said: “The COVID-19 pandemic has made citizens aware of health --- more than ever before. With vaccinations, COVID-19 might be controlled, but air pollution is still a major threat.” “My fear is that once the pandemic situation improves, we will go back to our old ways, even more so because economic activity is so depressed, people are desperate to get back on track. Unless we present people with better alternatives, they will be going back to their old ways, once things become better,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-19-incidence-mortality-linked-to-air-pollution-status-say-experts/article36130452.ece
27 August 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||High Court provides relief to BSF sub-inspector on posting to Kashmir||In a relief to a sub-inspector of Border Security Force (BSF), the High Court of Karnataka has set aside his posting to Kashmir during the fag end of his service when he was given posting in Bengaluru in 2018 after noticing his medical condition and the status of his wife, who is a cancer patient from past 12 years. “The BSF ought to have deployed a streak of sympathy in the peculiar facts of the case of the petitioner, notwithstanding the fact that the petitioner being a part of the battalion will have to move once the battalion moves,” the court said while setting aside his posting order issued in January 2021. Justice M. Nagaprasanna passed the order while allowing a petition filed by Shivaji B. Bajantri of BSF’s 162 Battalion at Yelahanka. The court noted from the rule 11 of the Border Security Force (Tenure of posting and Deputation) Rules, 2000, that a personnel placed in low medical category gets protection from deployment in extreme hard or hard area and are required to be posted in a normal area or a static formation based on recommendations of the medical board. As the petitioner has already been downgraded to lower medical category due to his health status, the court said he gets protection from the rules from posting to an extreme hard or hard area. The court also pointed out that the rules also state that personnel of the BSF having good record of service and free from disciplinary/vigilance angles may be given posting near their home town two years before attaining the age of superannuation. The petitioner, the court said, “In terms of the rules, at the outset, was entitled to continue in Bangalore for a period of three years, and according to rule 10 he is insulated from transfer/movement as he is admittedly due to retire in the month of May 2022.” The posting of petitioner is clearly in violation of the rules, apart from being contrary to the medical reasons, to ensuring proper treatment to his wife at government’s Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bengaluru, for which he was posted here in 2018, the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/high-court-provides-relief-to-bsf-sub-inspector-on-posting-to-kashmir/article36130462.ece

27 August 2021||Benglauru,KARNATAKA||IISc solutions to generate more oxygen take off||Clinical trials on oxygen concentrators developed by researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), as one of the two key efforts to address the oxygen shortage during COVID-19, have found that they are on a par with compressed oxygen cylinders. To date, the technology has been transferred to 24 companies and about 35 units have been supplied to various hospitals, said IISc in a press release. It added that the Karnataka government recently issued a circular for the supply of two units each to 2,508 public health centres from the licensees. “A prototype capable of producing oxygen at more than 93% purity at 5 litres per minute (LPM) and 82% at 10 LPM was developed by August 2020. The researchers then modified this prototype which now delivers more than 93±3% purity oxygen at 10 LPM within three minutes,” stated the release. The second solution caters to the needs of hospitals — an oxygen generation system. “The process is based on a twin-bed swing adsorption system integrated with storage and discharge vessels, and various safety systems. Last month, the first unit based on this system was installed at the Pobbathi Medical Centre in Bengaluru,” the release stated. On August 15, Prof. Rangarajan, director of IISc, inaugurated an open-source design for a medical oxygen generation system with 50 LPM capacity. “The system will be installed at St. Mary’s Polyclinic in Lucknow, and has the capability to fill ten 47-litre cylinders at 200 bar pressure within 24 hours, apart from supplying oxygen to patient beds.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/iisc-solutions-to-generate-more-oxygen-take-off/article36130449.ece
27 August 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Decades after dam on Hemavati, scam emerges||Much water has flown in river Hemavati since a dam was built at Gorur, near Hassan, in 1979. Now, the grant of alternative land for farmers who lost their land to the project has turned into a scam involving more than 10,000 acres. The value of land granted violating the rules would run into several hundred crores of rupees. A police investigation into the grant of land between January 1, 2015, and November 30, 2018, has unearthed over 2,500 cases of fictitious records. Considering that each beneficiary was entitled to four acres, the total quantum of land would be more than 10,000 acres. The Special Land Acquisition Officers allegedly did not follow the rules and guidelines while granting land. As many as 226 people were granted land in possession of the Forest Department, even without assessing the value of trees grown there. However, the government is yet to act on the report of the investigation. Alternative land It was way back in the 1970s that land required for the Hemavati River Project (HRP) was acquired. The land-losers got certificates with respect to the extent of land they lost. Each certificate could fetch four acres of alternative land. However, the process of granting alternative land dragged on for decades. The Karnataka government had earmarked government land in Sakleshpur for HRP land-losers. “Many people got land sanctioned twice. A large number of people who got land sanctioned were not genuine land-losers. They created false records with the help of officials,” said a police officer. Many beneficiaries were those who had encroached on government land in Sakleshpur taluk. The modus operandi was simple: they applied for a grant through someone who had a certificate. They would ensure that the land they had encroached on was granted to the applicant and then purchased the same from the beneficiary. “All this involved a large amount of money. The encroachers legalised their act with the help of officials,” said the police officer. Recently, the police arrested a person who ran a photocopying shop at Sakleshpur on the charge of cheating a man after assuring him grant of land. During the course of the inquiry, the police took a Revenue Department official into custody. Signatures forged The scam began to unravel in 2019, forcing Deputy Commissioner R. Girish to appoint a committee under the chairmanship of H.L. Nagaraj, then Assistant Commissioner of Hassan sub-division, to conduct a probe. He found many irregularities in the grant of land. Some documents carried forged signatures of senior officials. Later, the administration filed FIRs with the police. The police conducted an investigation into the grant of land handled during the tenure of Special Land Acquisition Officers E. Vijaya, Ravichandra Naik, B.A. Jagadish, and Capt. Srinivasa Gowda. The police have submitted an interim report to the Deputy Commissioner. The district administration has served notice on 2,370 people, including the beneficiaries. Only a few have responded. The Deputy Commissioner will have to take the final call after hearing all the respondents. Revenue Minister R. Ashok, during a visit to Hassan in July, had said that the government would take stern action against all the people involved in illegal acts. K. Gopalaiah, who is Minister in charge of Hassan, has reiterated this. When journalists asked about the inaction of the part of the government even after an inquiry revealed irregularities, Mr. Gopalaiah said the Secretary of the Revenue Department was verifying the issue and suitable action would be taken against all those involved.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/decades-after-dam-on-hemavati-scam-emerges/article36130458.ece

Many have circulated it for the reasons he cited while resigning from the party. L. Shekhar, who was president of the party’s booth committee in Ashoka Nagar in Shivamogga, resigned on Wednesday, citing the party’s failure to bring down prices of essential commodities despite being in power both at the Centre and State. Interestingly, Mr. Shekhar submitted his resignation letter addressed to the party’s block president at a time when party leaders reached his residence on Wednesday to handover his name-plate. The party has been distributing name-plates with party symbol, meant to be displayed at the entrance of their houses, to its booth presidents. Mr. Shekhar, in his letter, said the BJP had failed to work for the people. The price of foodgrains, LPG, electricity bill, petrol, diesel and other essential items has gone up and people are facing difficulties. “I have remained silent unable to defend the party”, he wrote in the letter. When The Hindu contacted him over phone Shekhar said he had a long association with the BJP. Now, along with the post, he had quit the party as well. The 49-year-old Shekhar has a garage in N.R.Pura. “I have suffered a lot in the recent months due to the lockdown and steep hike in price of essential commodities. My earnings have come down drastically. When my condition is such, how can I defend my party in front of others? Many women in my locality scolded me when I met them for the party work”, he said.

27 August 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Protesting students seek strict punishment for rape accused||Condemning the alleged gang-rape in Mysuru and seeking stringent punishment for the accused, scores of students staged a demonstration under the aegis of All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) and All India Mahila Samskrutika Sanghatane (AIMSS) in Dharwad on Thursday. Staging the demonstration in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Dharwad, the students, mainly girls, condemned the incident in strong terms and said that despite recurrence of such incidents, the governments have failed to act. Addressing the protestors, district president of AIMSS Madhulata Goudar said that it was shocking that a girl student who had gone to Chamundi Hills with her friend was waylaid and gang-raped by rogues. She said that Mysuru being an education centre, girl students from across the country get admissions in the city for various courses. Such incidents not only put parents in a state of shock but also might lead to discontinuation of education in some cases. There was dire need for corrective measures and strict action against the accused, she added. She said that across the nation, such incidents are being reported on a regular basis and what was shocking was that self-proclaimed leaders and even elected representatives start blaming the victim and make comments instead of giving moral support. The Union government’s slogan of Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao had just remained a slogan, she said. “In the wake of recurrence of such ghastly crimes, there is a need for providing protection to girls. “AIMSS and AIDSO believe that pornographic films and literature and liquor consumption are the main reasons for such crimes and they should be banned completely. “The organisations will also urge the government to implement the Verma Committee recommendations to prevent such incidents,” she said. AIDSO district secretary Ranajit Dhoopad, AIMSS office-bearers Ganga Kokare and Devamma Devatkal and others led the protest and demanded immediate steps to ensure stringent punishment for the accused. They submitted a memorandum to the district administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/protesting-students-seek-strict-punishment-for-rape-accused/article36130683.ece
27 August 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||DEMU trains to run between Vasco-da-Gama and Kulem||South Western Railway on Thursday replaced conventional rakes of the Vasco-da-Gama-Kulem Passenger Specials with new Diesel Electrical Multiple Unit (DEMU) rakes. According to a press release, the first service of Vasco-da-Gama-Kulem DEMU Special, the first DEMU train of Hubballi Division, left from Vasco-da-Gama at 7.30 a.m. on Thursday. As per the changes made, Vasco-da-Gama-Kulem-Vasco-da-Gama Passenger Special (07342/07341) and Vasco-da-Gama-Kulem-Vasco- da-Gama Passenger Special (07343/07344) will now have new DEMU rakes. These trains will have a total of eight car coaches each. According to the release, in DEMU service, each car passenger carrying coach has its own source of motive power fitted below the coach. This enables the DEMU train to have quick acceleration and retardation making it ideal to operate as shuttles between stations located at short intervals. Local passenger services are ideally suited for DEMU type for its inherent advantages. It offers better comfort to passengers and is most suited for short distance commuter trains. Another advantage of the DEMU train is that it can operate in both directions as it has driving cabin at both ends. A DEMU train does not require any cumbersome engine reversal at terminal stations, which will save time. Unlike the conventional coaches which have a seating capacity of 90, DEMU cars can accommodate 105 passengers. Two new DEMU rakes have been procured at an approximate total cost of Rs. 42 crore. New service South Western Railway has said that along with the DEMU service, one more train service between Vasco-da- Gama and Kulem was started on Thursday. Accordingly, Train No 07379 Kulem-Vasco-da-Gama DEMU Special will leave Kulem at 12.20 p.m. and reach Vasco-da-Gama at 2.10 p.m. In the return direction, Train No 07380 Vasco-da-Gama-Kulem DEMU Special will leave Vasco-da-Gama at 1.05 p.m. and reach Kulem at 3 p.m. En route , the train will have stoppages at Kalem, Sanvordem-Curchorem, Chandargaon, Sanjuje Da Arey, Madgaon, Suravali, Majorda, Cansaulim, Sankval and Dabolim in both directions. General Manager of South Western Railway Sanjeev Kishore has in the release said that the introduction of the DEMU trains in South Goa, with increase in frequency of services from two to three, is another step towards catering to the needs of railway passengers. Arrangements have been made for maintaining these rakes at Vasco-da-Gama itself so that the DEMU rakes could be maintained during night while they were stabled there after the daily services, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/demu-trains-to-run-between-vasco-da-gama-and-kulem/article36130681.ece

Kumaraswamy on Monday said that Janata Dal( Secular) would launch a campaign from four places to draw the attention of the Centre and also to sensitise the people of the State. Addressing presspersons in Hubballi recently, Mr. Kumaraswamy said that injustice had been meted out people of Karnataka by the national parties and even when the same party was in power both in the State and the Centre, injustice was being meted out.   “We are waiting for the COVID-19 situation to ease.

27 August 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Govt. urged to withdraw restrictions on public celebrations of Ganesh festival||State president of Sri Ram Sene and head of Karuneshwar Mutt, Andola in Jewargi taluk, Kalaburagi district, Siddaling Swamy on Thursday demanded that the State government withdraw the orders issued imposing restrictions on public celebrations of Ganesh festival citing COVID-19. Siddaling Swamy has set August 29 as the deadline for the State government to lift the restrictions imposed on public celebrations of Ganesh festival. Members of Sri Ram Sene and Shivaji Brigade will hold demonstrations outside the residences of BJP MLAs across the State on August 30 if the government fails to fulfil the demands. Addressing presspersons here on Thursday, Siddaling Swamy criticised the government for allowing BJP’s Jan Ashirwad Yatra programmes. “The government also issued an order allowing cinemas, shopping malls and schools to open. And, when it comes to public celebrations of Ganesh festival, the government imposes restrictions in the name of the pandemic,” he charged. He said that thousands of people gathered during the Muharram processions across the State recently and violated COVID-19 restrictions, but no action was taken against them. The government should impose curbs on all such occasions if it is really concerned about checking the spread of COVID-19. He also threatened to boycott urban local bodies elections scheduled on September 3 if the government fails to withdraw the restrictions imposed on public celebrations of Ganesh festival.

27 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Panambur Beach in need of maintenance||The serene Panambur Beach, one of the major tourist attractions around Mangaluru, is now in a state of neglect with trash accumulated all over the two kilometres stretch. With very few socialising places available around Mangaluru, Panambur Beach, right across National Highway 66 and abutting the New Mangaore Port, has been one of the easily accessible locations for denizens as well as tourists. Panambur Beach Development Project maintained the beach for nearly 12 years without any government funding before it was asked by the Tourism Department to hand over maintenance in October last. The district administration constituted an executive committee comprising nine members to manage the beach headed by the joint commissioner of Mangaluru City Corporation. With the administration calling for tenders for maintaining the beach, technical evaluation of two bids received has been completed and financial evaluation is in progress, Deputy Director of Tourism, Dakshina Kannada, N. Manikya said. With tourists slowly trickling in after easing of the COVID-19 lockdowns, the accumulated trash, mainly comprising river flood residues as well as urban trash that flow into the sea through canals, on the beach play spoilsport, according to a resident in the neighbourhood Sadashiva Bangera. Chief Executive Officer of the Panambur Beach Development Project Yatish Baikampady said that its initiative in 2007 offering 15% of the profit to the Tourism Department annually was the game changer, while other bidders had sought up to Rs. 70 lakh per annum from the government for maintenance. The entity has paid up to Rs. 4 lakh when it earned profits and in some years, a nominal amount of Rs. 10,000 when there was no profit. The focus is on attracting more tourists to the beach and showcasing the beauty of the coastal region. Tourism development projects should empower the local population by offering employment than be a mode of revenue generation for the government, Mr. Baikampady said. The entity did not participate in the recent tender process, he said and added that it is prepared to offer expertise to the contractor who will succeed in the bidding process. Mr. Manikya said that intermittent rainfall dump the trash into the sea, which, in turn, gets washed ashore. The department has asked the city corporation to clear the trash, he added.  ‘Intermittent rainfall dump the trash into the sea, which, in turn, gets washed ashore and the city corporation has been asked to clear it’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/panambur-beach-in-need-of-maintenance/article36130853.ece

27 August 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Free green bins to be given to 20,000 houses in Ullal||Ullal City Municipality will on Friday launch a programme to distribute free green bins to about 20,000 houses for depositing wet waste, according to municipal Commissioner Rayappa. Each bin has a capacity to store 10 kg of wet waste. One such bin has cost the municipality Rs. 121, Mr. Rayappa told The Hindu . The aim is to discourage people from handing over wet waste to solid waste collectors of the municipality in plastic carry bags and thus, motivate them to strictly adhere to segregating waste at source, he said. The commissioner said that the municipality collected 11 tonnes of wet waste and eight tons of dry waste daily. In addition, two tonnes of poultry waste is generated in its jurisdiction comprising 31 wards. Of the wet waste collected, the municipality converted four tonnes as compost daily. The compost is being made at a site near the office of the municipality in Ullal and at a private site at Kallapu. Each site composted two tonnes of wet waste daily. The remaining seven tonnes of wet waste is being sent to Mangaluru City Corporation’s compost plant at Pachchanady. The municipality has identified two more private sites, one at Uliya and the other at Kallapu, for converting wet waste as compost. The compost units in those sites will be commissioned in another three months and the municipality will stop transporting wet waste to Pachchanady. Dry waste is being sent for recycling to Belagavi by further segregating it through an agency. Poultry waste is being used by a company in Baikampady for making animal feed. Mr. Rayappa said that the Ullal brand manure produced from wet waste and launched last week has already seen good demand. It is being sold at Rs. 10 per kg in packs of 10 kg each. This manure can be used for gardening and other agriculture purposes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/free-green-bins-to-be-given-to-20000-houses-in-ullal/article36130860.ece

Poovappa and his wife have been feeding these stray dogs and cats properly cooked hot food in the Hampankatta area here. Mr. Poovappa and his wife, Ragini, stay in the police quarters in Hampankatta. They prepare rice and chicken curry in the morning and evening. The food is neatly packed in newspapers. Before leaving for VIP escort duty and other duties in the morning, Mr. Poovappa walks nearly an hour to feed stray dogs at different points between the police quarters and the office of the Police Commissioner. He does the same after he returns home from work. There are about 10 cats in and around the couple’s house and they feed them the local bhootai fish every day. The bonding with these stray animals, Mr. Poovappa says, developed during their days in Talapady village. “There were a good number of dogs in the open spaces near our house and we developed a close bonding with them. Our association has since continued after we moved to Hampankatta 16 years ago,” he said. The couple feed about 50 dogs and 10 cats every day. The cooked rice is mixed with curry made using chicken liver which the dogs like. Chicken bone pieces are boiled after soaking them in turmeric water. Rice curry is neatly packed and each packet is offered to a dog along with a piece of chicken bone. And, the dogs dutifully wait for the food that he brings them. While feeding is done leisurely during the off-days, on working days Mr. Poovappa completes it before leaving for duty around 9 a.m. “We make it a point not to keep these animals starving. Care is also taken to ensure this food does not spoil their stomach,” he said. After dogs eat the food, Mr. Poovappa disposes of the newspapers in which the lunch is packed. Mr. Poovappa carries biscuit packets in his vehicle and feeds stray dogs at the Circuit House and the places he visits while on duty. In addition to feeding, Mr. Poovappa takes care of stray dogs that are ill and provide them necessary medicine. Asked about the money he spends every month on feeding and medical care, Mr. Poovappa said that he has not kept an account of it as these animals “are part of my family”. He adds that it roughly comes to around Rs. 14,000 per month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/stray-dogs-cats-are-close-to-them/article36130862.ece

This is in addition to other ingredients and hence 5 kg of rice was sufficient “according to me”. His comment comes in the backdrop of Mr. Siddaramaiah promising to distribute 10 kg of rice free if Congress was voted to power.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/5-kg-of-rice-is-enough-katti/article36130888.ece
27 August 2021||Mysuru/Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Gangrape case: Police tracking mobile tower data for clues||The police probing the alleged gangrape of a postgraduate student in Mysuru on August 24 are tracking the calls made during the time of the crime using the mobile towers at the location to secure a lead on the culprits. The student was gang-raped near Chamundi foothills around 7.30 p.m. The scene of the alleged crime, near Lalitadripura, is a deserted area with no habitation. The police have searched the area for items that could have been possibly left behind by the gang. There were some liquor bottles in the vicinity. The police are examining CCTV camera footage from bars and restaurants along the Outer Ring Road. Additional Director-General of Police (Law and Order) Pratap Reddy visited Mysuru on Thursday to get an update on the investigation. Along with Commissioner of Police Chandragupta, Mr. Reddy visited the scene of the alleged crime near Chamundi Hills, and later convened a meeting of senior officials. The slew of crimes reported from Mysuru in the last few weeks has raised concerns about the deteriorating law and order situation in the city, which was once known to be a pensioners’ paradise and cultural capital of Karnataka. The rape of the student comes close on the heels of a heist at a jewellery shop in which dacoits opened fire, killing a bystander. Political parties have questioned the BJP’s “lack of governance”. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has said the law and order situation was deteriorating not only in Mysuru but across Karnataka. Malavika Gubbivani, district convener of the AAP, urged Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and Home Minister Araga Jnanendra, to take up women’s safety as a priority. “Parks, roads, and playgrounds in Mysuru lack lighting at night. Mysuru City Corporation and other agencies should install CCTV cameras in public places while the police should increase night patrolling,” she said. Congress panel Meanwhile, the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee has set up a fact-finding committee headed by the former MP V.S. Ugrappa to submit a report to the party on the gangrape incident in Mysuru. MLAs Tanvir Sait, Yathindra Siddaramaiah, and Roopa Shashidhar, KPCC Mahila Congress president B. Pushpa Amarnath, and the former Minister H.M. Revanna are prominent members in the 12-member committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/gangrape-case-police-tracking-mobile-tower-data-for-clues/article36130459.ece

Transport Minister Antony Raju has said the test piling work will begin on September 1. For the construction work to begin, two workshop buildings at the KSRTC bus stand will be demolished. Buses will be diverted through the eastern side of the depot. Three trees will be felled, for which the Alappuzha municipality has already granted permission. The KSRTC workshop and garage will be temporarily shifted to Valavanadu. Mr. Raju directed the officials concerned to get the workshop at Valavanadu ready by October 20. He said all arrangements for the commencement of the first phase of construction of the mobility hub would be completed by November 1. KIIFB funding The mobility hub with a total built-up area of 1,75,000 sq ft will come up on 4.07 acres where the KSRTC bus station is located at a cost of Rs. 129 crore and is funded by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). The multi-storey structure in the model of a snakeboat will have bus terminals, multiplex theatre, restaurants, commercial complex, retail shops, and hospitality services. As per the design, the bus terminal area is spread over 58,000 sq ft. Seventeen pickup and drop-off points are proposed to control crowds during peak hours. The ground floor of the facility will host a cafeteria, A/C and non A/C waiting lounges for male and female passengers, toilets, an information desk, and a waiting area. The first floor will have facilities for parking 37 buses. As per the plan, a total of 32,628 sq ft commercial area is extended across three floors.

(Breakthrough infections are those who contracted COVID-19 14 days after taking both the doses of vaccine). A health official said the Chief Minister ordered to conduct the study after a rise in the breakthrough cases. An increase in breakthrough cases was reported in the district from April. As many as 1,899 persons contracted the virus after taking the first dose and 201 after taking both the doses. However no case of death was reported in the two categories up to April 21.

27 August 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Activists oppose alternative route to National Highway-766||The Nilgiri-Wayanad NH and Railway Action Committee has urged the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to withdraw from its plan to prepare a Detailed Project Report (DPR) for an alternative route to NH-766 to connect Mysuru to Kozhikode via Kutta–Gonikoppal to resolve the issue of the night traffic ban on the Bandipur route. The alternative route would not be a solution to the night traffic ban, T.M. Rasheed, convener of the action committee, said. The move of the NHAI was the result of a conspiracy and influence of a vested interest group to divert the route, Mr. Rasheed alleged. The lobby was trying to sabotage all attempts to find a pragmatic solution to the night traffic ban on Karnataka’s part of the highway, he said. The proposed alternative route would pass through the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary and Rajeev Gandhi National Park as well as the highly ecologically fragile areas of Kodagu district in Karnataka, he said. However, the lobby was gaining favourable ruling by influencing officials and even misleading the Karnataka High Court and Supreme Court by hiding the facts, he said. Hence, the Kerala government should be alert so as to resist the movements of the lobby, he said. The government should intervene by suggesting construction of overbridges similar to the ones in the Pench National Park in Madhya Pradesh, he said. As the Central and Karnataka governments wanted an alternative route to NH-766, the Kerala government should suggest an alternative road through Sulthan Bathery-Chikkibergy as a practical solution. The State government should direct the NHA to prepare a DPR on the Sulthan Bathery-Chikkibergy route as suggested by the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC), he said. The State should try to convince the Union Road Transport and Highways Ministry and Supreme Court of the significance of the route, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/activists-oppose-kuttagonikoppal-alternative-route-to-nh/article36130751.ece

27 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Risk of death lower among vaccinated||An audit of 280 COVID-19 deaths in Ernakulam has revealed that nearly 98% of deaths had occurred among those who had not been fully vaccinated. They included people who have not received even one dose of vaccine. “The data showed that vaccines are effective in reducing deaths. We have seen a similar pattern in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, where fatality rates have come down among vaccinated population,” said Rajeev Jayadevan, convener of the scientific committee and former president of the Kochi chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA). Maintaining that vaccine effectiveness had brought down the number of deaths, Dr. Jayadevan cautioned the public against lowering the guard against COVID-19 with the confidence that they have been vaccinated. “We are witnessing an increase in breakthrough infections in the district. People need to step up vigil despite being vaccinated,” he said. M.G. Sivadas, Reproductive and Child Health Officer and nodal officer for immunisation, said vaccine hesitancy was not even one per cent among the target population in Ernakulam. “The demand for vaccine is considerably high. Around 96.6% of the target population above 60 years had received the first dose. About 30,000 persons in this category could not receive the first dose, as they had tested positive over the last three months,” he said. Dr. Sivadas said 85% of the target population in the district had received the first dose. Around 28% of the target population have been fully vaccinated, as per the latest estimates. Booster dose On the demand for a third dose / booster dose, he said vaccination could be administered only in accordance with guidelines issued by the Central and State governments. Dr. Jayadevan said efforts had to be made to reduce vaccine hesitancy, even if it was considerably low among the target population. “We should realise that the number would be huge even if it is one per cent of the target population. The district should also have more drive-in vaccine camps to increase coverage,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/risk-of-death-lower-among-vaccinated/article36130788.ece

Plea by association The Bench comprising Justice Devan Ramachandran and Justice Kauser Edappagath issued the directive when a review petition on COVID-19 treatment charges filed by the Kerala Private Hospital Association came up for hearing. During the hearing, the counsel for the association as well as the counsel for the Indian Medical Association (IMA) brought to the notice of the court the incidents of attack on doctors and nurses in the State by patients and caregivers. The court observed that unless health-care workers, including the doctors and nurses, were allowed to function peacefully, it would be impossible “to rein in the deleterious consequences of the pandemic and other-related diseases.” The court observed that such incidents would undermine the morale and courage of the health-care workers to continue their fight against COVID-19, particularly when the State was seeing a surge in cases. Counsel for the IMA and the association submitted that if attacks on doctors and other health-care workers continued, it might be very difficult for the health-care system to function properly. Legal provisions The Government Pleader submitted that the Kerala Healthcare Service Persons and Healthcare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage to Property) Act had provisions for stringent punishments to those who indulged in attacks on health-care workers and institutions. The government would ensure the protection of every stakeholders in the health-care system. Besides, the government would take steps to enlighten the people on the need for acting in a civilised manner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ensure-safety-of-health-care-staff-hc/article36130796.ece

The first floor of the 55-year-old two-storey structure developed cracks, and a section of it partially collapsed. Police and Fire and Rescue Services personnel evacuated people from nearby shops and commercial establishments. “We also disconnected power lines as a precautionary measure. Gas cylinders and other inflammable materials in the building and nearby shops were also shifted,” said J.S. Jogy, District Fire Officer. A hotel functioned on the ground floor of the building, while the first floor was being used as office space. Kochi Corporation Secretary A.S. Naisam said notice had been served on the building owner asking why the building licence should not be cancelled for failure to ensure its structural safety. “The corporation has demolished the damaged portion of the building. This was done to avert any further accident in the wake of a complete collapse of the structure,” he added. Preliminary assessment by the Fire Department and the civic body revealed that no measures had been taken by the owner to ensure the structural safety of the decades-old building. The owner is learnt to have told officials that he did not carry out repair work, as there was a plan to demolish the structure for constructing a shopping complex. The corporation will ask the owner to demolish the ground floor.

27 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||West Kochi canals have turned stagnant wet patches: report||Canals in West Kochi have become stagnant wet patches owing to loss of depth by siltation, bottlenecks created in the channel by civil structures, stagnation caused by bunds, and dumping of solid waste, according to a report by the Irrigation Department. An evaluation of the state of canals in West Kochi by the department pointed out that many of them had been encroached upon for construction of roads. As water transport lost its shine, canals in the region were neglected and became points of deposition of liquid and solid waste, the report said. Besides Kalvathy canal, Manthra, Rameswaram, Pandarachira, Pashnithodu, and Pallichalthodu are the major canals in the area. All the canals are at sea level, and the natural flow of water is sluggish or non-existent in them during non-rainy days. Tidal oscillation alone infuses some life into the system. Dumping of waste and large-scale encroachment have prevented the natural function of tidal canals in the region. If tidal water is allowed to seep past the canals, they will remain clean and lively all through the year, the report suggested. In many places in the city, sewage from housing colonies was seen directly being discharged into canals. The canals, which carried clean water once, are now carrying putrid water. Apart from the deteriorating water quality, waste deposition is also a major factor causing blockage to free flow of water. The clogged canals and road drains are unable to effect speedy drainage of stormwater which causes flash floods in Kochi city, the report pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/west-kochi-canals-have-turned-stagnant-wet-patches-report/article36130778.ece

27 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Curbs on private buses to affect KSRTC too||With the government issuing a notification preventing private buses from plying in routes beyond 140 km of their area of operation, fear is rife that this will further stifle Kerala’s public transport sector that is struggling to stay afloat. It will also affect the operators and crew of around 5,000 private buses that offer long-distance services. The public too will end up paying more to travel on KSRTC’s super class services which are expected to take over such routes. “Bus operators have submitted around 400 objections to the notification, as the deadline for public hearing expired on Thursday,” said T. Gopinathan, general secretary of All Kerala Bus Operators Organisation. The notification will force private buses that operate long-distance services to ply on routes within the 140-km limit. “This will throw into disarray the time table of private and KSRTC services. The notification goes against the earlier policy to permit private bus operators to continue existing services,” he added. The decision will further deplete the fleet of private buses, which has fallen from 35,000 two decades ago to just around 12,000, in the State. The debt-ridden KSRTC is in no position to fill the void, with the result that too many private vehicles will ply on roads, said M.B. Satyan, president, Kerala Private Bus Operators Federation. “All sections of passengers will be affected if the government implements this decision. Students will be the worst hit, since super-class buses of the KSRTC will charge much more than private buses that offer limited stop services,” Mr. Satyan said. ‘A monopoly’ Former Senior Deputy Transport Commissioner B.J. Antony said the move intended to create a monopoly for the KSRTC on long-distance routes, under the garb of route nationalisation. “This is among the many blunders successive governments have been making in the past 15 years. The KSRTC is in no position to operate new services,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/curbs-on-private-buses-to-affect-ksrtc-too/article36130791.ece
27 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||KSRTC yet to resume all services in Kochi||The air-conditioned low-floor buses of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) are yet to resume operations in Kochi, despite around 70% of private buses getting back to the road following improved patronage for public transport during the Onam festive season. This many private buses have resumed services on the hope that the government will waive road tax (which comes to approximately Rs. 1.20 lakh per bus annually) for the third quarter as well. Still, patronage is sound only during peak hours, said K.B. Suneer, general secretary, Ernakulam District Private Bus Operators Association. Almost the entire 190-strong fleet of AC low-floor buses, barring a dozen which operate in the Thiruvananthapuram-Kozhikode sector, remain grounded, including at the KURTC depot at Thevara here. Several non-AC low-floor buses were taken to Thiruvananthapuram where they were rebranded for operations in the State capital, KSRTC sources said. Most buses have remained thus for over a year, despite concern that they will suffer mechanical problems due to continued non-use, although workers have been directed to start and move them at frequent intervals. KSRTC Managing Director Biju Prabhakar said non-AC low-floor buses would be reintroduced in Kochi and Kozhikode once their operations stabilised in Thiruvananthapuram. “For this, crew and passengers have to get used to the e-ticketing system and the one-day travel card that is on the anvil in the State capital.” Sources in the agency’s Ernakulam unit said more services could be operated in keeping with passenger patronage, which is now limited to peak hours. Additional services are being operated during peak times. At the same time, several commuters fear to board AC buses due to the pandemic situation, they added. Most Thirukochi buses too have not resumed regular services, including on mofussil routes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ksrtc-yet-to-resume-full-fledged-services-in-kochi/article36130768.ece

The petition was filed by an employee of the Kerala State Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC). He said he had chosen not to get vaccinated against COVID-19. He had already taken three RT-PCR tests to attend his duty and it was very difficult to take the test continuously as it costs more than Rs. 500 a test. He wanted the government to educate the public about the vaccine and dispel doubts about its efficacy before imposing restrictions. The decision taken on August 4 to restrict the movement of those who had not been vaccinated was illegal as it violated Article 21 of the Constitution. ‘Do not entertain plea’ When the petition came up for hearing, the State submitted that 68% of people had got their first dose of vaccine. This kind of petition should not be entertained, especially when the test positivity rate stood around 20% and the daily COVID-19 cases were nearly 30,000 a day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/plea-against-mandatory-test-for-visiting-shops/article36130795.ece

The court said that the claims of the Adivasis and SC/ST families remained unresolved either because they had not been given the land promised or because the land offered to them was unsuitable for living.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/honour-pact-on-land-hc-tells-govt/article36130792.ece
27 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Cysts of 4.2 kg removed from woman’s chest||A team of surgeons at the Sunrise Hospital here removed two large hydatid (a parasitic disease caused by tapeworm) cysts weighing 4.2 kg that was formed in the chest and abdomen of a 35-year-old woman belonging to Palakkad. The woman had approached doctors after she experienced difficulty in breathing and had nausea for two months. The CT scans revealed two large hydatid cysts, one measuring 12x8 cm with multiple daughter cysts and occupying almost 75% of the right chest and pushing the heart to the left. Another large cyst was seen in the abdomen attached to the liver, measuring 20x15 cm. The right lung had almost completely collapsed due to the compression of the cyst and she was surviving on the left lung alone. The surgeons removed the large cyst from the adjacent organs without causing any injury. The cyst wall was excised along with the half of the lung and the diaphragm was repaired. With the removal of the huge cyst, the lung was able to expand to its full capacity. The surgery lasted around nine hours, according to the doctors. A hydatid cyst is caused by infection by tapeworm that affects mainly the liver, lungs and brain. The disease is contracted after coming in contact with dogs, sheep, cattle, or pigs which have been affected by tapeworm. Doctors suspect that the woman may have got the disease from cattle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cysts-of-42-kg-removed-from-womans-chest/article36130785.ece

27 August 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Laity forum opposes new order of liturgy||Almaya Munnettam, a group of lay people in the Ernakulam-Angamaly Archdiocese, has decided to oppose what it termed as unilateral imposition of an order of worship which would mark a deviation from the 50-year-old practice of the priest facing the congregation while leading the Mass. Leaders of the organisation said this while addressing people from different parishes who laid siege to the Ernakulam-Angamaly Archbishop’s house here on Thursday. They added that the imposition of a new order of worship was against the Pope’s efforts to usher in unity. Parish council meetings had passed a resolution asserting their preference for priests leading the Mass facing the congregation. Memorandum A total of 466 priests, Synod heads and thousands of laity members had submitted a memorandum to the Pope in this regard. The Synod must withdraw itself from attempts to go against the opinion of Church members, failing which the members would have to wilfully disobey any imposition of the new customs. The Major Archbishop and Synod heads would be held responsible for this and it would affect the warmth of bishop-laity relations, the organisation said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/laity-forum-opposes-new-order-of-liturgy/article36130770.ece

27 August 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Non-COVID patients at the receiving end||As the Kollam District Hospital continues to be a total COVID-19 facility, delayed treatment and procedures are causing difficulties to non-COVID-19 patients. In the absence of inpatient facility and surgeries, many are forced to opt for private hospitals. While the outpatient department is functional, dialysis, chemotherapy and a couple of cardiology procedures are the only other services provided by the hospital now. “Before the pandemic, the outpatient footfall per day was around 3,000 and now the number has gone below 1,000. Most of our cardiology and urology patients are now depending on private facilities or medical college hospitals in neighbouring districts,” says a hospital official. Over 100 surgeries Earlier, the hospital used to conduct around 60 cataract surgeries a day and over 40 major surgeries from various departments, including orthopaedics, ENT and urology. “We were asked to go to Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital since the hospital is now admitting COVID-19 patients only. My daughter requires regular hospitalisation due to a renal disorder. Taking her there for tests and procedures in the middle of restrictions is not easy and we cannot afford private facilities. They are ignoring patients with chronic issues and focussing on COVID cases who are mostly discharged after a week,” says Latha Devi, a resident of Anchal. While the Health Department has been diverting patients to taluk hospitals, the facilities are struggling to cope with the inflow. “Taluk hospitals are not equipped to accommodate all patients who are under specialty care. We have seven theatres inside one main theatre and the taluk hospitals with minimal facilities are no match. Non-COVID-19 patients are suffering and the hospital too is facing a major revenue dip,” adds the official. Medical equipment worth crores are lying unused in the hospital under the Kollam district panchayat. “The current situation is causing much hardship to commoners. We can set aside 50% beds for non-COVID-19 patients as we have other facilities like the one with 1,000 oxygen beds in Chavara. We should be considerate towards the underprivileged sections who completely depend on the District Hospital,” says district panchayat president Sam K. Daniel. Meanwhile, health officials feel reconverting the hospital is not feasible since the caseload is rising in the district. Third wave “At present, the District Hospital is conducting all emergency cardiology procedures, chemotherapy, dialysis and autopsies. We have made arrangements at taluk hospitals for surgeries. It is practically not possible to reconvert the hospital, especially when we are expecting a third wave,” says R.Sandhya, Deputy DMO. She adds that the 1,000-bed facility at Chavara was only a CFLTC. “We will not be able to manage with CFLTCs that accommodate patients with minor problems. We need a proper hospital with ICU facility for severe ‘B’ and ‘C’ category patients,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/non-covid-patients-at-the-receiving-end/article36130826.ece

27 August 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Uncertainty over DCC chief deepens in Kottayam||As the Congress high command is finalising the list of new District Congress Committee presidents in Kerala, the party unit in Kottayam appears to be on the knife edge in the absence of a consensus on who should get the job. According to sources, the party leadership is considering a handful of leaders for the post after attempts by K.Sudhakaran, president of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee, to build support for a person above group equations collapsed. The names that came up for consideration during the initial consultations were that of Eugene Thomas, Nattakom Suresh, Jomon Aikkara, and Philson Mathews. Of this, the first two seem to have emerged as the frontrunners with Mr. Suresh also enjoying the State leadership’s backing. Mr. Suresh, regarded as close to P.T. Thomas, also has the backing of Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan while Oommen Chandy has so far desisted from suggesting any specific names. The district unit, however, appears to be more inclined towards Mr.Thomas while the community equations too put him well ahead of Mr.Mathews. The chances of Mr.Aikkara appear too bleak in view of a Vigilance case against him. With Mr. Chandy in its leadership, the ‘A’ group commands a considerable dominance in the party here. The ‘I’ group remains almost insignificant while a group supporting K.C.Venugopal has been active in the district of late. “The ‘A’ group has been leading a fractured field since the previous local body elections even when its interests align at a broader sense. The appointments in the neighbouring districts of Pathanamathitta, Alappuzha, and Idukki will also have a bearing on the selection of the next DCC president in Kottayam,” said a senior leader. For instance, if the new DCC president in any of these districts belongs to the Ezhava community, it may naturally affect the prospects of Mr.Suresh, a member of the same community, he added. In Pathanamthitta Meanwhile in Pathanamathitta, Satheesh Kochuparambil, KPCC secretary and former member of the Mahatma Gandhi University Syndicate, appears to have almost sealed his spot as the next DCC president. The name of Mr.Kochuparambil, who is associated with the ‘A’ group, was unanimously nominated to the post, according to sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/uncertainty-over-dcc-chief-deepens-in-kottayam/article36130827.ece

This was decided at a meeting chaired by Vice-Chancellor M.K. Jayaraj here on Thursday. The programme titled COFE (College Fitness Education) will have theory and practical sessions in the form of a massive open online course. Tom K. Thomas, convener of the Syndicate standing committee on sports, said that a good sporting culture would help students overcome mental stress and depression. Those who attended the meeting pointed out that physical health would lead to mental health and contain violent instincts among the youth. It was the University of Calicut which implemented a sports education scheme for college students for the first time in the country. Practical sessions were planned for undergraduate students in the first four semesters. As it was an optional project, only interested students joined it. Those who successfully completed the project were given six marks in each semester. The new scheme envisages theory sessions in the first and third semesters and practical classes in the second and fourth semesters. Subjects such as Yoga, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, diet, nutrition, stress management would be covered. Theory classes would be held online. A committee led by physical education teachers would oversee the project. The students would get two credits each in four semesters. V.P. Sakkeer Hussain, director, Department of Physical Education, said that a workshop would be held for preparing a module for the project. It would be implemented after getting the approval from the Syndicate and academic council.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/varsity-to-make-fitness-education-mandatory/article36130749.ece
27 August 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Study COVID’s impact on migration: expert||With conflicting reports emerging on mass reverse migration of Keralites from Gulf countries and falling foreign remittances, experts have called for a study on the impact of COVID-19 on short-term and long-term migration in Kerala. The last study on migration in the State was done in 2018. An estimated 14-15 lakh people out of the 21 lakh non-resident Keralites may have come back from the Gulf region since the beginning of the pandemic in mid-March 2020. “The figure could be based on the repatriation flight data accessed by the State and conveys only one-way flow of return migrants. At least five lakh could have possibly migrated to new destinations or gone back to the same countries,” S. Irudaya Rajan, chairman, International Institute of Migration and Development, told The Hindu . In this context, Dr. Rajan said the prevailing migration trends would have to be re-examined as migration from Kerala to the Gulf countries had been diminishing over the years due to the cumulative effect of demographic change, decline in wages in the Gulf, decline in oil price, and the nationalisation policies of the GCC countries. Figures of 2018 As per the Kerala Migration Survey 2018, carried out by Dr. Rajan and K.C. Zachariah for the Centre for Development Studies, there are 2.1 million migrants from Kerala across the world. However, there has been a decline of 3 lakh migrants during 2013-18. The estimated total remittances to Kerala were Rs. 85,092 crore in 2018, an increase from the Rs. 71,142 crore reported in 2014. “A reason is that Keralites in the Gulf have climbed up the social ladder and earn higher wages,” he said. Incidentally, bank deposits by non-resident Keralites rose by 14% to Rs. 2.27 lakh crore in 2020 according to the World Bank data. However, such deposits are not remittances but money parked in NRE accounts in domestic banks. “The decline in remittances will be about 10%,” Dr. Rajan said. Pending proposal He said a proposal was pending with the State government to study the impact of COVID-19 on migration in Kerala. This will help determine migration, return migration, and remittances in the immediate post-pandemic future. Besides, the study will identify the major issues faced by workers from Kerala in other countries. Further, it will help gauge the impact of COVID-19 and global lockdown on those who intend to migrate and suggest strategies for future, Dr. Rajan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/study-covids-impact-on-migration-expert/article36130748.ece

Transport Minister Antony Raju opened the facility, Mak Twin Towers, which was constructed by the Kerala Transport Development Finance Corporation (KTDFC) at a cost of Rs. 74.63 crore. In his inaugural address, Mr. Raju said the commercial complex would emerge as one of the prime business spots in Kozhikode city. Delivering the presidential address, Public Works Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas said the new facilities at the terminal would benefit people from different sectors. He also said the scope of connecting the KSRTC with prominent tourism destinations would be explored. K.V. Moideen Koya of ALIF Builders accepted the key of the commercial tower from Mr. Raju. B. Ashok, IAS, Chairman, KTDFC, presented the project report. Forest Minister A.K. Saseendran, Ports Minister Ahammad Devarkovil, KSRTC Managing Director Biju Prabhakar and Thottathil Raveendran, MLA, were present. The leasing of the commercial complex was pending due to technical issues related to securing of no-objection certificate from the Fire and Rescue Services Department and building number from the Kozhikode Corporation. Insufficient lease amounts quoted by a majority of bidders had also delayed the opening of the commercial complex. According to KSRTC officials, the newly opened facility with two towers would offer a total built-up space of 38,069 square metres. Altogether, 21 floors have been made available for commercial purposes. Besides, the complex was constructed with facilities to park 40 buses at a time at the terminal. Space for shops, restaurants, offices, and IT hubs have been created separately to attract business, they said. The complex will also offer spacious parking facilities for 250 cars and 600 two-wheelers. According to officials, wayside parking in the area could be reduced to a great extent with the opening of the new parking facility. It was on June 1, 2015 that the twin-tower project along with the bus terminal was officially inaugurated. The space was developed utilising nearly 3.22 acres of prime land available in the heart of the city. According to officials, the expected revenue as rent from the commercial complex alone was Rs. 43.20 lakh a month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ksrtc-commercial-complex-thrown-open-for-businesses/article36130762.ece

The Minister was speaking at the opening of a KSRTC terminal complex in Kozhikode city. He said eight such fuel stations, including the one at the newly opened KSRTC terminal station in Kozhikode, would be opened for the public in the first phase. “The KSRTC has 70 fuel stations under it in the State. Arrangements are in place to open all these stations in the coming days,” said Mr. Raju. Connecting destinations The Minister said the State government would strive to introduce KSRTC services connecting various prime tourism destinations in the State. “Preliminary discussions have already been held on the proposal. We will also be holding further discussions, as the project will give a fresh impetus to the tourism sector,” he said. As a first step, he said, the KSRTC would start a special service from Kadalundi to Kozhikode Medical College on September 10. “It was one of the demands put forth by Tourism Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas. We approved it as Kadalundi was an emerging tourism destination seeking better connectivity,” he said. City circular service The Minister said the second phase of the KSRTC’s city circular service would be launched in Kozhikode after the first phase trial in Thiruvananthapuram city next week. “The circular service will ensure uninterrupted connectivity between various prime spots in both the districts,” he said. Transport policy Announcing the decision of the State government to go ahead with the formation of a new transport policy, the Minister said the lack of a policy was creating a lot of technical hurdles for government departments and vehicle owners. “We have already agreed in principle to formulate the policy at the earliest. It will help to deal with about 2.5 crore vehicles in Kerala very effectively,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/fuel-stations-to-be-opened-for-public/article36130764.ece

The road, riddled with potholes and narrowed by undergrowth in many areas, continues to pose a threat to the safety of motorists and pedestrians. According to local residents, there was no renovation work on this important link road after 2013. “Since it is one of the important link roads between the Kozhikode bypass and Kannur road, many local people are depending on the route for travel and to avoid busy highways. Repair works have not been done on the road for more than seven years citing fund shortage,” says V. Ramakrishnan, a local resident. There were many incidents of two-wheeler riders falling down after hitting the water-filled potholes during rainy seasons, he points out. Those who come to enjoy the panoramic view of the wetland areas in and around Eranhikkal and Kaippurathupalam are also finding it difficult to travel on the route. According to them, a renovated road can improve the tourism prospect of the area where a pedal boat service had been proposed by the Tourism Department. A public crematorium and a number of local industrial units are located along the damaged road. There is also a proposal to set up an industrial estate. Local residents say waste dumping is rampant in the area because of the undergrowth. Functionaries of the local residents’ association said the tourism prospects of the wetland area were dim with the cold-shouldering of various local development projects including the road development.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/canal-service-road-remains-accident-prone/article36130758.ece

Ibrahim Pullatt had been brought to Kozhikode to gather evidence in the case registered in Kozhikode city. Crime Branch officials hinted that he was involved in coordinating with investors in the business in other States. The Crime Branch squad took up the case very seriously as there were preliminary investigation reports which confirmed the presence of extremist elements using the parallel telephone service for their communications.

This happened even as discussions were on between him and Calicut University officials over modifying some existing courses and introducing new ones, Mr. Faizal told The Hindu on Thursday. The Lakshadweep administration recently gave nod to start a new community college under Pondicherry University on the islands. A.

The courses to be discontinued include BA (Arabic), MA (Arabic), MSc (Aquaculture), MA (English), MA (Economics), and MSc (Mathematics). “The proposal to cancel the courses was in the self interest of the Administrator,” he said. Mr. Faizal said that it was convenient for the students to pursue their higher studies through the University of Calicut and not Pondicherry University. “I have urged the administration to revoke the proposal,” he added.

27 August 2021||Malappuram,KERALA||Descendants of Kunhamad Haji protest against ICHR move||The Chakkipparamban family descendants of Malabar Rebellion leader Variyamkunnath Kunhahamed Haji staged a dharna in front of the Passport Seva Kendra here on Thursday, protesting against the Indian Council of Historical Research’s (ICHR) move to erase the names of Haji and 386 ‘Moplah martyrs’ from the Dictionary of India’s Freedom Fighters. A.P. Anil Kumar, MLA, inaugurated the dharna staged under the banner of the Chakkipparamban Family Association. About three dozen members belonging to the fifth and sixth generation of Variyamkunnath’s family took part in the dharna. The protesters said that nothing worse could be expected from a section of people who were out there to separate the current generations in the name of religion. “The Sangh Parivar is trying to separate the nation for its hideous agenda. We can’t expect anything good from them,” said C.P. Abdul Wahab, secretary of the Chakkipparamban Family Association. The protesters said that the Sangh Parivar should lower its head in shame as it had zero role in the country’s freedom struggle. “The rebellion Variyamkunnath led in Eranad in 1921 was anti-feudal and anti-British. The feudal lords had supported the British, and that’s why the rioters turned against them,” said Mr. Wahab, a fifth generation descendant of Variyamkunnath. Chakkipparamban Family Association district president C.P. Ibrahim Valluvangadu presided over the protest. Those who led the dharna were C.P. Ismail, C.P. Chereeth Haji, C.P. Kuttimon, C.P. Kunhimohammed, C.P. Ibrahim, C.P. Abdurahman, C.P. Kunhutty Haji and C.P. Mohammedali. Variyamkunnath’s father C.P. Moideenkutty Haji hailed from Nediyiruppu near Kondotty. He migrated to Nellikkuthu near Pandikkad as the British harassed him. Later, he shifted to Eerattupetta, where he was caught by the British and deported to Andaman. Variyamkunnath grew up at Valluvangad near Pandikkad. “He was a great patriot. His biography clearly proves that. He had the support of many Hindus. The British hated him as he challenged them. And now the Sangh Parivar hates him because of their political agenda,” said Mr. Wahab.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/variyamkunnath-kunhahamed-hajis-descendants-stage-stir/article36130755.ece

27 August 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Seeking to cleanse officialese of ‘colonial hangover’||A silent campaign is on in the State, demanding major corrections in the official Malayalam used in government and related spheres. At the helm is a WhatsApp group, titled Sauhruda Bhasha Group, pushing for an overhaul of the language being used in official records and applications. As many as 40 panchayats in Palakkad and neighbouring districts have been approached with the demand for changes. The Mathur grama panchayat will hold a meeting on August 31 to discuss the demand. Sources say that the panchayat is likely to drop the use of words such as ‘sir’ and ‘apeksha’ (meaning request) as part of joining the language modernisation drive. The idea, which germinated from Boban Mattumantha, a young social worker based at Malampuzha, has gained momentum with more and more youngsters joining the campaign. “A few government and court orders inspired us to launch the campaign,” said Boban. He said many words being used in Malayalam were rooted in colonial and monarchical background. “Those in power treated the people like subjects or slaves during the British Raj. Hence, we had many words conveying too much humility while making representations to the government. Gone are those days. Today, people are in power. They do not have to be at the mercy of those in governance. To get or know something from the government is their right. Therefore, words like ‘apeksha’ (request), ‘thazhmayayi’ (humbly), ‘tiyan’ (referring to the person) should go,” said Boban. ‘Remnants of the Raj’ The group raised many words which, though still being used in officialese, have acquired a colour of being archaic. The group targeted the police department for the use of ‘pretha vicharana’ in Malayalam for police inquest of a human body. “We are living in a modern age. How stupid it is to call a body ‘pretham’. It is time we started changing,” said A.C. Sidharthan, a campaigner in Puthupariyaram. In a memorandum he submitted to Puthupariyaram panchayat president the other day, Sidharthan demanded that the civic body stop using such words as ‘bahumanappetta’, ‘vineethamayi’, ‘angekku’, ‘avarkal’, ‘dayavundayi’, ‘thazhmayode’, and ‘apekshikkunnu’. “All those words are remnants of the British Raj. We don’t need them any more,” he said. ‘Right, not request’ The campaign demands that the ‘apeksha form’ meaning request form should be changed to ‘avakasha patrika’ meaning rights form. “We are not insisting that what we suggest should be used. Let the government work on it and come up with suitable alternatives,” said Boban.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/seeking-to-cleanse-officialese-of-colonial-hangover/article36130802.ece

Satheesan on Thursday slammed the government for its inability in plugging the gaps in COVID-19 containment strategies. Addressing the media, Mr. Satheesan attributed the failures in the system to bureaucratic high-handedness. “A group of bureaucrats, including the Health Secretary, has hijacked the defence mechanism of the State against COVID-19. Those ruling the State should show some common sense instead of just under-signing the reports handed over by these officials,” he said. Shift to RT-PCR Mr. Satheesan also accused the government of failing to establish a solid contact tracing system and demanded a complete shift to the RT-PCR testing mechanism. “At present, about 75% of the COVID-19 tests conducted in the State are antigen tests and there is an urgent need to move to a complete RT-PCR test programme. The ratio of contact tracing, on the other hand, remains just 1:1.5 as against the ICMR norm of 1:20,” he said. Mr. Satheesan also urged the government to address the apprehension among the public over COVID-19 vaccination. “If the government fails to conduct a proper investigation into the deaths that are alleged due to the vaccination and explain things to the people, it may even affect the ongoing vaccination drive. The Chief Minister and the Health Minister are acting without understanding the seriousness of the issues,” he said. Mr. Satheesan also accused the government of fudging the COVID-19 data, holding that it would seriously hamper the formulation of strategies for preventing a possible third wave. “ICU beds and ventilators are already in short supply in many districts while of the Rs. 817 crore mobilised as the Vaccine Challenge Fund, only Rs. 29 crore has been spent. The actual number of pandemic-related deaths is yet to be released,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/covid-containment-has-gone-awry-satheesan/article36130837.ece

Even as other government employees receive bonus for Onam, 12 personnel at the centre have not been paid bonuses for the past six years, they claim. Three other staff members – a cook and two trainers for candle-making and weaving — too are awaiting their salary dues, says a security team member. The security personnel are appointed by the hospital development committee. However, financial crisis, particularly in the wake of COVID-19, has hit their salary payments. They have not been paid allowances either. Unlike other government medical institutions that raise money for paying security personnel from visitor or parking fee, the Mental Health Centre does not have a recourse to such avenues. Source of income Internships to nursing students are the main source of income for the hospital. In the wake of the pandemic, internships were stopped to prevent any spread of infection from students to patients. Without income for the hospital development society, salary payments to the security personnel stopped. A member of the security team says he has worked at the hospital for eight years. Some of them have more than a decade of service. Five of them are widows of ex-servicemen. Having to deal with mentally ill patients, both in the outpatient and in-patient wings, their work is fraught with risks. They are also short-staffed, with mostly four personnel on duty at a time on a campus of 36 acres, he says, adding that his family has been making do with his ex-servicemen pension. Order ignored It is understood that Rs. 3.5 lakh is due as salary to the employees. Hospital authorities say that as per a 2016 order, the security personnel can be paid from the wages head of accounts. However, the order has been ignored and the Directorate of Health Services (DHS) was asked by the Finance Department to use its funds. However, the file has been returned by the DHS, citing lack of funds. Financial crisis had reared its head earlier too. Last year, their salaries for six months were paid from the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund at one go. A couple of years ago, the hospital development society committee decided to pay their salaries from a fixed deposit it maintained, but that money has been exhausted, the security personnel allege, calling for a permanent solution. They had approached the Health Minister’s office nearly a month ago, but to no avail, they claim.

27 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Witnesses disprove fish vendor’s claims||The allegation of misbehaviour levelled by a fish vendor against the Karamana police took a turn on Thursday after multiple eyewitness accounts, visual footage and scientific reconstruction of the purported incident disproved her claims. In an incident that initially appeared to draw parallels with a recent occurrence at Attingal, Maria Pushpam from Valiyathura claimed to have been subjected to high-handedness by two police officials attached to the Karamana police station while selling fish near the Karamana bridge on Wednesday. She alleged that they had toppled the vessel containing fish for sale before leaving in their police vehicle. But a video clip apparently recorded by a motorist on phone showed that the police officers remained inside the four-wheeler, while asking her to clear the area as she was found to be obstructing traffic. In addition, three eyewitnesses maintained that the allegations were false. One of them, Yusuf, a trader, told mediapersons that he saw the vendor dumping the fish vessel on her own in a fit of rage while arguing with the police. A scientific team comprising forensic experts also visited the spot to reconstruct the incident. Their findings strengthened the theory that the fish basket was toppled by Ms. Pushpam herself. Assistant Commissioner, Fort, S. Shaji submitted the findings and statements to City Police Commissioner and Inspector General Balram Kumar Upadhyay later in the day. Charges backed However, Ms. Pushpam, who has not submitted a formal complaint, remained firm on her allegation that the policemen had thrown her fish on the road. Asking why she would throw away the fish she sold for a living, Ms. Pushpam claimed that several people had witnessed the incident and came in support of her. Kerala Swathantra Matsya Thozhilali Federation and the Kerala Congress faction aligned with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) took up the cudgels for the fish vendor and held separate demonstrations outside the Secretariat. Meanwhile, Labour Minister V. Sivankutty ordered the District Labour Officer to conduct an immediate enquiry and submit a report on the incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/witnesses-disprove-fish-vendors-claims/article36130973.ece

The government has tasked the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT), Thiruvananthapuram, with conducting a study on the socio-economic fallout of the pandemic. While the government has not set a specific time-frame for completing the complex exercise, GIFT has also been asked to suggest effective measures to pull the economy out of the ''unprecedented crisis.'' Almost all sectors of the State's economy has been ''severely affected'' by the pandemic, the Finance Department noted in an August 18 order, entrusting the study to GIFT.  Unprecedented crisis ''The economic crisis and health-care issues triggered by the pandemic have pushed the State’s finances to an unprecedented crisis. The impact of the pandemic-induced lockdown and containment restrictions have adversely affected the economic and social well-being of almost all sectors, especially employees in the informal sector, agriculture, tourism, hospitality, MSMEs and on so on,'' according to the department. For the study, GIFT is planning to adopt a two-pronged approach that involves surveys and consultations with stakeholders from the different sectors, GIFT director K. J. Joseph told The Hindu . In suggesting steps to overcome the economic crisis, GIFT is expected to critically look at measures adopted by other States and countries. During the 2020-21 period, the pandemic adversely impacted all the major sectors, with consequences on the livelihood of lakhs. The period has also seen a fall in remittances from abroad. Government estimates show that around 14 lakh Keralites returned home due to the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/gift-to-assess-fallout-of-covid-19/article36130771.ece

The Congress set up a mock intensive care unit in front of the Secretariat to spotlight the surge in new infections, hospitalisations and pandemic deaths in the State. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed that Kerala had become the COVID-19 capital of India. Both parties chose to view the growing tide of infections through the political lens. They said the government had declared an early victory over the pandemic and failed to prepare for the worst. ‘In intensive care’ “Kerala is in intensive care,” said Shashi Tharoor, MP, who inaugurated the protest. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said the government had buckled under the weight of the latest COVID-19 surge. Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan said the government’s inoculation programme had collapsed despite an abundant supply of vaccines from the Centre. Kerala’s home quarantine strategy had failed. The administration has admitted belatedly that the ill-thought programme had turned homes into super-spreader locations. Meanwhile, Health Minister Veena George maintained that the government had anticipated the post-Onam COVID-19 surge and prepared in advance. Request to Centre Chief Secretary V.P. Joy and his counterpart in Maharashtra held an online meeting with the Centre.

The Kerala State Higher Education Council (KSHEC), which is spearheading its implementation, has already trained nearly 2,500 teachers in Moodle as part of an endeavour to bring the higher education sector under an open-source learning management system (LMS). According to council member-secretary Rajan Varughese, the Moodle-LMS platform has currently been operationalised at the College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram, and Government Brennen College, Thalassery. The entire faculty at these colleges were trained recently. “Around 50 colleges have expressed willingness to be involved in the digital enablement drive and to avail themselves of the server facility required to install the platform for institutional use. Thirty-five colleges will be brought under its ambit in the first phase. These include 20 government colleges,” says Dr. Varughese. He says the Digital University Kerala (DUK), which has been partnering with the KSHEC in project implementation, currently has the capacity to provide the LMS server for at least 50 colleges. The KSHEC has also approached the State Data Centre (SDC) for server facilities for the programme. Other State universities equipped with such facilities can become part of the movement by dedicating their available servers for affiliated colleges, he says. Faculty training The council has imparted training on LMS to 2,059 teachers, thereby exceeding the government’s target to equip 2,000 teachers with the necessary know-how on the cloud-based LMS during its 100-day programme. A six-day faculty development programme for 400 teachers from State universities and affiliated colleges from September 1 will take this count to 2,459.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/digital-enablement-scheme-gains-momentum-in-kerala/article36130793.ece

Excise Commissioner S. Anantha Krishnan suspended N. Sankar, Inspector, EE&ANSS, from service pending an enquiry. A department enquiry headed by Additional Excise Commissioner, Enforcement, Abdul Rashi, had found that Mr. Sankar's "inaction and inability to take charge of the situation and ensure proper action" resulted in the botch-up. Mr. Rashi also recommended disciplinary action against Vinoj, Circle Inspector, Excise, for gross negligence of duty. The government transferred him to Vellarikundu to ensure non-interference in departmental proceedings. The Excise Commission transferred M.A. Shibu and M. S. Sivakumar, Civil Excise Officers, and K. S. Pramod, Preventive Officer, for “helping Sankar in his nefarious actions.” The drug case has its provenance in intelligence generated jointly by the State Excise Enforcement Squad (SEES) and Customs, Preventive. It handed over the case to the Kochi unit with the information that the gang had secreted at least 2 kg of the drug in three apartments in Ernakulam. However, for unknown reasons, the Kochi squad allowed one of the prime accused in the case to walk free. It also did not account for the seizure of the deer antler. Moreover, the Kochi squad registered the case in a manner alleged to be advantageous to the accused. Some officers refused to endorse the Mahassar report and registered their opposition in writing. The issue became a scandal after surveillance camera images of the accused moving the drug out of one of the apartments went viral. The “embarrassment” prompted Excise Minister M. V. Govindan to order an internal enquiry. He said that officials if found guilty, would face action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/drug-probe-botch-up-excise-acts-against-errant-officers/article36130753.ece

Wind tunnels are large devices used to study the effects of air flows past solid objects; in this particular case, scale models of launch vehicles and spacecraft. As the name suggests, the trisonic facility will enable the VSSC, which is the lead ISRO centre for launch vehicles, to carry out tests in three different speed regimes - subsonic, transonic, and supersonic. The blow-down type wind tunnel under construction at the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) will have a simulation range of 0.2 Mach to Mach 4 speeds. “We are planning to have the first blow-down in February 2022. It was planned for November this year, but the second wave of COVID-19 has caused some delay,” an ISRO official said. Space missions So far, ISRO has been supported by the trisonic wind tunnel at the National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL), Bengaluru. But this facility is over 50 years old. Besides, the need for a trisonic wind tunnel of its own was deeply felt by ISRO given the heft of the space missions lined up for the immediate future such as the crewed Gaganyaan project. Important parts of the tunnel include air storage vessels, a settling chamber where the air flow is ‘smoothened’, and nozzles through which the air is let into the test section. Hypersonic tunnel The VSSC already has a hypersonic wind tunnel, which is needed for testing parameters of re-entry missions. This facility, which can simulate flow speeds up to Mach 12, was commissioned in 2017. The ISRO centre is in the process of piecing together the various components of the trisonic wind tunnel, a work which has been awarded to Tata Projects Ltd. A giant settling chamber for the wind tunnel which arrived at the Kollam port from Mumbai is currently on its way to Thumba by road on hydraulic-axle trailers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/trisonic-wind-tunnel-being-set-up-at-thumba-space-centre/article36130927.ece

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan formally launched Pravasi Bhadratha Pearl, a nano-enterprises assistance scheme; the Pravasi Bhadratha Micro for micro enterprises; and Pravasi Bhadratha — Mega that is being implemented through the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC). Pravasi Bhadratha – Pearl is designed for the weaker/low-profile category of NoRK returnees with less savings and income. The scheme, which promises loans up to Rs. 2 lakh, will be implemented through the Kudumbashree Mission. An amount of Rs. 30 crore has been earmarked for the scheme. Pravasi Bhadratha Micro, to be implemented through the Kerala Bank and cooperative societies and nationalised banks, envisages loans up to Rs. 5 lakh. An amount of Rs. 10 crore has been earmarked for the scheme. Pravasi Bhadratha — Mega is envisaged to provide loans in the range of Rs. 25 lakh to Rs. 2 crore. Time-bound solutions The Chief Minister urged NoRKs to make the best use of the schemes. He said that the State government has been taking steps to address the problems faced by NRKs in a time-bound manner. Many of the around 15 lakh Keralites who returned to the State are the victims of pandemic-induced job loss. The State government is duty-bound to protect them, Mr. Vijayan said. Help desks During the pandemic, the government had paid special attention to the plight of NoRKs. Special help desks were started in 16 countries.

27 August 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||KSERC moots changes in power tariff norms||The Kerala State Electricity Regulatory Commission (KSERC) is pushing for a number of significant changes in the regulations governing the determination of electricity tariffs in the State. Two of the key takeaways from the draft KSERC (Terms and Conditions for Determination of Tariff) Regulations, 2021, published by the commission this month revolve around the method of sharing of profits and losses from the electricity business with consumers, and the sale of surplus energy. Profit sharing Under the ‘Mechanism for sharing of gains or losses on account of controllable factors,’ the draft says that half the amount of the aggregate gain from power generation, transmission or distribution business — as determined by the commission — “shall be passed on to the consumers as a rebate in the tariff.” The aggregate loss shall not be passed on to the consumers. The existing 2018 regulations recommend one-third of the gain to be passed on as a rebate in the tariff. According to the draft, the commission can permit the licensee (the KSEB, for instance) to sell surplus electricity to its consumers instead of selling it in the open market or power exchanges. This can be done in two ways — the surplus can be sold to open access consumers (industries) at a price existing in the power exchange at the respective time block of the day. The licensee should declare the surplus electricity available in advance through its website. For other consumers, the sale can be made at the power exchange price at the average price of the day subject to certain conditions. Further, the draft says that the commission would also strive to gradually reduce the cross-subsidy among consumer categories with respect to the average cost of supply. The commission will fix the retail supply tariff for each consumer category of various distribution licensees separately on the basis of their aggregate revenue requirement and expected revenue from charges (ARR & ERC), the truing-up of accounts, and after considering the overall performance, the draft noted. For five years According to the draft, the regulations will be in force for a five-year period from April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2027. Generation, transmission and distribution licensees are required to file, under the multi-year tariff (MYT) framework, ARR and tariff petitions for each year of the five-year control period and the capital investment plan for each year by December 15, 2021. The commission has published the draft on its website. The commission noted that it consider objections and suggestions before finalising the regulations.  The draft says half the amount of aggregate gain from power generation shall be passed on to the consumers as a rebate in tariff||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kserc-moots-changes-in-power-tariff-norms/article36130824.ece

Sivankutty has urged the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to address the concerns of local residents residing close to the toll plaza erected along the NH-66 bypass at Thiruvallam. Mr. Sivankutty, who represents the Nemom Assembly constituency, visited the area and interacted with people residing nearby on Thursday. He also discussed the issue with project director P. Pradeep and liaison officer M.K. Rahman. The Minister urged them to discuss with their higher-ups the possibility of deferring toll collection along the Kazhakuttam-Karode NH-66 bypass stretch until the completion of the project. Local residents must be permitted to travel through the toll plaza without being required to pay the user fee. Steps must also be adopted to develop the service roads and prevent water-logging in the area. In a statement, Mr. Sivankutty said that a high-level meeting will be called to resolve the issue. Public Works Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas will also participate in the proposed discussion, he said. The Minister had written to Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari, Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor, seeking their intervention in the issue. In his letter to Mr. Gadkari, Mr. Sivankutty said toll collection has begun despite less than half of the 21-km stretch from Kovalam to Karode being developed. MLA writes to CM Meanwhile, Kovalam MLA M. Vincent wrote to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and urged him to take the issue up with the Central government. Orders must also be issued to the district administration to suspend toll collection until the completion of the project, he said. Both the Congress and the CPI(M) have been agitating against the collection of user fee at the toll plaza. Their prime demands — permitting free travel for local residents and deferring toll collection until the completion of the project — are yet to be accepted by the NHAI.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/address-concerns-about-toll-plaza-sivankutty/article36130975.ece

No one was injured in the incident. District Collector Nagalakshmi Selvarajan was away on a visit to the Puttaparthi constituency at the time of the incident. Repair works were going on as the roof of the functional drawing room of the bungalow had a water seepage problem. When contacted, Ms. Nagalakshmi said that wire concealing works were also going on, but none was present in the room at the time of the incident. It was built during the British time. A few supporting wooden members of the tiled roof seemed to have given way. It has to be ascertained if the building is safe for the District Collector to continue to stay there as it is her camp office too. The Collector would have to get it assessed and repaired by some agency. “The Roads and Buildings Department, which used to take care of all the government buildings, was asked through a G.O. not to take up the maintenance work since 1999-2000,” said R&B Superintendent Engineer. Now, every department has to fend for itself and maintain its buildings. The first District Collector’s office had been established in 1807 by the first Ballari District Collector Sir Thomas Munro. Probably, this camp office was built during that time.

Taking forward Anantapur MP Talari Rangaiah’s demand for the release of additional funds for developing a campus on the 491 acres given by the State government in Bukkarayasamudram mandal close to the city, Mr. Venkaiah Naidu asked the Union Minister of State for Education Subhas Sarkar (who was present in the function online) to look into the issue and ensure early release of funds so that the university could produce some graduates with extraordinary skills. “The people of Rayalaseema who are in a position to support the university must come forward and donate to establish a premier facility in their homeland instead of entirely depending on government,” said the Vice-President. He also advised the State government to be more generous towards this university. Infrastructure support There is a digital divide in the country in the post-COVID-19 scenario with online classes becoming a necessity.

27 August 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Breakthrough infections not alarming’||Karnataka has recorded 14,421 breakthrough COVID-19 infections and 126 of the patients have succumbed to the disease ever since the start of vaccination. Breakthrough infections are those that occur among people who have contracted COVID-19 despite being vaccinated. According to data from the State Health and Family Welfare Department, while 11,881 infections and 109 deaths were reported among those who have taken the first dose, 2,540 infections and 17 deaths were reported among the fully vaccinated. State Health Commissioner K.V. Trilok Chandra said the numbers are not alarming as only 0.03% of the 93,04,200 fully vaccinated people in the State have been infected again. Asserting on the effectiveness of the vaccine, the Commissioner said: “Not more than 150 of them required hospitalisation. It is very important that people should continue to follow COVID-19 precautions even after getting vaccinated.” While 3,88,53,903 crore people have taken at least one dose of the vaccine in Karnataka as of Thursday, over 93 lakh people have been fully vaccinated with two doses. According to a recent study published by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), breakthrough infections were predominantly caused by the Delta variant of the virus during the second wave in India. Delta variant V. Ravi, member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in the State, said that almost all the breakthrough infections were due to the Delta variant of the virus. “Evidence from genome sequencing of breakthrough infections shows that Delta is the culprit. There are concerns that newer variants of the virus could also emerge through breakthrough infections,” he said. U.S. Vishal Rao, Dean of Centre of Academic Research at HCG Cancer Centre, who is a member of the State’s Genomic Surveillance Committee, said that a majority of the 126 deaths reported have occurred in Hassan and Mysuru. While sources said this could be due to serious adverse events that patients in these districts would have developed following immunisation, Dr. Rao said : “This would most likely signify the possibility of vaccine escape mutations acquiring in some specific strains that were seen in Hassan and Mysuru.” C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said the same process of risk assessment and triaging should be done for those whocontract the disease even after being fully vaccinated. “Only those with co-morbidities, if symptomatic, may require hospitalisation for monitoring and further management. Among those who have contracted breakthrough infections, we have noticed that ICU admissions are significantlylow,” he said. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said: “The ICMR study has found that only 9.8% of the breakthrough infections required hospitalisation. What is even more reassuring is that none of those patients required an ICU or ventilator during hospitalisation. This suggests that vaccination can significantly reduce the risk severity and mortality”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/breakthrough-infections-not-alarming/article36130347.ece

Mr. Bommai said the meeting largely focused on disputes related to the Cauvery, the Mahadayi, and the Krishna water sharing with neighbouring States. With regard to the proposed balancing reservoir in the Cauvery basin at Mekedatu in Ramanagaram district, Mr. Bommai said it had been decided to put forth the State government’s stand when the case gets listed for hearing next time in the apex court. The Tamil Nadu government has opposed the Mekedatu project and filed a petition in the court. A citizen has also filed a petition in a court in Madurai in Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka’s legal team has been told to argue the case to get it quashed since it has no locus standi . Tamil Nadu has unanimously passed a resolution urging the Union government not to accord permission to Karnataka for the Mekedatu project. Holding that “downstream interlinking river projects being implemented in Tamil Nadu are illegal in nature”, the Chief Minister said another petition would be filed in the Supreme Court against the neighbouring State and the matter would also be taken up with the Union government. Mr. Bommai said the dispute over Kalasa–Banduri Nala project in the Mahadayi basin was also discussed. The hearing of the case is listed in September. The legal team has been told to explain the main issues in the special leave petition. Goa has been opposing the State’s project. The legal team has been asked to prepare a plan for early issue of a gazette notification by the Centre on sharing of the Krishna waters. The Telangana government has filed a petition before the court seeking to resolve the dispute.  Mr. Bommai said he met senior advocates Mohan Katarki on Wednesday and Shyam Divan on Thursday and discussed ways to proceed in view of the existing water disputes. “In a week or so, they will inform us of the progress,” the Chief Minister said.

27 August 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Mysuru rape: Minister backtracks after CM’s rap||A day after the gang rape of a college student and attack on her friend near Chamundi foothills shocked Mysuru, Home Minister Araga Jnanendra caused outrage with a series of insensitive statements, which he was compelled to retract after a reprimand by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai. Mr. Jnanendra, speaking to press persons on Thursday morning had questioned the timing of the victim’s visit to the site of the alleged crime. Responding to a query, he said: “They [victims] went to a desolate spot, at 7.30 p.m. They should not have gone there at that time. But, we cannot stop anyone from going anywhere...” Later in the day, accusing the Congress of “politicising” the incident, Mr. Jnanendra said in Bengaluru: “Rape has occurred there [Mysuru]. But Congress is trying to rape the Home Minister here.” When asked to explain his statement, he told mediapersons that he meant it as a “joke”, and did not intend to hurt anyone. ‘Irresponsible’ The Congress strongly condemned the remarks of Mr. Jnanendra. “Not just him but his entire party should answer for such irresponsible statements,” said KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar. He said the police ought to “book cases against Congressmen who were attempting to rape the Home Minister”. However, the Chief Minister, who was in Delhi, took note of the gaffe and stated categorically that he did not endorse the Home Minister’s statements. Speaking to mediapersons, Mr. Bommai said that he had asked the Home Minister to clarify. “I have also asked senior officials probing the case to report to me directly,” he said.  Minutes later Mr. Jnanendra expressed regret over his comments and said he was retracting his statements. “It was out of concern that I made that statement about the victim. She is like my daughter and will ensure she gets justice,” he said. A group of men allegedly raped a student after assaulting her male friend near Chamundi foothills on August 24 night. The alleged incident occurred around 7.30 p.m. in the wooded area near the helipad, in Alanahalli police station limits. The student and her friend were admitted to a private hospital around 1.30 a.m. on August 25. Both of them are out of danger. An FIR has been filed at Alanahalli police station. No arrests have been made so far. Mysuru has seen a series of protests by various groups demanding that the culprits be brought to book immediately. Meanwhile, the Karnataka State Commission for Women has sought a report from the Mysuru police on the incident. It has taken suo motu cognisance of media reports about the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/mysuru-rape-minister-backtracks-after-cms-rap/article36130343.ece
27 August 2021||CHENNAI,ANDHRA PRADESH||7.5% quota in UG courses for govt. school students in T.N.||The Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly on Thursday unanimously adopted a Bill seeking to earmark 7.5% of seats on a “preferential basis” for students from State government schools in admissions to undergraduate courses in engineering, agriculture, veterinary, fisheries, law and other professional programmes offered by universities and private, government-aided and government colleges in the State. The beneficiaries of the quota would be required to have studied from Classes VI to XII in State government schools. ‘Real equality’ The legislation, introduced in the House by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, stated that the Tamil Nadu government decided to take affirmative action with the aim of bringing about “real equality” between students who studied in government schools and those who studied in private schools. The existence of “ de facto inequalities” between students of government schools and those who studied in private schools was evident from the report submitted by the Justice D. Murugesan Commission, it said. “Though education is important to all students to enrich their knowledge and to help them lead a reasonable and meaningful life, the students from government schools, forming a distinct class, require more attention from the State for preferential treatment in higher education when compared to the students of private schools, who are provided a better environment and a different and conducive atmosphere for pursuing their education,” the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bill said. Considering the socio-economic condition, the disadvantage suffered and the past enrolment of government school students, the Commission has recommended that no less than 10% of seats in engineering, agriculture, veterinary, fisheries, law and other professional courses be set apart to provide preference in admissions to government school students “without affecting the rule of reservation in force in the State”. The Justice D. Murugesan Commission was constituted to assess and analyse the reasons for the lower number of government school students getting admission into engineering, agriculture, fisheries, veterinary and law courses at universities, self-financing colleges and government colleges, and to recommend remedial measures to ensure due representation of government school students. When Mr. Stalin sought the permission of the House to move the Bill, all parties, including the principal Opposition party, the AIADMK, supported the legislation. Leader of the Opposition Edappadi K. Palaniswami spoke in support of the Bill. The Speaker said the Bill was being moved with the unanimous support of the House. Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudi said the reservation for government school students would not be applicable to deemed universities.The Bill was passed unanimously. The AIADMK members were not in the House when the Bill was adopted, as they had staged a walkout over another issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/75-quota-in-ug-courses-for-govt-school-students/article36130454.ece

Attributing it to heavy crowing at marriage venues, arrival of people from the neighbouring States, and increasing number of devotees at premier temples in the district, a senior medical officer deplored that lack of public cooperation and non-serious way of official surveillance would make the thrid wave a reality. In the last one month, there has been a gradual rise in the movement of people and violation of COVID-19 norms in the public transport system. Almost all the APSRTC buses, including inter-State services, have reported satisfactory occupancy rate. The COVID-appropriate behaviour such as wearing a mask and maintaining physical distance has been completely ignored. “People have almost stopped using hand sanitisers,” said a sanitary inspector in Chittoor. A paramedical staff member at Srikalahasti said that though she had been getting calls from a few headmasters of government schools to arrange random tests for students, she was helpless. “We have been told to conduct not more than three tests in a day,” she added. At a ZP High School in an eastern mandal, the teachers were forced to send 15 students back home as they had symptoms. “Though we have a thermal scanner, we can’t just consider them as normal. We have asked them to go home and get themselves tested for COVID-19,” headmaster of the school said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/pandemic-graph-rises-in-chittoor-again/article36130901.ece
27 August 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Three of a family ‘end life’||Three members of a family committed suicide at Rachapalem village, about 5 km from Puttur, on Thursday, allegedly vexed with the harassment of moneylenders. Satish (35), a farmer and small trader, had reportedly taken over Rs. 1 crore as loan from several sources, including moneylenders, friends and relatives, in the last 18 month. Unable to cope with the pressure being mounted for payment of interest and principal amounts, Satish had gone absconding. The debtors later started questioning Satish’s parents and younger brother about his whereabouts. In the last two days, the debtors allegedly started threatening them with legal action. Unable to bear the humiliation, Satish’s parents – Sankaraiah (66) and Guravamma (55), along with their younger son Vinay (22), consumed poison, and were found dead in their house.  (Those with suicidal tendencies can dial 100.)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/three-of-a-family-commit-suicide/article36130405.ece
27 August 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Major fraud’ detected in BoB’s Kalikiri branch||The police on Thursday detected embezzlement of funds in the Kalikiri branch of Bank of Baroda (BoB). The fraud, allegedly involving a few bank employees and DWCRA groups, came to light when the police were investigating into the complaints lodged by the bank’s customers. It was alleged that in the last couple of months amounts were being deducted from the accounts of a few DWCRA members without their knowledge as they received no messages to that effect. The deductions were shown only on updating of the passbooks. A few customers complained that their fixed deposits were withdrawn without their knowledge. It was alleged that about 150 accounts had been tampered with. It was also found that a majority of the funds had been transferred into the account of one bank employee. While admitting that fraudulent transactions had taken place in the bank, a police officer said, “Senior officials from BoB’s Regional Office in Tirupati are inspecting and verifying the records. Preliminary information is that a few bank staff had conducted transactions online after working hours and had also obtained passwords of the customers. It is alleged that Rs. 3 crore has been embezzled. A final picture is expected by Friday evening.” Meanwhile, anxious moments prevailed as customers reached the bank to know about the safety of their deposits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/major-fraud-detected-in-bobs-kalikiri-branch/article36130406.ece

27 August 2021||hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Aga Khan Trust set to exit tomb restoration project||The Aga Khan Trust for Culture is set to withdraw from the Qutb Shahi Tombs restoration and conservation project in Hyderabad it handled for the past decade and where the present MoU expires in January 2022. “For 10 years now, over 42 cases/ IA’s have been filed by the same advocate representing the same seven petitioners — residents within Golconda Fort — all people with no expertise. The allegations made are baseless, including destruction of the very monuments we have set out to conserve. Under such circumstances, it is not possible to continue to undertake these challenging conservation efforts,” said Ratish Nanda, CEO, Aga Khan Trust for Culture. The last straw was the stay by the Telangana High Court not to vacate the stay on interpretation centre being developed within Deccan Park in lieu of the demolished banquet hall and swimming pool. The tombs have been conserved to international acclaim using practices that the AKTC has been using while working on sites like the Humayun’s Tomb in Delhi, Sundar Nursery, Bagh-a-Babur in Kabul, and other well known monuments and sites. Seven tombs Under the watch and care of the AKTC, the complex, known locally as seven tombs, expanded to include the baolis (wells), serai, funerary mosques and discovery of pre-Mughal symmetrical landscaping practices. The AKTC was in the process of restoring the enamel tile work that covered Muhammad Sultan’s tomb before the tile work was lost. The complex is a medieval necropolis at the foothills of the Golconda Fort where all the rulers of the dynasty (1518-1687) except the last one is buried. From 2010, it is on the tentative list for the World Heritage Site status. “Repeatedly the Wakf Tribunal has ordered to discontinue works — causing hardship and much loss. While one court urges care and concern for monuments, another is dismissive of the country’s largest conservation effort. Some of the government respondents — the Wakf Board, the Quli Qutb Shah Urban Development Authority — have made no serious effort to counter false allegations. There is no way forward,” said Mr. Nanda about the distinct possibility of them having to walk away from this major conservation project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/aga-khan-trust-says-its-withdrawing-from-project/article36130356.ece
27 August 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Telangana HC deadline for govt. to act on GO 111||Telangana High Court on Thursday instructed the High Power Committee, constituted by State government to examine GO 111, to present its report by September 13. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy, which has been hearing for past three days a batch of petitions on matters relating to GO 111, directed the State government to study the HPC report and take a call on the report by September-end. The HPC report should be put on the website of the Municipal Administration and Urban Development department contemporaneously. The HPC, which is chaired by Chief Secretary, should specifically focus on the report submitted by the Environment Protection Training and Research Institute (EPTRI). The Institute had given the report in 2006 with regard to the non-catchment area under Osmansagar and Himayathsagar. The bench instructed the government to study the HPC report in the backdrop of the non-catchment areas declared by the EPTRI in its second report and take action on it. The decision of the government should be circulated and uploaded on the website. The HPC chairperson (Chief Secretary) should file an affidavit within a week to abide by the terms, conditions and the timelines mentioned by the bench. “The HPC gets disbanded if it fails to submit the report as per the timeline mentioned by this court,” the CJ declared. If the committee did not present the report as per the deadline, the parties relying on the EPTRI report would be at liberty to seek appropriate relief, the bench said. Earlier, when Additional Advocate General J. Ramchander Rao began presenting his contentions, the CJ sought to know what was the time period of the HPC. Reading out the GO relating to creation of the HPC, the CJ said as per it, the committee should have presented its report within 45 days. “After that said period, the committee is automatically disbanded...it cannot be there forever...” the CJ observed. The AAG contended “the committee was in force according to the government” and assured that the government “will take it seriously now”. In that case, it amounted to admitting that the government was not serious all these days on the matter, the CJ said. Eventually, the bench granted time of four weeks for the HPC to present its report. However, the time began from August 13 when the government filed an affidavit stating the HPC would submit the report within four weeks. The matter was posted to October 4 for next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/telangana-hc-deadline-for-govt-to-act-on-go-111/article36130342.ece
27 August 2021||KADAPA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Notorious gang from MP held for burglary||The Kadapa police arrested a gang hailing from Madhya Pradesh on Thursday, which was allegedly involved in a number of criminal activities in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh before landing in Andhra Pradesh. Nanka Bhuria (25) of Dhar district, Vishal Soni (35), Gaurav Jain (25), his brother Kapil Jain (23) of Alirajpur district, and Peru Vishnu (28) of Khargone district, all from Madhya Pradesh, were arrested for their alleged roles in cases registered in Yerraguntla and Kalamalla stations of Kadapa district and Kolimigundla station of Kurnool district. “Their modus operandi was to identify smaller townships, especially located far away from the glare of towns or closer to industrial units and break into houses,” said Superintendent of Police K.K.N. Anburajan, presenting the accused before the media on Thursday. Surprise catch What appears to be a surprise catch in the operation was the alleged role of Bharat Bhuria, brother of the first accused and an undertrial prisoner housed in Mysuru central prison, in the series of crimes. Interrogation revealed that the undertrial allegedly passed off vital clues and tips to the gang through a mobile phone from his prison cell. Bhuria was allegedly involved in more than 10 cases in Karnataka. Vishal Soni and the Jain brothers, declared as ‘most wanted’ criminals in more than five States, had allegedly played a key role in financing the Bhurias as well as in buying back the valuables for a throwaway price for disposal later. The gang had even purchased land worth Rs. 45 lakh from the stolen money, it was alleged. “We are making arrangements to get Bharat Bhuria from Mysuru on a PT warrant,” Mr. Anburajan added. The police recovered the land document, two cars, seven mobile phones and tools used by the gang for their operations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/notorious-gang-from-madhya-pradesh-held-for-burglary/article36130353.ece

East Godavari SP M. Ravindranath Babu told presspersons that the gang was allegedly found transporting liquid extracted from ganja leaves near Chintoor. The contraband was reportedly procured from Visakhapatnam Agency. “This is the first time ganja in liquid form has been seized in the Agency. It appears that the ganja mafia has explored the new option to transport the contraband,” said Mr. Babu. The accused have been identified as Mohammad Abid and Ahmed Shakeeb of Telangana, F. Hussain of Tamil Nadu, and Pongi Babu Rao and Korla Nagarjuna of Visakhapatnam Agency. The cost of the liquid is estimated at Rs. 2 lakh. Police also seized a vehicle and five cellphones. The accused reportedly introduced themselves as tourists and managed to enter the Agency to procure the contraband.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/five-held-for-transporting-liquid-ganja-in-chintoor/article36130942.ece
27 August 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Wagon Tragedy victims too de-listed||The martyrs of Wagon Tragedy too would be de-listed from the compendium on martyrs of India’s Freedom struggle. A three-member review panel of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) is understood to have proposed the removal of the names, including four Hindus, from the 5th volume of the Dictionary of Martyrs of India’s Freedom Struggle (1857-1947) .  The Hindu had earlier reported that the panel had suggested the exclusion of the martyrs of the 1921 Malabar rebellion, from the list. Majority of the dead While majority of the dead in the Wagon Tragedy were Muslims, Kunnapalli Achuthan Nayar, Meletath Sankaran Nayar, two tenant-cultivators, and Kizhakkilaapalathil Tatan Unnipurayan and Cholakarambayil Chetti Chipu, two ‘labourers,’ were the Hindus among the victims. The dictionary edition that is being reviewed had noted that the Wagon Tragedy victims were “taken into custody in connection with the Malabar rebellion of 1921 against the combination of the British colonial authorities and the exploitative Jenmis ,” and “transported to Podanur Central Prison, near Coimbatore, from Tirur, in an almost air-tight railway goods wagon on 19 November 1921.” As many as 56 persons were found dead due to suffocation, when the condition of the captives was checked at Podanur. Six prisoners died en route to hospital and eight in the hospital, it was noted. The ICHR sources felt that the victims could very well be identified as “martyrs but not freedom fighters.” They did not qualify to be included in the dictionary on martyrs of Indian Freedom Struggle. The police records and other historical documents proved that the victims were booked for rioting and forceful religious conversions among other charges, they said. Cause of agitation While reviewing the entries, the panel looked into the cause of the agitation and the events that led to the tragedy. The protesters never addressed the issues of nationality or national freedom but fought for establishing a Caliphate. The “Khilafat” agitation had turned violent, ignoring the appeal of the national leaders of the freedom movement for peaceful protests, they said. The Wagon Tragedy had left a deep impact in the socio-political history of the Malabar region. The Tirur municipality had named its town hall after the victims and a replica of the wagon was set up there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/wagon-tragedy-victims-too-de-listed/article36130352.ece
27 August 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||84-day gap is for better efficacy, Centre tells HC||The Centre on Thursday informed the Kerala High Court that the 84-day gap between the two doses of Covishield had been prescribed so as to improve the efficacy of the vaccine and not due to the non-availability of vaccines. When a petition seeking to narrow down the gap for individual buyers of vaccines came up for hearing, the Central government counsel submitted that the decision on the dose intervals had been taken on the recommendations of the Empowered Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 and inputs from the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI). Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar had last time asked the Centre to clarify on what basis the 84-day gap between two doses of Covishield had been prescribed. The court wanted to know whether the interval was based on the availability of the vaccine or its efficacy. The court had made the observations while hearing the writ petition by Kitex Garments Ltd., Kochi, seeking a directive to the State government to allow it to administer the second dose of the vaccine to its employees before completion of the 84-day period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/84-day-gap-is-for-better-efficacy-centre-tells-hc/article36130350.ece

Mr. Hari Prasad said that quick disbursal of loans for the two priority sections would improve economic activity which was affected due to COVID-19. Speaking to The Hindu , he said that 636 business correspondents were available for 816 Rythu Bharosa Kendras to ensure quick help for farmers. “With their support, the farmers can get crop loans in a hassle-free manner. They can apply for renewal of loans and other facilities easily. With the support of business correspondents, the farmers get all banking services at their respective RBKs,” he said. Mr.Hari Prasad said that the banks were also advised to sanction loans to weavers for the protection of handloom sector. “After the visit of Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to Ponduru village, the banks planned to extend Mudra loans to at least 900 weavers. The banks can give loans between Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 5 lakh for weavers based on their requirement. The disbursal process will begin shortly,” he said, adding that many street vendors were able to get loans easily under PM SVANidhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/prioritise-pm-svanidhi-crop-loans-banks-told/article36130944.ece
27 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala’s case graph may spiral, merge into third wave: experts||A steep rise in COVID-19 graph in the post-Onam period was a given, as buoyed by the feeling of safety afforded by vaccination, social interactions and multi-family gatherings were bound to happen, heightening chances of disease transmission. The second wave in Kerala had never reached the baseline. The case graph, which had been maintained at a high plateau of over 20,000 cases daily, could spiral up and possibly merge into a third wave, public health experts feel. Disease transmission “We are now at a much higher baseline than we did when the second wave began rising but we do have some advantages this time as we have delivered at least one dose of vaccine to 88% of those above 45 years, while 43% has been fully vaccinated. We see clear indications that the disease has shifted to the younger age groups and that an estimated 10-15% of our new cases are vaccine breakthrough infections,” says T.S. Anish, epidemiologist and a member of the State’s experts’ committee on COVID-19. Despite the rise in active cases, just about 15% of these cases are currently in hospitals. ICU and ventilator occupancy, regardless of some daily fluctuation, has been more or less steady over the past four weeks. However, even as the government hopes that vaccination will see it through the third wave, reports of waning vaccine efficiency from the US Centres for Disease Control, as well as the Oxford study should make the administrators question the prudence of its overemphasis on COVID vaccination, to the exclusion of other strategies and precautions that it should be adopting at this point of the pandemic. CDC releases data Last week, CDC released data from three studies, which said that while vaccines helped to reduce the severity of the disease and deaths, the protection it afforded the individual against infection was progressively waning. New York Times reported that “although fully immunised people of all ages got infected with the virus, vaccine effectiveness showed the sharpest drop, from 90.6% to 74.6%, in people aged 18 through 49 — who are often the least likely to take precautions and the most likely to socialise. Researchers at the University of Oxford, UK, after analysing a vast data set of PCR results, concluded that though two doses of both Pfizer and Astra Zeneca (Covishield) offered good protection against Delta, this protection waned over time. Astra Zenaca was 69% effective against a high viral load 14 days after the second dose but this fell to 61% by 90 days.

27 August 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Transmission within families on the rise: Veena||COVID-19 disease transmission within homes has been rising in the State, accounting for 35% of the total cases, according to a statement issued by Health Minister Veena George on Thursday. Ms. George said that improper home quarantine has been resulting in entire families getting infected as soon as one member is diagnosed with the disease. People who test positive for COVID-19 should opt for home quarantine only if they have proper facilities for total isolation, or else, they should move to domiciliary care centres, said Ms. George. Those in home quarantine should remain in total isolation and wear masks and desist from interacting with other family members. Those with influenza-like symptoms should get themselves tested immediately and others who have been in contact with the person should remain in home quarantine after informing health-care workers, the Minister said. ‘No hospital crisis’ Ms. George also denied reports that the State was heading for a crisis regarding ICU beds and ventilators, saying that no district has any shortage of intensive care facilities. Free COVID-19 care is being offered through 281 empanelled private hospitals and, if at all there is a shortage of beds in government facilities, beds can be arranged at the empanelled private hospitals, she said. In government hospitals, of the total 3,048 ICU beds, 1,020 are occupied by COVID patients, while 740 by non-COVID patients, which meant that 1,288 beds, or 43% of the total, remain free presently. 75% ventilators vacant Of the 2,293 ventilators, 444 are occupied by COVID patients and 148 by non-COVID patients, meaning that 75% of ventilators (1,701), are vacant. In 281 empanelled private hospitals, 20,724 beds were available, apart from 2,082 ICU beds and 1,081 ventilators. At present, 798 of these ICU beds are occupied and 313 ventilators are occupied by COVID patients. The number of beds can be increased as required, said Ms. George.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/transmission-within-families-on-the-rise-veena/article36130360.ece

The visit was a part of the one-year diploma course that was introduced in an effort to enhance the sellers’ domain knowledge on the products and services they deal with. Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA), Chittoor, brought 40 dealers from the Madanapalle region for an interaction with the scientists. C. Ramana, principal scientist on farm mechanisation, showed the various tools used in farming and explained how automation could take farming to a different level. His colleague S. Kaleemulla explained the void in outreach due to absence of millet processing units. Similarly, scientist Bala Hussain Reddy explained the funding available to entrepreneurs through the Agri Business Incubator. The dealers also visited the soil testing lab, studied the precautions to be taken in groundnut crop, preparation and use of bio-manure and bio-pesticides.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/input-dealers-visit-rars/article36130905.ece
27 August 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Stencil art: a ‘cut’ above the rest!||Stencil cut may not be recognised as a specialised art form, but here is a young woman who has excelled at making portraits, sceneries and even mythological episodes that have won her awards. With her suave scalpel cut, Agarwal Jyothsna of Tirupati has recreated many episodes from the Mahabharata using this paper-cutting technique. Having completed her B.Tech in CSE, she is now determined to take a plunge into fine arts. What started as a pastime during the lockdown in April last year turned out to be a serious hobby. Casual uploads of her images on YouTube brought a deluge of followers, some of them evincing interest to purchase her art works. It was then that she thought of making a career out of paper-cutting art. Her passion has now finally tranformed into a vocation, with the young artist bagging several orders. Most of the portraits and images are arrived at by cutting out the unwanted areas with a scalpel. For some complicated and larger pictures, Jyothsna relies on mobile applications that convert them into B&W images. The image of Lord Krishna riding a chariot to the Kurukshetra battlefield, manifesting His true self with ‘Viswaroopam’ while narrating the ‘Bhagavad Gita’ and the Pandavas praying to Bheeshma lying on a bed of arrows, are some of the images in the series that won her awards from India Book of Records and Asia Book of Records for ‘recreating the maximum number of images from the Mahabharata’. “Similarly, ‘Srirama Pattabhishekam’, the coronation ceremony of Lord Rama, is one of my complicated works,” says Ms. Jyothsna. There are images of Lord Ganesh, Lord Shiva, Lord Hanuman, and former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam done on black chart, available in a ready-to-frame format to adorn the walls. Having a serious rethink, she is now keen on pursuing a Bachelor of Fine Arts course to start afresh on a career that runs concurrent to her passion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/stencil-art-a-cut-above-the-rest/article36130402.ece

A statement issued by the council Secretary B. Sudheer Prem Kumar on Thursday said show cause notices had been issued to these institutions seeking their explanation within a month of receiving the same. He said certain private unaided degree colleges were not following norms related to affiliation of the university concerned, while there were others which had not made admissions in some of the programmes for three years. Prof. Prem Kumar said based on the data furnished by affiliating universities, the council had issued show cause notices to these “erring” colleges and had decided not to allow them to make admissions for the academic year 2021-22. A total of 40 institutions had been identified as “zero admission” colleges. Of them, six are affiliated to Andhra University, Acharya Nagarjuna University (8), Adikavi Nannaya University (5), Yogi Vemana University (4), Krishna University (13), Rayalaseema University (3) and Vikrama Simhapuri University (1). Similarly, admissions were not permitted into 454 programmes run by 257 colleges in the State in the current academic year. Of them, 62 programmes run by 40 colleges are under Andhra University, 58 programmes run by 30 colleges are affiliated to Sri Venkateswara University, 42 courses run by 29 colleges under Acharya Nagarjuna University, 34 programmes offered by 15 colleges under Sri Krishnadevaraya University, 54 courses run by 42 colleges affiliated to Adikavi Nannaya University, 24 programmes run by 15 colleges under Yogi Vemana University, 29 courses offered by 16 colleges affiliated to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar University, 58 programmes run by 30 colleges under Krishna University, 54 courses offered by 22 colleges under Rayalaseema University and 39 programmes run by 18 colleges affiliated to Vikrama Simhapuri University. Prof. Prem Kumar said since these colleges failed to maintain standards and did not follow the norms of admission/affiliation, they cannot make admissions into UG programmes for the academic year 2021-22 till the competent authority passed a final order on the written explanation submitted by them. The show cause notices have also been placed on the Council websitewww.apsche.ap.gov.in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/apsche-puts-erring-private-degree-colleges-on-the-mat/article36131071.ece

27 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Panel warns schools, colleges against collecting excess fee||Andhra Pradesh School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission (APSERMC) Chairman R. Kantha Rao on Thursday said that for the first time in the State, fees collected by private schools and junior colleges had been regulated and he warned of stringent action against managements violating the norms laid down by the panel. At a press conference here, Justice Kantha Rao said ‘service’ and not ‘profiteering’ should be the objective of imparting education. He said the G.O.s 53 and 54 were issued stipulating the fee to be collected by private schools and junior colleges in the State for the next three academic years and these should be followed scrupulously. In other States, a practice of educational institutions notifying fee structure, which is then scrutinised by the government before arriving at a final decision, existed, he said, adding: “Though there is an obligation to notify the fee by educational institutions in our State too, it has not been followed in the last 20 years, resulting in absence of a uniform fee structure.” Last year, the recommendations of the commission could not be implemented as the matter was in court, he informed and said that the commission had arrived at a decision after an exhaustive study. “We do not intend to take any arbitrary decision. We are not here to close down schools, we are here to only regulate them,” he said. Window for appeal He said a lot of home work had gone into the fee structure prepared for various categories of schools and colleges and 80% of the institutions would not have any problem with it. If any ‘genuinely aggrieved’ management wanted to represent its case to the commission, it could do so within 15 days and “we will discuss the particular case and revise it if it is needed”, he said. Replying to a query, he said ‘budget schools’ are seeking certain exemptions but they have unfounded apprehensions. Referring to suicides by students in certain junior colleges, the panel chief said their recommendation for withdrawal of recognition of such colleges was pending with the Board of Intermediate Education. The commission members inspected 360 private schools last year and found many of them lacking in minimum facilities and recommended action against them. It also identified 120 colleges for violating norms and is seeking tough measures against them. Stating that students, their parents or teachers had the right to oppose collection of more than the stipulated fee, he said such cases should be brought to the notice of the commission through the toll-free number 9150381111 between 10 a.m and 5 p.m. “The commission will take action within a week of receiving the complaint,” he said. The commission Vice-Chairman V. Vijaya Sarada Reddy said the fee regulation measure was aimed at curbing the menace of private institutions fleecing parents by collecting excess money. The commission Secretary A. Sambasiva Reddy and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/panel-warns-against-collecting-excess-fee/article36130690.ece
27 August 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rs. 639 cr. plan to tackle air pollution in Vizag, Vijayawada, 11 towns||AP Pollution Control Board (APPCB) Chairman A.K. Parida said that the government would soon launch a ‘Clean Air Andhra Pradesh’ (CAAP) programme which is aimed at reducing air pollution in Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada cities and 11 towns during the next five years. The target is to bring down the air pollution from PM (Particulate Matter) level-10 i.e. annual average of 70-80 Micrograms Per Cubic Meter (MPCM), to less than 60 MPCM by 2025-26 with a total financial outlay of Rs. 639 crore, a major portion (Rs. 506 crore) of which would be spent in Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada on infrastructure like Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Systems, Mr. Parida stated. Delivering the key-note address in a virtual conference organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)-AP on the theme ‘Environment, Health & Safety: Driving Industrial Growth through Sustainable Best Practices’ on Thursday, Mr. Parida said Andhra University (AU) had been roped in to support the implementation of the action plans in Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Rajahmundry, Kakinada and Eluru towns. IIT-Tirupati would extend a similar support for curbing the air pollution in Vijayawada, Guntur, Ongole, Nellore and Tirupati while the National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL) at Tirupati would do the same in Chittoor, Anantapur, Kadapa and Kurnool.

27 August 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Veerraju demands White Paper on State’s financial position||Bharatiya Janata Party State unit president Somu Veerraju has demanded that the government release a White Paper on the State’s precarious financial position reflected by its inability to even make timely payment of salaries on the one hand and mounting public debt on the other. In a letter to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday, Mr. Veerraju said the debt which was Rs. 97,123 crore at the time of bifurcation of the unified State of Andhra Pradesh, ballooned to Rs. 2,62,225 crore in the FY 2018-19 and a whopping Rs. 3,73,140 crore now owing to what he termed gross mismanagement of government finances. He alleged that the YSR Congress Party government borrowed Rs. 1.15 lakh crore in just two years compared to Rs. 1.65 lakh crore raised by the TDP government during its five-year stint. The present government was in such dire straits that it had to borrow Rs. 5,000 crore every month to keep itself afloat. Loans amounting to Rs. 56,000 crore were raised by various corporations, he alleged. The manner in which the AP State Development Corporation was formed and used as a vehicle to mobilise funds showed the government’s recklessness in fiscal management, Mr. Veerraju observed, while insisting that the huge sums borrowed from 10 PSU banks, mainly from the State Bank of India, were being spent irresponsibly even as the revenues hit a nadir due to the COVID. The government should, therefore, explain to the people what made it run from pillar to post to garner funds notwithstanding the financial support being extended by the Centre from time to time, the BJP leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/veerraju-demands-white-paper-on-states-financial-position/article36130912.ece

Dheeraj, who holds a stamp vendor licence, used to reach out to the customers of his father and tell them that payment could be made online from his computer without having to go to the bank, the police said. “After receiving the amount from the customers, he used to pay a small amount to the government through his account. He later used to issue fake challans showing payment of the amount in full,” the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/man-son-held-in-fake-challans-case/article36131065.ece

27 August 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP cadre being harassed by some police, YSRCP leaders: Lokesh||The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) national General Secretary Nara Lokesh has written a letter to the Superintendent of Police, Kurnool district, alleging that the TDP cadre were being harassed by a section of police and YSRCP leaders. In the letter on Thursday, Mr. Lokesh said that the police had been either spectators or instruments of the ruling party prerogatives in Kurnool district. As evident from the FIRs filed, the family of D. Ramanjaneyulu had been subjected to extended harassment and torture by a section of local police officials, especially the CI and the SI. Mr. Ramanjaneyulu from Markapuram village of Kallur mandal in Kurnool district had been facing harassment for playing an active role in the TDP. “That this is happening at the behest of the local MLA is all the more shocking,” he said. “This is a clear case of the police targeting a common family out of malice. Filing false cases, even if these can be easily struck down by the courts, is a case of mental harassment and physical threat. IPC Section 307 (Attempt to Murder) is being misused widely to file cases against TDP cadre, whether or not the alleged victims are hurt in any manner. The process itself becomes the punishment for a family as they try to prove their innocence against the might of the police force,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-cadre-being-harassed-by-some-police-ysrcp-leaders-lokesh/article36130918.ece

27 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Officials on edge as school kids begin testing positive for COVID||Reports of schoolchildren testing positive for COVID-19 have begun streaming in from several areas of the district, sparking concern among parents and officials of the Education Department. Six students have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 24 hours in various parts of the city and Agency areas of the district. Four students of Zilla Parishad High School at Yellapuvanipalem in Gopalapatnam area tested positive for COVID-19 in the city on Thursday. All the students are learnt to be asymptomatic, according to officials. District Medical & Health Officer (DMHO) Visakhapatnam, P. Surya Narayana, said that three days ago, students of the government school had undergone testing, and out of them four students tested positive. “All the students are asymptomatic and are now in isolation at their homes. Testing is being done for their primary and secondary contacts,” Dr. Surya Narayana said. GVMC officials are sanitising both the classrooms and the homes of the students at Yellapuvanipalem. Meanwhile, two students from two different primary schools tested COVID-19 positive in G. Madugula mandal of Visakhapatnam district. According to a senior medical officer from Paderu, a primary school student from Solabham village and another student from Kuneti village had tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 24 hours. Mr. Surya Narayana said that on a daily basis, the health department is conducting tests on around 1,000 schoolchildren in various parts of district, covering all the schools. He said that if six or more students test positive from any school, the school will be closed for a brief period. He also said that managements were informed to take adequate steps to check the spread of COVID-19. Awareness campaigns are also being organised in the schools on COVID-19 appropriate behaviour, he added. Impact Education Department officials opine that the rise in new COVID-19 cases in a couple of schools is likely to impact attendance in other schools in the coming weeks. While attendance was low in the first few days of reopening of the schools on August 16, the attendance percentage was slowly rising in the past few days. Not just in the city, but students from districts like Vizianagaram and Chittoor had tested positive for COVID-19. Parents expressed concern over several schools not taking adequate COVID-19 precautions at the schools. “Social distancing is being thrown to the wind at many schools. I initially sent my son to school for two days but later decided not to due to lack of safety measures over there,” said a parent. According to Transport Department officials, most of the parents are opting to drop their children themselves at school. Not many buses of educational institutions are plying these days, said a senior officer. Daily update The district has reported 92 new cases in the last 24 hours ending Thursday morning, taking the cumulative tally to 1,55,149.

Earlier, the Krishnapatnam port also was forcibly acquired from Navayuga Company, he alleged. “The export and import duties and water transport duties at all important ports will be increased steeply. The Adani management has already raised the prices of limestone movement in the Gangavaram port. The share of income to the State will be lost,” he said. “The ports are playing an important role in the security of the country. The Eastern Naval Command is situated just beside the Gangavaram port. Therefore, handing over the port to private players will hamper the security of the nation,” said Mr. Narasinga Rao. The attack by the Pakistani terrorists on Hotel Taj in Mumbai must not be forgotten. The sale would also have an impact on the lives of the fishermen, he said. “All the major ports in the country are being handed over to the Adani group. The CPI(M) demands that the State government immediately withdraw its decision to sell away its shares in the Gangavaram port, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sale-of-gangavaram-port-detrimental-to-state-cpim/article36130920.ece
27 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Works apace to supply 24/7 drinking water to parts of city||Works for the 24/7 drinking water supply to residential houses under the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is on a fast-track mode. To begin with, the GVMC is focussing on the northwest part of the city and had completed more than 50% of the works. Initiated in the year 2019, in a phased manner, the GVMC officials have provided connections to about around 4,500 households in areas such as Madhavadhara, Karasa, Marripalem, Siva Nagar, FCO Colony, Ranapratap Colony and a few others, so far. The project worth Rs. 400 crore is being undertaken under the Visakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor Development Programme (VCICDP) with the aid of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The project is focussing not only on revamping the existing water network system, but also reducing the wastage during supply. As part of the project, high-end technology is being used to reduce wastage and also an effective alert system to address the complaints. The water supply for the project is being monitored by the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) which was set up near Madhavadhara area. Jayashankar, General Manager of Hyderabad-based Nagarjuna Construction Company, which is handling the project, said that everything is monitored under the SCADA and there is no manual intervention. Individual houses are connected with Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) which are again linked to District Metered Areas (DMA) set up in the colonies. The AMIs will measure the quantity of water being used in every household on a daily basis. The DMA would check the quality of water, the pressure on which water is being released and a few other other parameters. If at all water is overused or wasted, the AMIs would send an alert to the control room. “Similarly, in case of any water leakage or spillage, we wills receive an alert immediately, after which action can be initiated,” he said. 48,000 households to benefit According to a Senior Engineer from the GVMC, the project would cover Ward nos. 32 to 44 and 67,68. Around 48,000 households will be benefited under the project in the first phase and works for it are going on at a very good pace. The response from the beneficiaries is also good. Earlier, they used to receive water for one-and-a-half-hour to two hours. But now, the drinking water supply is being provided round the clock, he said. “Apart from using around 22 existing water tanks, several Ground Level Storage Reservoirs (GLSR) with a capacity of 2,200 to 3,200 KL storage capacity are being built as part of the project at Madhavadhara, Indira Nagar, Narasimha Nagar, Shramik Nagar and at a few other places. Around 50 % of pipeline works have already been completed,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/works-apace-to-supply-247-drinking-water-to-parts-of-city/article36131077.ece
27 August 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Complete land pooling work, Dadi urges CM||YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) State general secretary Dadi Veerabhadra Rao has appealed to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to direct the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) officials to complete the land pooling work, which was started in Anakapalle in 2007. In a letter to the Chief Minister on Thursday, Mr. Veerabhadra Rao noted that due to the negligence of previous governments, the lands of small and marginal farmers were stuck in the land pooling scheme (LPS) project, behind the NTR Market Yard at Anakapalle, for the last 14 years. The land was filled with gravel and only some of the roads were constructed. The site was used as a helipad during the visits of former Chief Ministers. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had also once visited the site by helicopter as Opposition leader in the past. Though there were no objections from anyone, the project was stopped for the past six years. The farmers were not even paid compensation, he said. Mr. Veerabhadra Rao noted that the farmers were hopeful that the project would be completed during the tenure of the YSR Congress government. Several representations were given to VMRDA Commissioner P. Koteswara Rao but no action has been taken on them. He explained that the erstwhile VUDA had decided to acquire 63 acres of land from 78 farmers and develop housing layouts. It was decided to some allot plots to the farmers while the remaining would be marketed by VUDA. The farmers had handed over 42 acres of land to VUDA some years ago. Some more farmers were prepared to handover their 15 acres to VMRDA for the past two years but the VMRDA was not coming forward for registration. Mr. Veerabhadra Rao noted that the once the project work was started, the remaining six acres would also be handed over by the farmers. He also sought that the VMRDA should allot plots to those farmers, who have already handed over their lands. He reiterated his appeal to the Chief Minister to direct the VMRDA to complete the project or alternatively return the lands to farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/complete-land-pooling-work-dadi-urges-cm/article36131079.ece

27 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||New lab can sequence 5,000 COVID genomes||Next generation sequencing can bring about a revolution in biological sciences and unprecedented progress to society as genomics is the sunrise sector of the 21st century just like Information Technology in the 90s took the country to great heights, said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday. Mr. Singh was speaking after virtually opening the city-based ‘Nucleome Informatics’, South Asia’s largest and most advanced genomics facility - NKC Centre for Genomics Research, which will carry out the latest third-generation sequencing and play a critical role in fighting the pandemic by sequencing 5,000 COVID genomes and 500 human genomes. Established in the memory of the late six-time MP from Khandwa, Nand Kumar Singh Chauhan, the NKC centre will also start providing in-house ‘DrSeq suite of predictive genomics products’ to improve the understanding and uptake of personalised or precision medicine. The laboratory will have the world’s largest long-and-short-read sequencing facilities. Another such facility will come up in Indore soon. The Defence Minister said that the ultra-modern lab will also play a role in upping the country’s potential in agriculture, animal husbandry and personalised medicine. In the backdrop of climate change and COVID, genome sequencing can increase productivity and help in healthcare. “COVID genome sequencing will also help us find out that part of the virus DNA that does not change, which will contribute to vaccine development,” he pointed out. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who also participated in the function, said ‘Agrigenomics’ can help in increasing farm productivity, reduce input cost, and increase resistance to disease so that farmers’ income can be doubled. Principal scientific adviser Prof. K. VijayRaghavan said the laboratory is an extraordinary feat. He was impressed with the technology put in place and looked forward to its implementation. Nucleome CEO and MD Dushyant Singh Baghel said that the NKC centre is a tribute to the late Khandwa MP’s relentless service to the people of India. “It was his continuous support and morale-boosting that motivated us to abandon the idea of moving the venture to San Diego (United States) and to continue it in India,” he said. With the addition of NovaSeq 6000 (the world’s largest short-read sequencing) and GeneTitan platforms, the laboratory will play a critical role in expanding the scope of in-house services, allow seamless cross-platform services and analyse data of RNA sequencing for improving precision medicine,” said Mr. Baghel, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, Rajya Sabha MPs Rajendra Gehlot and Ajay Pratap Singh, Dept of Biotechnology secretary Dr. Renu Swarup, Animal Husbandry and Dairy secretary Atul Chaturvedi, Telangana IT secretary Jayesh Ranjan and others were present during the inauguration. Last year, Nucleome was said to be the first laboratory in South Asia to procure the third-generation long-read sequencing platform ‘Sequel II’ from PacBio. It also became the first Indian organisation to partner in the prestigious multinational Vertebrate Genome Project of the G10K Consortium, a press release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/new-lab-can-sequence-5000-covid-genomes/article36130699.ece
27 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Congress faults Malla Reddy’s ‘language, behaviour’||The ugly verbal war between TPCC chief A. Revanth Reddy and Labour Minister Ch Malla Reddy played out for the second day with Congress supporters lashing out at the Minister using the same language he used against the Congress president at a press conference on Wednesday. The Congress charge was led by Mallu Ravi, Addanki Dayakar, Bellaiah Naik and Preetham, who at separate press conferences questioned the language used by a Minister and the thigh slapping challenging the Congress president to resign. ‘TS culture damaged’ Mr. Dayakar said the TRS leaders have damaged Telangana culture and language resorting to abuses against anyone questioning their corruption. He asked whether Congress leaders too should indulge in mindless abuses on Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao like the Minister did. Instead of clarifying the allegations, the Minister tried to divert the attention from the core issue of corruption. ‘Minister should resign’ Mr. Dayakar said Mr. Malla Reddy should resign and seek fresh mandate since the corruption allegations are against him. If he wants Mr. Revanth Reddy to resign, let the Minister ask the Chief Minister to resign in Gajwel. “Mr. Revanth will contest against the CM and let the people decide,” he said. Mr. Bellaiah Naik asked Mr. Malla Reddy to prove where did the 600 acres he had claimed to own come from and under what law he is holding such huge land bank. The Minister is frustrated that his corruption is now out in open and is resorting to gimmicks of resignation, he said. Issue of assigned land Mr. Naik alleged that the TRS had snatched away the assigned lands given by the Congress governments over the years. In Mudu Chintalapally itself, 50 acres were taken away from Dalits and Girijans while nearly 3 lakh acres of assigned lands were snatched by the government in the State, he claimed. The Dalita Girijana meetings of the Congress are exposing the failed promises like three acres land, 2 BHK houses, jobs and even fee reimbursement, he said.  At a separate press conference, former Member of Parliament and senior vice president of the party Mallu Ravi claimed the government is worried over the huge response to the Dalita Girijana dandora and deekshas and Malla Reddy’s outburst was an outcome of it. ‘Demeaned office’ He said enquiry should be instituted against land grabbing of Mr. Malla Reddy like the investigation into former Minister Eatala Rajender’s lands. Mr. Malla Reddy demeaned the office of a Minister behaving like a street fighter and has no right to continue as the Minister. Is the Chief Minister encouraging such behaviour, he wondered. TPCC SCC cell chairman, Preetham, ST cell chairman Jaganlal Naik and Fisheries Congress chairman Mettu Sai Kumar too warned the TRS Minister to apologise for his behaviour or face their wrath. Letter to Governor Meanwhile, TPCC senior vice president G. Niranjan wrote a letter to Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan to “expel” Mr. Malla Reddy from the Cabinet for his unruly utterances and derogatory language. Ministers have to be speak and behave with responsibility and not like street rowdies. If he is spared, future politics will be full of street fights, he said. Mr. Niranjan also urged the Governor to set up a committee to enquire into the 600 acres of land the Minister has claimed to own and find out whether they were legally purchased. Congress cadre across the State burnt effigies of the Minister against his abusive language and sought his apology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/congress-leaders-fault-malla-reddys-language-behaviour/article36130731.ece

27 August 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Stop Revanth Reddy’s derogatory language: TRS MLA||Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) MLA A. Jeevan Reddy has shot off a letter to the Congress leader Rahul Gandhi questioning the derogatory language being used by TPCC president A. Revanth Reddy against Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. In the letter posted on Twitter, the TRS MLA said ever since the new PCC president has taken over, he is resorting to abuses against the government and the Chief Minister, thus breaking the decency limits. “You may not be aware of the language being used by the TPCC president and I want to bring it to your attention,” he said in the letter. ‘Vote for Note’ case  Mr. Jeevan Reddy further stated that Mr. Revanth Reddy is on bail in the ‘Vote for Note’ case and he is abusing the position given to him by the Congress leadership. He reminded that the coalition government in Maharashtra, where the Congress is a partner, arrested Union Minister Narayan Rane for insulting the Maharashtra leadership. “If Revanth Reddy continues with his similar language, we have to lodge similar complaints with the Telangana government,” he said in his letter. The Armoor MLA asked Mr. Rahul Gandhi to control the language of Mr. Revanth Reddy or else the Congress party would further suffer as people are disgusted with the insulting abuses made in the public meetings diluting the very meaning of politics. Later, in a press conference at the TRSLP office, he said the Congress leader has the habit of making baseless allegations rather than coming with concrete evidence. “Revanth doesn’t have the stature to mention the Chief Minister’s name given his background,” he said. Mr. Reddy also warned the Congress leaders that if 100 MLAs of TRS decide to counter attack, they can’t face them. “You are afraid with the reaction of just two TRS MLAs,” he said referring Mainampally Hanmanth Rao and Minister Malla Reddy. He said the Congress is frustrated -- realising that it cannot come to power in Telangana. On the Congress claim that Pragati Bhavan would be turned into Ambedkar Bahujana Bhavan, he said Congress Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy too functioned from the same place and why was it not named after Dr. Ambedkar then? Let them first name CM offices of Congress-ruled States as Bahujan Bhavans before raising the issue in Telangana,” he said.  Meanwhile, Minister Malla Reddy said he is committed to resign if Mr. Revanth Reddy takes the offer made at the press conference on Wednesday. If he wants, I can extend my deadline by two or three more days, and in future I will not tolerate Mr. Revanth Reddy’s foul language, he said. The Minister also agreed that he should have refrained from using such language at a press conference but he was humiliated by the constant charges made against him by the Congress leader.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/stop-revanth-reddys-derogatory-language-trs-mla/article36130732.ece
27 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||GHMC withdraws entry ban||Moral policing by GHMC officials pertaining to entry into the Indira Park has generated outrage from several people of city on Thursday. A banner tied by the Urban Biodiversity wing officials at the entry gate of the Indira Park, prohibiting entry of unmarried couples into the park, has gone viral, earning severe backlash from netizens. “New low & new level of moral policing by Indira Park Mgmt in Hyd! A public park is an open space for all law abiding citizens, including consenting couples across genders. How can ‘marriage’ be criteria for entry! This is clearly unconstitutional,” fumed Meera Sanghamitra, an activist, on Twitter. “Couples must take their marriage certificate before entering this public park says the @GHMCOnline,” said Shameela, another Twitter user. Some others wondered why the restrictions have been imposed now when Indira Park has been known for long as haven for consenting couples. Officials on condition of anonymity blamed media reports which appeared on how the park had become a hotspot of “socially inappropriate behaviour”. Children and senior citizens are uncomfortable around couples inside the park indulging in explicit sexual acts, a GHMC official said, defending the ban. Similar restrictions have been imposed in Sanjeevaiah Park too making it an exclusive park for children, he said. After the online backlash, the corporation has retracted the restrictions, and issued a memo to an official concerned seeking explanation. Zonal Commissioner, Secunderabad, has issued a statement online regretting the inconvenience caused by the banners. Local police have been informed to keep a vigil through regular visits to maintain serene atmosphere in the park, he posted. The mention of police earned more ire from national level activists, with CPI(ML) polit bureau member and Secretary, All India Progressive Women’s Association Kavita Krishnan seeking clarification as to whether police would be demanding to see ID cards of lovers, and young people in parks. “Will they be interfering in any way with couples cuddling in the park? That kind of moral policing is better suited to Taliban and Sangh,” she posted on Twitter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ghmc-withdraws-entry-ban/article36130710.ece
27 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Temperature controlled air cargo containers at RGIA||GMR Hyderabad Air Cargo (GHAC), a division of GMR Air Cargo and Aerospace Engineering Limited, became the first cargo terminal in India and South Asia to handle a shipment using the next generation ‘Envirotainer Releye® RLP’ air cargo containers on Thursday. GHAC is also developing a dedicated ‘Cooltainer Yard’, touted to be the country’s largest on-airport hub to store, service and manage active and passive temperature-controlled containers, with a capacity to hold up to 250 containers at any point of time. Envirotainer active heating and cooling containers are one of the preferred options for movement of highly temperature-sensitive air cargo shipments globally like pharmaceuticals and vaccines, which need to be protected from the vagaries of temperature excursions at all times throughout the supply chain, said an official spokesman. Releye® RLP is the next generation temperature-controlled air cargo container introduced by Envirotainer, offering superior performance, up to 50% higher space efficiency, advanced live monitoring and control features to maintain temperature of shipment for up to 170 hours, the highest in the world today. With Hyderabad region being home to one of the largest concentrations of COVID-19 vaccine manufacture globally, the introduction of the Releye® RLP containers in the market will further strengthen the global supply chain for the movement of these vaccines. “The new containers will offer an unparalleled value proposition to air cargo shippers and consignees in the region,” said GMR Hyderabad Airport CEO Pradeep Panicker. GHAC is the designated hub and a partner station for Envirotainer temperature-controlled air cargo containers, with the airport cargo terminal maintaining a stock of up to 75 containers for use, a press release said on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/temperature-controlled-air-cargo-containers-at-rgia/article36130701.ece

27 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Ensure protection of Ramappa temple: HC||Telangana High Court said the State and Central governments should ensure that Ramappa temple, which was recently recognised as world heritage site, was a symbol of perfect balance of tourist place and protected ecosystem. Hearing a PIL on Ramappa temple site, a bench of Chief Justice and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy noted that there was a possibility of sudden real estate boom in the vicinity of the temple in the backdrop of it securing the world heritage site tag. When a place becomes popular, naturally more people would be inclined to invest in properties in and around such place. Ramappa temple is likely to witness such a boom and there could be a spurt in construction activity. It was the responsibility of the government to ensure a proper balance of providing facilities to tourists and keeping the area clean of encroachments and illegal constructions, the bench noted. The civic authorities should demarcate construction and no-construction zones at the site. Ecological system in the vicinity of the temple should not be disturbed, the bench said. Citing the example of Quli Qutub Shah tombs in Hyderabad, the bench said the onus of making and keeping Ramappa temple site a protected place lay with the authorities. The bench instructed the State and Central governments to file status reports on the efforts made by them to lay down milestones for complete conservation and protection of Ramappa temple within the time-frame prescribed by the World Heritage Committee. The matter was posted to September 29 for next hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ensure-protection-of-ramappa-temple-hc/article36130734.ece
27 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Monda Market to be developed||The popular Monda Market in Sanathnagar Assembly constituency would be developed on the lines of the recently-remodelled Mozamjahi Market, Minister for Animal Husbandry, Fisheries and Dairy Development Talasani Srinivas Yadav said on Thursday. The Minister along with Special Chief Secretary (Municipal Administration) Arvind Kumar, local corporator Deepia, GM (HMWS&SB) Ramana Reddy and Assistant City Planner Mahender went round the vegetable, mutton, fish and pot markets within Monda Market extensively. He discussed the steps to be taken for developing the market having a long history and popularity. Mr. Srinivas Yadav explained that the market was established during the Nizam era to help communities carry out petty and small businesses as their livelihood. He stressed the need to develop necessary amenities both for the vendors/traders and visitors and asked the officials concerned to prepare a comprehensive report for the purpose. A consultancy was already appointed for the purpose and was told to submit its report in 15 days, he noted. A meeting would be convened with the vendors/traders after getting the report from the consultancy, the Minister said, adding that steps were also being taken to construct a multi-level parking facility in the space behind old ‘jailkhana’. The Minister also directed the Chief City Planner to take up road widening from Palika Bazaar Chowrasta to vegetable market in Monda Market and also to remove the godown of old Gandhi Hospital in the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/monda-market-to-be-developed/article36130697.ece
27 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Roman Catholics in West Coast trace lineage to Brahmins: study||The West Coast of India harbours a rich diversity of various ethno-linguistic human population groups, of which the Roman Catholics are a distinct group. While historians and anthropologists relate them to the ancient group of ‘Gaud Saraswats’, others believe they are members of the Jews lost tribes in the first century migration to India. The first genetic study done on this group to infer their origin and genetic history showed them to have remnants of very early lineages of Brahmin community, majorly with Indo-European-specific genetic composition and some indication of Jewish component! The research led by noted chief scientist of CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), and director, Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD), Dr. Kumarasamy Thangaraj, Dr. Niraj Rai, senior scientist, DST- Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences, Lucknow and others, analysed the DNA of 110 individuals from Roman Catholic community of Goa, Kumta and Mangalore. They compared this genetic information with previously-published DNA data from India and West Eurasia plus archaeological, linguistic and historical records to fill the key details about the demographic changes and history of the Roman Catholic population of South West of India since the Iron Age (until around 2,500 years ago), and how they relate to the contemporary Indian population. This study also found consequences of Portuguese inquisition in Goa on the population history of Roman Catholics, hence indication of the Jewish component. This finding has been published in Human Genetics on August 23. “Our study has revealed that majority of Roman Catholics are genetically close to an early lineage of Gaud Saraswats,” said Dr. Thangaraj, senior author. “This study strongly suggests profound cultural transformations in ancient South West of India due to continuous migration and mixing events since the last 2,500 years,” said Dr. Niraj Rai, co-author. “The origins of many population groups like the Jews and Parsis in India are not well understood but these are gradually unfolding with advances in modern and ancient population genetics,” said Lomous Kumar, another researcher. “This multi-disciplinary study using history, anthropology and genetics information have helped us in understanding the population history of Roman Catholics from one of the most diverse and multicultural region of our country,” pointed out CCMB director Dr. Vinay K Nandikoori. Other institutes involved in this study are Mangalore University, Canadian Institute for Jewish Research, and Institute of Advanced Materials, Sweden.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/roman-catholics-in-west-coast-trace-lineage-to-brahmins-study/article36130702.ece
27 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Stop atrocities against Agency residents, OPDR tells govt.||The State unit of the Organisation for the Protection of Democratic Rights (OPDR) has demanded that the government take steps to stop oppression, violent practices and atrocities of the forest, revenue and police officials against tribal and non-tribal people living in the Agency areas. Steps should also be taken to lift the “illegal” cases filed against the residents of these areas. Farmers’ lands should not be taken away in the name of reserve forests and their crops should not be destroyed while steps should be taken to protect the rights of cultivators. In addition, rights over lands and ownership documents should be issued to people engaged in podu cultivation, it said. In a memorandum submitted to the government, OPDR state vice-president S. Jatin Kumar and former MP Solipeta Ramachandra Reddy demanded that the State should implement the promises made to podu cultivators in the run up to the 2018 Assembly elections. The government should issue pattas to all tribal and non-tribal cultivators, who had been cultivating lands for generations, without any discrimination, they said. A fact-finding committee constituted by the OPDR visited Asifabad, Adilabad, Mahbubabad, Khammam and Bhadrachalam areas and held meetings with farmers concerned. The tribal and non-tribal farmers in these areas are facing severe land problem and the desire to get permanent rights over land for cultivation is very strong. The State government had promised before the 2018 elections to solve the problems of podu cultivators and give them rights over their lands. The promise was however not implemented, and on the contrary, “a tirade of warnings and attacks by forest officials and police raids on the cultivators was unleashed.” Establishment of check posts in the name of forest protection increased and huge number of cases were foisted against the residents. “Terrorising the people has become the order of the day,” the memorandum said. The State government’s schemes like Harita Haaram, Palle Velugu and others are being carried out in the forest areas depriving farmers of their rights. Steps taken by the government in the name of different schemes are creating division among people based on caste, region and tribal, non-tribal and inter-tribal differences. Though the people made several representations on their plight, justice had not been done to them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/stop-atrocities-against-agency-residents-opdr-tells-govt/article36130958.ece
27 August 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Uncertainty over organisation of local cadres into different categories of posts||Uncertainty over the completion of organisation of local cadres in line with the revised Presidential Orders continues. The government has embarked upon organisation of local cadres after obtaining presidential assent for the Telangana Public Employment (Organisation of Local Cadres and Regulation of Direct Recruitment) Order 2018 following the reorganisation of districts from 10 to 33. After due consultation with the employees’ unions, orders had been issued department wise for categorising posts into district, zonal and multi-zonal cadres earlier this month. A majority of the departments have in fact categorised the posts into different cadres and notified the same as part of the exercise. Though the departments completed their exercise, guidelines had not been issued for arriving at the number of employees who should be deployed in each of the districts. Employees who are currently working on “order to serve” basis in different districts are expected to receive communication from the government for exercising their options relating to the districts which they prefer to work from. “The exercise needs allocation of posts in all the districts and the ratio should be fixed. But there is no information forthcoming from the government in this direction,” an employees union leader said. The government had to allocate the posts first and this should be followed by inviting options from the employees. Subsequently, issues like nativity of the employees and vacancies in different levels should be ascertained for their allocation department wise to the districts in line with the provision that 95% of the posts are reserved for locals. “The old Mahbubnagar district, for instance, is divided into five districts. Parts of the old district have been merged with Vikarabad and Ranga Reddy and there is no clarity on the allocation of the posts to these districts so as to identify the vacancies,” he said. The joint action committee of employees had submitted memorandum to the government more than once, but no action had been initiated into the issue thus far. The exercise assumes significance as the Presidential Order states that the government should within a period of 36 months of the commencement of the order (August 30, 2018) organise classes of posts in the civil services and classes of civil posts under the State into various local cadres for different parts of the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/uncertainty-over-organisation-of-local-cadres-into-different-categories-of-posts/article36130728.ece

While this may be the case, it appears that the party, with its headquarters in Darussalaam, Hyderabad, is looking at a much larger role, seeking to expand it footprint with its eyes on the Karnataka Vidhan Sabha elections. At the moment, the party has fielded its candidates in 21 of the 55 wards. A team of senior party workers, corporators and cadre have been working on the ground. Party president Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday embarked on a padyatra seeking support for the party. During the padayatra in Kalaburgi, popularly known as Gulbarga, on Wednesday Mr Owaisi reiterated the candidature of Ilyas Baghban from the North Kalaburgi Assembly segment. “After the success in the municipal elections, God willing, within a year and a half there will be the Assembly polls. It is from here, from your Assembly seat, that the Majlis had decided, and also informed you that we would field Ilyas Baghban from here,” he said, even as he condoled the death of former minister Qamarul Islam, who passed away in 2017. Speaking to the public during the padayatra , Mr Owaisi said the AIMIM would look into civic issues such as drinking water, roads, and education. However, he emphasised the need to create a strong political leadership and presented the AIMIM as a fit option. “The sitting MLA from Gulbarga North is Qamarul Islam’s wife Kaneez Fathima, who is from the Congress. It means that if she is given the ticket next time as well, the MIM would have to wrest the seat from her,” said a Kalaburgi resident. Mr Owaisi met the influential faith leader Syed Khusro Hussaini, who is the Sajjada Nasheen of the famous Sufi shrine Dargah Hazrat Khwaja Banda Nawaz. ‘Dissatisfied’ On Thursday, Mr Owaisi expressed dissatisfaction on the all-party meeting convened to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. He said the US had exited the war-torn country without informing India. “All India can now do is “wait & watch” as UN-listed terrorists become part of ruling coalition in Afganistan,” Mr Owaisi tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/aimim-can-solve-kalaburgi-civic-issues/article36130712.ece

27 August 2021||Mumbai,||MVA govt. launches scheme for COVID widows||To extend help to women who lost their husbands to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Maharashtra government’s Women and Child Development Department has launched Mission Vatsalya, aimed to serve around 18 benefits, schemes, and services to them under one roof. “COVID widows, especially from rural areas, underprivileged backgrounds, and deprived sections were a neglected facet of the crisis. Due to the death of the breadwinner, their hardship aggravated. Considering these aspects, Mission Vatsalya is launched,” said Women and Child Development Minister Yashomati Thakur. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, 15,095 women have lost their husbands to COVID-19. Of them, 14,661 women were listed by the District Task Force. Ms. Thakur said efforts are being made by the department to provide 18 services to help them and also to get the certificates they need, including a number of schemes like Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Yojana and Gharkul Yojana. Under this programme, a total of 8,661 women have applied for the Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Anudan Yojana, 405 for the Shravanbal Seva State Pension Scheme and 71 for the Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme. Applications have been received from 1,209 women for the Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme. The department has also received three applications for the Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme. So far, 10349 applications have been received from the women contacted by the department. Door-to-door visits Officials from the department, office of the Child Development Project Officer, the Local Unit Officer and Anganwadi Sevikas will be going to the homes of these women and to check and provide them these services. As of now, the department has reached out to more than 10,000 women in the State who will get the benefits soon, the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mva-govt-launches-scheme-for-covid-widows/article36130601.ece
27 August 2021||Mumbai,||Face recognition cameras to be installed at railway stations in Maharashtra, Gujarat||As many as 470 video cameras with real-time face recognition technology have been commissioned at railway stations across Maharashtra and Gujarat, including those on the Mumbai suburban line of the Western Railway. “As part of our Integrated Security System, we are installing 2,729 cameras on stations between Churchgate and Virar. They have multiple features such as intrusion detection and will help us monitor railway stations in a better manner,” said Sumit Thakur, chief PRO, Western Railway. He said the cameras can be used for crime detection and security measures. Andrey Telenkov, CEO, NtechLab, which has developed the system, said, “The system will be used on the busiest section of the network and ensure simultaneous recognition of up to 50 people in a single frame. It was a challenge but we were able to address it efficiently and on schedule.” The video analytics system will be used to shape strategy, for instance, by counting passenger traffic at any given time on the network. It will also be used to identify criminals and track missing persons. “Our video analytics technology employs high-precision, real-time face recognition mode, in the video stream. Images are compared with a database of wanted individuals. If there is a match, it notifies law enforcement. The entire process, from the appearance of the person in front of a camera to law enforcement receiving a signal, takes less than three seconds. This enables a fast response to situations as they develop,” he added. The project was completed jointly with Technosys Security Systems. NtechLab was certified by the Research Designs and Standards Organisation. Liana Meliksetyan, chief commercial officer, NtechLab, said, “Before the year-end, we plan to complete three more video analytics projects in the fields of retail, education and entertainment.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/face-recognition-cameras-to-be-installed-at-railway-stations-in-maharashtra-gujarat/article36130602.ece

Rajaram Shinde (54) was arrested based on the complaint of a 36-year-old woman who was cheated of Rs. 70,000.

27 August 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi tops list of world cities in number of CCTVs per sq. mile: CM||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said the Delhi government had delivered on yet another significant promise as the Capital was now on top of a list of cities across the world in relation to the number of CCTVs installed per square mile. Top 3 Indian cities Delhi has 1,826 CCTVs installed per square mile, which is three times higher than Chennai, 11 times higher than Mumbai and has surpassed cities like London, Shanghai, New York and Singapore to rank number one across the globe in this respect, Mr. Kejriwal said. “I feel proud to say that Delhi beat cities like Shanghai, New York and London with most CCTV cameras per square mile across the world. At first, Delhi has 1826 cameras, while at second, London has 1,138 cameras per square mile” Mr. Kejriwal tweeted. “My compliments to the Delhi government’s officers and engineers who worked on the project as a mission and achieved the feat in such a short time,” he added. The Public Works Department (PWD) took up the process of acquiring and installing 2.75 lakh CCTVs in phase one of the project and 1.4 lakh more CCTVs are in the process of installation at present, the government stated. “All kinds of obstacles”, the government alleged, were put in its way to stall this initiative; one such development was the Lieutenant Governor, citing concerns against CCTVs in Delhi, “arbitrarily” forming a committee on the matter that would in effect bypass the elected government. “It is due to the persistence and penance by the CM who constantly protested outside L-G House against his arbitrary orders that the way for the execution of the CCTV project could be paved,” the government stated. All CCTV feeds are highly secure with hardware monitored by the community, feeds accessible only to authorised users and the system itself capable of automatic health checkups to detect disturbances and intrusions of the connections, the government said. It added that only 3 Indian cities feature in the top 20 —Delhi at rank 1, Chennai at rank 3 and Mumbai at rank 18. Under the entire scheme, each RWA/Market Association has 30 to 40 cameras to cover their respective areas and 2.75 lakh CCTVs provided were installed in phase one with a further 1.4 lakh CCTVs in the process of installation. Camera monitored areas are clearly marked with signage. A panic button will be provided in the area and also be clearly marked, which will trigger SMS alerts to RWA, Police and the PWD Command Centre, the government added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-tops-list-of-world-cities-in-terms-of-cctvs-per-sq-mile-cm/article36130588.ece
27 August 2021||New Delhi,||‘Bed preparation by govt. 25% less than requirement during 2nd wave’||Dr. V.K. Paul, Member of NITI Aayog, has informed the Delhi government that the number of beds the government is preparing for a possible third wave is around 25% less than the requirement during the second wave, according to a document seen by The Hindu . “Referring to the capacity of 37,000 beds with 12,000 ICU beds, Dr. Paul said this capacity would be able to take only 850 cases per million per day whereas last time Delhi had above 1,100 cases per million per day and as such it is about 25% below that level. He suggested fine-tuning of it,” read the document about a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) earlier this month. Also, Professor Balram Bhargava, DG, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said during the meeting that a high-level committee should be set up to “improve health infrastructure in district hospitals” and it should reach the level of private sector hospitals. The Commissioner of Police said at the meeting that guards should be deployed at wine shops as “customers do not follow COVID appropriate behaviour”. “On public transport, CP said that DMRC should be directed to open more gates as passengers waiting in lines spill over to the roads. Frequencies of metro and DTC should also be increased. Sarojini Nagar, Sadh Nagar and Gandhi Dham markets need to be regulated,” the document said. Officials also praised the Delhi government’s various efforts to prepare for a possible third wave. Experts were not of the same opinion on when a possible third wave could hit the city. “Guleria, Director, AIIMS said he could only hazard a guess as a third wave could arrive any time between August and December. He suggested that planning for the same be made from September-October but again stated that it remained a difficult guess,” the document said. But Dr. Paul said the third wave is “possible” by September and October and advised a focused vaccination drive for 45+ population. “He stated that in any possible third wave, mortality rate will be low unless the virus changes. The rogue virus can come up and we have to prepare for it. He also referred to the need for a high-quality serosurvey,” it read. Schools reopening Senior officials at the meeting were of the view that schools can’t remain shut and recommended a serological survey among children. “Sujit Kumar Singh agreed with Dr. Paul and observed that students could not be kept away from the schools. Health advisory such as temperature screening etc. may also be issued and Sero-survey among children may also be conducted to know their exposure. He advised forming of an expert group in this regard,” the document said. Chief Secretary Vijay Dev said that by the next DDMA meeting all SOPs would be readied and by September 1, the reopening of schools could be considered.  He [Dr. Paul] stated that in any possible third wave, mortality rate will be low unless the virus changes.

27 August 2021||New Delhi,||Online applications for learner’s licences up threefold this week||The number of citizens applying for learner’s licences from homes went up almost threefold this week with more than 1,400 such applications being made every day between August 18 and Wednesday. The number of daily applications is up from almost 850/day, which were recorded since the launch of the Transport Department’s ‘Faceless Services’ initiative by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on August 11 till August 18. In all, according to Transport Department records, 15,798 applications for learners’ licences, among the most significant services offered by the department to citizens, were received till 10 a.m. on August 25 compared to 5,948 recorded towards the conclusion of the first week of the programme. According to departmental records, 11,370 of the total applicants have been successful so far while 1,109 failed their tests and as many as 4,428 did not appear for it. The department also recorded 142 unsuccessful applicants due to colour blindness. As reported by The Hindu on August 25, as many as 10,000 learners’ licences had been issued to citizens since August 11. Last week, of the 5,948 applicants for learners’ licences as many as 5,341 applicants were successful while 607 did not make the cut. Currently, the Delhi government’s Faceless Services program includes 33 major transport-related services, which account for 95% of the total services which citizens can avail: driving licence and related services, vehicle registration and related services and permit-related services. The remaining smaller services will soon be added to the faceless basket in the coming months, according to the government. Physical interaction will be limited to the driving skill test conducted at 13 fully Automated Driving Test Tracks and fitness tests of vehicles. Pre-pandemic, the government stated, approximately 30 lakh services were being provided to citizens online annually and the 13 Motor Licencing Offices (MLOs) in the Capital are in the process of seeking and resolving pending complaints before finally being converted into facilitation centres for those who cannot avail of the department’s services online due to one reason or another. As of August this year, according to the government, Delhi was the first State in the country to go faceless replete with e-sign and Aadhar-based authentication. Also, it was the first State to provide e-Learners’ licence tests through AI-based facial recognition or feature mapping.

27 August 2021||New Delhi,||Gahlot seeks Rs. 5 crore as damages in defamation suit from BJP Rohini MLA||Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot filed criminal and civil defamation suits against BJP Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta for allegedly making “scandalous allegations” related to the purchase of low-floor buses by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC). A statement from his office said that the complaints were filed against Mr. Gupta after he “intentionally defamed and tarnished” the reputation of Mr. Gahlot for “malafide purposes and to gain political mileage” through these. The statement said the Transport Minister had sought Rs. 5 crore as damages in the civil defamation suit from Mr. Gupta for making “such reckless remarks” against him and action under Sections 499, 501 against him in the criminal defamation suit. He further sought removal of all “defamatory content posted by Vijender Gupta” against him on Twitter and Facebook. ‘Dictatorial AAP govt.’ Mr. Gupta called the defamation case filed by Mr. Gahlot an attempt to “suppress the voice of truth” by the “dictatorial AAP government.” The Rohini MLA alleged that the Minister, who is the Chairman of the DTC board and “prime accused in the DTC scam”, is trying to salvage his image after the L-G constituted committee’s report found grave violations in the AMC contract of the 1,000 low-floor DTC buses. He said the case was taken up by the CBI for investigation. “The Minister has gone into panic mode and is making a last-ditch attempt to silence the opposition for exposing his dark deeds. I will meet the L-G to demand removal of Mr. Gahlot as DTC Chairman,” Mr. Gupta stated. Mr. Gahlot’s continuing on the post could lead to “tampering of crucial evidence” in the matter, Mr. Gupta alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/gahlot-seeks-rs-5-crore-as-damages-in-defamation-suit-against-bjp-mla/article36130589.ece

27 August 2021||New Delhi,||Approach school for fee exemption: HC||The Delhi High Court on Thursday asked two minor siblings, who lost the bread-earner father to COVID-19 last year, to approach their school for any concession or exemption from payment of fees and said that it cannot pass an interim order asking the Delhi government to pay fees of a private school. “I do understand [but] Delhi government can’t pay fees for a private school. This is too far-fetched. They will not do it for one person,” said Justice Rekha Palli. The judge said the government can provide free education in their schools for the two children. Advocate Bharat Malhotra, appearing for the children, said that the mother was facing financial stress and since the government had earlier announced that free education would be provided to such children, either payment of fee should be directly done or it should be reimbursed. He also informed the court that on August 19, the govt. issued a circular directing that children, who lost a parent to COVID-19, should be enabled to continue their education in schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/approach-school-for-fee-exemption-hc/article36130585.ece

27 August 2021||Washington,||‘Ensure Taliban do not destabilise Pak.’||A group of U.S. lawmakers has urged President Joe Biden to ensure that the Taliban, which is now the de facto ruler of Afghanistan, do not destabilise Pakistan and acquire nuclear weapons. The lawmakers demanded that Mr. Biden should answer critical questions on what happened in Afghanistan and what are his plans to move forward. “Are you prepared to support regional allies militarily in the event that the Taliban militarise the Afghanistan border? What is your plan to help to ensure that the Taliban do not destabilise its nuclear neighbour Pakistan?” the group of 68 lawmakers from the Senate and the House of Representatives asked in a letter addressed to Mr. Biden on Wednesday. “Do you have a plan to ensure that Afghanistan, under Taliban occupation, will never acquire a nuclear weapon?” they asked. The lawmakers said over the past weeks, the world watched with utter shock as the Taliban took over Afghanistan with astonishing speed, “the result of unforced errors made by withdrawing completely the small remaining footprint of our main military force from Afghanistan, and by unnecessarily delaying the evacuation of U.S. personnel and its Afghan partners”. China-Taliban ties The situation in Afghanistan has rapidly “metastasized” into Taliban rule with reinstated oppression of women and girls, the repression of civil society, the displacement of countless Afghans from their homes who the Taliban then use force to prevent from fleeing Afghanistan, and a power vacuum that China seeks to fill by increasing its ties to the Taliban, they said. Observing that the consequences of U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan are not isolated to that country, or even to the West Asia region, the lawmakers said the action carried geopolitical and strategic consequences that will reverberate for decades. “Dealing with these consequences means that we must take action now to chart the course for American strategy, while we manage the immediate repercussions of this self-inflicted crisis in Afghanistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/biden-urged-to-ensure-taliban-do-not-destabilise-pakistan/article36130100.ece
27 August 2021||Port Louis,||UN bans British stamps in Chagos island||Mauritius has welcomed the UN postal agency’s decision to ban British stamps from being used on the Chagos archipelago, calling it a victory for the island nation in its dispute with London. The vote by the Universal Postal Union (UPU), a United Nations agency focusing on the mail sector, follows a longstanding spat between Mauritius and Britain over the Chagos Islands, where London and Washington operate a joint military base. “This is another big step in favour of the recognition of the sovereignty of Mauritius over the Chagos,” Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth said. Although Mauritius became independent in 1968, the Chagos archipelago remained under British control, sparking protests by Chagossians, who accuse London of carrying out an “illegal occupation” and barring them from their homeland. Following Tuesday’s vote, “the UPU will stop registering, distributing and transmitting stamps” bearing the words British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), the name given by Britain to the archipelago, Mr. Jugnauth said. In 2019, the International Court of Justice ruled that Britain should give up control of the islands. Later that year, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution recognising that “the Chagos Archipelago forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius” and urged UN agencies “to support the decolonisation of Mauritius”. The British Foreign Office said it was “disappointed” by Tuesday’s vote. “The U.K .has no doubt as to our sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory, which has been under continuous British sovereignty since 1814,” a spokesperson for the Foreign Office said. Britain insists the archipelago belongs to London and has renewed a lease agreement with the U.S. to use Diego Garcia, the largest of the islands, until 2036.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/un-bans-british-stamps-in-chagos-island/article36130112.ece
27 August 2021||Washington,||Bennett to discuss Iran in meeting with Biden||President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett are set to hold their first face-to-face meeting on Friday, the White House said, as Mr. Biden cleared his agenda to deal with the Kabul bombing. Israel’s new leader intends to press Mr. Biden to give up pursuit of reviving the Iran nuclear deal. Before arriving in Washington, Mr. Bennett made clear the top priority of the visit to the White House was to persuade Mr. Biden not to return to the nuclear accord, arguing Iran has already advanced in its uranium enrichment, and that sanctions relief would give Iran more resources to back Israel’s enemies in the region. The Israeli leader met separately on Wednesday with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to discuss Iran and other issues. The visit was his first to the U.S. as Prime Minister. Mr. Bennett told his Cabinet ahead of the trip that he would tell the American President “that now is the time to halt the Iranians, to stop this thing” and not to re-enter “a nuclear deal that has already expired and is not relevant, even to those who thought it was once relevant.” Sanctions continue Mr. Biden has made clear his desire find a path to salvage the 2015 landmark pact cultivated by Barack Obama’s administration but scuttled in 2018 by Donald Trump’s. But U.S. indirect talks with Iran have stalled and Washington continues to maintain crippling sanctions on the country as regional hostilities simmer. The country now enriches a small amount of uranium up to 63%, a short step from weapons-grade levels, compared with 3.67% under the deal. It also spins far more advanced centrifuges and more of them than were allowed under the accord, worrying nuclear non-proliferation experts even though Tehran insists its programme is peaceful. The Biden-Bennett sit-down comes weeks after Ebrahim Raisi was sworn in as Iran’s new president. Mr. Raisi, 60, a conservative cleric with close ties to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has suggested he’ll engage with the U.S. But he also has struck a hard-line stance, ruling out negotiations aimed at limiting missile development and support for regional militias — something the Biden administration wants to address in a new accord. Administration officials acknowledged that Iran’s potential “breakout” — the time needed to amass enough fissile material for a single nuclear weapon — is now down to a matter of months or less. But a senior administration official said the administration sees the maximum pressure campaign employed by the Trump administration as having emboldened Iran to push ahead with its nuclear programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/israeli-pm-to-make-case-to-biden-against-iran-nuclear-pact/article36130098.ece
27 August 2021||Hanoi,||Harris ends Asia tour with fresh jab at China||Vice-President Kamala Harris launched a new broadside against China as she ended her Southeast Asian tour in Hanoi Thursday, warning the U.S. would continue to push back against Beijing’s claims in disputed Asian waters. The comments came on the final day of a regional trip in which Washington has sought to reset relations in Asia after the turbulent Donald Trump years and stress its commitment to Southeast Asian allies. During the trip, Ms. Harris had already accused Beijing twice of bullying its neighbours in the resource-rich South China Sea — and on Thursday she again took aim at the Asian giant. “We’re going to speak up when there are actions that Beijing takes that threaten the rules-based international order... such as activity in the South China Sea,” Ms. Harris said. “Freedom of navigation... is a vital issue for this region.” Ms. Harris’ Vietnam visit had been slammed by critics as tone-deaf given the parallels between this week’s chaotic scenes in Kabul and the 1975 evacuation of Saigon. Washington had also faced questions over its reliability following the U.S. withdrawal and Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. But Ms. Harris has tried to steer clear of the historical parallels, instead emphasising American commitment to the region by opening a Southeast Asia branch of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Hanoi and donating a million COVID-19 vaccines to Vietnam. “In the years ahead we will be back time and time again,” she told journalists on Thursday. Vietnam is facing its most serious wave of the pandemic so far and the gift was widely praised on social media. Ms. Harris insisted on Thursday that the U.S. did “not seek conflict” with Beijing, but it would “do what we can to make sure that we stay committed to our partners” on issues such as the South China Sea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/harris-ends-asia-tour-with-fresh-jab-at-china/article36130107.ece
27 August 2021||Hong Kong,||Hong Kong ousts independent lawmaker||A powerful new Hong Kong committee tasked with vetting politicians and officials for their loyalty disqualified an opposition lawmaker for the first time on Thursday, as authorities purge its institutions of anyone deemed disloyal to Beijing. Cheng Chung-tai, one of just two opposition figures left in the city’s legislature, was deemed disloyal on the basis of his previous statements and behaviour, chief secretary John Lee, who heads the vetting committee, told reporters. “To those who pretend to... bear allegiance to the government, I will not be deceived by their flowery speeches and their attempts to sugarcoat,” Mr. Lee said, adding Mr. Cheng had “lost his seat with immediate effect.” Mr. Lee did not detail what specifically Mr. Cheng had said or done that had led to his disqualification. ‘Patriots’ politics China is rapidly recasting Hong Kong in its own authoritarian image in the wake of huge democracy protests two years ago. It has blanketed the business hub in a national security law that has criminalised much dissent and rolled out a campaign to ensure only so-called “patriots” can play a role in its politics. That campaign has included a sweeping overhaul of the city’s already limited elections, drastically reducing the number of directly elected seats. Only one non-government loyalist is now left in Hong Kong’s partially elected legislature—an independent who represents the city’s medical sector. In 2017 he was found guilty of “desecrating” the Chinese and Hong Kong flags by turning them upside down during a debate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hong-kong-ousts-independent-lawmaker/article36130111.ece

Blinken told reporters that at least 4,500 American citizens of the 6,000 Americans who wanted to leave Afghanistan have departed. He said officials have been in “direct contact” with another 500 Americans who want to leave and have provided them with “specific instructions on how to get to the airport safely.” Officials were “aggressively reaching out” to the remaining 1,000 Americans to “determine whether they still want to leave,” he said. “Some may no longer be in the country,” Mr. Blinken said. “Some may have claimed to be Americans but turn out not to be. Some may choose to stay.” “Of the approximately 1,000, we believe the number of Americans actively seeking assistance to leave Afghanistan is significantly lower,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/up-to-1500-americans-still-need-to-be-evacuated/article36130114.ece

The commission said witnesses described gunmen affiliated with the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), a rebel group, arriving on August 18 after security forces withdrew from Gida-Kirimu in the western region. “The area’s residents and others said more than 150 people were killed by the gunmen,” the EHRC said. The attack forced women and children to flee to neighbouring areas, and sparked a wave of revenge killings. “In subsequent days, some residents carried out ethnic based reprisal attacks, killing more than 60 people” and triggering a further exodus of civilians fleeing the violence, the commission said. The panel called for “immediate action” to prevent the instability from spreading further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/210-killed-in-attacks-in-ethiopia/article36130113.ece

27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Has the first-past-the-post system polarised Indian politics?||India’s parliamentary democracy is going through a phase of intense confrontation between the dominant ruling party and a weakened but belligerent Opposition. Is this situation a consequence of the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system, where a party with the the highest votes gets the seat even if it doesn't win a majority? Suhas Palshikar and E. Sridharan address this question in a discussion moderated bySrinivasan Ramani.Edited excerpts: Prof. Palshikar, you had written recently about the emergence of a second dominant party system with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) becoming the central pole of Indian politics ever since it came to power at the Centre in 2014. Even if the BJP has now lost ground, with its vote share reducing in various State elections, it did retain its highest average cumulative vote share for election cycles. That said, what similarities and dissimilarities do you see with the hegemonic period of the Congress of the 1950s and ’60s? Suhas Palshikar:The similarity is in the vote share numbers garnered by the dominant party and in its capacity to fragment the Opposition. In terms of numbers, a dominant party gets a disproportionately larger share in seats in legislatures compared to its vote share. The other similarity is in its ability to remain dominant by fragmenting the Opposition and so we see the recent discussions on Opposition unity. The dissimilarities are evident in the roots of the dominance and the journeys towards it. The Congress emerged as a dominant party as a result of its contribution to the freedom struggle; the roles that Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and others played then. It converted that legitimacy into electoral dominance. The BJP emerged in 2014 as electorally dominant and has since been trying to establish its hegemony. That is why I have argued that its hegemony is still in the making while it has become dominant electorally. Dr. Sridharan, the hegemony enjoyed by the Congress in the 1950s and ’60s gave way to trends in Indian politics such as federalisation and regionalisation. So, even if we had the FPTP system, there was a certain degree of diversification that allowed for newer forces to emerge organically. Since 2019, the fact that the BJP has garnered a disproportionate seat share relative to its vote share has revived the critique of the FPTP. Your view? E. Sridharan:The BJP’s dominance in both 2014 and 2019 was based on a plurality of votes (31% and 37%) converting into a majority of seats and is similar to the Congress’s dominance from 1952 to 1984 which was also based on vote share pluralities converting to seat majorities (sometimes two-thirds to three-fourths majority). The FPTP system tends to magnify the seat share of the party with the largest vote share, while parties receiving a lower vote share tend to get a much lower seat share. There are exceptions such as the Karnataka Assembly elections of 2008 and the Madhya Pradesh elections of 2018 where the party which got a slightly higher vote share got a lower seat share. The BJP is today not as hegemonic as the Congress of the past. Forty-two of the 303 seats that it won in 2019 were in three States — Maharashtra, Punjab and Bihar — and were at least partially due to vote transfer from allies; seat shares have not reached two-thirds majority; and the party’s spread across States is less than the Congress’s in its heyday. As for the FPTP system, I would like to introduce Duverger’s law to your readers. [Maurice] Duverger, a French political scientist, argued that the FPTP system tends to bring about a two-party system at the constituency level. In countries like India, this translated into the establishment of a two-party system at the State level which happened between 1967 and 1989. Post-1990, this produced three kinds of bipolarity: Congress versus BJP in a number of States, Congress versus the Left in three States, and Congress versus regional parties in other States. This was an outcome of Duverger’s law operating at the State level. At the national level, 2014 marked the end of a 25-year period of a coalition/minority government. And post-2014, there was the emergence of a second dominant party system. I don’t think that FPTP necessarily produces polarisation. If you look at the proportional representation (PR) system in Europe and elsewhere, where seats are allocated roughly in accordance with the vote share, that also produces distinct polarisations. Look at the 1978 Sri Lankan Constitution which instituted the PR system. Since then, there has been ethnic polarisation despite the small parties getting seat shares higher than what they would have received in a FPTP system. Similarly in Israel, which also enjoys a thoroughgoing PR system, there is severe polarisation in ethnic, religious and political terms. The FPTP system can’t be blamed for polarisation. Polarisation is linked to the politicisation of certain social cleavages. These cleavages are sometimes dormant in society and can become active or can be activated through mobilisations. When certain social cleavages are activated, that is when they get magnified by the electoral system. Prof. Palshikar, today there is little dialogue between the ruling party and the Opposition. What explains this stasis? SP:I agree with Dr. Sridharan that it is not FPTP that is creating polarisation. One of the general reasons for the adversarial relations between the ruling party and the Opposition is the failure in institutionalising the parliamentary system, which presupposes a certain negotiation, a spirit of give and take and continuous deliberation between the ruling party and the Opposition. We have failed in generating an institutional pattern for this tendency. I would locate the beginning of this as the time around the Emergency period when the spirit of dialogue dissipated. Since then, the dialogue process has been up and down. If you come to the current moment, I think it is the distrust between the ruling party and the Opposition that has produced this stasis. The problem is not about the institutional mechanisms that we adopt; it is in the processes that we implement those mechanisms. Those process-related issues can be located in social and other cleavages and how they play out in competitive politics. It is the extreme competitive nature of our polity and the frustrations that come with the presence of a dominant party in the system besides the arrogance that stems from electoral dominance that leads to an inability to engage with the Opposition. ES:The confrontational situation in Parliament and other legislatures has heightened in the last couple of years. This is due to the sharpening of the ideological level in politics, which reflects the cleavages in the society, and to the suspicion that the fundamentals of the system are being sought to be changed. The ruling BJP is not a similar hegemonic force as the Congress in the sense that it had in its manifesto issues such as the Citizenship Amendment Bill and the abrogation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. In a way, the BJP has an agenda that is beyond the constitutional consensus that guides the policies of most political parties in India. Is this a reason for the current state of affairs too? SP:Just to supplement what Prof. Sridharan said, we witness today a new phase that is marked by a confrontation that is not merely one of political contestation in the ordinary sense of the term. Here is a party that wants to change the entire system fundamentally and other parties are still not sure how to respond to that. They instinctively oppose it but at the same time they understand that the difference is in the approach of the dominant party, that they have to adapt/adjust to that stance so that they garner enough votes in the next election. This confusion among the non-BJP parties produces not just distrust but lack of clarity on what ideological positions they must take during the ideological onslaught or the offensive of the BJP. The BJP has now changed the terms of how the political contestation will be held ideologically, and the inability of the non-BJP parties to appreciate and respond to this and to produce an alternative narrative has led to a frustration that is reflected in their various responses to the BJP. ES:There is a perception that the ruling party is pushing against the constitutional consensus, which is fairly strong in our system. There are about three and a half layers of protection to the basic structure of our Constitution. The government needs a two-thirds majority in both Houses subject to the presence of at least 50% of the House in attendance. The government has a clear but not a two-thirds majority in the Lok Sabha. It doesn’t have a majority in the Rajya Sabha. In order to make constitutional amendments, it must get the support of smaller parties, which it has been able to get so far. Then, it has to go through judicial review — the courts have so far not pronounced on some of the controversial issues that have come up in the last few years. Finally, for some articles on Centre-State relations, it has to pass them through half the State Assemblies. There are ideological shifts going on and new social cleavages that have been activated that have changed the political landscape. Can it be said that federal issues are emerging as the area of contestation with the BJP on the one side and regional parties on the other? SP:In principle, the flashpoint in the next five years or so could be the federal relations between the Centre and the States on fiscal or other administrative and political matters. The various State parties are still not sufficiently aware of this possibility and therefore they are busy buying peace with the ruling party at the Centre, rather than confronting it. I don’t see any direct flashpoint emerging politically between the State parties and the BJP immediately, though. Also, the ability of the BJP or any Central government in the last three decades to directly transfer resources to local bodies in the States bypassing the State government besides controlling the administrations of the States has weakened the State parties’ ability to take on the Central government. Objectively, they are not in a position to do so and subjectively, they are not sure how to pitch the fight. Therefore, we have a fascinating period where there is all the making of a federal flashpoint, but at the same time, the actual flashpoints may be somewhere else in reality. Do you see a mixture of postures — negotiation, confrontation and adjustment by various regional parties vis-à-vis the Centre? The Biju Janata Dal (BJD), YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) using one ploy, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) using another, and so on? SP:I would use the word ‘acquiescence’ to describe how the BJD, YSRCP and the TRS’s relations are with the Centre.  When certain social cleavages are activated, that is when they get magnified by the electoral system. E.

27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Finding India’s voice on Afghanistan||In the chaos that has followed the Taliban takeover of Kabul on August 15, noisy recriminations in the international community and the desperate appeals of Afghans who want to leave the country, India has been relatively silent. On the ground, the Narendra Modi government chose to speak with its feet, ordering the full evacuation of the Indian embassy and all Indian personnel within hours of Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani’s departure from the ‘Arg’ Presidential Palace. At the UN Security Council (UNSC) in New York and UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, India has expressed its worries about terrorism, human rights and refugees, but has not mentioned the Taliban itself even once by name. And in India, the Government appears to be equally mute, as thousands of Afghans clamour for visas, and get no reply, focusing instead on the task of bringing a few hundred Indian nationals back home. When India led The silence is in sharp contrast to the past, particularly the last 20 years, where India had been at the forefront of discussions in Afghanistan and on Afghanistan. India’s role strengthened over the tenure of three different governments in Delhi in three areas: in terms of infrastructure building and development assistance, encompassing all 34 provinces of the country; in terms of building democracy, helping script the Constitution and hold elections; and in terms of educational investment, allowing thousands of young Afghans to study, be trained as professionals and soldiers, and become skilled in India. India was the first country that Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership with, the only country that undertook perilous but ambitious projects such Parliament, the Zaranj-Delaram Highway, and the Chabahar port project in Iran for transit trade, and by far the one country that polled consistently highly among countries that Afghan people trusted. It seems inconceivable that the Government can choose to simply walk away from such capital, regardless of the developments in Afghanistan, domestic political considerations in India and geopolitical sensitivities. The Government must consider all its options in remaining engaged with Afghanistan for its future. A marginalisation To begin with, it is necessary to acknowledge the hard truth that no other power from the west to the east has considered India’s interests while charting its course on Afghanistan. India has found itself cut out of several quadrilateral arrangements: the main negotiations held by the “Troika plus” of the United States-Russia-China-Pakistan that pushed for a more “inclusive government” including the Taliban; the alternative grouping of Russia-Iran-China-Pakistan that formed a “regional arc” that has today seen them retain their embassies in Kabul; and the connectivity quadrilaterals formed by the U.S. and China, respectively, with Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan, that depend heavily on Taliban protection and Pakistani port access. Neither India’s traditional strategic and defence partner, Russia, nor its fastest growing global strategic partner, the United States, thought it important to include India or insist that their envoys Zamir Kabulov (Russian President Vladimir Putin’s special envoy to Afghanistan) and Zalmay Khalilzad (U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation) briefed their counterparts in New Delhi about the details of their negotiations with the Taliban leadership. If New Delhi was unable to feel its staff would be secure from Taliban militia and their Pakistani benefactors in order to keep diplomats in Kabul, nor to negotiate a diplomatic outpost at Kabul airport that would allow it to place a core team with the U.S., the United Kingdom and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, it is time to accept that India is in need of a new diplomatic strategy. While the Narendra Modi government found it inconvenient to vocally protest the talks with the Taliban and the extended line to Pakistan to facilitate the talks with these “friendly” global leaders thus far, it is necessary for it to publicly decry an outcome that has clearly worked against India’s interests now. Action under the UN umbrella In order to do so, India needs to begin by rallying the United Nations, to exert its considerable influence in its own interest, and that of the Afghan “republic”, which is an idea that cannot be just abandoned. At the UNSC, India must be more vocal about its abhorrence of a Taliban-run Afghanistan that seeks to reverse the gains of the past two decades. A considerably diluted statement that India drafted as UNSC president on August 16, that did not even mention opposition to an “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan” was a disappointment in this regard. Next, India must take a leading role in the debate over who will be nominated to the Afghan seat at the UN, and whether the Republic’s appointed current Ambassador will remain, or the seat declared “vacant” or even “suspended” depending on the new regime in Afghanistan committing to international norms on human rights, women’s rights, minority rights and others. As Chairman of the Taliban Sanctions Committee (or the 1988 Sanctions Committee), India must use its muscle to ensure terrorists such as Sirajuddin Haqqani and other members of the Haqqani group responsible for brutal suicide bombings on Indian embassies and consulates must not be given any exemptions: on travel, recourse to funds or arms. Mr. Modi’s speech at the UN General Assembly scheduled for September 25 will be an apposite occasion to express India’s position on the future of Afghanistan and challenge the rest of the international community to refuse to legitimise the Taliban regime unless it is willing to negotiate on all these issues. As the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, has said, the Taliban’s desire for international recognition this time around “is the Security Council's only leverage to press for inclusive government and respect for rights, particularly for women, in Afghanistan”. Dealing with the regime Next, the Narendra Modi government must determine the nature of its engagement with the new regime in Afghanistan. While a tactical engagement, dealing with the safety of Indians and Indian interests, overflight rights and other coordination seems inevitable, the question of whether India should convert its furtive back-channel talks with the Taliban and with Pakistan in the past few months into something more substantive remains to be debated. This becomes more important as India now faces a “threat umbrella” to its north, including Pakistan’s cross-border terrorism, Afghanistan’s new regime and China’s aggression at the Line of Actual Control. The Government’s modus operandi over the last few years, of running foreign policy by stealth and surprise, would be counter-productive here. A more broad-based and consultative process of engaging all political parties would be required instead. While not directly dealing with the Taliban, India must ensure stronger communication with those who are dealing directly, including leaders such as former Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai and former High Council for National Reconciliation chief Abdullah Abdullah, who have lived in India and retain close links, to ensure its interests. As a part of its engagement, New Delhi must consider whether to revive its assistance to the resistance, which at present includes Ahmad Shah Massoud Jr., Amrullah Saleh, Abdul Rashid Dostum and Atta Mohammad Noor, all well known to India and aligned to a great extent with India’s objectives in Afghanistan. People outreach Finally, the Government must embrace its greatest strength in Afghanistan — its relations with the Afghan people — and open its doors to those who wish to come here, just as previous Indian governments have done in the past. The Government’s efforts, thus far, have been woefully inadequate, with only a few hundred Afghans evacuated or allowed to enter; the Ministry of Home Affairs decision to cancel all pre-issued visas, due to security concerns, is a step in the wrong direction. In particular, India must continue to facilitate medical visas for Afghan patients and extend the education visas for students who are already admitted to Indian colleges. In a world of hard geopolitical realities, it is India’s soft power, strategic autonomy or non-alignment principles and selfless assistance to those in need, particularly in its neighbourhood, that has been the strongest chords to its unique voice in the world. The moment to make that voice heard on Afghanistan is now. suhasini.h@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/finding-indias-voice-on-afghanistan/article36130086.ece
27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Covering the gaps in the game of data||The new show in town is the game of data. Running for a while now, it is keeping the audience on edge with its volatile and shifting rules. If one season negated a whole body of data leaving the audience nonplussed, the next brought joy to certain quarters with its data reinterpretation. The latest season has shocked the audience as an entire body of data has gone missing. The article in The Hindu (Editorial page, August 19, 2021), “The significance of the ‘there is no data’ answer”, which is an incisive review of the latest season of missing data, is enlightening. On data politics Data politics is not new. The interconnectedness of power and knowledge and its use by States to control populations has long been expounded by Foucault, Bourdieu and others. Rapid technological innovations in information and communication technologies have further complicated the issue where, through Internet connectivity, both subjects and objects of data are now inextricably intertwined. The spur towards evidence-based policy making or evidence-based budgeting by governments points to the amassing of large, granular level data about citizens by States. Data-based policymaking or budgeting is meant to facilitate the use of evidence to inform programmatic funding decisions. The goal is to further invest in what works to improve outcomes for citizens. Data-based decisions can redress inter and intra-district inequalities through targeted resource allocations. However, data-based governance pre-supposes the existence of reliable, rigorous and validated data with or without demonstrated impact or outcomes. If governance decisions are to be data centric, there is a need to ensure a good, robust and reliable database. Data-based policy making States collect enormous amounts of administrative data. However, these administrative data are often not validated. For example, it is well known that the flow of funds below the block level is often opaque and the data that is submitted by local bodies are generally not validated. The task of trying to match funds with functions at the panchayat level is rather challenging. While there is a critical need to link the databases of various departments, it is not easy as territorial jurisdictions and household-level identifiers are likely to vary from department to department. There is a need to bring some mechanism to homogenise these various data sets with a single identifier; but more importantly, there is a need to validate these data sets through urban local bodies and rural local bodies. Accurate collection, measurement and interpretation of data are critical for data-based decision making to be successful. However, this is fraught with challenges for as much as data is used, it also gets misused, abused or even manipulated. For instance, absence of data in certain domains does not necessarily indicate better governance. During the novel coronavirus pandemic, some States were not testing enough. Consequently, the data on COVID-19 positive cases were interpreted to seem that some States, especially in South India, were unable to control COVID-19 cases compared to their North Indian counterparts; some with much poorer health indicators as well as infrastructure. In such cases, making resource allocations and decision-making based on data are likely to have adverse impacts. Similarly, a 2012 academic study on assessing the quality of governance across States had an indicator under a ‘Law and Order’ variable that aimed to measure police behaviour, and the indicator was “Complaints against Police behaviour”. How should such an indicator be measured? What would be an ideal score — low or high? The answer is not simple: it is complex and context-specific and, therefore, should not be interpreted in isolation. A low score in a poor, backward State does not necessarily indicate that police behaviour is exemplary; it could indicate that people are scared to complain against police behaviour for fear of reprisals. A high score in a State with high literacy and human development index (HDI) can mean that people have enough confidence in the judiciary and the State to complain against police behaviour, thus becoming an indicator of a better quality of governance. Similarly, an issue such as mental health, that comes with enormous social stigma in India, needs careful measurement as higher incidences of mental health (from institutional sources) can indicate better access to institutional care as well as a social context that is less beset with stigma. Tamil Nadu’s education data In the same vein, the recent data on education released by the Union government that shows Tamil Nadu having around 27 educationally backward districts, is baffling. Despite these figures, elsewhere, the same report ranks Tamil Nadu fourth in educational attainment. The literacy rate in Tamil Nadu in Census 2011 was higher at 80.1% compared to the national figure of 73%. While there were inter-district variations in literacy, Dharmapuri district, with a literacy rate lower than the national average, still had 68.5% literacy in 2011. It is problematic to imagine that there has been such a downward slide in the last 10 years as some recent State-level studies have shown further improvements in literacy across districts compared to 2011. Clearly, in this case, the measurement of district-level educational backwardness needs close scrutiny. Such interpretations also highlight the need to supplement the quantitative data with smaller qualitative studies to capture processes, subjectivity, and contextual factors. As the game of data shows, we are in a data-driven world. While on the one hand, there is a move towards data-based governance and decision-making, on the other, concerned about the ‘statistical vacuum’ due to a number of national statistical bases getting eroded either through delays or data suppression, scholars like Jean Drèze and others have been calling for decentralised systems of data collection processes, with States building their own databases. This requires States to invest heavily in both human and technical infrastructure with built-in quality control measures to ensure an interesting twist to the game of data that is now ongoing.

27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||The clean-up crew we need||The valour of Jatayu (a demi-god in the form of a vulture) in confronting Ravana is well-described in the Ramayana. The epic also mentions Sampati, Jatayu’s brother, who played an instrumental role in guiding Lord Rama towards Lanka. While we read and marvel at these helpful creatures in our epics, we haven’t granted them the same importance in reality, however. Vultures are very important scavengers in our ecosystem, yet India lost more than 95% of its vulture population through the 1990s and by the mid-2000s. Today, the country requires urgent conservation efforts to save vultures from becoming extinct. Myths and facts Vultures are often misunderstood as a source of diseases. Although they feast on carrion almost exclusively, they are sometimes capable of preying on extremely sick, wounded, or infirm creatures if there is no food around. As a result, they are demonised. Some consider vultures ugly, unlovable and even a bad omen. Given the lack of understanding and knowledge about them, let’s first understand what vultures do and why they are important. Vultures belong to the Accipitridae family whose members include eagles, hawks and kites. They are relatively social birds with an average lifespan of 10-30 years in the wild. Being bulky, they nest on tall trees or rocky cliffs. Vultures are slow breeders and so the survival of every individual is very crucial. With their excellent eyesight and strong sense of smell, vultures can detect the presence of dead animals from great distances. Vultures don’t have a voice box and so they cannot sing. They communicate via grunts and hisses. Generally, vultures rely on other carnivores to open carcasses. Their powerful bills and long slender necks are designed to help them tear off the meat chunks from inside the carcass. Unlike other raptors, vultures have weak legs and claws (talons). They do not carry food; instead, they regurgitate food and feed their young ones. Vultures have a highly acidic stomach that helps them digest rotting carcass and kill disease-causing bacteria. India has nine species of vultures. Many are critically endangered. The main reason for the decline in the vulture population is the use of the drug, diclofenac. Diclofenac, which relieves cattle of pain, is toxic to vultures even in small doses and causes kidney failure and death. Myths about the medicinal healing powers of vultures’ body parts has led to the hunting of vultures. Quarrying and blasting of stones where vultures nest have also caused their decline. Interestingly, studies show that while the vulture population has declined, the feral dog population has increased. The health hazards associated with feral dogs are well known. Removing vultures from the ecosystem leads to inefficient clearing of carcasses and contaminates water systems. If dead animals are left to rot for long durations, it may give rise to disease-causing pathogens. The animals that consume such flesh become further carriers of disease. Very few animals/birds can ingest rotting carcasses. Thanks to their acidic stomach, vultures can. Thus, they play a crucial role in maintaining the health of the ecosystem. Steps to increase numbers To tackle this problem, India banned diclofenac for veterinary use in 2006. Five States are to get vulture breeding centres under the Action Plan for Vulture Conservation for 2020-2025, approved in October 2020. There are no rescue centres for treating vultures as of now, so this too has been mooted under the Plan. Vulture ‘restaurants’, which exist in some countries, are also a way of preserving the population. In these ‘restaurants’, diclofenac-free carcasses of cattle are dumped in designated areas where vultures gather to feed. These measures have slowly started making a positive impact, but there is still a long way to go. Awareness and action must go hand in hand. With International Vulture Awareness Day coming up on September 4, it is important for us to spread awareness about the importance of vultures in our ecosystem.

27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Learning safely||The Centre’s move to allocate two crore coronavirus vaccine doses for universal coverage of all teaching and non-teaching staff in schools by Teachers’ Day (September 5) adds a measure of confidence that resumption of face-to-face classes from September is not fraught with high risk. Several States are preparing to reopen schools, mostly for Class 9 and higher, next month. Some, including Haryana, Telangana and Gujarat, have announced that they will allow offline classes even for younger children. Amidst fears of a third wave of the pandemic, epidemiologists, academicians and policymakers have been wrestling with the question of a low-risk trade-off, balancing protection from the virus with some bridging of the learning deficit caused by prolonged school closures that are crippling future prospects of millions of children. It is encouraging that half of the 97 lakh teachers in the country have already been immunised, by official estimates, making it feasible to reach the rest by September 5. The risk of infection to children in schools remains, however, and must be addressed with utmost seriousness, particularly with fast-transmitting virus variants present in all States. This calls for a coherent response that incorporates the best learnings from epidemiology and decentralises decision-making to the districts based on local circumstances. It is, of course, a step forward that a vaccine, the three-dose ZyCoV-D, has been approved for the 12-18 age group, but this is to be administered only from October. The reversion to physical classes will, therefore, have to be carefully calibrated. Vaccination of children over 12 years of age has been allowed in some countries, but the pandemic’s course has remained unpredictable. In Israel, one of the most vaccinated countries with an estimated 78% coverage of the over-12 population, the Delta variant swiftly caused a spike in infections as distancing norms, the mask mandate and travel bans were eliminated. In one instance, an entire class of students was infected by one unvaccinated child who had been on vacation. This cautionary tale serves to emphasise the importance of priority vaccination of children, starting with those who may have other health conditions, maintaining safety protocols, and adopting low-cost non-pharmaceutical interventions such as good classroom ventilation and open-air instruction wherever feasible. Credentialed studies in the U.S. indicate that these are effective measures, along with vaccination. It is vitally important for the Centre to share information on the school reopening experience with all States and issue alerts in real time to enable decision-making. An empirical approach will also enable organisations such as the National Institute of Disaster Management collate useful insights. Parents must be convinced by transparent official measures that the health and education prospects of their children are in safe hands.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/learning-safely/article36130078.ece

What distinguishes it from the new public sector disinvestment policy is that a change of ownership is not envisaged. The Government estimates these assets — airports, coal mines, highway stretches, even urban tracts, stadia and hotels — to fetch around Rs. 5.96-lakh crore through structured leasing and securitisation transactions. This, in turn, could help fund the National Infrastructure Pipeline with new projects worth Rs. 100-lakh crore, although the Government has said fiscal constraints are not the trigger for this plan. As Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has emphasised, these assets or the land therein will not be sold but private players will be asked to pay for operation and management rights and expected to modernise assets that are either languishing or are simply under-utilised. An infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) structure has already been used this year by the PowerGrid Corporation to raise funds against its transmission lines network and could be used for highways, gas pipelines and railway tracks, including the Dedicated Freight Corridor. For ports, mining, railway stations, concession agreements laying out the contours for a PPP are proposed. About Rs. 88,000 crore is expected from the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) in this year itself, in addition to the Rs. 1.75-lakh crore already estimated in the Budget from the sale of public firms such as Air India and BPCL. While this Government is yet to complete a single PSU sale, the risks of adverse audit paras about valuations and processes hang over monetisation deals too. However, post-transaction troubles in outright sales can be of a limited nature. With proposed concession periods running up to 60 years for some assets, NMP deals, by contrast, could pose a long-term headache if they are not structured with end-user interests in mind, balancing the profit and utility motives. The sharing of risk and rewards between the public and private partners needs to be weighed carefully for each sector. Checks and balances are needed for actual infrastructure usage versus projections at the time of bidding. If the Government had implemented its 2014 Budget promise to set up an apex body to devise new PPP models, learning from past mistakes, India’s institutional capacity for the NMP would have been more mature by now. Just like disinvestment deals during a downturn could crowd out new investments and risk the tag of ‘fire sales’, revenue projections for PPP assets could be deflated now leading to lower bids followed by super-normal gains for the operator in the future. Getting the nitty-gritty right is critical for this grand plan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/risks-and-rewards/article36130080.ece
27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Rumours following PM’s note to China||New Delhi, August 26: The Prime Minister’s Secretariat and the External Affairs Ministry have become so tight-lipped about the purpose of Mrs. Indira Gandhi’s communication to Mr. Chou En-lai that they have unnecessarily set in motion a spate of wild speculation over it. The top officials in the External Affairs Ministry, who would normally be kept in the picture when such moves are made by the Prime Minister, are feigning ignorance to an extent that many have been left wondering whether they were really unaware this time until they read about it in the newspapers. Even otherwise the Prime Minister’s present style of functioning is creating within the Government a new kind of compartmentalisation by cutting across the normal divisions of Ministry-wise responsibility and establishing an apex system with her Secretariat serving as the focal point. When Mrs. Gandhi takes a new step or makes a new move, it does not always percolate down to the Ministry concerned at any rate below a certain level, with the result that the senior officialdom in general is often ignorant of the broad policy moves being made by her in various spheres. But in the field of foreign affairs, it is creating more difficulties since the External Affairs Ministry is not always able to interpret Indian initiatives to the diplomatic representatives here without turning to the Prime Minister’s Secretariat at every stage for policy guidance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/rumours-following-pms-note-to-china/article36130089.ece
27 August 2021||MUMBAI,||Few takers seen for debt recast 2.0 as demand recovers: Crisil||With the recovery in demand and growing confidence in economic growth, very few corporates have opted for or are looking for debt restructuring under the RBI’s Resolution Framework 2.0, according to a report by Crisil Ratings. Barely 1% of eligible companies in Crisil’s rating portfolio had opted for or were contemplating restructuring under the Resolution Framework 2.0, the debt rating agency said in the report released on Thursday. The findings came from an analysis of about 4,700 firms rated by the agency. “The quick recovery in demand after moderation during the second COVID-19 wave, and sanguinity around economic growth have led corporates to give the restructuring option a miss,” said chief ratings officer Subodh Rai. The more localised and less stringent nature of restrictions during the second wave has meant relatively lower disruption in business activities compared to the first wave. So, the muted response is par for the course, he said. On May 5, the RBI had announced Resolution Framework 2.0 for borrowers, including individuals, small businesses, and MSMEs with an aggregate exposure of up to Rs. 25 crore, with some caveats. On June 4, the RBI raised the aggregate debt threshold to Rs. 50 crore. About 95% of firms that had opted for or were considering the scheme now, were rated in the sub-investment grade rating category, the ratings agency added. Crisil’s director Nitin Kansal said most of these firms belong to the low-to-medium resilience sectors such as hospitality, educational services, textiles, construction and gems and jewellery.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/few-takers-seen-for-debt-recast-20-as-demand-recovers-crisil/article36130069.ece
27 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Spend less on lifestyles of senior managers: Bhargava||Maruti Suzuki chairman R.C. Bhargava on Thursday asked the automobile components industry to focus on maximising internal resources for investments in research and development and to spend less on other purposes such as lifestyles of senior management personnel. His comments come amid renewed debates over high salaries for senior management after shareholders of Eicher Motors, the maker of Royal Enfield motorcycles, voted against the re-appointment of Siddhartha Lal as managing director due to concerns around remuneration. Speaking at the 61st annual session of the component manufacturers’ association ACMA, Mr. Bhargava said, “I will strongly suggest to component manufacturers that they need to look at the entire management culture ... see how more funds remain within the company and less funds are used for other purposes, including lifestyles of senior management personnel,” he added. Pointing out that investments in engineering and R&D had been inadequate, Mr. Bhargava said given that such investments would be comparatively large and might not yield adequate dividends in the short term, it is important that they are done from internal resources. He also asked component manufacturers to focus on constantly improving quality not only for tier-1 vendors, but also tier 2 and tier 3 vendors, who, in many cases, are the ‘weak points’ of the industry.  As investments may not yield dividends in the short term, funds must come from internal resources||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/spend-less-on-lifestyles-of-senior-managers-bhargava/article36130065.ece
27 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||ACMA seeks stable long-term roadmap for localisation||The Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA) on Thursday stressed that a long-term stable and technology agnostic roadmap, which would allow for localisation of technologies, was critical to ensuring the survival and competitiveness of the industry amid declining vehicle sales. ACMA President Deepak Jain highlighted that high domestic taxation, increasing fuel costs, and a steep rise in commodity prices among other factors was adversely impacting affordability of vehicles, and in turn the viability of the component sector. Meanwhile, SIAM President Kenichi Ayukawa and CII President T. V. Narendran pitched for augmenting the country’s semiconductor capabilities in the face of a global shortage. Hyundai Motor India MD and CEO S.S. Kim also highlighted the need to develop an alternate and localised supply chain to mitigate the impact of disruption and push localisation in the domestic automotive sector. “While the semiconductor shortage appears to be a challenge, it also brings in an opportunity,” said Mr. Ayukawa, who is the CEO and MD of Maruti Suzuki. “Of course, semiconductor manufacturing requires very huge investments. The Indian automobile industry alone cannot assure full viability of such an investment in semiconductor projects. Hence, there is a need for consolidation across sectors,” he added. Mr. Narendran, MD of Tata Steel, noted that India needs to create capabilities in semiconductors since it is going to become more critical as electric mobility gains momentum in the country. “With the growing adoption of electric mobility, semiconductors are going to become more and more critical. It’s important for us as an ecosystem, as a country, as an industry, collectively or individually, to invest in creating these capabilities in India,” he said. ‘End reliance on China’ Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant reiterated that the Indian automobile and components industry must eliminate its import dependence on China for automotive parts and focus on localisation of such items. “A wide array of disruptions, such as global supply chain rebalancing, government incentives to increase exports and technology disruptions are creating opportunities at all levels of the automotive value chain,” said Mr. Kant. “These must be seen as opportunities. It is very important that industry participants see a clear highway and it is time for the industry to drive the machine at full throttle,” the Niti Aayog official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/acma-seeks-stable-long-term-roadmap-for-localisation/article36130063.ece

In addition, accommodative interest rates and loan restructuring schemes would continue to mitigate asset risks, Moody’s said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/strong-buffers-will-help-banks-tackle-asset-risks/article36130058.ece

27 August 2021||CHENNAI,||Tanvi wins cliffhanger for maiden crown||Sunayna Kuruvilla and Tanvi Khanna, two of India’s best players after Joshna Chinappa and Dipika Pallikal, produced a top-class performance in the women’s final that brought the curtains down on the HCL-SRFI Indian squash tour tournament, a PSA Challenger-10 event, at the ISA courts here on Thursday. Second seed Tanvi saved three match-points to outlast top-seeded Sunayna 11-5, 9-11, 7-11, 11-7, 15-13 in the women’s final. However, it was an anti-climax in the men’s summit clash as fourth-seeded S. Velavan drubbed Abhishek Pradhan, seeded six, 11-7, 11-8, 11-5. Tanvi and Sunayna played a tactical match that was engaging and entertaining. In the first game, Tanvi raked up an 8-3 lead with some delectable drops and strong play from the backcourt and never looked back. Sunayna hit back with strong defence and deft placements to pocket the next two games. Tanvi then made it two games each rather comfortably at 11-7 with some outstanding drops and consistent play. Tanvi took a handy 5-2 lead in the decider before the top seed made it 5-5, and it was neck and neck with both players producing their best. Holding her nerve Sunayna had two match-points at 10-8 and one more at 12-11, but Tanvi held her nerve to bag her maiden PSA title. In the men’s final, Pradhan, generally a fighter and a consistent player, was totally outplayed. Velavan, the left-handed 23-year-old from Chennai, didn’t give Pradhan any chance to attack with a strong defence. “This is my second PSA title after the one in Madison (USA) in 2018. Today, I didn’t allow him to prolong the rallies. My counterattack was good,” said Velavan. Finding it tough Tanvi said she always found it tough against Sunayna. “Last time, in the semifinals of the 2019 senior Nationals in Chennai, Sunayna had a match-point at 10-9 in the fifth and I went on to win,” she said. The winners took home $1,140 each and 400 ranking points. HCL Technologies global sales director Arun Rajendran gave away the prizes.  The results (finals): Men: S. Velavan bt Abhishek Pradhan 11-7,11-8, 11-5.   Women: Tanvi Khanna bt Sunayna Kuruvilla 11-5, 9-11, 7-11, 11-7, 15-13.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tanvi-wins-cliffhanger-for-maiden-crown/article36130428.ece

27 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Winning the Nationals an achievement: Akanksha||Back home in Mumbai, Akanksha Nitture does not get to play on clay. When she decided to compete in the National junior championship on clay in Chennai, Akanksha was taken to Pune by her coaches to get used to the surface. “Initially, we could not play for about three months owing to COVID. I had COVID. All of us in our family were affected. Coming out of that and winning this is an achievement,” said the 18-year-old Akanksha, about her singles and doubles titles in the Nationals. In a conversation with Olympian Vishnu Vardhan, a stakeholder in Tennishub which sponsored the National junior championship, Akanksha recalled how the weather was quite challenging in Chennai. Owing to rain, she had to play one of the matches on hard courts. “It was tough to switch between two surfaces, but somehow we managed,” said Akanksha. Quite a bubbly personality, Akanksha said that she would dedicate the title to herself, for all the hard work she had endured, apart from her parents “for all their sacrifices” and the coaches at the ASA Academy in Navi Mumbai “for believing in me”. Happy with coaches She was particularly happy with the coaches for playing with her to generate a high standard of training sessions. Ranked 29th among the women in the country, Akanksha, quite a smart player on court, said that she would continue to play more tournaments in the professional circuit to get better. Akanksha said that her favourite was the Australian Open as it had a familiar playing surface. She said that her favourite women players kept changing almost every week or every month, as there were so many good ones. “I like Aryna Sabalenka, Ashleigh Barty, Naomi Osaka, Victoria Azarenka and all time favourite Serena Williams,” said Akanksha. Tennis may take her to many places and allow her to sample different cuisines, but Akanksha was clear that there was nothing to match “ ghar ka khana ” (home food).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/winning-the-nationals-an-achievement-akanksha/article36130553.ece

27 August 2021||New York,||US Open: spectators to be at full capacity||Spectators will not be required to wear masks or show proof of vaccination status to attend matches at the US Open when the tennis tournament returns at full capacity next week, one year after all fans were banned because of the coronavirus pandemic. The goal “The goal, really, is to be certain that we don’t have an outbreak of COVID that’s going to be unusual or that we would regret,” Dr. Brian Hainline, a US Tennis Association first vice-president and member of its medical advisory group, said on a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. “We’re still relying on the goodwill of people. The unvaccinated — although it’s not going to be enforced — they really should be wearing masks. “ I expect many vaccinated individuals are going to be wearing masks, as well.” The year’s last Grand Slam starts on Monday. Fuelled by the highly contagious delta variant of the virus, new reported cases of COVID-19 in the US have topped 150,000 a day, the highest level since late January. The tournament’s protocols are based on what has been laid out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the New York City Department of Public Health. “This is not a USTA decision or a US Open decision. This is a decision made with New York City,” said Dr. Hainline, who is also the NCAA’s chief medical officer. Protocol Players don’t need to be vaccinated to compete; they will be tested for COVID-19 when they arrive in New York and then every four days. A positive result will force the player to isolate for 10 days and withdraw from the tournament. Spectators won’t need to fill out health questionnaires and will not have their temperatures taken to access the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. To eat indoors there, anyone 12 and older will need to show proof they’ve had at least one dose of a vaccine. All courts are considered outdoor venues — including, thanks to their air-filtration systems, Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium, even if their retractable roofs are closed because of rain.  A positive result will force the player to isolate for 10 days and withdraw from the tournament||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/us-open-spectators-to-be-at-full-capacity/article36130474.ece

27 August 2021||London,||Former England captain Dexter passes away||Former England Test captain Ted Dexter, one of the country’s greatest players, has died aged 86 after a recent illness, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) said on Thursday. Dexter, nicknamed ‘Lord Ted’, was an aggressive batsman and part-time seam bowler who played 62 Tests for England after making his debut in 1958 against New Zealand. He captained England and Sussex in the early 1960s. “After a recent illness, he passed away peacefully in the Compton Hospice in Wolverhampton at midday yesterday, surrounded by his family,” MCC said in a statement. “Ted was a cherished husband, father and grandfather and one of England’s greatest ever cricketers.” Dexter, who was England captain for 30 matches, “played the game with the same sense of adventure and fun that captures much of the story of his remarkable life,” the MCC added. Dexter scored 4,502 runs at an average of 47.89 during his Test career and took 66 wickets at an average of 34.93. As a cricket administrator, Dexter was chairman of England selectors between 1989 and 1993. He was later appointed president of MCC and awarded a CBE in 2001. Dexter also developed a system that was formally adopted and forms the basis of the International Cricket Council’s current Test-player rankings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/former-england-captain-dexter-passes-away/article36130379.ece
27 August 2021||MUMBAI,||Domestic panel in the dark over role||More than six weeks after being formally appointed, members of the BCCI’s working group for domestic cricket are still in the dark about the nature of their role. When the BCCI formed the seven-member working group on July 11, the members had assumed that they would be involved in devising a compensation package for the 2020-21 domestic season, which was curtailed because of the COVID-19 outbreak. But the group has neither been involved in revising the domestic calendar for the forthcoming season nor consulted about the compensation package. “Let alone being called for a meeting, none of us even knows what our mandate actually is,” a working group member told The Hindu , on condition of anonymity. The appointment was in line with a press release issued by the BCCI on June 20 after the apex council meeting. “The Apex Council has decided to form a committee to look into the issue of compensation for Indian domestic cricketers for domestic season 2020-21. “The Apex Council has mandated the Office Bearers of BCCI to form the committee and find a suitable compensatory mechanism for domestic cricketers, at the earliest possible,” said the statement.  However, when the letter announcing the appointment of the group was circulated among the BCCI affiliates, there was no mention of the compensation package. “We had hoped that we would be called for a meeting soon and the compensation bit, although not officially announced, would be discussed on the floor of the house. Surprising “In fact, it was kind of surprising for most of us when the BCCI revised the domestic calendar recently without keeping any of us in the loop,” said another working group member. The group includes Rohan Jaitley (North), Yudhvir Singh (Central), Jaydev Shah (West), Devajit Saikia (North-East), Avishek Dalmiya (East) and Santhosh Menon and Mohammad Azharuddin (South).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/domestic-panel-in-the-dark-over-role/article36130362.ece

Speaking to Brazilian investors on Wednesday, the 50-year-old Spaniard said he plans to see out his contract with City but could go into international management after that. “The next step will be a national team, yes, if there’s a chance,” said Guardiola in an online forum. “I must have a break after seven years (at City), I need to stop to watch, learn from other players and maybe that is the road I will take. ... I would like to coach at the Euros, a Copa America, a World Cup.” Guardiola didn’t say if he’d consider any other national team than Spain, but said he didn’t expect to get hired by “important national teams like Brazil”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/will-like-to-coach-a-national-team-guardiola/article36130894.ece

27 August 2021||MUMBAI,||Mumbai keeps series alive||Yashasvi Jaiswal’s (75, 59b, 8x4, 2x6) exploits at the top and captain Shams Mulani’s (3/12) spell at the death helped Mumbai win the second T20 against Oman and keep the three-match series alive. After losing the series-opener on Tuesday in Muscat, Mumbai rode on opening batsman Jaiswal’s stylish strokeplay to put on 162 for six in its 20 overs after being put in to bat. Pulling things back Mulani then pulled things back with his flat left-arm spin to get Mumbai back in the game. While Jaiswal didn’t get too much support from the other specialist batsmen, all-rounder Aman Khan’s cameo (31 not out, 15b, 2x4, 2x6) meant Mumbai could cross the 160-mark. Mulani then tilted the game in Mumbai’s favour as Oman finished at 144 for nine, thus handing an 18-run win to Mumbai. Thanks to opener Jatinder Singh’s fifty50, Oman was in sight of sealing the series, needing 58 runs off the last eight overs having lost just two wickets. However, all-rounder Sairaj Patil dismissed Aaquib Ilyas in the next over and began Mumbai’s comeback. Mulani bowled the 16th and 18th overs, picking up three wickets while conceding just two runs to ensure the series will be decided in the third match on Sunday.  The scores:   Mumbai 162/6 in 20 overs (Yashavi Jaiswal 75, Aman Khan 31 n.o., Kaleemullah 2/45) bt Oman 144/9 in 20 overs (Jatinder Singh 51, Zeeshan Maqsood 29, Shams Mulani 3/12, Sujit Nayak 2/10).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mumbai-keeps-series-alive/article36130871.ece

I’m extremely disappointed to see some of the reactions from the public on my recent comments. “There was nothing wrong with Arshad Nadeem using my javelin to prepare, it is within the rules and please do not use my name to push a dirty agenda,” he added. Neeraj, in a recent interview, stated that he was searching for his personal javelin before his first throw during the Olympic final on August 7 and found Nadeem holding it. “We keep our personal javelin (inside a holding rack) but it can be used by anybody. It is the rule and there is nothing wrong in that. “He (Nadeem) was having the javelin and preparing for his throw. I asked him to give it to me for my throw,” said Neeraj. Back only in 2022 The Tokyo gold medallist also announced on Thursday that he had decided to cut short his 2021 season and take some time off.

With both ball and bat, we’ve displayed exactly what we wanted to do,” said Anderson. “Losing the toss, being asked to bowl and putting in a performance like that... it just doesn't get much better.” India’s Rishabh Pant insisted that his side’s collapse was just “part and parcel” of the game. The wicketkeeper was, however, more forthcoming about an incident in the raucous Western Terrace late in the day that appeared to anger Kohli. “I think somebody threw a ball at Mohammed Siraj. He (Kohli) was upset,” said Pant. “You can chant whatever you want, but you can’t throw things at the fielders.

27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Interpreting the Vedas||One must learn all sacred texts through one’s preceptor, who will throw light on difficult passages in the texts. Attempts at self- learning can lead to misinterpretations, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse. The Taittiriya Upanishad, talking about how to give daana, says, “Shradhhayaa deyam; ashraddhayaa deyam.” Shradhhayaa deyam means “give with respect”. But the very next line uses the word ashraddhayaa, and we may wrongly interpret it as “Give disrespectfully.’ If such an interpretation were to be taken, then it would be the opposite of the previous injunction. Why would two contradictory statements be given by the Vedas? And there is no way the Vedas will ask us to give daana in an improper and arrogant manner. So, clearly, to interpret ashraddhayaa as implying that one must give disrespectfully, would be very wrong. The correct interpretation is “do not give disrespectfully.” If one studies under an Acharya, he will teach one how to properly understand the statement. The Vedas were passed down orally, and this has ensured that they have come down intact, without mistakes, because different permutations and combinations were used to ensure accuracy. The Taittiriya Upanishad gives more instructions on what the attitude of the giver should be. It says, “Shriya deyam.” That means one must give joyfully, and without regrets. It says , “ Hriya deyam.” This means one must be ashamed at one’s insignificant donations. It further says, “Bhiya deyam.” This means one must give with fear, for if one is arrogant while giving, it will mar the act of charity. The Upanishad says, “Samvida deyam.” This means one must be firm in one’s resolve to give. There should be no wavering or second thoughts about giving to someone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/interpreting-the-vedas/article36130147.ece

27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Tales of South Madras||Chimbudeven is best known for his fantasy-comedy outings, including his debut hit Imsai Arasan 23am Pulikesi (2006), but the filmmaker is taking a different route with his upcoming Kasada Tabara . “It will be emotional and serious, as the storyline demands that kind of treatment,” says the director, in a chat with MetroPlus about the film starring Harish Kalyan, Sundeep Kishan, Shanthnu Bhagyaraj, Regina Cassandra, Priya Bhavani Shankar and Premgi Amaren, among others . Excerpts: How did this project come about? I had a six-month gap during the pre-production of Pulikesi 2 a couple of years ago. At that time, I had an idea of a compact film that I casually narrated to my friend, filmmaker Venkat Prabhu, who liked it so much that he wanted to produce it. While it focusses on six people who lead different lives, there is a common thread throughout: Kasada Tabara is a hyperlink film.  There have been several anthologies in the recent past, but yours is a hyperlink… This is not something new to Tamil cinema: Thiruvilayadal (1965) is a hyperlink subject, with Lord Shiva being the common link. Mine has six episodes that are connected to each other in some way. While many Tamil filmmakers have chosen North Madras as their milieu, you have gone down south… South Madras is as beautiful and significant as the North. Here, every neighbourhood has a distinct quality. Kasada Tabara showcases many parts of Mylapore, Adyar, OMR and ECR. I don’t think there is a lot of difference between North and South Madras...the latter too has fishermen, Madras baashai and is steeped in history. You have chosen six different cinematographers and music composers for this project. How challenging was it? I have got the experience of six films in this one project! The entire process was very interesting because I got to work closely with established technicians offering different perspectives. Do you think releasing this on an OTT platform increases its chances of discoverability, especially among non-Tamil audiences? Cinema is all about evolution. We need to change with the times. The creative process is still the same, but it is the platform that is changing. In the last few years, most filmmakers have become comfortable with OTT platforms, and I would like to think that there are more positives in it than negatives. Kasada Tabara will stream   on Sony Liv from today.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/tales-of-south-madras/article36130813.ece
27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||‘There’s no fear-based mentality at Marvel’||When Destin Daniel Cretton was asked by president of Marvel Studios Kevin Fiege during the former’s pitch for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings , Fiege and his team asked Cretton if he was ever keen on doing a Marvel movie. The filmmaker froze and immediately recalled a phone call with his manager weeks before the pitching process, where he specifically said, “don’t ever let me do a Marvel movie”. Fast forward to 2021, and Cretton is sitting for a busy press day for the project. Timeline-wise, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings picks up after Avengers: Endgame ; it follows titular hero Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) drawn into the cryptic Ten Rings organisation and is forced to confront a troubling past he left behind. When Cretton was announced as the film’s director in March 2019, the MCU zeitgeist was experiencing a furore that not many other cinematic franchises had the luxury of boasting. Cretton is not embarrassed to admit his fears of stepping into the MCU, though most people are. “I was scared of stepping into a big studio movie like this and of what it might do to me. I had a lot of fears,” he recalls. He had one person to turn to, though: old friend and long-time collaborator Ryan Coogler, director and co-writer of Black Panther . “Ryan said, ‘the pressure is hard; it’ll be the hardest thing potentially that you have done up to this point, but none of that pressure or none of those complications come from the people you’re working with or for.’ That eased my mind. Not to toot Kevin’s horn, but there is an environment of curiosity and exploration that comes from the top down. There is no fear-based mentality at this studio which has allowed us to take risks and chances and be able to instill that same fearless exploration with everybody involved in this film and that’s a huge reason that the movie turned out the way that it did.” Fiege on-boarded Cretton because of the filmmaker’s determination to go deeper with Shang-Chi as both a superhero and a young man dealing with the sins of his father, while speaking to the Asian diaspora experience. “If we were not putting Shang-Chi shoulder to shoulder with all the amazing other Marvel superheroes we have come to love in the past, that would be, to me, a big disservice to the culture and character.” Authenticity was more than a priority to Cretton and Marvel. After all, with Shang-Chi travelling to China, not everyone would be readily speaking English. “The conversation behind which language should be spoken was always rooted in just the logic of the characters, and who would naturally be speaking what language,” he affirms, adding, “That conversation started in the writer’s room and then once our actors came in, it was always a dialogue around all these. So, we were constantly having the discussion of what made sense for the scene.” Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings releases in theatres on September 3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/theres-no-fear-based-mentality-at-marvel/article36130815.ece
27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||The last laugh||Shiva’s upcoming Tamil film is Kasethan Kadavulada . The titled translates to ‘money is God’. But that isn’t what the actor subscribes to, in the pandemic-ridden world we live in today. “Love and humour; these are the two things that the world needs today. The basic necessity for everyone is happiness,” says Shiva, over a virtual conversation from the set of Kasethan Kadavulada . Shiva is trying to spread humour through LOL: Enga Siri Paappom , an unscripted comedy reality show that drops on Amazon Prime Video on August 27. Featuring 10 comedians who share a common roof for six hours, the concept behind the show is that, you win if you make others laugh but do not laugh yourself. Contestants include the likes of Premgi Amaren,Satish, Pugazh, RJ Vigneshkanth and Powerstar Srinivasan trying their best to suppress their laughter, but Shiva, being the host, did guffaw quite a few times. “When I got the synopsis for this show, I got hooked. That it gave me an opportunity to be with Vivekh sir was a big factor. I’m a huge fan of Vivekh sir, having been awe of his comedy tracks in Minnale and Run. ” The few weeks that he show for the show, directed by Madhumitha, gave Shiva the opportunity to spend a lot of time with Vivekh. With the shoot in Mumbai when COVID-19 cases were high, Shiva and Vivekh — staying in neighbouring rooms at a hotel — shared a lot of anecdotes. “I have previously interviewed him a few times, but shooting for LOL … was special because it gave me so much time with him. We spoke about films, life and much more. He spoke about how he wrote separate comedy tracks in the many hit films that I grew up watching, and how he kept encouraging young actors. His death was a huge shock to me,” says Shiva.

That is why stories like Ahimsa will always remain important. The story is set in 1942. Mahatma Gandhi asks one member of every family to join the freedom movement. Ten-year-old Anjali is surprised when she learns that, in her family, it is not her father but her mother who has joined. Anjali has to come to terms with her new life, accept challenges and, when her mother is jailed, even step into her shoes. This is a true story, inspired by the author’s great-grandmother’s experiences of working with Gandhiji.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/food-for-thought/article36131064.ece
27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Party at the park||“Ananya is not talking to me,” said Nisha, sadly, to her mother. The two girls had been best friends since Std. IV but, in Std. VI, Ananya had become friendly with Anita. “Even my bench mate Ruth is always rude to me. Nobody wants to be my friend.” Her mother did not want Nisha to host a self-pity party. So she said, “Get up! Let’s go to the park.” At the park, Nisha played badminton with her mother. As they rested on the park bench, a little boy approached them. “Hello! My name is Aarav. Today is my birthday and I am turning six. Please come to my birthday party.” They agreed. His mother smilingly welcomed them. Aarav saw three boys playing near the pond and invited them too. Nisha and her mother helped Aarav’s mother set the table. His father came with the boy who sold balloons outside the park, “This is Raghu. I have invited him.” Raghu put some balloons in the form of an arch and was happy to be paid for his work. Aarav’s mother explained, “We moved to this city a few months ago. Aarav is a friendly child. But, he was unable to make friends in his new school. We asked Aarav to invite his class for his party, but his classmates rudely declined. Some parents called us to decline the invitation as well. But Aarav was not upset. He suggested we celebrate his party in this park.” Celebrations Nisha saw Aarav invite some joggers at the park, and some kids from the play area too. Soon, it was time to cut the birthday cake. The 20 children and 10 grown-ups wished him and the kids played games. Next day, at school, Ruth said she had forgotten to bring her lunch money, and so Nisha shared her lunch. She noticed Rani sitting alone in the corner of the class and asked her to join them. She also told Ruth and Rani about Aarav’s birthday party at the park. In the weekend, they all met up again at the park. Aarav told Nisha that he had made two new friends at school. What fun it was when they realised that his new friends were Simon, Ruth’s brother, and Rajesh who was Rani’s brother. Life had come a full circle indeed.  Her mother did not want Nisha to host a self-pity party, and said, “Get up! Let’s go to the park.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/party-at-the-park/article36131037.ece

He shares his amazement with Mayasura.  Ravana: Uncle, I had asked Meghnath to learn the secrets behind the world’s most powerful weapons from the three Gods — Shiva,Vishnu and Brahma, by praying to them. It seems like he has already achieved what took me years to do!  Mayasura: That’s wonderful! With his potential, he needs a good teacher. You should enroll him with our guru Sukracharya.  Ravana: That is a good idea! Let’s do that right away... Off to Venus Guru Sukracharya lived on Venus. So, the three of them set off in the new flying machine, Vaihayasa, which was designed by Mayasura for King Bali and was capable of interstellar and interplanetary travel.  Meghnath: Grandpa, are we really going to outer space?! It’s the first time I will be crossing the ozone layer!  Mayasura: Though you didn’t travel physically, you travelled all the way to Vaikunta through your dedication and hard work. Guru Sukracharya is impressed.  Meghnath: What?! Guru Sukracharya! He trains only the strongest Asura warriors, right? Am I not too young to train under him?  Mayasura: Yes, but there is a surprise for you. Just wait for it. New technology As they continue talking, the aircraft crosses the Stratosphere, the Mesosphere and enters the Ionosphere. Mayasura jumps into the cockpit and presses a button. The wings open out and Meghanth sees a bunch of batteries and vacuum tubes lined inside. They start to glow.  Meghnath: What is happening, Daddy?  Ravana: This is a vehicle that uses a modern technology — electric propulsion and ion propulsion — to move.  Meghnath: How does that work?  Ravana: Till you cross the Karmen line — 100 km above the ground — the effect of gravity is greater. So, we need fuels like solid and liquid propellants. Once we travel beyond the pull of gravity, our vehicle becomes light. So, we need only a minimum push to propel our vehicle. This is achieved by using ion propulsion technology. Do you know what an ion is?  Meghanth: Yes. An ion is a particle — atom or molecule — with a net electrical charge. When we pull an electron out of it, the ion becomes a cation , gaining a positive charge. It becomes an anion when it gains one or more electrons, acquiring a negative charge. Because of their opposite electric charges, cations and anions attract each other.  Ravana: You are right. The same ions, when placed close to plates with an opposite charge, move swiftly towards the plates creating a wave of movement called Ionic wind, which is capable of thrusting a spacecraft forward.  Meghnath: Wow! So high-velocity ions are the space’s equivalents of high-velocity air on ground!  Ravana: Exactly! Some spacecraft use the Ion Thruster Engine to extract electrons out of atoms to ionise them using electricity. By now, their aircraft has crossed 384,000 km, travelling beyond the moon. Suddenly, a huge square sheet pops out of the aircraft’s body. Both Meghnath and Ravana are awestruck!  Meghnath: What’s happening, Grandpa?  Ravana: I’ve never seen this before!  Mayasura: This is the new technology that I learnt from the future; from JAXA (the Japanese space agency). It is called a solar sail. This kite-shaped wing is made of 7.5 micrometer (0.00030 inch) thick sheet of polymide. One square meter of polymide sheet weighs only 10 gm. That means, the entire sail weighs only 2 kg.  Meghnath: What?! Such a huge object weighs only 2 kg?! But how does it work?  Mayasura: It is similar to a sail being blown by the wind, which helps the ship move. This sail uses a light exerting a force on the mirrors, like the sunlight. With this force, the sail spins 20-25 revolutions per minute, carrying our aircraft towards the destination. The Vaihasaya moves closer to Venus, the realm of Sukracharya. Meghanth is amazed by its beauty. Venus looks like a polished crystal ball with a thick atmosphere over it. As they move closer, Meghanth sees something that makes his jaw drop!  Meghnath: Tripura!! The floating city!  Mayasura: Get ready to experience more magic, my boy...

27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||The man with the golden arm||Neeraj Chopra won independent India’s first-ever athletics medal at the Olympics. He won gold in the javelin throw final with his second throw of 87.58m at the recent Tokyo Olympics and beat the competition in his second throw in the final. Chopra’s haul ensured this is India’s best-ever medal haul at the Olympics (seven), surpassing the six at the London Games in 2012. This is also India’s second individual Olympic gold medal after Abhinav Bindra’s win at the Beijing Games in 2008. “I wanted to sleep early but couldn’t. I managed to sleep around 12:30 am, and was wide awake by 5.30 am. I tried to sleep again because rest is essential for recovery, but I wasn’t able to. I had breakfast and tried again, but I was wide awake in an hour. Aisa lag raha tha ki mere shareer se aag nikal raha tha, aisa garam tha. Josh bahut tha (It felt like my body was radiating fire. I was very charged up),” he said after his triumph. Neeraj’s coach Klaus Bartonietz said he never wanted the athlete to feel the pressure of winning the gold. “You should not say I will win gold; it puts a lot of pressure. You should enjoy this competition, that is all. And then you do your best,” he told Neeraj before the competition. The German’s last piece of advice to Neeraj was: “ maje karo (have fun).” Asked how much the gold medal weighed, Neeraj said: “Even if it weighed 10kg, it would feel light to me. I am feeling very good!” Neeraj dedicated his medal to one of India's greatest athletes Milkha Singh, who passed away last month. “When we were in Kourtane, Milkha Singhji passed away and I felt very bad. I did not meet him when he was alive, and I wanted to meet him with an Olympic medal. Sadly, he’s not among us but I hope he’s seeing us from above and is happy that his dream has come true. Even other athletes like P.T. Usha and others who missed out on a medal by centimetres — I hope they’re all happy.”  It felt like my body was radiating fire.

The buses on the road made him nervous. But the presence of his two best friends strengthened him. “Go!” said Dhanush. “No,” said Stella. “If your mother comes to know, you will be in trouble.” “I won’t tell her. Will you?” asked Dhanush. Stella frowned. “We deserve a treat,” said Dhanush. “This is the first time Bhuvan is walking home without his mother.” Feline love The signal turned red and Bhuvan crossed the road to reach the long queue at a kulfi stall. When a grey kitten brushed against his leg, he followed it to the adjacent lace and button shop. Bhuvan often came here with Aai whenever she wanted to buy materials for her tailoring shop. The owner, Mrs. Miranda, was filling a bowl of water for four kittens at the entrance. Bhuvan lifted the grey kitten and petted it. “Can I take him home?” “Do you have any pets?” asked Mrs Mirinda. “Two chickens…” said Bhuvan. “The kitten needs his mother now. You can have him after a fortnight.” Bhuvan heard Stella call him, so he hurried to the kulfi stall and bought three kulfis. Dhanush whistled when he crossed the road and shared the kulfis. “Miranda Aunty has four new kittens in her shop. I am going to adopt one of them,” said Bhuvan, licking his kulfi. “A kitten?” squealed Stella. “Have you gone mad? The kitten will grow into a cat someday and eat your chickens.” Who’ll keep the kitten? “You can keep the kitten in Stella’s house since she lives opposite to you,” suggested Dhanush. “That way you can play with it whenever you want.” “Why should I keep the kitten?” said Stella. “You are good at singing lullabies’ to your baby sister. I am sure you will do a splendid job looking after the kitten.” “Hey! I am good at other stuff too! If you think of it, I am good at everything I do!” Dhanush laughed. Stella swung her water bottle at him. “Why don’t you keep the kitten? You stay just two houses away from Bhuvan!” “I will only feed kulfis to the kitten,” said Dhanush. “Kittens don’t eat kulfis!” chided Stella. “Yes, they do! Kulfis are full of milk. All kittens drink milk!” “We can take turns in looking after the kitten as we live on the same Sonar street,” said Bhuvan, before gobbling the last piece of his Kulfi and smiling at Aai who was walking towards him. “Why are you late?” she asked, reaching for Bhuvan’s school bag. Bhuvan and Stella looked at each other. “The peon forgot to ring the bell on time,” lied Dhanush and saved the day.

Different forms of visible light are seen as the colours of the rainbow. When a wave of light hits an object, it could be absorbed or scattered or reflected or refracted or transmitted. The last means passed through the object, which makes it transparent. Paper is made of fibre and the many fibres have pockets of air between them. When oil comes in contact with paper, minute droplets fill these gaps between the various fibres.   Who invented Sudoku?  Maki Kaji, who died on August 10, was the founder of Sudoku. He created the puzzle to be simple for people who didn’t want to think too hard to solve number puzzles. In 1980, he launched a quarterly puzzle magazine, Nikoli, naming it after a race horse he had won. Three years later, he founded a company under the same name, and the magazine was its main product. Sudoku first appeared in this magazine.

27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Carnatic orchestra in action||Bho Shambo,’ a song from a Maharajapuram Santhanam album that hit the charts decades ago, still remains a hot favourite with musicians and audiences. L. Krishnan, whose brainchild it was, was a prolific and successful composer during the cassette boom of the 70s and the 80s. Now, Krishnan’s son, K. Arunprakash, a well-known mridangam exponent and composer, is pushing the boundaries of the music he grew up with. About 30 years after R. Sundaravalli Ammal, a housewife-turned-composer, published her songs in the book Kaanada Kovilgal Kelaada Geethangal , Arunprakash is organising a concert featuring several musicians to relive some of her compositions. Supported by the late composer’s family, the event will premiere on the Parivadini Music YouTube channel in the first week of September. Book release Sundaravalli Ammal composed not only the lyrics but also the music for the songs that flowed through her mind even as she went about her household chores, and published them in her book with notations in 1991. She did not, however, live to complete the notation for 10 of her songs. These ten will now get a new life with Arunprakash not only setting the lyrics to music, but also notating them in a book, Sundara Amudha Ganam , to be released at the event. Historian V. Sriram and musician R.K. Shriram Kumar have written the foreword for the book. Critic Subbudu wrote the foreword for Kaanada Kovilgal Kelaada Geethangal , while the Sankaracharya of Kanchi gave his blessings in writing. Speaking about his father, Arunprakash says, “He  started off as a vocalist after training under B.V. Lakshmanan, Pudukode Krishnamurthy, O.V. Subramamaniam, and G.N. Balasubramaniam.” Krishnan joined the Telugu film industry as a music director, and later moved to All India Radio as a composer. “Balamuralikrishna, Bombay Jayashri, Maharajapuram Santhanam, Bombay Sisters... the list of illustrious musicians he worked with is long. He composed music for more than 2,000 albums, Annamacharya kritis, Bharatiyar songs, and Maharajapuram Santhanam’s ‘Vandeham Sharanam,’ to mention just a few, that became big hits,” recalls Arunprakash. About his own composing, he says, “While my father’s music is a big inspiration, I listen to all kinds of music, Western, classical, film and so on.” Arun’s orchestra For the upcoming Sundaravalli Ammal event, Arunprakash’s orchestra has an interesting mix: Vignesh Ishwar and Aditya Madhavan (vocals), Sandeep Ramachandran, Sayee Rakshith and Madan Mohan (violin), Mylai Karthikeyan (nagaswaram), Sujith Naik (flute), Charulatha Chandrasekar (veena), and N. Guruprasad (ghatam). “Besides vocal, there are raga interludes on the nagaswaram, flute and violin — Anandabhairavi, Sama, Saranga, Kambodhi, Sahana, and Dhanyasi are among the ragas selected — as well as a tanam interlude on the veena.” ‘Sengamale valli nathane’, Sundaravalli Ammal’s beautiful Tamil lyrics, floated in the air as we entered a rehearsal at Ragasudha Hall. As the line ended, the violins, flute, nagaswaram and veena piped in, even as the vocalists picked up the cue to introduce the next line. The rehearsals have been many, revealed Arunprakash, who sat centrestage playing the mridangam. He and ghatam vidwan Guruprasad provided the rhythm. There was a pause in between to check sound settings before the music started again with an effervescent Anandabhairavi piece. Going by the energy of the rehearsal, the programme promises to be a memorable ode to music and Tamil.  The writer is a trained classical musician.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/carnatic-orchestra-in-action/article36130314.ece
27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Poet of the masses||After more than six decades, songs penned by the inimitable Shailendra continue to warm our hearts, be hummed by the older generation, and sung by young participants at music reality shows. ‘Pyaar hua ikraar hua’ from Shree 420 instantly brings to mind the popular image of Raj Kapoor and Nargis under an umbrella; ‘Khoya khoya chaand’ from Kala Bazar reminds you of Dev Anand’s swagger; ‘O Sajna’ from Parakh makes one visualise a charming Sadhana singing on a rainy night. For an entire generation of film lovers, lyricist Shailendra was the king of simplicity, who understood the medium of cinema and the importance of characterisation. The songs he wrote before his untimely death at the age of 43 are as popular for their simple expressions as for their musicality. Born Shankardas Kesarilal on August 30, 1923, Shailendra left an indelible stamp on Hindi film music in the 50s and the 60s. The Rawalpindi-born lyricist grew up in Mathura and worked as a welding apprentice in Bombay, spending his evenings listening to poets at the Indian People’s Theatre Association (IPTA). Career as a lyricist Having begun writing early in life, he would often recite his poems at kavi sammelans  in Bombay. His ‘Jalta Hai Punjab’ was very popular. After hearing him at a mushaira, Raj Kapoor approached him, wondering whether he could use the poem in his film Aag . Not keen for his work to be used in cinema, the young writer refused. However, a couple of years later, when he was in need of money, he approached the filmmaker and was offered two songs in Barsaat , including ‘Barsaat mein humse mile tum sajan’. That song proved to be a turning point in his career. When one talks of Shailendra, one is reminded of the team that consisted of filmmaker-actor Raj Kapoor, music director duo Shankar-Jaikishen, lyricist Hasrat Jaipuri, singers Mukesh, Lata Mangeshkar and Manna Dey. Some of Mukesh’s songs, written by Shailendra, composed by Shankar-Jaikishen and picturised on Raj Kapoor, are immortal. These include ‘Awara hoon’ ( Awara ), ‘Mera joota hai Japani’ ( Shree 420 ), ‘Sab kuchh seekha hamne’ ( Anari ), the Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai title song and ‘Dost dost na raha’ ( Sangam ). His own production, Teesri Kasam , starring Raj Kapoor, had Mukesh singing ‘Sajan re jhoot mat bolo’ and ‘Sajanwa bairi ho gaye hamaar’. Besides, there are the Manna Dey-Lata duets such as ‘Pyaar hua ikraar hua’ ( Shree 420) and ‘Jahaan main jaati hoon’ and ‘Yeh raat bheegi bheegi’ ( Chori Chori) . Epic partnerships Shailendra had many hits with other music directors too. With Salil Chowdhury, his friend from the IPTA days, he did the successful Madhumati and Parakh , among others. The former featured classics like ‘Suhana safar’, ‘Aaja re pardesi’ and ‘Bichua’, and Parakh had the Lata gem ‘O sajna’. With S.D. Burman, he worked in Kala Bazar , Bandini and of course Guide , which had the epic numbers ‘Din dhal jaaye’, ‘Kaanton se kheenchke’, ‘Tere mere sapne’, ‘Gaata rahe mera dil’ and ‘Kya se kya ho gaya’. He wrote ‘Rula ke gaya sapna mera’ for S.D. Burman in the Dev Anand film Jewel Thief , but since he fell ill, Majrooh Sultanpuri wrote the other songs. In Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s Anuradha , sitar maestro Pt. Ravi Shankar scored the music, with Shailendra writing Lata hits like ‘Jaane kaise sapnon mein’ and ‘Saanware saanware’. There were also those hit songs with Shankar-Jaikishen that had no Raj Kapoor connection. Prime examples were ‘Tu pyaar ka saagar hai’ from Seema , ‘Yeh mera deewanapan hai’ ( Yahudi) , ‘Yaad na jaaye beete dinon ki’ ( Dil Ek Mandir) , ‘Ajeeb dastaan hai yeh’ ( Dil Apna Aur Preet Parayi) , ‘Tera mera pyaar amar’ ( Asli Naqli) and ‘Main gaaoon tum so jaao’ ( Brahmachari) . Unlike many of his contemporaries, who used complex phrases, Shailendra wrote in a way that everyone could understand, continuing a tradition set by D.N. Madhok, and paving the way for lyricists like Anand Bakshi. For instance, even the man on the street could relate to the line ‘Sab kuchh seekha hamne, na seekhi hoshiyari, sach hai duniya waalon ke hum hai anari’ (I learnt everything but shrewdness; yes, world, I am a fool).

27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||In step with the times||As a participant at the dance improvisation programme held as part of the American Arts Festival, New Delhi, Madhu Natraj was told to show the many ways in which the index finger can be moved. Impressed by the young girl’s imagination, the mentor told her, “If the three joints of your index finger can be used to express, think of the limitless permutation and combination of movements you can create using all the muscles and joints of the body. This is the power of dance.” For someone who was not keen to pursue dance professionally, these words made a huge impact and Madhu found her calling in the performing arts. Daughter of renowned Kathak dancer and choreographer Maya Rao, she went beyond the training and structured repertoire to explore dance on her terms, finally going on to head the Natya Institute of Kathak and Choreography that her mother, along with Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, had started in New Delhi in 1964. It was moved to Bengaluru at the behest of the late Karnataka Chief Minister Ramakrishna Hegde. Later, Madhu launched the STEM (Space, Time, Energy, Motion) Dance Kampni, to focus on contemporary choreography. “I combined martial arts and yoga with Kathak. Since I choreographed my first production in 1995, I have always collaborated with other disciplines like sculpture, painting and theatre to offer a wholesome experience to the audience.” Structured courses The Natya Institute also introduces students to the aesthetics of choreography through some uniquely designed courses. Owing to the pandemic, the courses have moved online, and they cover a vast array of subjects ranging from Indian aesthetics and art history, Natyashastra and the history of choreography, movement analysis, cultural anthropology, stage lighting, set design, costume and more. “The aim is to develop a holistic vision,” says Madhu. “We had to restructure the courses for online teaching. We started two new courses — skills diploma in choreography and skills diploma in Kathak — certified by JUx and Jain University (deemed). Designed as a mentorship programme, 12 students from across the globe are chosen and trained for a year. The first batch of students are nearing the completion of their course,” says Madhu. In May 2020, the Dr. Maya Rao Kathak and Choreography conference was launched. “It was held virtually. Instead of 400 people attending, we had nearly 30,000 views. Such is the reach of the digital platform, but we need to take care not to dilute its effect. Since the start of the pandemic, the major challenge has been to sustain ourselves financially.” The institute now works in three areas — creating new contemporary works, training young dancers, and reaching out to rural areas through the arts. “Over the past year, we have raised funds to support more than 100 folk artistes,” says Madhu. The dancer says she can never forget her mother’s words when she was trying to get back to dance. “She told me, ‘Ask yourself if you have the capacity to choose creative satisfaction over monetary gain. If yes, go ahead and fulfil your dreams’.”  The author is a Chennai-based   freelance writer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/in-step-with-the-times/article36130323.ece
27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||The spirit of freedom||Patriotic songs are high on emotion and have beautiful lyrics. Add the colours of Carnatic music and present them in kutcheri format and one can feel the power of the combination. Gayathri Venkataraghavan proved it at her concert for Hamsadhwani to mark the 75th Independence Day. She ensured that the primacy of the song themes were preserved even while bringing manodharma into play. Music was thus an additional ornamentation to the lyrics. The two substantive segments of the concert featured Subramania Bharati’s ‘Thondru nigazhntha’ in Bhairavi and tisra ekam and a ragam tanam pallavi in Hindolam. The elegance of the Bhairavi alapana was in tune with the spirit of Independence . Apart from a few novel phrases like ‘pa ri sa’, both Gayathri and violinist Ananthakrishnan offered measured embellishments to a conformist course. A bright mood was set up with the song ‘Bharata sakthi’, in Hamsadwani, with crisp swarams. Gayathri then sang ‘Jayati jayati bharata mata’ (Mayuram Viswanatha Sastry) in Kamas, once popularised by many stalwarts, especially GNB, at hurricane speed, perhaps for the percussionists to warm up. Raga choices befitted the occasion, with a Kapi alapana sketch followed by ‘Swatantra bharatham’ and a short viruttam in Mohanam that led to the popular Bharati song, ‘Vetri ettu thikkum kottu murase’. Ananthakrishnan’s sensitive responses on the violin brought out the soul of the songs. Hindolam was rendered in a Hindustani style with short phrases and sustains that boosted the opportunity to present more karvais. Gayathri’s treatment was gentle and soothing. An RTP with patriotism as the undertone could have sounded alien, but the lyrics and a lilting misra chapu structure ensured that the piece stayed within the overall mood. ‘Vande mataram sujalaam suphalaam’ was the pallavi. Following a brisk trikala singing, Gayathri appended soft swarams in Hindolam, Sama, Madhuvanti and Kamboji to give completeness to the pallavi. Tukkadas on this occasion offered a wide choice but none portrays the celebratory bugle as well as ‘Aaduvome pallu paduvome’ in Maandu, and Gayathri lent her own verve to the song, which resonates with R. Sudarsanam’s immortal music and the legendary D. K. Pattammal’s voice. ‘Vande mataram’ in Hamsanadam, ending appropriately with Desh, brought the concert to an end. Ananthakrishnan stuck to the essential tenor of the concert admirably while Ganapathi Raman on the mridangam and Sunil Kumar on kanjira were in their elements thanks to the brisk course of the concert and the well-known lyrical meter. Reining in the music from over-indulgence was a laudable effort by Gayathri.

27 August 2021||August 27 2021 00:00 IST,||Understanding Rahman||One of the chords that integrates India is A.R. Rahman’s music, but we still don’t know how the creations of a shy Tamil boy found a devoted audience across the world. Everybody seems to have a favourite Rahman song but the reticent composer remains an enigma. Celebrating three decades of his journey, National Film Award-winning director Umesh Aggarwal launched on August 26 a year-long series Rahman Music Sheets on his YouTube channel O2india, which not only profiles Rahman through in-depth interviews with his collaborators but also brings together young artistes from across the globe to recreate his music. “I wanted to convey that Rahman’s music transcends boundaries. We have school students in Japan, who don’t speak Hindi or English, recreating the music of his Tamil films. There are students from the Berklee College of Music and Stanford University,” says Aggarwal, who is remembered for his documentary Jai Ho, that had chronicled the rise of Rahman as a global icon. The new series showcases artistes from the U.S., the U.K., the Czech Republic, Croatia, Turkey, U.A.E. and Australia talking about Rahman. There are other off-beat moments, like the four-year-old Mizo girl singing ‘Vande Mataram’ and a Mizo group singing a choir version of ‘Maa Tujhe Salam’. Reflecting on the moment when Rahman became a global star, Shridhar Subramaniam, president, Corporate Strategy and Market Development, Asia and Middle East, at Sony Music Entertainment says, “When they presented ‘Vande Mataram’ at the Global Sony Music Conference in Manila, the fear was if it would work in an audience that’s not Indian. “Nobody understood the words, but they understood the quality of the sound.” Today, he says, Rahman means as much to Sony as Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen or Celine Dion. Music collaborations While many of his collaborators believe that Rahman’s compositions have so much emotion that they don’t require lyrics to embellish them, Rahman himself says he imbibed the importance of language from Subhash Ghai who would say, “If you don’t learn the language, you cannot compose.” The two collaborated on Taal, arguably the biggest hit in Rahman’s Hindi film career. “Earlier, I used to think that my music would survive anywhere... but after his advice, I started learning Hindi, reading couplets and poems in Urdu.” It introduced him to the history of Hindi film music. Coming from the South, he says his knowledge was limited to a few soundtracks. “Then I discovered Naushad, Madan Mohan, Hridaynath Mangeshkar, S.D. Burman... it was amazing.” Looking back, Shekhar Kapur, who collaborated with Rahman on Elizabeth, says that traditionally, in Indian songs, you would say “here are the lyrics, here is the tune, and here is the orchestration to it. But in a Rahman number, they are all tightly knit together. That he has mastery over all of it was very new to us.” Ram Gopal Varma, who introduced Rahman to Hindi films with Rangeela, recalls that Rahman didn’t have “creative arrogance.” “He would never ever defend something he made. If for some reason the director didn’t like the tune, he would make another tune, but never defend or explain it, which is fascinating.” Unconventional Ashutosh Gowarikar feels that Rahman, at heart, is very commercial in his likes and dislikes. “But in his mind, he wants to create a new kind of sound; may be a new deviation within the melodic track, and that’s unusual.” He cites the example of Swades, where Rahman used shehnai to a mesmerising effect in the climax. “The idea was to show how Mohan Bhargav (the main character played by Shah Rukh Khan) is once again wedded to the country, and a marriage is incomplete without the shehnai. But never in my imagination did I think that he would use the shehnai in this manner — he used it as a refrain and created such an emotional track out of it.” On Rahman singing ‘Ye jo des hai tera’, Gowarikar says, there’s a soulful quality to his voice that adds another dimension to the songs he renders. Varma says Rahman expands the horizons for the filmmaker; and recalls how using his voice for Aamir Khan in ‘Mangta hai kya’ was “pathbreaking”. “Aamir felt that people would laugh as they were used to Udit Narayan as his playback but Rahman completely destroyed the concept of one singer singing for an actor. The unconventional approach challenges the director to think differently about song picturisation and choreography.” Kapur describes Rahman as “pretty international”. “He understands the resonance of sarod as much as that of an aboriginal instrument. He understands Indian ragas but has also studied Western classical. To say that he has combined Eastern compositions with Western technology actually belittles his ability. It’s far more than that.” Commenting on the longevity of Rahman as a global musician, Danny Boyle points out that one of the curses of being a song composer in the West is that no matter how skilled your work is, it’s often unacknowledged. “Normally, the public doesn’t really notice it. But Rahman is so gifted that he does that job as well as gives you tunes that, like great pop tunes and musical motifs, you carry with you.” On his spiritual side giving strength to his music, Kapur says it is like when Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel because he believed he got his strength from his spiritual and religious beliefs. “With Rahman, I feel, it is more religious. If that is what works for him, then god be with him, because wherever it comes from, it is amazing.”  ( Rahman Music Sheets is available on YouTube   channel O2india.)   While many of his collaborators feel that Rahman’s compositions have so much emotion that they do not require lyrics to embellish them, Rahman says he imbibed the importance of language from Subhash Ghai||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/understanding-rahman/article36130327.ece

27 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||DU comes under fire for dropping texts by Dalit writers||The Delhi University’s decision to drop texts by two Dalit authors Bama and Sukirtharini — “Sangat” and “Debt” respectively — from the English syllabus has come under severe criticism from several quarters. The translated texts were part of the new syllabus that came into force in 2019 and were supposed to be taught to the current batch of third-year students for the first time, several DU professors said. Additionally, Mahasweta Devi’s “Draupadi” which has been taught at the university since 1999, according to professors, was also dropped from the syllabus by the varsity. Due deliberations Countering the backlash, DU in a statement on Thursday said that the empowered Oversight Committee “after due deliberations with recommendations of the Head, Department of English, finalised the syllabus”. The varsity also maintained that the present syllabus was “inclusive” in nature and that it included “pioneering works of various renowned scholars of both national and international fame without consideration of their religion, caste and creed.” ‘Move disappointing’ Following the university’s decision to drop the texts at an Academic Council (AC) meeting held on Tuesday, despite 15 elected members marking their dissent, several professors said that the move was “disappointing and shocking.” Mithuraaj Dhusiya, an AC member who marked his dissent said, “There was no proper discussion regarding this. The Oversight Committee had members who did not have any expertise on the English syllabi. The English Department Head was a special invitee which meant that there were no rights to vote or dissent. The manner in which it was passed is shocking and disappointing. Why were only certain authors and certain texts dropped?” Rudrashish Chakroborty, professor at Kirori Mal College said, “The Oversight Committee is guilty of not only undermining the laid down academic processes of the university, they have also abdicated their responsibility towards the students by delaying the notification of the syllabus in every semester. It is unbecoming of a university having stature like DU to notify the syllabus five weeks after the commencement of the semester. The fact that students/teachers don’t know which texts to study/teach speak volumes about the academic apathy and the irresponsibility of the Oversight Committee towards the teaching-learning process. Coupled with this is the overreach of the arbitrary addition/deletion of texts without the consent of the Committee of Courses — the only statutory body to frame the syllabus.” Senior DU professors closely associated with the matter said that the two texts by the Dalit writers were a part of the draft revised syllabus which came into effect in 2019. Mahasweta Devi’s work “The current batch of third-year students would have been the first to be taught these two texts. However, in the recommendations sent by the OC, these two texts were dropped and it was eventually passed in Tuesday’s AC meeting. Dropping of Mahasweta Devi’s “Draupadi” was an afterthought,” said a senior DU professor. M.K. Pandit, the Chairperson of the Oversight Committee, however said that “Draupadi” was dropped as a “large majority had a different view”. “The OC is an empowered committee and comprises senior academics and deans. What “overreach” is there? I am an academic and I do not know if someone is a Dalit or a non-Dalit writer and such aspects were not kept in mind. I am only aware of Mahasweta Devi’s text which was dropped as many felt that there were details in the text which was not conducive to cater to all sections of society who come to DU. Students come from different backgrounds and their sensibilities might not be the same,” said Mr. Pandit. The statement issued by the varsity also added, “The university subscribes to the idea that the literary content forming part of the text in a language course of study should contain materials which do not hurt the sentiments of any individual and is inclusive in nature to portray a true picture of our society, both past and present.” The dissent note moved by 15 of the AC members read, “It is unfortunate that the Oversight Committee has always shown prejudice against the representation of Dalits, tribals, women and sexual minorities as evident in its concerted efforts to remove all such voices from the syllabus. This is particularly evident in the committee’s insistence to forcefully excise the authors like Mahasweta Devi, Bama and Sukartharini who represent Dalit, tribal and other marginal voices.” Political pressure Three AC members who had marked their dissent termed the university’s statement as “false and misleading”. “The claim of the press release is utterly false and misleading: the Oversight Committee was conspicuous by its undemocratic decision-making of issuing fiats to the English department without giving any academic rationale. In fact, the Oversight Committee has undermined the collective efforts and the democratic processes undertaken by the Department of English in framing the syllabus through its subject committees mandated by the department GBM which then got ratified by the committee of courses. However the Oversight Committee, instead of examining the rationale of the texts included in the syllabus, merely pandered to the political pressures and vested interests,” the statement read. Further it added that, “…to use hurt sentiments as an excuse to delete texts is a blatant attempt to impose thought control of the dominant and privileged social groups. By suggesting that the syllabus should merely uphold the status quo and not critique or question the same, the DU press release has actually undermined the very ethos of a university.” (More reports on Page 10)  The Oversight Committee had members who did not have any expertise on the English syllabi.

27 August 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Punjab govt. to give incentives to industries for using stubble||In an effort to check stubble burning menace during the paddy season, the Punjab govenment has decided to permit certain categories of industries to install paddy-straw-fired boilers to claim fiscal incentives. The decision was taken at a Cabinet meeting, chaired by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday. The Cabinet also decided to provide cumulative fiscal incentives of Rs. 25 crore to the first 50 existing industries on ‘first come first serve’ basis for using paddy straw as fuel in boilers, said an official statement. The industries that can get this benefit include sugar mills, pulp and paper mills among others. The Cabinet also approved non-fiscal incentives to industries in terms of availability of ‘Panchayat’ land for storage of paddy straw with lease agreement upto 33 years. Apart from this, balers would be made available on priority in areas where paddy straw is used as fuel in boilers, said the statement, adding that the move would help in tackling the menace of stubble burning during harvesting of Kharif crops, thus also conserving the fertility of soil and saving the beneficial micro-organisms. ‘Significant decision’ The statement said the decision assumes significance in view of the challenge of managing crop residue. “Post harvesting, while the wheat straw is used as fodder for the livestock, paddy straw in the fields is set on fire by the farmers to quickly clear their fields for next crop. Due to field fire incidents during the month of October-November, the problem of air pollution is widely prevalent in and around the rural area, causing major health effects,” it said. “Due to the climatic conditions, the air quality in the national capital region also deteriorates, with contribution from various local sources such as domestic, vehicular, industrial and municipal solid waste dump fires. However, farm fires in the neighbouring States is also blamed for air pollution in the NCR. Paddy is cultivated in 31.49 lakh hectare area (2020) in Punjab, resulting in the generation of about 20 million tons of paddy straw,” the statement added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/punjab-govt-to-give-incentives-to-industries-for-using-stubble/article36130571.ece
27 August 2021||NEW DELHI,||Drunk man fires at another in suspected ‘road rage’ case||In a suspected case of road rage, a man who was with his friends in a vehicle was shot at by another man driving another car in Delhi Cantonment area, the police said on Thursday. The accused has been arrested. The police said that the victim has been identified as Sandeep Bhati who is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Noida and is stated to be out of danger. The accused has been identified as Nitin, a resident of Kalkaji whose mother is posted in Delhi Police’s South district. He was heavily drunk at the time of the incident. “He was so drunk that he didn’t remember that he had shot at someone,” a police officer said.  A PCR call was received at 5 a.m. on Wednesday by Mr. Bhati’s friend who informed the police about the incident and the injury. When the police reached, victim’s friends Gaurav and Vipin told them that the three of them were returning from Kholi Baba Dham/Mandir Bhiwadi in Mr Bhati’s car. When they were near the airport, they noticed a blue-coloured car whose head lights were switched off. “Sensing fear, they accelerated their vehicle but the driver of the blue car followed them and when they reached RTR Marg in front of Western Air Command Gate, the driver of the car fired at them,” the officer said. The bullet hit the rear glass of the victim’s car and then hit Sandeep’s head. They tried to stop the blue car but the accused managed to flee the spot after hitting their car. Mr Bhati is still in the ICU, the police said. “During the course of investigation, CCTV cameras installed along Delhi-Gurgaon border to Kalkaji were checked which helped in the identification of the offending car. Based on technical surveillance, the accused Nitin was arrested,” the officer said. Another accident It was revealed that the accused was drunk at the time of the incident and could not recall the sequence of events. However, the police suspect that he fired in a fit of rage when he got annoyed because he could not overtake the victim’s vehicle despite honking. The police said that the accused also committed an accident at Kalkaji in which his car got damaged. The police then managed to find the offending vehicle from a workshop in Okhla. The vehicle has been seized.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/drunk-man-fires-at-another-in-suspected-road-rage-case/article36130579.ece
27 August 2021||JAIPUR,||Sambhar Lake needs faster restoration, says expert study||The world famous Sambhar Salt Lake in Rajasthan, which is constantly shrinking with the degradation of soil and water quality and a decline in the population of migratory birds, needs a faster restoration for conservation of its wetland and salt brine worth $300 million, an expert study on the lake’s ecology has said. The lake, situated 80 km south-west of Jaipur, is the country’s largest inland saline water body which attracts thousands of migratory birds every year. The death of more than 20,000 birds belonging to about 10 species which migrate annually to the lake had made international headlines in 2019. The birds foraging in the Sambhar marshlands had died due to avian botulism. The study, undertaken by a research team of the Central University of Rajasthan’s School of Earth Sciences, has recommended an urgent action to restore the lake’s ecosystem for protecting the birds and biodiversity as well as the salt production. ‘Mining menace’ Laxmi Kant Sharma, associate professor in the Department of Environmental Science, who led the research, told The Hindu on Tuesday that 30% of the Sambhar Lake’s area had been lost to mining and other activities, including the illegal salt pan encroachments. It has also threatened the livelihoods of local people who have always lived in harmony with the lake and its ecology. The study team conducted geospatial modelling for 96 years, from 1963 to 2059, at a decadal scale with the integration of ground data on birds, soil and water. The satellite images were classified to cover Aravalli hills, barren land, saline soil, salt crust, salt pans, wetland, settlement and vegetation. Dr. Sharma said while the past trends showed a reduction of wetland from 30.7% to 3.4% at a constant rate with its conversion into saline soil, which increased by 9.3%, the future predictions had depicted a loss of 40% of wetland and 120% of saline soil and net increase of 30% vegetation, 40% settlement, 10% salt pan and 5% barren land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sambhar-lake-needs-faster-restoration-says-expert-study/article36130565.ece
27 August 2021||Guwahati,||College girl’s murder reaches Assam Cabinet||An unusual issue topped the weekly Assam Cabinet meeting on Thursday – the murder of a college girl by her estranged boyfriend. A few decisions such as tackling the impact of climate change, removing the bottlenecks in the implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission and reopening higher secondary to postgraduate classes from September 1 were taken at the meeting headed by Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. But the hacking of Nandita Saikia, a student of a three-year degree course at the Moridhal College in northeastern Assam’s Dhemaji by a non-teaching employee of the college a few days ago took much of the meeting space. Expressing deep condolence, the Cabinet directed Special Director General of Police G.P. Singh to fast-track the probe to ensure the culprit is given exemplary punishment. Rintu Sarma, the non-teaching employee, attacked Ms. Saikia with a machete on August 21. Two others were also injured in the attack. Ms. Saikia was admitted to a private hospital in Dibrugarh and she died of her injuries on the head on Wednesday night. The accused was arrested on the day of the incident. Demands for capital punishment for the accused have since increased in intensity. “Anguished to learn about the demise of Nandita Saikia who was undergoing treatment after a heinous attack on her. In this hour of grief, I stand in solidarity with her family members,” Agriculture Minister Atul Bora said. ‘Anguished by the act’ Rajya Sabha member Ajit Kumar Bhuyan wrote, “I extend my heartfelt condolences to the family of Nandita Saikia... Anguished by the act of the perpetrator; urge the administration to take necessary steps to provide exemplary punishment to the accused.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/college-girls-murder-reaches-assam-cabinet/article36130567.ece

A Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh refused to accept the submission of the petitioner’s counsel that resources of the State remained unutilised due to the exclusive reservation of facilities for COVID-19 treatment of government officials and their families. The HC passed the order on a plea by Delhi-based doctor Kaushal Kant Mishra who argued that creating a classification in favour of a certain category of persons was “arbitrary” and “unimaginable” when the common man was running from pillar to post in search of oxygen beds. As per the Delhi government’s April 27 notice, 70 rooms at Hotel Ginger at Vivek Vihar; 50 rooms at Hotel Park Plaza in Shahdara, and 50 rooms at Hotel Leela Ambience at CBD Ground in Karkardooma, linked to Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital; and all the rooms in Hotel Golden Tulip at Hari Nagar, linked to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, are reserved for the treatment of officers/officials of Delhi government, autonomous bodies, corporations, local bodies and their families.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/covid-plea-against-reserving-hotels-for-govt-officials-rejected/article36130574.ece
27 August 2021||GUWAHATI,||Couple showers savings on ‘life-changing’ school||An Assam couple has showered their savings on a school that changed their lives. S.M. Firoj Laskar had studied at the State-run 1017 Dakshin Mohanpur L.P. School in southern Assam’s Cachar district. He is now a cluster resource centre coordinator under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. His wife Lakhi Laskar is not a past pupil of the school in a remote part of the district. But she happens to be its headmistress. The connection had given a message to Mr. Laskar — that he should give back to the school that moulded him into what he is today. It helped that his wife was attached to the school that has helped augment the family income. The couple started by giving the school kitchen a new, hygienic look, followed by a rainwater harvesting and water conservation system around a hand-pump on the premises. More than a week ago, they set up a street library on the boundary wall of the school designed to cater to the children as well as any passer-by interested in reading. They donated some of their books and bought a few that children would find attractive enough to read. Cachar’s Deputy Commissioner Keerthi Jalli said, “It is very rare for government officials to spend money out of their own pocket for some public good. The fact that Firoj Laskar goes out of his way to spend money on innovative things for the school is highly appreciable”. Meeting with DC Mr. Laskar got in touch with her in April to know about the Jal Surakshar Prokolpo (water conservation project) she had initiated as the Deputy Commissioner of the adjoining Hailakandi district earlier, she noted.

The AIKS demanded withdrawal of the amendments and threatened to launch an agitation in case its demand was not met. Inderjit Singh, vice-president, AIKS, Haryana, said that some important pro-farmer provisions were made as a result of prolonged struggle of farmers in the Land Acquisition Act, 2013. He said the anti-farmer, anti-people and pro-corporate provisions have now been added to the legislation by the Haryana Assembly through backdoor, adding that “this was a treachery by the BJP-JJP alliance government with the farmers”. “As a result of these amendments, now acquisition of land has been made easy as the willingness of minimum 70% of the farmers has been removed. Even the construction of houses on the farms can be demolished with an executive order at the time of land acquisition,” said Mr. Singh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/farmers-outfit-condemns-changes-to-land-act-2013/article36130575.ece
27 August 2021||New Delhi,||HC raps North body for delay in salary payment||The Delhi High Court on Thursday took North Delhi Municipal Corporation to task for delay in payment of salaries and pensions to staffers and warned it of ordering attachment of its assets and sale of properties. The court also noted that the issue of whether the hospitals of North body have to be handed over for management to the Centre or the Delhi government, as it is facing financial issues, has still not been considered by the civic body. A Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said the corporation is not showing any sense of urgency which the issue demands and added that from now, it will not tolerate any delay in payment of salaries and pensions to the employees and retired staffers. Six hospitals The High Court had earlier directed the North body to take a decision on the issue whether its six hospitals should be handed over to the Central or Delhi government. Later, it was informed by Advocate Divya Prakash Pande, appearing for the civic body that the commissioner of the corporation took steps and the issue was pending before the corporators. Ms. Pande said the proposal was earlier rejected by the House. ‘Can’t have both ways’ To this, the Bench said the corporation can’t have both ways that it will keep on insisting to retain the hospitals which could not generate any revenue but are source of expenditure for it and it will then say that it is running short of funds to pay salaries and pensions. “Henceforth, whenever you will say you don’t have funds, we know what we have to do. From next time, we are going to attach your properties and will start with attaching your commissioner’s office,” the Bench said. The court was informed by the North body counsel that pensions have been paid till June and salaries have been paid till July.
