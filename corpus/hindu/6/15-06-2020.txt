15 June 2020||Chennai,||India’s rise in cases third fastest globally||With 11,220 new COVID-19 cases and 325 deaths registered on Sunday, the total number of infections and the death toll in India reached 3,32,777 and 9,521 respectively. This data was based on reports from State Health Departments and collated by The Hindu . The recovery rate was nearly 51%. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the total number of samples tested on Sunday was 1,51,432, up from 1,43,737 on Saturday. Maharashtra led the tally with 3,390 new cases and 120 deaths. Delhi registered 2,224 cases and 56 deaths. India now ranks third, behind Brazil and the U.S. in the daily increase in COVID-19 cases (7-day rolling average) across the world. In the number of deaths registered every day, India ranks fourth below Brazil, the U.S. and Mexico. It again ranks fourth in terms of total number of cases behind the U.S. (with nearly 2.1 million), Brazil (8,50,514) and Russia (5,28,267) and ninth in total fatalities, according to the Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 tracker. Fewer tests While India's infection rate in terms of cases per million people was much lower, the country has conducted fewer tests per million (3,000) than others with the most infections, according to data maintained by the website Our World in Data. The comparable testing rates for the U.S., Russia and the U.K. are 70,000, 99,870 and 55,860 respectively. Brazil’s testing data was not available.

15 June 2020||Jammu,||China has preferred talks: Rajnath||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Sunday that dialogue was under way to resolve the stand-off on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. “Military and diplomatic channels are open with China. China has also expressed desire to resolve the issue through a dialogue. We also believe that Indo-China tussle could be resolved through a dialogue at the military and the diplomatic levels,” Mr. Singh said addressing BJP leaders and workers in a virtual Jan Samvad . Referring to the Opposition’s criticism, Mr. Singh said the government would not keep the people or Parliament in the dark about the developments in Ladakh. “We will divulge the details at an appropriate time,” he said. He assured the people and the Opposition that “there will be no compromise with national pride”. “India is strong, not weak. We are augmenting the security of the country,” he said. ‘Will change J&K future’ Promising to initiate an “unprecedented development” process in the next five years in Jammu & Kashmir, Mr. Singh said people in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) would soon prefer India to Pakistan after watching the progress on this side. “Development is our priority. In the coming five years, we will change the future of J&K and PoK residents would envy it too,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/china-has-preferred-talks-rajnath/article31829722.ece
15 June 2020||New Delhi,||Testing to be ramped up in the Capital, says Amit Shah||Amid an exponential rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in Delhi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Sunday that testing would be ramped up in the next two days and polling booths would be used to test patients in containment zones. A house-to-house survey in containment zones was also planned. As on Saturday, there are 241 containment zones in Delhi, and more than 1,000 deaths due to the infection have been reported so far. Mr. Shah met Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Lieutenant-Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal, and Union Health Minister Harshvardhan on Sunday to discuss the COVID-19 strategy in Delhi. Soon after the meeting, Mr. Shah posted a series of tweets about the outcome. Telephonic guidance “To contain COVID-19 in Delhi, testing to increase two-fold in the next two days and will be further increased three times after six days. Also after a few days, testing will start at every polling station in containment zones,” Mr. Shah tweeted. He said to provide information and guidelines to small hospitals in Delhi, the Modi government had decided to constitute a committee of senior doctors for telephonic guidance in the AIIMS and a helpline number would be released on Monday. “A committee has been formed under chairmanship of Dr. V.K. Paul (of Niti Aayog) to provide 60% of dedicated COVID-19 beds in private hospitals at a low rate, the committee will submit its report tomorrow on private hospitals... Centre has assured the Delhi government of all necessary resources such as oxygen cylinders, ventilators, pulse oximeters to fight COVID-19,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/testing-to-be-ramped-up-in-the-capital-says-amit-shah/article31829917.ece
15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,||In the pandemic, the disabled remain an invisible minority||In Delhi's Wazirpur, two families are struggling each day to make it. Pulinder, 49, is paralysed due to an epileptic seizure. For the past two years, his wife, Asha Devi, has been supporting the family. They have a son, who has an undiagnosed ailment that leaves him weak now and then. Ms. Asha Devi wipes a tear and says, “Where should I go now? Should I buy food or medicines?” Ms. Asha Devi works in a steel line. Post the lockdown, the families have got absolutely no support from the government or from their employer. She has not received wages from the steel line she works at, and Mr. Pulinder has not been able to access proper medication for his condition. Another woman who is a product of deprivation on account of both disability and class is Naznin. Her husband, Sajjaad, lost the use of his legs in an accident two years ago. He needs Ms. Naznin’s assistance for most of his tasks. She sighs in anguish and says, “How can I stand in long lines for ration when there is nobody to take care of him back home? I have three small children to support as well. Who should I ask for help?” According to a report by the National Centre for the Promotion of Employment for Disabled Persons (NCPEDP) — which includes results from a study of 1,067 people with disabilities (about 73% male, 27% female) — over 73% of those surveyed faced serious difficulties due to the lockdown. Locked out For many like Mr. Pulinder and Mr. Sajjaad, living with disabilities has been more of a task post-lockdown because of governmental negligence, combined with inaccessibility to healthcare and rewarding employment. A large class divide has become increasingly visible in the lockdown. According to professional psychologists, individuals with disability and their families are at a greater risk of poor health and quality of life outcomes because either their social status is affected by their disabilities or their disabilities are made worse by the inaccessibility that comes with social status. Lower income levels have been consistently correlated with poor health and inferior quality of life.

15 June 2020||VIJAYAWADA,||42% of total COVID-19 cases reported during Unlock-1||Three months after the first COVID-19 case was reported on March 12, the State on Sunday witnessed many firsts, which indicated how rapidly the cases were spiking. As a matter of fact, 42% of the total 6,152 cases were reported during the past 14 days, that is since ‘Unlock 1’ came into effect from June 1, bringing near normalcy in the areas outside the containment zones. As per the bulletins issued by the Health Department from June 1 to 14, as many as 2,581 cases were reported. In May, when lockdown restrictions were partially eased, as many as 2,168 cases (35.24%) were reported. In April, 1,359 cases (22.09%) were registered. In March, only 44 cases (0.71%) were reported. The pace of spike in local transmissions is also high. Of the total 4,841 local cases, 1,799 were reported in June so far. A total of 1,639 were reported in May. All the cases in April and March were considered local cases as there was no influx of migrants from other States and abroad. The remaining cases were of foreign returnees (204) and migrant returnees and other State people (1,107). The detection of 294 new cases in the past 24 hours ending Sunday morning was the biggest single-day spike, which pushed the tally to 6,152. Of them, 253 were of locals. The remaining were of foreign returnees (2) and people from other States (39). The death toll had gone up to 84 with two fatalities reported in Kurnool and East Godavari.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/42-of-total-covid-19-cases-reported-during-unlock-1/article31829733.ece
15 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||ICMR study plots mid-Nov. peak||The peak stage of COVID-19 in India has been delayed by the eight-week lockdown along with strengthened public health measures, and it may now arrive around mid-November when a paucity of isolation and ICU beds and ventilators can arise, a study says. The study, conducted by researchers from an Operations Research Group constituted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the lockdown shifted the peak by an estimated 34 days to 76 days and helped bring down the number of infections by between 69% and 97%, allowing time to shore up resources and health infrastructure. In a scenario of intensified public health measures with 60% effectiveness after the lockdown, the demand for treatment facilities can be met until the first week of November. Thereafter, isolation beds could be inadequate for 5.4 months, ICU beds for 4.6 months and ventilators for 3.9 months, projections by the researchers showed. However, this shortfall is estimated to be 83% less than what it could have been without the lockdown and public health measures. With sustained measures to increase the infrastructure and the varying pace of the epidemic in different regions, the impact of the unmet need can be reduced. If the coverage of healthcare measures can be increased to 80%, the epidemic can be mitigated.  In a scenario of intensified public health measures with 60% effectiveness after the lockdown, the demand for treatment facilities can be met until the first week of November||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/icmr-study-plots-mid-nov-peak/article31829734.ece
15 June 2020||Mumbai,||Local trains back on track for essential service workers today||Local trains for essential service workers like health, civic and police personnel will start from Monday morning, following a decision taken late at night after a series of meetings between railway and State government officials on Sunday. Western Railway (WR) will run 120 services from Virar to Churchgate, while Central Railway (CR) will run 200 services. On WR, services will run at 15-minute intervals between 5..30 a.m. and 11.30 p.m. On CR, trains will only halt at fast service stations and will depart from Panvel, Kasara, Karjat, Kalyan and Thane. Ticket windows will be opened for commuters, but passes will be issued only to those who can furnish a government ID card. Earlier in the day, railway officials met representatives of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the Mumbai Police to work out protocols. Motormen had been asked to stay ready to resume services and use N95 masks that had been provided to them earlier. Another safety kit will soon be provided. The RPF is also being redeployed across stations to manage crowds and 150 additional staff from the Maharashtra Security Force have also been requisitioned. The Government Railway Police has also asked all its staff to hold discussions on crowd control with their RPF counterparts. Railway officials said they had shared their plan with the BMC, which included having QR code-based passes for essential staff. But civic officials thought it would be difficult to implement in a short period. Work is under way to put in place a system to this effect. A key point discussed during the meetings was whether to allow essential staff working in the private sector to use the services. The Railway Board has allowed private health care workers to avail of the services.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/local-trains-back-on-track-for-essential-service-workers-today/article31830167.ece
15 June 2020||Bengaluru,||BBMP to test people in markets, eateries, and medical shops||The silent spread of COVID-19 through asymptomatic patients has caught many cities unawares. In an attempt to pre-empt this and to get a clearer idea about the spread of the virus in the city, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) plans to test people visiting public spaces, such as markets, malls, restaurants, supermarkets, and medical establishments. When compared to other cities in India, the number of positive cases in Bengaluru [currently at 690] is relatively low and the BBMP aims to keep it that way. The civic body has developed a new strategy called ‘anti-contact tracing’ to uncover new clusters where the virus may be spreading quietly. Officials plan to combine samples from crowded places with those taken from people’s homes. The BBMP developed this approach with their data analysis team, which includes experts from the Indian Institute of Science. Hephsiba Rani Korlapati, special officer, BBMP COVID-19 war room, said that this approach aims to identify clusters quickly. “People are infected days before they develop symptoms. So our approach is to have an adaptive strategy, which also factors in time. Our plan is to not wait but to test quickly,” she said on Sunday. While contact tracing depends on quickly tracing and isolating all primary and secondary contacts of a positive patient, officials say that ‘anti-contact tracing’ requires more exploratory testing as it involves hunting for new clusters. B.H. Anil Kumar, BBMP Commissioner, told The Hindu that they will focus on those who have come into contact with a large number of people. “The focus will be on places which have a large footfall,” he said. Explaining the difference between randomised testing and anti-contact tracing, Mr. Anil Kumar said, “We do randomised testing in containment zones where there is a high probability of people being infected. We do this to see if there is a community spread and ensure that people who are tested positive are shifted. In this case, samples will be drawn from people who visit places with high footfall. This will help us identify new hotspots or clusters”. The civic body decided to adopt this strategy after they were unable to identify the source of transmission of a few Influenza-Like Illnesses cases. “We will soon evolve the protocol of how and from whom the samples will be drawn,” Mr. Anil Kumar added. Through anti-contact tracing, the BBMP will help collect samples from a cross-section of different households/locations and “combine them intelligently” to discover new clusters. “This will help design better algorithms to pool samples into groups. Some of the other guidelines for this testing is to skip collecting samples from neighbouring houses and sample adaptively,” Ms. Korlapati added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bbmp-to-test-people-in-markets-eateries-and-medical-shops/article31829763.ece
15 June 2020||CHANDIGARH,||Squeezed — Punjab, Haryana in space jam||Over five decades of living together have not made Punjab and Haryana happy neighbours, especially on the issue of sharing space in the erstwhile Punjab Assembly building. Since Haryana was formed in 1966, the two States have been sharing space in the building for their Secretariats and Assemblies. The space crunch has forced Haryana Speaker Gian Chand Gupta to write to Punjab Governor-cum-Chandigarh Administrator V.P. Singh Badnore seeking more space. The letter comes days after Punjab Speaker Rana K.P. Singh made it clear that the State did not have any surplus area to spare. “The Governor has assured me that he will constitute a committee to look into the matter,” Mr. Gupta told The Hindu . “As per our records, 20 rooms, which had been designated for Haryana, have not been given to us... We should have got a 40% share of space in the building under the Punjab Reorganisation Act, but got only 27% so far,” he said. In his June 2 letter to the Governor, Mr. Gupta said the additional rooms under the control of the Punjab Assembly Secretariat are not being put to any constructive use and are only being used as stores. The 64,430 sq ft building was trifurcated in 1966 — 24,630 sq ft for Haryana, 30,890 sq ft for the Punjab Vidhan Sabha and 10,910 sq ft for the Punjab Vidhan Parishad, which ironically does not exist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/squeezed-punjab-haryana-in-space-jam/article31829727.ece
15 June 2020||VIJAYAWADA,||8 Intermediate students ‘end’ life||The State witnessed eight suicides, all by students of the Intermediate course, the results of which were declared on Friday. The reasons cited were failure or low marks in the examinations. Omprakash Reddy (16), a first year student in Tirupati, took the extreme step on Saturday at his grandfather’s house at T. Putlavandlapalli village in Anantapur district. He was reportedly upset over his poor performance in the examination. Haripriya Reddy (18), a second year student and a resident of Ayyuru in Nandyal in Kurnool district, took her life unable to digest the fact that she had failed in mathematics by one mark. Rangala Pavani (18), a native of Rajampet in Kadapa district and a second year student, resorted to the extreme step on Saturday for securing poor marks. Upset over the fact that he failed in three subjects, Ravi Kumar (17) from Kala Nagar in Visakhapatnam took the extreme step. Two suicides were reported from Prakasam district. A 17-year-old girl studying in first year at Addanki committed suicide at her house at Mallavaram village, near Maddipadu, in the early hours of Sunday. The police said she was upset over her failure. At K. Thakkelapadu near N.G. Padu, a 19-year-old girl ended her life after she failed in the examination. Dusi Swarnalatha, a resident of Indiranagar near Palakonda in Srikakulam district, who was upset over her failure in two subjects, took the extreme step after her parents went to the fields for work. Poor show in the examination reportedly prompted Mounika, a second year student from Palamaneru in Chittoor district, to resort to the extreme step.

A panel with Secretaries of Public Works and Highways departments is zeroing in on buildings and spaces that can be converted into COVID-19 health or care centres. COVID-19 patients are treated in four categories of facilities — severe cases need hospitalisation, moderate cases are admitted to health centres, mild cases are housed at care centres and asymptomatic cases remain in home quarantine. “Our figures so far have shown us that about 10% of the total active patients need hospitalisation, some 20% need health centres, another 50% need care centres and the remaining can be put under home quarantine,” a senior official said. While the government is augmenting beds in hospitals, facilities for 70% of the patients have to be arranged too, as they form a majority of positive cases, he contended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tn-govt-begins-identifying-places-to-set-up-covid-19-care-centres/article31829828.ece
15 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||ICMR study plots mid-November peak||The peak stage of COVID-19 in India has been delayed by the eight-week lockdown along with strengthened public health measures, and it may now arrive around mid-November when a paucity of isolation and ICU beds and ventilators can arise, a study says. Delayed by lockdown The study, conducted by researchers from an Operations Research Group constituted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the lockdown shifted the peak by an estimated 34 days to 76 days and helped bring down the number of infections by between 69% and 97%, allowing time to shore up resources and health infrastructure. In a scenario of intensified public health measures with 60% effectiveness after the lockdown, the demand for treatment facilities can be met until the first week of November.

With sustained measures to increase the infrastructure and the varying pace of the epidemic in different regions, the impact of the unmet need can be reduced. If the coverage of healthcare measures can be increased to 80%, the epidemic can be mitigated. According to the model-based analysis for the pandemic in India, with the additional capacity built for testing, treating and isolating patients during the lockdown, the number of cases at the peak could come down by 70% and the cumulative cases may drop by nearly 27%. As for mortality, approximately 60% deaths were prevented and one-third of this mortality prevention is attributed to the reduction in the unmet need for critical care as a result of the intervention, the analysis showed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/icmr-study-plots-mid-november-peak/article31829916.ece

15 June 2020||New Delhi,||Testing to be ramped up in Delhi: Shah||Amid an exponential rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in Delhi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Sunday that testing would be ramped up in the next two days and polling booths would be used to test patients in containment zones. A house-to-house survey in containment zones was also planned. As on Saturday, there are 241 containment zones in Delhi, and more than 1,000 deaths due to the infection have been reported so far. Mr. Shah met Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal, and Union Health Minister Harshvardhan on Sunday to discuss the COVID-19 strategy in Delhi. Soon after the meeting, Mr. Shah posted a series of tweets about the outcome. “To contain COVID-19 in Delhi, testing to increase two-fold in the next two days and will be further increased three times after six days. Also after a few days, testing will start at every polling station in containment zones,” Mr. Shah tweeted. Telephonic guidance He said to provide information and guidelines to small hospitals in Delhi, the Modi government had decided to constitute a committee of senior doctors for telephonic guidance in the AIIMS and a helpline number would be released on Monday. “A committee has been formed under chairmanship of Dr. V.K Paul (of Niti Aayog) to provide 60% of dedicated COVID-19 beds in private hospitals at a low rate, the committee will submit its report tomorrow on private hospitals...Centre has assured the Delhi government of all necessary resources such as oxygen cylinders, ventilators, pulse oximeters to fight COVID-19,” he said. Comprehensive survey He added that a comprehensive health survey would be done after visiting each household in containment zones and the report would be submitted in a week. “For effective monitoring, each person will be made to download Aarogya Setu App,” he said. A second round of meeting with Mayors of Delhi and municipal chiefs is expected at 5 p.m. on Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/testing-to-be-ramped-up-in-delhi-shah/article31829703.ece

15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,||3 States yet to reply on labour law changes||More than a month after the Parliamentary Committee on Labour wrote to eight State governments seeking explanation on the changes brought to the labour laws during the extended lockdown, three BJP-ruled States — Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh — have not responded, despite two reminders from the committee. The three States have effected the most significant changes, suspending the majority of the labour laws for a period of up to three years. The committee had sought details of the amendments made by them and also the instruments (executive order or ordinance) used to effect the change. A total of 13 State governments had diluted the labour laws in May, with eight of them raising the daily working hours from eight to 12. Asked if this amounted to undermining the Parliamentary Standing Committee, Labour Committee Chairperson and Biju Janata Dal MP Bhartruhari Mahtab said, “I can only say that their reply is awaited.” Tardy response Sources said the State governments had been tardy in responding, with Assam being the only one to send in its response within a week. The Rajasthan government replied only a few days back. Among other changes, it has amended the Industrial Disputes Act to increase the threshold of companies coming under the law from those employing 100 workers to those having 300 workers. Further, the meeting of the committee had to be cancelled twice after the officials at the Union Labour Ministry tested positive for COVID-19. It was first scheduled for June 5 and then rescheduled for June 17. But now it has been deferred and may be held on June 26. “More than 50% of the members are willing to attend the meeting in Parliament since we haven’t heard from the Speaker’s office to hold committee meetings via videoconferencing. Whenever we hold the meeting, this subject will be taken up,” Mr. Mahtab said. Explaining the changes made by U.P., M.P. and Gujarat governments, Tapan Sen, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said the amendments made by the three States pushed 80% of the workforce out of coverage of labour laws. “In these three States, barring the child labour laws and laws related to women working the night shift, most other laws have been suspended in the name of reform. The custodians of the law themselves want to throw the workers at the mercy of the employer,” Mr. Sen said. He added that under the changes, employers can hire and fire at will without paying necessary compensations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/3-states-yet-to-reply-on-labour-law-changes/article31829921.ece
15 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||India, China press ahead with aid||Amidst its own tensions with India and the month-long stand-off between India and China at the Line of Actual Control, Nepal Prime Minister K.P. Oli has decided not to accept medical teams from either New Delhi or Beijing, an official of the ruling Nepal Communist Party told The Hindu . As cases of coronavirus increase in countries across South Asia and some of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) countries, both India and China are pressing ahead with medical supplies, including medicines and protective gear, as well as offers of medical teams to be stationed there. Medical materials “Nepal is happy to welcome medical materials from our friends,” said Bishnu Rijal, Deputy Chief of the NCP’s Foreign Affairs department. “But our health professionals are capable to handle the pandemic. We need medical materials now, not medical practitioners,” he added. The decision comes on the heels of an offer of a PLA medical team that was made during a conversation between Mr. Oli and a Chinese Communist Party official, that The Hindu had reported on. In March, the Indian Army, which has a special relationship with the Nepali Army, had also offered to send a medical team to Nepal. However, the Nepal government decided it would be better not to accept either, especially after some criticism from the opposition Nepali Congress party over the possibility of Chinese military teams in Nepal. SAARC countries India and China have also made rival offers of aid in other parts of the region. With nearly 6,00,000 cases now, the eight SAARC countries (India, Pakistan, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan) account for about 7.5% of the world total of 7.9 million COVID-19 cases, and about 3% of global coronavirus deaths. According to its “Health Silk Road” initiative, China has sent 29 medical expert teams to 27 countries, including military medical teams to Pakistan, Laos and Myanmar, while India has intensified its offers in the SAARC region (minus Pakistan) and the IOR, deploying aid by Air India flights as well as by the Indian Naval Ship ‘Kesari’ and sending teams as well. Last week, a Chinese medical team flew into Dhaka to help train healthcare professionals in COVID-19 treatment. India has thus far sent medical teams to the Maldives, Mauritius, Comoros, and Kuwait, and the Army had prepared “Rapid Response Teams” (RRTs).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-china-press-ahead-with-aid/article31829716.ece
15 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||India looks to deploy Naval Liaisons||After joining the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC) as Observer in March, India is looking to post Navy Liaison Officers at the Regional Maritime Information Fusion Centre (RMIFC) in Madagascar and also at the European maritime surveillance initiative in the Strait of Hormuz for improved Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA). “We are working closely with France who is a pre-eminent member of IOC to post a Naval LO at the RMIFC in Madagascar. We are also working on posting a Naval LO at the European Maritime Awareness in the Strait of Hormuz (EMASOH) in Abu Dhabi,” said a defence source . “This will be in the overall realm of improving linkages of the Navy’s Information Fusion Centre for Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR) in Gurugram with other IFCs and become the repository for all maritime data in the IOR,” the source said. The RMFIC functions under the aegis of the IOC, of which India became an Observer in March 2020 along with Japan and the United Nations. The IOC is a regional forum in the Southwest Indian Ocean, comprising five nations — Comoros, France (Reunion), Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles. China and the European Union (EU) have been Observers in the IOC since 2016 and 2017, respectively. The Navy LO is expected to be posted at EMASOH by July and at the RMIFC by September or October, the source said. India has an LO at the IFC in Singapore for over four years now. Freedom of navigation The EMASOH headquarters is composed of Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and French officers and based at the French naval base in Abu Dhabi. The aim is “to monitor maritime activity and guarantee freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz.” On February 5, the initiative was declared operational by the French Ministry of Armed Forces. The Navy set up the IFC-IOR in December 2018 within the premises of the Information Management and Analysis Centre in Gurugram to track maritime movements in the region. France became the first country to deploy a LO at the IFC-IOR, followed by the U.S. and several other countries including Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom have announced their intention to post LOs. Currently, infrastructure is being built to house the officers. Pre-fabricated structures are being built and are expected to be ready by the end of the year, another source said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-looks-to-deploy-naval-liaisons/article31829693.ece
15 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC to extend virtual court system amid COVID-19 fears||A committee of seven Supreme Court judges, led by Justice N.V. Ramana, has decided to continue the virtual court system and not revert to the physical hearings, given the “alarming growth” in COVID-19 cases. A letter from the Supreme Court Registry to the office-bearers of the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association said the court “shall continue functioning through the virtual court system for the present, with further direction that the matters may be listed before hon’ble judge-in-chambers as well as before the court of the registrar, through virtual court system only, to enable wider participation of learned advocates”. The Registry informed the lawyers that the committee would next meet on June 30 or any other suitable date to again take stock of the situation. On June 2, the court agreed to explore the feasibility of physical appearances of advocates while adhering to physical distancing norms. It has been hearing urgent cases through video-conference. The court had named this mechanism the ‘virtual court system’. The Supreme Court Advocates-on Record Association, the Supreme Court Bar Association and the Bar Council of India have been repeatedly making representations that a majority of the lawyers feel that they cannot effectively present their arguments at virtual hearings. They have been calling for resumption of physical hearings from July.  The other members of the committee are Justices Arun Mishra, R.F. Nariman, U.U. Lalit, A.M. Khanwilkar, D.Y. Chandrachud, and L. Nageswara Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-to-extend-virtual-court-system-amid-covid-19-fears/article31829695.ece
15 June 2020||CHENNAI,||Forgotten in the fog of war, the last firing on the India-China border||The 1967 clash between India and China is often remembered as the last shot fired on the India-China border. That clash in Sikkim, where India got the better of China just five years after defeat in the 1962 war, saw more than 80 Indian soldiers killed while estimates say 400 Chinese soldiers may have been killed. 1967 clashes If it is true that 1967 marked the last major fighting that saw casualties on both sides, it was not, however, the last incident of a shot being fired on the contested boundary. That would happen eight years later, when a patrol of Assam Rifles jawans was ambushed by the Chinese at Tulung La in Arunachal Pradesh. Four were killed. “We often remember 1967, but to say that was the last firing, and that what happened eight years later was some sort of accident does not square with the facts,” said Nirupama Rao, a former Foreign Secretary and Ambassador to China. “It was an ambush, plain and simple, and four of ours lost their lives.” The Indian government maintained that the Chinese had crossed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and ambushed the patrol on October 20, 1975. The Chinese denied this and blamed India for the incident. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing accused the patrol of crossing the LAC and firing at a Chinese post. The Ministry handed a protest note on October 22 to the Charge d’Affaires of the Indian Embassy in Beijing describing China’s actions as “a self defence response”, according to a November 3 report in the French newspaper Le Monde , that was shared with The Hindu by Saurabh Vashist, a researcher on India-China relations. The report said India recovered their bodies a week later on October 28. U.S. cable A U.S. State Department cable from 1975 noted India’s view that the “Chinese ambush was sprung 500 metres south of Tulung La” and took place on Indian territory. It quoted a senior Indian military intelligence officer as saying on November 5 the border there was very clear, marked by a distinctive shale cliff. He said China had moved up a company to the pass and detached a platoon which erected stone walls on India’s side of the pass, and from there fired several hundred rounds at the patrol. Four of the patrol had gone into a leading position, while two others, who escaped, had stayed behind. The officer said the patrol was routine and had been in the area several times before. The cable noted that Tulung La was among the more remote passes in the region, a few dozen kilometres from Bum La and Tawang. It noted China had used the pass during the 1962 war as a channel to send its troops down to Bomdi La, to defeat the Indian resistance there to their offensive. “Although the Chinese appear to be following their policy of enforcing the status quo with respect to the LAC pending negotiations,” the cable concluded, “they apparently still lay claim to Arunachal Pradesh down to the foothills”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/forgotten-in-the-fog-of-war-the-last-firing-on-the-india-china-border/article31829707.ece

AICC general secretary Avinash Pande and Chhattisgarh Minister T.S. Singh Deo spoke to the MLAs separately. The legislators were first shifted to a resort on the outskirts of Jaipur and later to the hotel, amid allegations of horse-trading by the BJP. Special screening State Food and Civil Supplies Minister Ramesh Meena, who is considered close to the Sachin Pilot camp, distanced himself from the gathering. Despite several leaders having reportedly called him, Mr. Meena did not show up at the hotel even on Sunday. A special screening of the film Gandhi was held for the MLAs at the hotel during the day, while a cricket match between the teams of Congress and independent MLAs was organised in the evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-mlas-stay-put-at-jaipur-hotel-for-fourth-day/article31829709.ece
15 June 2020||HYDERABAD,||50,000 people to be tested in Hyderabad, adjoining districts||In a major policy decision to rebut the criticism from Opposition parties on the low testing for coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the State government has decided to conduct tests on 50,000 people in four districts in the next 10 days. The development comes as part of strengthening the vigilance in the State capital and districts abutting it for effectively tackling the spread of coronavirus. The government has accordingly decided to conduct tests in 30 Assembly constituencies in Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Vikarabad, Medchal-Malkajgiri and Sangareddy districts in the coming one week to 10 days. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who reviewed the situation arising out of the increasing number of coronavirus positive cases with senior officials on Sunday, took a decision to this effect. Private hospitals and laboratories would be engaged in conducting the tests in line with the norms of Indian Council for Medical Research and at prices fixed by the Central government for conducting tests. The Chief Minister said the State capital was among the highly populated metropolitan cities in the country and there was need for ensuring that the reputation of the city in maintaining public health should be maintained. Further, steps should be taken to ensure that people who tested positive, but without severe impact of the virus, should be kept in their respective houses and free treatment should be provided to all such patients undergoing home quarantine. The government had decided to conduct tests as a precautionary measure and there was no need for concern. The government was prepared to treat any number of people testing positive. “The government is working with total commitment and alertness to see that treatment is provided to all the required,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/50000-people-to-be-tested-in-hyderabad-adjoining-districts/article31829771.ece
15 June 2020||Shivamogga,||Row over monkey park plan||The State government’s plan to establish a monkey park, on the uninhabited islands in the Sharavathi backwaters region, has been opposed by environmentalists. Following a spike in the cases of monkeys raiding agricultural and plantation crops in Malnad region in recent times, the farmers had staged several protests demanding that the State government address the problem. As a solution to the menace, the State government took a decision to establish the park and in the 2020-21 budget, Rs. 6.25 crore was allocated for the purpose. Initially, it was planned to establish the park on 150 acres of government land near Nagodi village under Nittur Gram Panchayat limits in Hosanagar taluk. Fearing that the project may trigger an outbreak of diseases like the Kyasanur Forest Disease (monkey fever), the residents there had opposed the project. The Nittur GP had also passed a resolution against the project. Following this, the State government has now planned to shift the project to the uninhabited islands in Sharavathi river backwaters region. Delegation’s visit A delegation, comprising senior officials of the Forest and the Revenue Departments, visited three such islands near the Talakalale reservoir, a balancing reservoir of the Linganamakki dam on May 16. Confirming this, Nagaraj L., Assistant Commissioner of Sagar sub-division, told The Hindu that a search for a suitable place is being conducted. It may be mentioned here that in Himachal Pradesh, there are state-of-the-art monkey sterilisation and rehabilitation centres to address the monkey menace. The State government had planned to establish the monkey park here on the same model. A delegation of officials of Forest and Revenue departments was supposed to visit H.P. to study the functioning of the centres, but owing to the lockdown, the tour was postponed. ‘Ecological imbalance’ Expressing ire against the move to establish the monkey park, Ajaykumar Sharma, an environmentalist, told The Hindu that the islands in the Sharavathi backwaters region are rich in bio-diversity and translocating monkeys there might trigger an ecological imbalance. He expressed regret that without studying the impact, of the translocation of the primates, on the fauna endemic to the islands and vice-versa, the State government was trying to implement the project in haste. Mr. Sharma said that the unabated destruction of forests in the name of development resulted in monkeys and other wild animals raiding agricultural lands for food. “A monkey park is not the solution. The human-monkey conflict can be addressed by conserving the forests and by planting fruit-bearing trees on the forest fringes,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/row-over-monkey-park-plan/article31829684.ece
15 June 2020||New Delhi,||Mamata flays draft Electricity Bill, seeks Opposition support||West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee has written to the Chief Ministers of the States ruled by the Congress and other Opposition parties over the draft Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020. Sources said she had sent copies of her letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the Chief Ministers of Punjab, Puducherry, Kerala, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Delhi, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. She had also written to DMK president M.K. Stalin and JD(S) leader H.D. Deve Gowda. She called the draft Bill a violation of “the spirit of co-operative federalism” and accused the Centre of failure to consult the States on the Bill since electricity is on the Concurrent List. One of the sweeping changes proposed in the Bill is an end to subsidies. All consumers, including farmers, will have to pay the tariff, and the subsidy will be sent to them through direct benefit transfer. Ms. Banerjee argued in her letter that this would mean people would have to pay a huge sum towards electricity charges, while receiving support through direct benefit transfer later. This would result in defaults leading to penalties and disconnection, she said. “As the public at large are still to benefit from 100% financial inclusion, the success of direct benefit transfer is itself a big grey area ... the subsidy through the tariff mechanism should continue as the government has social obligations,” she wrote. The draft “divests” the States of their power to fix tariff and hands over the task to a Central government-appointed authority. This is discriminatory, since the tariff can be tweaked according to the whims and fancies of the Central government, she said. She also criticised the provision that makes it compulsory for the State power companies to buy a minimum percentage of renewable energy fixed by the Centre. This would be detrimental to the cash- strapped power firms, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mamata-flays-draft-electricity-bill-seeks-opposition-support/article31829699.ece
15 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||Jamiat challenges plea in SC over law on places of worship||Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind has asked the Supreme Court for a chance to contest a petition filed by a Hindu body to quash a legal provision which protects the “barbarous action of invaders who had converted the Hindu places of worship”. The Jamiat said the court should not even issue notice on the petition and make the Muslim community insecure about their places of worship, especially after the recent culmination of the Ayodhya dispute. The Jamiat, represented by advocate Ejaz Maqbool, has filed an impleadment application on Saturday against a writ petition filed by the Vishwa Bhadra Pujari Purohit Mahasangh in the court earlier in the week. The Mahasangh has challenged the validity of Section 4 of The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991. It claims the provision “validates the alleged illegal and barbarous action of invaders who had converted the Hindu places of worship by restricting the right of Hindus to reclaim possession of these places of worship which had been converted by the invaders”. It alleged that the Section “discriminates the members of the Hindu community vis-a-vis the members of the Muslim community in the matter of restoring possession of places of worship”. The Mahasangh’s plea gains significance in the case of Kashi and Mathura, where two mosques stand. The Jamiat highlighted how the Ayodhya judgment had held that “law cannot be used as a device to reach back in time and provide a legal remedy to every person who disagrees with the course which history has taken”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jamiat-challenges-plea-in-sc-over-law-on-places-of-worship/article31829718.ece
15 June 2020||Bengaluru,||Nadda hails Karnataka govt.’s handling of COVID-19 crisis||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) high command’s acknowledgement of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s leadership in handling COVID-19 in the State, especially in Bengaluru, came as a relief to the beleaguered Chief Minister after his recent loss of face over the selection of candidates for Rajya Sabha seats. Party national president J.P. Nadda, who addressed an online ‘Jana Samvad’ rally to celebrate one year of the Narendra Modi-led BJP government at the Centre, said the quality of Mr. Yediyurappa’s leadership was evident “when we see the COVID-19 situation in metro cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Kolkata, compared to Bengaluru”. “There are just over 500 cases in Bengaluru, which is a testament to the proactive leadership of Yediyurappa and his team. The administration’s success can be attributed to 4Ts — Trace, Test, Treat, and Technology. The several mobile applications devised by the State, digital management of quarantine facilities and hospitals, special COVID awareness teams to refute fake news, and the Dasoha helpline that has been feeding the hungry migrant labourers... He [Mr. Yediyurappa] did not fall behind Narendra Modi and has announced an economic package to cushion the impact of COVID-19 and the lockdown,” Mr. Nadda said. He also congratulated the Chief Minister on the “reform measures” undertaken by the State government to the APMC Act and the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961. The appreciation from the BJP president comes at a time when several MLAs have raised the banner of revolt against the Chief Minister and the party high command rejected all three names recommended by him to be elected to the Rajya Sabha. It also came on the eve of the core committee meeting of the State unit to select four candidates to be elected to the Karnataka Legislative Council. Mr. Nadda, speaking of the achievements of the Modi government, said, “It is a year of great achievements — removal of Article 370, introduction of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and law criminalising triple talaq. Though we are faced with a crisis in COVID-19, Narendra Modi led the country from the front and saved it from the onslaught of the virus by going in for a lockdown and announcing a Rs. 20-lakh-crore relief package to revive the economy,” he said. He also came down heavily on the Congress for “playing politics by opposing the government in times of a crisis”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nadda-hails-karnataka-govts-handling-of-covid-19-crisis/article31829672.ece
15 June 2020||LUCKNOW,||U.P. recruitment scam: real Anamika Shukla finally gets a job||Anamika Shukla, an unemployed, trained teacher from Gonda, who alleged that her educational certificates were forged to provide jobs to several impersonators in Kasturba Gandhi Balika schools across Uttar Pradesh, has finally landed a job in a private school in her home district. The “original” Ms. Shukla was recruited as an assistant teacher in the primary section of the Bhaiya Chandrabhan Dutt Smarak Vidyalaya. While offering her the appointment letter, school manager Digvijay Pandey said the school committee had passed a resolution to employ Ms. Shukla as it had an excess of students. Ms. Shukla said the school had considered her “talent” while employing her. “ Bahut acha lag raha hai (I am feeling really good),” Ms. Shukla told reporters after accepting the appointment. The teacher recruitment scam which has roiled the State for the past few weeks, took a new turn last week, when Ms. Shukla submitted her documents at the office of the Basic Education Officer in Gonda, stating that she never worked as a teacher despite applying in five districts since 2017. On her complaint, the Gonda police have now lodged an FIR against persons accused of impersonating her to get employed as teachers. Meanwhile, in Mainpuri, police arrested a woman Anita Devi on charges of getting appointed as a teacher using forged documents of Anamika Shukla. Ms. Anita Devi had been teaching at a Kasturba Gandhi Balika school for a year using fake certificates, said Ambedkar Nagar SP Alok Priyadarshi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-recruitment-scam-real-anamika-shukla-finally-gets-a-job/article31829713.ece

As soon as he got information that Jangoan MLA Muthireddy Yadagiri Reddy had tested positive, Mr. Govardhan gave his samples for testing as both had spent some time together in a private meeting two days ago, according to sources close to the MLA. Mr. Govardhan, who showed symptoms of COVID-19 on Saturday, informed District Collector C. Narayana Reddy. Immediately, doctors collected his blood and saliva samples and sent them for examinations. The MLA received the call from the laboratory late on Sunday afternoon with the result. Meanwhile, the family members of the MLA went into self-quarantine. The Legislator also attended the inaugural of the double bedroom houses at Bibipur tribal village in Dichpally mandal on Saturday. MLC V.G.

15 June 2020||Mumbai,||Mega cruise liners dock for crew sign-off||The Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT), which is hosting three mega cruise ships, Anthem of the Seas, Celebrity Infinity and Carnival Splendor , for the next four days, is in the middle of carrying out the largest crew sign-off exercise involving 4,827 seafarers who are returning home after the COVID-19 pandemic struck. The next few weeks are only going to get busier on the cruise liner front, with nine more ships — of the 13 that planned to visit Mumbai — already en route with 7,000 Indians on board. Port of refuge “The Mumbai port is truly the port of refuge for our stranded seafarers. This is by far the largest crew evacuation exercise. We have already signed off 1,819 seafarers from six ships that have called in at Mumbai till date,” said MbPT Chairman Sanjay Bhatia. It all started on April 23, when 145 Indian seafarers stranded on the U.S. cruise ship Marella Discovery reached Mumbai and were allowed to sign off after weeks of being on board the ship, docked at the outer anchorage. “The crew members were actually off the ship in three hours. The ship had left the port in eight hours,” said commander Nevil Malao, vice-president, J.M. Baxi and Company Ltd., who led the operation. Commander Malao now has two ships under his watch: Celebrity Infinity and Anthem of the Seas . Another cruise ship, the Ovation of the Seas , belonging to Royal Caribbean Cruises, dropped off 870 crew members at Mumbai last week. On May 12, J.M. Baxi and Company helped 168 Indian crew members disembark from Seven Seas Voyager , operated by Florida-based Regent Seven Seas Cruises, a unit of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. The MbPT has crossed the handling of 9 lakh tonnes of cargo in the post-lockdown phase. “A large range of cargo, from bulk lentils to hot and cold rolled coils, plates, base oil, sugar, bitumen, and vehicles to a variety of projects have been handled within the limited storage areas with assistance and support of dedicated staff and officers,” Mr. Bhatia said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mega-cruise-liners-dock-for-crew-sign-off/article31829692.ece
15 June 2020||New Delhi,||3 States yet to reply on labour law changes||More than a month after the Parliamentary Committee on Labour wrote to eight State governments seeking explanation on the changes brought to the labour laws during the extended lockdown, three BJP-ruled States — Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh — have not responded, despite two reminders from the committee. The three States have effected the most significant changes, suspending the majority of the labour laws for a period of up to three years. The committee had sought details of the amendments made by them and also the instruments (executive order or ordinance) used to effect the change. A total of 13 State governments had diluted the labour laws in May, with eight of them raising the daily working hours from eight to 12. Asked if this amounted to undermining the Parliamentary Standing Committee, Labour Committee Chairperson and Biju Janata Dal MP Bhartruhari Mahtab said, “I can only say that their reply is awaited.” ‘Tardy response’ Sources said the State governments had been tardy in responding, with Assam being the only one to send in its response within a week. The Rajasthan government replied only a few days back. Among other changes, it has amended the Industrial Disputes Act to increase the threshold of companies coming under the law from those employing 100 workers to those having 300 workers. Further, the meeting of the committee had to be cancelled twice after the officials at the Union Labour Ministry tested positive for COVID-19. It was first scheduled for June 5 and then rescheduled for June 17. But now it has been deferred and may be held on June 26. “More than 50% of the members are willing to attend the meeting in Parliament since we haven’t heard from the Speaker’s office to hold committee meetings via video conferencing,” Mr. Mahtab said. Explaining the changes made by U.P., M.P. and Gujarat governments, Tapan Sen, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said the amendments made by the three States pushed 80% of the workforce out of coverage of labour laws. “In these three States, barring the child labour laws and laws related to women working the night shift, most other laws have been suspended in the name of reform. The custodians of the law themselves want to throw the workers at the mercy of the employer,” Mr. Sen said. Following the amendments, 10 central trade unions had complained to the International Labour Organisation, which has sought a reply from India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/3-states-yet-to-reply-on-labour-law-changes/article31829697.ece
15 June 2020||HYDERABAD,||With WFH, new dynamics at play in IT sector||The work-from-home mode adopted by IT and ITeS companies since the imposition of the lockdown may bring in some new dimensions and dynamics into play, transforming the way the sector had been functioning all these years. Techies, who have been working from home for more than 70 days now without any disruption in business operations despite initial hiccups like power outage and bandwidth issues, have adapted themselves to the changed work mode. Even after relaxation in guidelines by the Central government giving exemption to IT companies to bring all their workforce to office, the managements took a rain check on that given the rising number of positive cases in the city. In the last one week, new cases were being reported in three digit numbers in the State with the bulk of them in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation area and the surrounding districts. In the meantime, many IT companies and MNCs have conducted internal surveys to know the views of their employees to resume work from offices and it was found that only 6% to 10% of employees were in favour of coming to offices. The rest of employees preferred to continue to work from home for some more weeks to a few months. Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association (HYSEA) representatives said that the long period of WFH made some companies, particularly start-ups and small and medium enterprises, rethink their mode of functioning and cancel lease of their office premises. For any IT company, 30% of their cost is establishment/office space. “The thinking is that money saved on rent can be used to give more salary to skilled people. Surely, new dynamics are developing, which can change the IT sector forever,” they said. Even young employees from outside the State and working in the city who normally go for shared accommodation, are not renewing their rental lease. “With our company deciding to continue the WFH mode indefinitely, we are going back to our home States and work from home rather than staying here,” said a young IT company employee. Former president of the HYSEA Murali Bollu said the changing dynamics might have a domino effect on other companies in the next few months. Companies that saved money on office rent can quote lower rates for contracts to their clients. “The WFH mode is prevalent in IT companies in the US too. So far, we used to get H1 visa for our employees to work on site on client premises. Now, with every one working from home, location of work becomes immaterial. Thus, it can be easy to persuade the US client to let our employees work off site by aligning to their timings,” he said. Thanks to the new hardware/software tools like Krisp, which cancels noise in the background, working from home was becoming comfortable, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/with-wfh-new-dynamics-at-play-in-it-sector/article31830003.ece
15 June 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Survey to assess demand for co-working spaces||With sharing of co-working spaces and work-from-home becoming the new normal across sectors, IT Parks-Kerala has launched a survey to ascertain the demand and expectations of professionals and organisations as part of its #Move2Kerala campaign, which seeks to position the State as a major global digital hub in the post-COVID era. The online survey, which addresses the workforce and entrepreneurs, takes into account the growing trend of re-imagining the workspace that began before the upheaval triggered by the pandemic, with establishments recognizing the potential, including economic advantages, of remote working and work from home. The thrust of the #Move2Kerala campaign is to attract companies and mid-senior level talents to Kerala. It will encourage professionals from Kerala scattered around the world to consider returning to the State. The government has chalked out plans to create a network of virtual and physical work-near-home co-working spaces. Earlier this week, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had mooted the creation of “work-sharing benches” to pool human resources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/survey-to-assess-demand-for-co-working-spaces/article31830051.ece

Additional Superintendent of Police (City) Jaunpur, Sanjay Kumar, said a reward of Rs. 5,000 each had been announced on the 17 absconding persons after the incident. “All the accused barring 17 were arrested,” said Mr. Kumar. Police had arrested 37 persons in connection with the incident, in which seven huts of a Dalit community were set ablaze and cattle heads were also burnt to death last Tuesday at Bhadethi village in the Sarai Khawaja area of the Purvanchal district. ‘Invoke NSA’ Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday ordered officials to lodge the National Security Act (NSA) against the accused. The incident started out after a minor dispute between two sets of youths who had accompanied their grazing buffaloes and goats near a pond. While local sources said the dispute started over the plucking of mangoes, the Station House Officer said the altercation broke out after a buffalo belonging to youths of one community attacked a goat on the other side.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/reward-on-17-accused-in-hut-burning-case/article31829924.ece
15 June 2020||MUMBAI,||OMCs increase petrol, diesel prices yet again||State-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) on Sunday increased the price of sensitive petroleum products petrol and diesel for the eighth consecutive day. The price of petrol was increased by 62 paise per litre and diesel by 64 paise, as OMCs continued to adjust retail rates in line with costs after an 82-day break from rate revision because of the coronavirus pandemic. In Delhi, a litre of petrol costs Rs. 75.78, up from Rs. 75.16 on Saturday, an increase of 62 paise. Diesel price rose 64 paise to Rs. 74.03 per litre from Rs. 73.39,” according to the Indian Oil Corporation Limited website. Similarly, in Mumbai, a litre of petrol costs Rs. 82.70, up from Rs. 82.10, while diesel rates were increased to Rs. 72.64 per litre from Rs. 72.03. Petrol prices in Chennai stood at Rs. 79.53, up 54 paise from Rs. 78.99 on Saturday, while diesel became costlier by 54 paise, rising to Rs. 72.18. In Kolkata, the price of petrol rose to Rs. 77.64, while the price of diesel stood at Rs. 69.80. Rates have been increased across the country, and they vary from State to State depending on the incidence of local sales tax or VAT. The OMCs have increased petrol price by Rs. 4.52 per litre and diesel by Rs. 4.64 in the past eight days. The freeze on the base selling price was imposed in mid-March, after the Centre increased excise duty to generate finances. The OMCs instead of passing on the hikes then on customers, adjusted them against the fall in the retail rates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/omcs-increase-petrol-diesel-prices-yet-again/article31829925.ece

15 June 2020||PATHANAMTHITTA,||‘Vested interests behind anti-Athirappilly protests’||Certain agencies with vested interests have been unleashing false propaganda against all development projects in the State and the ongoing protests against the proposed Athirappilly hydro-electric project too are no different, former member of the Kerala State Electricity Board and energy expert K. Radhakrishnan has said. Talking to The Hindu , the former KSEB member (power generation) has welcomed the government’s move to reopen the hydro-electric project proposal which, according to him, will give sustainable boost to the State’s power sector without causing much harm to the eco-system. According to him, the dam to be constructed in a comparatively small storage area cannot do much harm either to the forests or the environment. The total area to be submerged was only 104 hectares of land of which natural forest cover only 28.4 hectares. This was very negligible in the river basin with more than 10,000 hectares of thick forests. Moreover, compensatory afforestation of double the area submerged was compulsory now, he said. Mr. Radhakrishnan said the proposed 163 mw hydro-electric project would give an annual yield of 233 million units. The project had also been redesigned to maintain the beauty of the waterfalls. A review of the two-decade-long chronological history of the Athirappilly project amply exposed the meaninglessness of the decision-making process with regard to development projects. The Athirappilly project received forest clearance in 1997 and the environmental clearance in 1998. The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) had given techno-economic clearance in 2005. The study conducted by Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute (TBGRI) and site visits by experts deputed by the Union Ministry had ruled out any serious environmental impact. Mr. Radhakrishnan said there were also serious allegations that power traders and private generators who wanted to sell electricity to the State had been funding the agitations against the Athirappilly project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vested-interests-behind-anti-athirappilly-protests/article31830050.ece
15 June 2020||PATHANAMTHITTA,||Malabar gliding frog spotted at Pullad||A green frog with slender body, webbed feet, unusual body positions, very well camouflaged and gliding in the air. This was how a juvenile Malabar gliding frog (Rhacophorus malabaricus), a rare amphibian that can glide in the air up to 10 to 12 metres, was spotted in the orchard of a house at Pullad, near Kozhencherry, on Saturday. Jithesh Krishnan, Assistant Professor of Botany at NSS College, Pandalam, spotted the frog endemic to the rainforests of Western Ghats, in his orchard. Second time Mr. Krishnan told The Hindu that it was the second time he could find this rare amphibian species in the same orchard in the past two years. Mr. Krishnan said Western Ghats was a repository of biological diversity and the Malabar gliding frog undoubtedly an ecologically sensitive and beautiful species. Its gliding abilities, with the long skin between the fingers, helped these frogs to cover 10 to 12 feet in one leap, said Mr. Krishnan. The frog has got a body length of 10 cm, making it one of the largest mossy frogs. The fingers and toes are like sticks to attach and walk through tree branches. Males are smaller than females. Mr. Krishnan said like many mossy frogs, they built foam nests above small pools of water, into which the tadpoles drop after hatching. As their body is so soft, they can live only in moist forests with streams. The surroundings of the house at Pullad is like a small grove with an open water holding tank at centre, surrounded by trees. Declining population The Malabar gliding frog population was declining due to deforestation, climate change, developmental activities, toxic chemicals and so on, he said. Mr. Krishnan said the frog bred during the monsoon and usually, the females chose to spawn on the lush green leaves overhanging a waterbody. Nature enthusiasts have also observed interesting behaviour like cannibalism among tadpoles of this species.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/malabar-gliding-frog-spotted-at-pullad/article31829677.ece

As for mortality, approximately 60% deaths were prevented and one-third of this mortality prevention is attributed to the reduction in the unmet need for critical care as a result of the intervention, the analysis showed. “While lockdowns will delay the onset of peak and give the much- needed time for the health system to respond, strengthening the health system response in terms of testing, isolation of cases, treatment and contact-tracing, as is being done currently, will have to be the mainstay to reduce the impact of the pandemic in India until a vaccine becomes available,” according to the study. The overall economic health system cost of the pandemic is estimated to be 6.2% of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/icmr-study-plots-mid-november-peak/article31829680.ece
15 June 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala CM seeks testing facility abroad for NoRKs||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to instruct Indian embassies in foreign countries to provide non-resident Keralites (NoRKs) means to test themselves for COVID-19 infection before boarding flights home. Mr. Vijayan’s latest letter to Mr. Modi came against the backdrop of Opposition’s criticism that the government had broken its promise to non-resident Keralites left in the lurch in epidemic-hit countries. The United Democratic Front had slammed the government for “unfairly” ordering NoRKs seeking to return home on chartered flights to present a medical testimonial proving that they were COVID-19-free to authorities at the point of departure. Community concerns Mr. Vijayan said the government supported the mission to bring “pravasis” home. However, it could not make the larger community vulnerable to a new wave of infections. The Chief Minister said it was pertinent to note that 53 persons out of the 85 who had tested COVID-19 positive on June 13 were recent arrivals. A senior official told The Hindu that new arrivals accounted for 85% of the COVID-19 positive cases in Kerala. The State could restrict transmission through contact with returnees to less than 11% of the total number of cases. However, the situation was perilous. Several airlines and organisations had scheduled 800 flights to Kerala from abroad. An estimated one lakh emigrants would arrive in the State soon. Kerala could not discount the threat of transmission from asymptomatic arrivals, the official said. In his letter, Mr. Vijayan appeared to echo the concerns raised by the Opposition. He said emigrants found it expensive and trying to get themselves tested in their countries. Some nations were reluctant to test persons who were not overtly symptomatic. Test results were often delayed. Indian embassies should financially assist those who could not afford the tests. The Chief Minister said he hoped the Centre would send the missions adequate test kits. Mr. Vijayan said if PCR test was not possible, the authorities should conduct a rapid test on inbound passengers. He also suggested separate flights for passengers who had tested positive for the virus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-cm-seeks-testing-facility-abroad-for-norks/article31829683.ece
15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,||The disabled remain an invisible minority||According to professional psychologists, individuals with disability and their families are at a greater risk of poor health and quality of life outcomes because either their social status is affected by their disabilities or their disabilities are made worse by the inaccessibility that comes with social status. Lower income levels have been consistently correlated with poor health and inferior quality of life. For the people with disabilities, however, this is not new, says Preeti Singh, a disability rights activist with cerebral palsy and a student at IIM Calcutta. “We always come as an afterthought for the government. When we have no representation in Parliament, how do you expect them to think of us?” “Where is the inclusion of people with disabilities in online education? Does the government know how many children have disabilities? Do they have scribes for exams? Are the websites equipped to deal with visual disorders? How many people like Asha can even afford to have an online education?” “People with disabilities have pre-existing conditions like MRSA [an infection], or have compromised spinal cords, which make them more susceptible to virus infection. There is no accessibility in the quarantine centres, and I personally know people who have had horrifying experiences because of lack of accessibility,” says Ms. Singh. Ms. Asha Devi and Ms. Naznin’s struggle to feed their families points to a larger problem of invisibilisation of the struggles of persons with disability. “For every political party, you have a religious minority cell, a caste cell, a women’s cell, have you ever heard of a disability rights cell?” asks Nipun Malhotra, CEO of Nipman foundation, and Wheels for Life, a disability rights organisation. Mr. Malhotra has a condition called arthrogryposis. He says, “there is no representation in Parliament, and hence, nobody to ensure the policy made for us is intersectional in nature.” Social distancing is a privilege for the marginalised classes, and is worse for those with disabilities. The government has offered no respite for anyone with disabilities. “The pandemic has various implications for people with disabilities. Look at quarantine centres, we don’t have accessibility there. The concept of social distancing is redundant for people who need assistance for everything. I need somebody’s help to do the basic task of washing hands. How do I practise social distancing?” asks Mr. Malhotra. Rahmat Ali, a social worker who runs Vir Abdul Hamid Yuva Club, an NGO, has been helping the families with access to food. He says, “For families such as these, the crisis is harder to deal with considering that they have been deprived of two things, able bodies and financial sustainability. It is therefore imperative that the government should act.” For a person like Mr. Pulinder, who needs assistance for basic tasks, it is highly unlikely that provisions have been made taking into account disability. Ms. Naznin, like many others, is yet to receive not just the wages. She has not received the Rs. 1,000 promised by the government for daily wagers. She says she needs to allocate for Mr. Sajjad’s medicinal needs and the other immediate needs. In spite of talk of redressing caste, class, gender and other types of discrimination, disability from systemic oppression has largely been ignored. Mental health is further pushed into invisibilisation and stigmatisation. COVID-19 is worsening it. “We must think of PwDs living alone, those quarantined in centres, and ensure that Persons with Disability are given basic facilities if their primary caregiver is quarantined,” says Mr. Malhotra. “There must be a consolidated Ministry, instead of just rebranding us as “divyaang” or just saying that an effort is being made. From years of anguish, I feel disillusioned in the government now,” Ms. Singh says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-disabled-remain-an-invisible-minority/article31829687.ece
15 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||SC protects journalist Vinod Dua from arrest||The Supreme Court on Friday protected senior journalist Vinod Dua from arrest till further orders in a sedition case registered by the Himachal Pradesh police for his telecast on the Delhi riots in February. In an urgently convened virtual court hearing on Sunday, a three-judge Bench led by Justice U.U. Lalit agreed to Mr. Dua’s terms to the police that he would join the investigation through videoconferencing or online mode, keeping in mind travel restrictions imposed amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bench, also comprising Justices Mohan M. Shantanagoudar and Vineet Saran, however, refused repeated pleas made by senior advocate Vikas Singh, for Mr. Dua, to stay the investigation, and said Himachal Pradesh Police was “entitled to carry on the investigation, including interrogation of the petitioner [Dua] at his residence after giving him prior notice of 24 hours”.  Status report sought The court sought a status report on the investigation from the State by the next hearing on July 6. The court has also asked the Union government to respond to a plea made by Mr. Dua that no FIR should be registered against journalists with at least 10 years of standing unless cleared by a committee constituted by the respective State governments. The complaint, believed to be filed by a local Bharatiya Janata Party leader, accused Mr. Dua of spreading fake news. The other charges raised against him include causing public nuisance, printing of defamatory matter and making statements conducive to public mischief.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-protects-journalist-vinod-dua-from-arrest/article31829704.ece

15 June 2020||CHANDIGARH,||‘Refer to African nationals properly in police papers’||Terming the use of ‘Nigro’, while referring to an African national in official documents by the Punjab police, “highly offensive”, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has issued a direction never to use the word in any police document, including ‘challans’ or anywhere else in case papers such as investigation reports. High Court judge Justice Rajiv Narain Raina, during a hearing of case through videoconference on June 12, observed, “I am appalled to find the term ‘Nigro’ used while referring to an African national in the challan papers presented under Section 173 Cr.P.C. before the trial court in an NDPS case. This is a highly offensive word across the globe and no one has any business to use it, and much less the police.” This brings shame to India and hatred for the country, the court said. “The police appear to have assumed that every black is a drug peddler and should be treated as such. This is terrible thinking.” ‘Sensitise force’ In the interim order, the court requested the DGP to instruct the force not to use the offensive term while referring to ‘black’ persons in case papers. “They deserve the dignity and respect in a foreign land as visitors or students from Africa temporarily living in our country, which prides itself on many peoples of all colours of the skin ranging from white to black and aboriginal. This has nothing to do with investigation or crime. Therefore, the investigating officers and the police officials that record FIRs be immediately sensitised and warned on the issue by ensuring that no person should be looked down upon on the basis of the colour of his/her skin. All Africans are our friends and when they come to India, they are our valuable guests...They should simply be referred to by the country of their origin in case papers,” said Justice Raina. Recalling Mahatama Gandhi’s contribution to the anti-apartheid movement, Justice Raina said, “Mahatama Gandhi was politically nurtured in South Africa for two decades pioneering the apartheid movement and fighting against colour discrimination and for freedom against black laws...Let us follow that inspiring precept and pay due respect to each other and other people. We are, professedly, a tolerant sub-continent of “browns” in all its shades, but more often than not, display a perverted and primitive mind-set looking down on others without looking within ourselves. For many centuries we have been slaves. Freedom does not lend its wings to our countrymen to fly anywhere they wish and in any manner they like and abuse foreigners on the street calling them ‘kalla’. Freedom teaches love for human dignity and respect for fellow man.” “This aspect needs to be corrected by ordering strict action against the policemen who indulge in this character assassination based on physical features... The pernicious practice should be stopped forthwith and the police commanded on pain of disciplinary action never to address anyone by that description, forget about writing it down in official papers of permanent State record,” said the order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/refer-to-african-nationals-properly-in-police-papers/article31829922.ece
15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,||Mahavakya explained||Proficiency in worldly knowledge is no doubt a great merit, but does not have any bearing when it comes to realising esoteric truths, is the basic teaching in the sastras. In the Gita, Arjuna talks as if he knows all the truths and puts forth his decision to abandon the fight. Krishna listens patiently and then finally imparts His advice when Arjuna humbly submits himself as a student willing to follow His advice. When a spiritual aspirant imbibes this spirit of humility and places absolute faith in the teacher, the way is set for realisation, pointed out Sri R. Rajagopala Sarma in a discourse. The Mahavakya ‘Tat Tvam Asi’ ‘That Thou Art’ that succinctly contains the truth of the oneness of the jiva and Brahman is introduced and explained exhaustively in the Chandogya Upanishad and finally it is asserted as the only truth by way of conclusion. In this section, Uddalaka Aruni, a realised seer, asks his son Svetaketu to study the Vedas under a preceptor to attain knowledge of Brahman. Svetaketu returns after 12 years of study and his attitude and demeanour reflect a sense of pride in his achievement. Sensing this, the father asks him if he has learnt that ‘ultimate knowledge’ by which all else is known and there is nothing further to be known. The son is baffled by this tricky question and asks his father to teach him this truth. The father begins his instruction by giving common examples from this world of experience. By knowing the basic material all else is known. By knowing Brahman as the material and instrumental cause of this universe all else is automatically known. The instruction draws from the world of human experience to establish the veracity of the Mahavakya that can be perceived only through the eye of the sastras.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mahavakya-explained/article31829705.ece

Sampath, Industries Minister. Speaking to reporters after inspecting the Arasu cement factory of the Tamil Nadu Cement Corporation Limited (TANCEM) here on Saturday, Mr. Sampath pointed out there had been exodus of migrant workers to their native States and this had created labour shortage. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had taken note of the issue. Industries that had employed these migrant labourers should engage labourers available in the State in their place. Mr. Sampath said that the Centre had announced a special credit scheme to the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), which were distressed over the impact of COVID-19 lockdown. The Minister said that the AIADMK government had been selling one lakh cement bags per month at a subsidised rate of Rs. 190 a bag under the Amma Cement Scheme. TANCEM was producing 2,000 tonnes of cement from the additional unit at the Arasu cement factory in Ariyalur. The production would be increased to 3,000 tonnes per day soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/training-for-youth/article31830205.ece

15 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Ten zones surpass 1,000-mark; over 5,000 cases in Royapuram||Ten zones of the Greater Chennai Corporation have reported more than 1,000 COVID-19 cases each. Royapuram continues to report the largest number, with cases in the zone crossing 5,000. Owing to the increasing cases in the 10 zones, the Corporation has deployed 61 mobile medical units for COVID-19 containment activities in the city. The units will conduct fever camps and help those in home isolation. Residents in each of the six zones — Royapuram, Tondiarpet, Thiru Vi Ka Nagar, Kodambakkam, Anna Nagar and Teynampet — received the services of six mobile medical units on Sunday. The Corporation on Sunday conducted 203 fever camps, screening 10,541 persons. As many as 392 persons were diagnosed with influenza-like illnesses. With the rise in cases in the added areas of the Greater Chennai Corporation and suburbs such as Tambaram, the number of mobile medical units allocated to high-incidence zones such as Royapuram and Tondiarpet has seen a reduction.  Public health experts, who analysed the number of cases in the past 14 days, recommended the allocation of more mobile medical units to added areas such as Tiruvottiyur and local bodies in the suburban areas of Chennai. Cases in added areas For instance, Tiruvottiyur zone, which is an added area, has reported 640 cases in the past 14 days. Owing to the sudden uptick, traders in the area decided to restrict timings of their shops. Residents of Royapuram zone requested the Corporation to send in more mobile units. A.V.S. Marimuthu, a resident of Narayana Naicker Road in Royapuram, said the residents requested at least 20 mobile medical units for the area. “Six vehicles are not adequate to contain the disease in Royapuram. All residents are scared. We have witnessed at least 10 deaths in the past few days. We have stopped coming out of our houses. We need assistance from more doctors,” he said. Meanwhile, around 5,000 residents were under home isolation, according to Corporation officials. Other cases were in COVID-19 Care Centres and other institutions. According to a press release, 31,896 cases were reported in the city. Most residents isolated in institutions do not have proper toilets and separate rooms in their homes, an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ten-zones-surpass-1000-mark-over-5000-cases-in-royapuram/article31829836.ece
15 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Staff nurse dies of COVID-19 at ‘hotspot’ RGGGH||A staff nurse died of COVID-19 at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) on Sunday. With several doctors, including seniors and postgraduates, having tested positive for the infection in the last few days, there are fears among the hospital’s staff that Tamil Nadu’s largest government tertiary care centre may have become a hotspot for COVID-19. The increasing number of COVID-19 cases among healthcare providers has become a cause for worry at RGGGH. At least 60 PG doctors were isolated at ESI, Ayanavaram, after testing positive over the last three days. They included 44 who were residing at the PG men’s hostel. A number of senior doctors and assistant professors have also tested positive. RGGGH authorities confirmed that a staff nurse, who was in her early fifties, died of COVID-19 at the hospital on Sunday. Reliable sources said that she had initially tested positive for COVID-19, but subsequently, repeat swab tests had returned negative for the infection. She returned to work after 14 days, and tested positive again. “RGGGH has become a hotspot for COVID-19. First of all, patients with infectious diseases should be admitted to places where there is good ventilation and adequate natural sunlight. Both these factors are absent in the blocks where COVID-19 patients are being admitted,” a doctor said, on condition of anonymity. Currently, patients who test positive are admitted to the Rheumatology Block, wards 205, 206, 215, 43 and 47 in Tower 2, while Tower 3 houses the COVID-19 outpatient department. Earlier, healthcare providers posted on COVID-19 duty were granted a 14-day quarantine. “With patient inflow increasing, the hospital is not providing a proper quarantine period to them,” the doctor alleged. They have changed the testing policy, and are screening only symptomatic healthcare providers,” he added. Many healthcare professionals complained of long working hours which were leading to increased exposure to the infection. Complaints of poor-quality masks and face shields and a lack of separate rooms for the donning and doffing of personal protective equipment in Towers 2 and 3 have also surfaced. It was time that all blocks were fumigated, a doctor said.  However, a hospital official said the RGGGH was running smoothly. “Most of the affected PGs are asymptomatic. We are taking up massive disinfection measures at the hospital, hostels and CRRI ,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/staff-nurse-dies-of-covid-19-at-hotspot-rgggh/article31829869.ece
15 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||For Rs. 8,000, a migrant can catch a bus back home||Private bus services have started plying from Chennai Central, helping people stranded in the city during the lockdown to head back home. The services were started owing to difficulties faced by migrant workers in finding trains. Ticket prices range from Rs. 7,000 to Rs. 8,000 per passenger for a trip to States like Rajasthan, Bihar, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh. “We help passengers reach Bihar in three days. We don’t know if the government has approved the journey. The passengers opting for the bus transit are those who are unable to get a train. We help stranded people who are desperate to reach home during the pandemic,” said a driver of a bus parked near Ripon Buildings on Sunday. Residents of areas such as Sowcarpet have left for their native villages in States such as Rajasthan in buses during the past few weeks. According to estimates, at least 10,000 street vendors have left for their native villages in the past few weeks owing to loss of livelihood. Many started leaving the city by illegal modes of transit during the pandemic, increasing the risk of COVID-19 spread. A senior official of the Corporation said the civic body has sent 1.2 lakh stranded persons to other States with the support of other line agencies. “We are helping IT professionals who lost jobs. The IT professionals contacted civic officials online and wanted to reach their native places. We sent them in trains by following norms of COVID-19 containment. Professionals who are stranded are requested to get help from civic officials,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/for-rs-8000-a-migrant-can-catch-a-bus-back-home/article31829839.ece
15 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Police manage to trace a third of 277 ‘missing’ patients||The police have traced 90 of the 277 COVID-19 patients whose whereabouts the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) was not able to ascertain. Most of the missing cases are from the Pulianthope and Washermenpet areas. When the GCC took stock of the COVID-19 cases in the city, including those in home quarantine, private and government hospitals and COVID-19 Care Centres, the numbers did not tally. Incomplete information “The details of those who test positive at labs in the city have to be sent to the Directorate of Public Health and the same is forwarded to the GCC. But the field workers were unable to trace the positive patients with the address provided by them,” said a senior police officer. The GCC informed the police about the issue and sought their help to trace the patients. “The police stations under whose jurisdiction the patient’s address came were informed. They called the phone numbers provided by the patient and verified the addresses,” said a police officer. In some cases, the numbers were correct and the address was wrong and in a few cases it was vice versa. Some of them had switched off the mobile phones and some other had provided wrong addresses. “Our officers went to each house and verified and also called the phone numbers provided. We were able to trace approximately 90 out of 277 cases, as either the address or phone number was correct,” said a senior police officer. ‘Ensure address proof’ Efforts are on to identify the remaining. “It is a tough task. The lab staff should ensure that Aadhaar card and address proof of the person coming for testing is collected,” said a police officer. Police sources said one of the reasons why people don’t provide proper addresses is due to the stigma attached to COVID-19. “The public starts ignoring the patient and stays away from him. This has an impact on them. Some even tie neem leaves outside the houses of COVID-19 positive people,” added a senior officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/police-manage-to-trace-a-third-of-277-missing-patients/article31829837.ece
15 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Eateries see poor patronage||It has been a week since restaurants have opened for dine-in and restaurateurs in the city say footfall has only marginally gone up while parcels have come down. R. Srinivasa Raja of Adyar Anandha Bhavan said the parcel sales had merged with the dine-in numbers. “There are still heavy restrictions on movement and restaurants have to spend more on sanitising. But, hopefully, in the long run, restaurants will break even,” he said. Many restaurants, especially in the city, have not yet opened due to manpower shortage. “It is the North Indians, who make the naans, rotis and chat items. Those from Tamil Nadu have gone home too. And those who have the staff are unable to pay rent and electricity bills,” said M. Ravi of Chennai Hotels Association. Temple towns The situation is not the same in small cities where restaurants depend on local population for staff. They are waiting for arrival of tourists and reopening of temples that draw crowds. “We do not have an issue with staff availability. We have not cut pay but asked staff to come on alternate days. For now, we are just managing the day-to-day running of the business,” said K. Hariharan, a hotelier of Kancheepuram. “People just want normalcy to return,” he added. In Mamallapuram, restaurants have also been getting very few customers. J. Sethuraman of the Mamalla Hotels Group said that the town was dependent on tourists and weekend visitors from Chennai and Puducherry. In Chidambaram, which mainly depends on the Thillai Nataraja temple and the Annamalai University, parcels remain the mainstay.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/eateries-see-poor-patronage/article31829841.ece

15 June 2020||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Lack of screening raises fear among slum residents||Fear of COVID-19 has turned days nightmarish for several residents of slums across Chennai. Residents of several slums in the city have raised issues like lack of sufficient screening and containment measures. According to Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) officials there are 2,170 tenable, untenable, developed and yet-to-be-surveyed slums in the city. Though the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) claimed to have been distributing masks, santisers and sanitary napkins in the slums and creating awareness to arrest the spread of COVID-19, residents in many slums said that there is no sufficient screening and containment measures. “My husband tested positive for COVID-19, but when I requested the officials to test me, my children and my mother-in-law, they said that we would be screened only if we have symptoms,” said Amudha (name changed), a resident of Kabali Thottam in Mylapore. Residents of Kalyanapuram in Vyasarpadi said that they were not screened for symptoms of COVID-19. “My neighbour tested positive for COVID-19. The house was disinfected and covered with sheets, but none of us were screened for symptoms. All our houses are closely knit,” said Gopinath, a resident. A few other residents added that there was low awareness among people and many were scared to say that they had symptoms of fever and cough when Corporation workers came for regular surveys. “When we see the ambulance coming to take persons who have tested positive, people run away. Such is the fear among all of us,” another resident added. Prem Kumar, a short film director, and a resident of Visalakshi Thottam in Mylapore, said that the ILI survey and screening was not properly done. Residents in many slums complained that containment measures were not proper. “They just barricade the house with a banner saying Corona Hotspot,” added Maheshwari, a resident of Royapuram.  Residents of the Wood Works slum, near the Elephant Gate police station, have not been allowing GCC volunteers to enter their locality for conducting the survey. “Our area was shut down for a few weeks. Despite repeated requests, the GCC did not provide us groceries or vegetables. Now we are not allowing their volunteers to come inside for comducting the survey,” said Mary, a resident. A GCC official said that the number of COVID-19 cases in slums had reduced relatively. “Earlier, there were cases in areas such as S.M. Nagar, Anjaneya Nagar and B.R.N. Garden. Now cases in slums are only in single digits. We are continuing to create awareness in these areas by roping in NGOs,” the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lack-of-screening-raises-fear-among-slum-residents/article31829871.ece
15 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Pandemic can’t be grounds for granting bail, State tells HC||The State government has contended before the Madras High Court that granting bail to an accused by taking the threat of a pandemic into consideration “is not in accordance with law”, and “will make way for a lawless situation in the State”. The issue was raised in an appeal preferred by the State government, represented by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of the Greater Chennai police, against the bail granted to DMK Rajya Sabha member R.S. Bharathi by a special court on June 1. Justice N. Sathish Kumar is expected to hear the appeal this week. According to the prosecution, the Member of Parliament was booked on serious charges under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989. He was accused of insulting members of the Scheduled Caste communities by claiming, at a private meeting conducted by the Kalaignar Reading Circle, that many of them had become judges only because of the alms provided to them by the Dravidian Movement. Nevertheless, the special court had granted him bail without remanding him in judicial custody for even a single day, subject to the simple conditions that he must execute an own bond for Rs. 10,000, along with two sureties, and appear before the police as and when required, the government said. Assailing the order, the CCB claimed that the sessions judge had erred in passing it. “The lower court failed to impose any stringent condition. Granting bail on the simple condition of own bond and two sureties is totally contrary to law,” it said. The prosecution said that the threat of COVID-19 had weighed heavily on the mind of the presiding officer of the special court, after the petitioner had claimed that he was under home quarantine because two of his family members happened to be doctors. The prosecution claimed that there was no evidence to prove that he was under home quarantine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pandemic-cant-be-grounds-for-granting-bail-state-tells-hc/article31829877.ece
15 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Quota soon for govt. school students in medical admissions||An ordinance, providing a 10% “horizontal quota” for students of State government schools in admission to medical courses through the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), is likely to get the approval of the State Cabinet at a meeting on Monday afternoon. As the “quota within quota” cannot be carried out through an executive order, the government is required to take the ordinance route, a senior official pointed out. The move follows the submission of a report by a commission headed by former judge of the Madras High Court P. Kalaiyarasan, to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami last week. In March, the Chief Minister, while announcing his government’s move to set up such a panel, told the Assembly that the reservation scheme would be for students who studied from Class I to XII in government schools, corporation schools, municipal schools, Kallar reclamation schools and schools run by the Forest Department. The Chief Minister had acknowledged that the entry of government school students into medical colleges went down drastically after the introduction of the NEET. To be chaired by the Chief Minister at the Secretariat, the Cabinet meeting will also take stock of the measures taken to tackle the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the State. In May 1997, the DMK government ordered the creation of “special and horizontal” reservation of 15% of seats in professional courses for students studying in schools in village panchayats. In June 2001, the AIADMK government increased the quantum to 25%. In February 2002, the Madras High Court declared the quota scheme unsustainable. However, in September 2007, the DMK regime enacted a legislation, earmarking 3.5% exclusively for Muslims in education and employment within the overall quota of 30% for Backward Classes (BC). Since April 2009, Arunthathiars within the 18% reservation for Scheduled Castes are being given 3% quota.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/quota-soon-for-govt-school-students-in-medical-admissions/article31829851.ece
15 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Mental torture of elders more prevalent than physical abuse’||Psychological abuse of elders was more prevalent than physical torture and many cases of abuse go unreported, said senior geriatric physician V.S. Natarajan. In a statement issued ahead of the World Elder Abuse Awareness Day being observed on Monday, he said that psychological abuse could happen in subtle or overt ways and elders might not even recognise it. Highlighting that elders often hesitated to speak about abuse due to various reasons, including the fear of worsening the situation further, Dr. Natarajan, founder and chairman of V.S. Natarajan Geriatric Foundation, said the government could organise more awareness programmes at district levels. “The World Elder Abuse Awareness Day falling on June 15 every year can be observed in a bigger way by recognising families that are taking good care of elders despite difficulties,” he said. Past 3 months He said although the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns had put everyone to hardship, he was personally yet to come across cases of physical abuse of elders in the past three months.

15 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Trials with Ayurveda intervention on the cards||With the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Tamil Nadu, the Health Department has planned a research to study the efficacy of add-on personalised Ayurveda intervention on patients, in comparison to standalone treatment based on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. The 90-day study, on a sample of 60 patients, has been proposed at the Stanley Medical College Government Hospital, Chennai, in association with the Arya Vaidya Pharmacy Research Foundation, Coimbatore. The focus of the investigators, comprising Allopathic and Ayurveda doctors, will be on reducing the duration of hospital stay and ventilator support for patients. According to sources in the Health Department, the research will be conducted on two groups of patients, each comprising 30 members and aged above 18. While one group will go through the add-on Ayurveda treatment protocol, including diet, the other will continue with the standalone ICMR-recommended treatment for COVID-19. The selected patients will be from those who tested positive through the RT-PCR method and not requiring ventilator support. COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities like acute/advanced stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, chronic liver diseases, recent history of cardiovascular events, renal problems, acute inflammatory complications of diabetes like non-healing ulcers and severe neuropathy will be excluded from the study. Written consent According to a senior health official, the add-on intervention will include an intensive Ayurveda drug-based treatment with general dietetic and lifestyle modifications. “If the patient develops severe symptoms and alleviation of biomarkers, requiring intensive care during the treatment period, then rescue therapy, according to the local guidelines, will be applied. We will take the written consent of the patients before commencing the comprehensive treatment protocol,” the official said. The official said that this was an initiative of Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam and Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan to control the rising number of fatalities and improve the recovery rate in the State. The results of the study, he said, could contribute to national policy and pave the way for integrated medicine in the management of COVID-19 caused by the SARS CoV-2 Virus. He pointed out that the State had already advised the use of Indian medicines like kabasura kudineer and Arsenic Album 30 as prophylaxis drugs for people to build immunity. The study proposal is coming up before the Ethical Committee of the Ministry of Ayush for approval on Monday, officials sources added.

15 June 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Refunds still a bugbear||For an air passenger, what is almost as frustrating as seeing the ‘cancelled’ message flash on the screen is trying to get a refund of the fare. Three weeks after domestic services resumed, flights out of Chennai, though limited, continue to see cancellations. Compounding the passengers’ woes is the battle is to get a refund from the airline. R. Kannan (name changed) said that his family had booked tickets on a flight from Chennai to Delhi recently, and the airline cancelled the service at the last minute. “The worst part, we have been desperately trying to get a refund, but in vain. Even to get through to a customer care representative involves a long wait. It is an exhausting exercise,” he added. Several passengers post their refund ordeals on social media. Vishal Sharma, one such irate passenger, tweeted: “My flight from Chennai to Delhi was cancelled on June 6 and a refund has not been initiated for the same. Customer care does not answer, mail does not get delivered. Customer representatives do not have complete information. Please initiate refunds in these times.” Many are not happy with the credit shells provided, saying they may not even travel again. Officials said there were fewer cancellations now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/refunds-still-a-bugbear/article31829843.ece

15 June 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Choked drain trouble residents around Pattalamman Kovil at Avarampalayam||Alleys north of the Pattalamman Kovil Street lead to the railway track passing through Avarampalayam. Between the railway track and the houses that are on the end of the alleys is a drain that runs parallel to the track. Filled with solid waste and choked by bushes, the drain has become a source of problem for the 300-odd residents of the area that falls in Ward 40 of the Coimbatore Corporation. C. Sundar, a resident, says the drain turning into a home for reptiles including deadly snakes is the foremost of their concerns. “We are scared of our safety at night and that of children during the day as they play in front of our houses, near the drain.” His neighbour N. Selvi says though the residents are also scared of the increasing presence at night of thieves, who move in from across the railway track, the residents’ immediate concern is the impending South West Monsoon because the water from the choked drain will inundate their houses. “Every year, water from the drain enters our houses to push us to the community hall near the Pattalamman temple. This year can be different if the Corporation chooses act in time.” Or, the years to come can be different, if the Corporation comes forward to demolish our houses, most of which are on government land, to give us new accommodation in the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board tenements. The residents say they have petitioned the district administration and Corporation authorities on several occasions but help has not been forthcoming. The area’s DMK secretary A. Mahesh Kumar, the residents and also the area MLA N. Karthik have sent several petitions seeking a permanent solution by suggesting either construction of a drain or moving the residents to the tenements. Unless one of the two was to happen, the residents will continue to face problems, year after year. The Corporation authorities assure that they will soon clean the drain and then look at a permanent solution for the residents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/choked-drain-trouble-residents-around-pattalamman-kovil-at-avarampalayam/article31829885.ece
15 June 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Codissia moots skill training for domestic workers||Labour shortage seems to be a major problem for industries in Coimbatore district that have resumed operations because of relaxations in lockdown. In an effort to overcome the problem, the Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (Codissia) has mooted a skill training project for workers of Tamil Nadu who need a job. R. Ramamurthy, president of the Association, said he is talking to officials of the Tamil Nadu Skill Development Corporation regarding the programme. “I have also shared a questionnaire with many of the industrial associations in Coimbatore, asking for details on worker availability and shortage at each unit. We expect to get the data in a week. So far, just a handful of industries have replied and they want more workers, especially the foundries,” he said. The demand is for skilled and unskilled workers. According to V. Krishna Kumar, president of Southern India Engineering Manufacturers’ Association, “The manpower issue is more serious for pumpset manufacturers. Trained manpower, who left for their home towns, are yet to return. Recruiting fresh candidates and training them will be a big task. For the pump industry, the two months peak season was lost (due to lockdown). Nearly 20 % of the business comes during these two months. The units are just limping to normalcy and by the time they resume full operations, monsoon will set in,” he says. Mr. Ramamurthy said the Codissia can allocate space at its two industrial parks for the Government to set up skill training facilities. The government should mobilise manpower from the southern districts of the State and they can be trained here and recruited by the MSMEs. If the programme succeeds, it can be replicated in other districts. But, it can be taken up only with the support of the government. The Association is also co-ordinating with the Department of Employment and Training here to see if they can help fill up the vacancies in the MSME units, especially for unskilled workers. They can be involved in training too, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/codissia-moots-skill-training-for-domestic-workers/article31829893.ece
15 June 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||CMCH sees highest number of births during lockdown||When the COVID-19-induced lockdown disrupted operations of many small and medium level hospitals, the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) provided solace for hundreds of antenatal mothers from the region. In May, the hospital witnessed 930 births, the highest in the history of the tertiary care Government facility till date. The hospital also took care of more number of premature babies and those with less than one kg birth weight. “The 930 births reported in May was the highest number of births reported in a month at the hospital. Even amid difficulties and challenges, our staff worked extra hours and 55% of births reported from March were normal deliveries,” said CMCH Dean P. Kalidas. According to V. Booma, Head of the Department of Paediatrics at CMCH, 650 to 700 were the average births per month before lockdown and it increased up to 900 per month during lockdown. “The Sick Newborn Care Unit (SNCU) of the hospital recorded 1,152 admissions during the lockdown period. Of these, 370 infants were less one kg against the average birth weight of 2.5 to 3 kg. More than 350 infants weighed between 1 kg and 1.5 kg. In both groups, close to 90 % of children survived," she said. The infant with the lowest birth weight was a premature baby girl of a couple from Cuddalore who weighed 650g at birth in April. “Now the baby weighs 1.5 kg. The mother and the baby are about to get discharged”, said Dr. Booma. Another child of a couple from Tiruppur weighed 1.5 kg at birth and was diagnosed with jaundice and anaemia. The baby was given Intravenous Immunoglobulin G (IVIG) therapy and got discharged in May. According to Dr. Booma, various reasons trigger premature birth of infants who are also prone to have low birth weight. Lungs of such infants are not mature and SNCU care is required. Neonatologists P. Senthil Kumar and V.K. Sathyan and the nursing team are also giving special training to mothers of children admitted to SNCU on Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC). This enables skin-to-skin contact of mother and infant. “Apart from increasing the bonding between mother and infant, KMC also gives the right temperature from mother’s body to the child. Slings for KMC are provided by the hospital,” said Dr. Booma. CMCH is currently providing all immunisation services every day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cmch-sees-highest-number-of-births-during-lockdown/article31829901.ece
15 June 2020||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore Corporation projects realistic revenue collection||Coimbatore Corporation, it appears, has projected realistic revenue collection for financial year 2020-21 after having inflated the projection for the previous financial year.The Corporation had hurriedly presented its budget towards March-end, a few days ahead of the COVID-19 lockdown. It had projected its tax revenue collection for the financial year 2020-21 at Rs. 212.76 crore. The collection included income from property tax – residential, industrial and commercial with arrears, other taxes, rental income, fee and user charges, grants and subsidies, loans among others. In its budget for the finanacial year 2019-20, the Corporation had projected tax revenue collection at Rs. 277.34 crore but ended up revising it downwards to Rs. 200.52 crore. The Corporation sources familiar with the budgeting process explained that the projection for FY 2019-20 was based anticipating more money into the coffers because of the increase in property tax. Now that the State government had announced that it would have a re-look at the rate of revision, the Corporation had scaled it down and cited the figures from residential property tax collection to underscore their argument – the projection for fiscal 2019-20 was Rs. 91.04 crore and for fiscal 2020-21 it was Rs. 60.13 crore. Against the ‘Rental Income from Municipal Properties’ head, the Corporation had for financial year 2020-21 projected a collection of Rs. 34.2 crore. For the fiscal 2019-20 it had projected Rs. 35.11 crore, the sources pointed out and explained that the downward revision was because the revised estimate for the previous financial year showed that the collection was only around Rs. 29.26 crore. At the end of the current FY, the Corporation’s projection would be way off the mark because of the impact of the lockdown. And, this appeared a distinct possibility because property tax payers for industrial and commercial establishments had started demanding some concession from the civic body and so were the people who had rented the Corporation’s properties. That apart, this year too the Corporation seemed to have prepared its budget anticipating more money from the Central and State governments. Under the ‘Grants and Contributions for Specific Purpose’ head the Corporation had anticipated that it would get Rs. 631.85 crore this year. In its budget for the year 2019-20 the Corporation had projected receiving Rs. 558.2 crore but ended up getting only Rs. 184.06 crore. The sources said while the Corporation had made a realistic projection of its revenue collection for the current financial year, it was not uncommon for it to inflate numbers against the heads it accounted the money from Central and State governments. Irrespective of whether it received the money or not, the Corporation did indulge in it because it always wanted to show a surplus budget, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-corporation-projects-realistic-revenue-collection/article31829883.ece
15 June 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Allegations resurface against BU’s School of Distance Education||After a lull, allegations have resurfaced against the Bharathiar University’s School of Distance Education (SDE) – that it was illegally conducting courses through private institutes that are outside its jurisdiction in Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. A letter detailing the allegations that was sent to the Governor-chancellor, Tamil Nadu, University Grants Commission chairman, higher education minister, higher education secretary, vice chancellor and Syndicate members and shared with the media said that the SDE supported private centres outside its jurisdiction offering ‘correspondence courses’, which was against the law. Sources in the academic fraternity said the University should not run courses through private institutes as it was ineligible to do so on account of its NAAC score. Besides, if it were to offer correspondence courses it should only be from the institutes located within its jurisdiction. The letter further said that the private institutes for a huge sum forged certificates of students, allowed them to transfer course credits from the courses the students had discontinued, allowed students to write all the three years’ papers at one sitting through open book examination and that the private institutes had admitted over 1,000 students for the 2020 academic year. The allegations were nothing but malicious, countered the SDE’s Director in-charge P.E. Thomas. First, the SDE had permitted 38 affiliated colleges and six colleges outside its jurisdiction to offer ‘correspondence courses’ through learner support centres. Therefore there was no question of private institutes offering Bharathiar University’s distance education programmes. There were private institutes but they had not made any admission in the last two years. They only facilitated the students admitted in 2018-19 complete the final year. As for credit transfer, Mr. Thomas said the SDE’s academic section scrupulously verified records of bona fide students before granting permission. He said the SDE had made online the admission process for learner support centres to admit students. Only after the academic section’s approval, each selected student could pay the fee required to join a course. UGC guidelines As for the SDE permitting six colleges outside its jurisdiction to offer ‘correspondence courses’ through learner support centres, he said the UGC guideline was very clear by allowing universities to permit colleges outside their jurisdiction but within the State to run learner support centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/allegations-resurface-against-bus-school-of-distance-education/article31829891.ece
15 June 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Leopard trapped in barbed wire fence rescued||The Forest Department officials tranquilised and rescued a female leopard caught in a barbed wire fence on a private land at Sirumugai, near Coimbatore, on Sunday. The officials suspect that the carnivore accidentally could have got ensnared somewhere else a few days ago as it had a deep cut close to its fore legs. Injury in the back The carnivore, aged around 18 months, with severe injury in the back and some veins cut, was shifted to a Forest Department facility near Mettupalayam for treatment. Officials said the leopard was found trapped in a fence at Mothepalayam village, within the limits of Sirumugai forest range on Sunday morning. The villagers found the leopard lying in pain in the shrubs. As people thronged the area, the animal tried to move, which in turn tightened the barbed wires around it. Forest Department staff from Sirumugai and nearby Mettupalayam range rushed to the spot and moved the crowd to a safe distance. The police were deployed at the spot. Forest Veterinary Officer Sugumar and veterinarian Rajesh from Theppakadu tranquilised the leopard. They tied a syringe to a stick and administered the sedative from a safe distance. The sedated leopard was rescued and shifted to a facility near Mettupalayam. D. Venkatesh, District Forest Officer of Coimbatore Forest Division, said the animal seemed to have got ensnared somewhere else a few days ago as the wound was old. Assistant Conservator of Forests M. Senthil Kumar said a woman from the village said that she had seen the leopard moving with difficulty a few days ago. “The cut around its body was caused by a wire which is not normally used for snares. So we suspect that the leopard could have accidentally got entrapped by the wire which is used for construction purposes,” he said. A team of veterinarians and front line staff of the department are taking care of the leopard. Another team is investigating the cause of the incident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/leopard-trapped-in-wire-fence-rescued/article31829878.ece

Recently, 50 of them were provided with livelihood means. While most of them got jobs in power looms, hotels and construction units, a few started selling snacks and ice creams on pushcarts. When the rest 15 expressed willingness to start their own business, the couple mobilised funds through friends and philanthropists to purchase the items they required for self-employment. Corporation Commissioner M. Elangovan handed over these items to them on Friday. An ice cream vending machine, a watch repair shop, fancy and household items on a two-wheeler, a sewing machine, a footwear shop and garments were the means of livelihood that these persons were provided with. Recalling how he reached the school, K. Chandramohan (45) of Kumbakonam said he came in search of a job to Tiruppur in the first week of March, after which lockdown was announced. “I walked from Tiruppur to Erode and while taking rest outside the school, I found a few men standing near the gate who explained why they were here”, he said. He joined them and is now ready to sell garments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lockdown-hit-persons-provided-with-livelihood/article31829881.ece
15 June 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Burning issue of Achampathu||On Sunday afternoon, smoke was billowing from burning garbage at a dump adjoining the cremation ground at Achampathu. A portion of the garbage was also dumped inside Kiruthumal river, which runs adjacent to it, along the Madurai-Theni highway. The residents of Achampathu complain that the unscientifically dumped garbage is often set on fire and the smoke billows out from it, posing health hazards to them. An official from the Achampathu panchayat said that around three years back a huge pit with two divisions was formed near the cremation ground to segregate biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste. “However, it was not a workable model,” he said. Hence, they built cement cubical tanks for composting biodegradable waste and producing manure. “But, around six months back, the thatch roof of the cubical tanks caught fire,” he said. Since then, garbage has been dumped near and into Kiruthumal river and often set on fire, said K.K. Ambalavanan, a resident near the dump. “Everytime smoke comes out of the burning garbage, my 67-year-old mother, who is suffering from asthma, finds it difficult to breathe. We allow her to sit inside an air-conditioned room for some hours for her to recover,” he said. It is common to see garbage set on fire at least twice a week, said N. Kasi Viswanathan, who runs a shop near the dump. “An acrid smell of burning plastic hangs in the air even after the fire is put out,” he said. Mr. Ambalavanan said that ashes from the garbage spreads all over his house. “It is disheartening to see garbage being dumped inside Kirthumal river. Few decades back, clear water used to flow on this river. Now it has changed into a carrier of urban waste,” said Mr. Vishwanathan. Achampathu panchayat president J. Muthulakshmi said that they are working on a proposal to build a separate micro-composting unit there. “The officials are planning to clear waste and desilt Kiruthumal river. Once it is completed, we will start building the micro-composting unit. This will sort out all the issues,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/burning-issue-of-achampathu/article31830157.ece
15 June 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Over 20,000 samples collected: Collector||Madurai Collector T.G. Vinay on Sunday said testing had been stepped up since details of samples collected in each district — as on June 7 — were made public by the State government in a bulletin the same day. Mr. Vinay said 4,556 samples had been taken since then, taking the total count to 20,776. The State bulletin put the total number of tests conducted in Madurai district, as on June 7, at 14,102 . “But the actual number was 16,220 samples,” the Collector said. Individual labs, approved by Indian Council for Medical Research to update the numbers on its portal, did not do so with regard to the district’s figures, he pointed out. A Public Health Department source said at least 500 samples were tested daily over the last week. On June 12 and 13, over 900 tests were conducted. “There has been a steady increase in the collection of samples because of the inflow of returnees. We have stationed mobile health units on Soorapatti, Vadipatti and Madurai-Natham highway to test persons travelling by cars. Those who are travelling to Madurai by train from Villupuram can also be tested at Madurai junction. Regular checks at the airport are taking place too,” the source said. Within the Corporation limits, anyone with symptoms of influenza were being tested at fever clinics. Testing had been stepped up at primary health centres. A revenue official said there were at least 2,000 cars and minivans carrying hundreds of people into the district. “Although the ideal move will be to test every single vehicle, health workers are testing only those who have symptoms, especially cough, cold or fever. The symptoms need to be pronounced to get a test.” The Collector, however, said the administration would continue to ensure a steady increase in the number of tests of people at the district border.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/over-20000-samples-collected-collector/article31830161.ece
15 June 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Thazhampoo Kungumam’ sale loses lustre||A trip to the famed Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple would be incomplete for many devotees without purchasing ‘Thazhampoo Kungumam’ packets. Hundreds of shopkeepers around the temple make and sell ‘Thazhampoo Kungumam’ to devotees and tourists. However, due to COVID-19 lockdown, devotees have not been visiting the temple, resulting in almost no sale of kungumam packets. P. Pandiarajan, whose family has been making ‘Thazampoo Kungumam’ for the past three generations, says that the kungumam, unique to Madurai, commands a good market throughout the country. “It is preferred by customers for its colour, quality and fragrance,” he says. Many families prepare it on a small scale at their homes. In the recent years, some big companies have also started manufacturing it. Some shopkeepers buy the kungumam from them and repack it for sale, he says. In the absence of temple festivals, grand weddings, functions and devotees, only a few customers are buying smaller quantities, says R. Uma, who makes the kungumam at her residence in Gopala Kothan Street. The lockdown has also affected the sale of kungumam packets to other States like Karnataka, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh, says Mr. Pandiarajan. “While 90% of the sales occur around the temple, a few shopkeepers also sell it to temples across the country and to customers, who hail from Madurai but are settled in other parts of the country,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lockdown-hits-sales-of-madurais-thazhampoo-kungumam/article31829848.ece
15 June 2020||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||No work, no income for orchestra musicians||Under normal circumstances, orchestra musicians would have performed at some event or the other between March and May every year. However the COVID-19 lockdown has robbed them of their means to a livelihood this year and has left many of them in penury. “We used to perform in temples and weddings and had an assured income. With no work for the last 80 days, our instruments are rusting and voice of our singers has become feeble. We don’t know how to take our lives forward,” says J.B. Vijay, president of Tamil Nadu Medai Mellisai Kalaignargal Sangam in Madurai. Since the lockdown began, lives of several performers have been seriously affected. While some are worrying about their children’s education, others are regretting over having wasted money on buying new instruments earlier this year. “Had we known about the lockdown, we would have saved the money,” Mr. Vijay says. S. Mathiazhagan, secretary of the association, says artistes do slip into nostalgia of the good old days, as the going is bad now. “Last year was particularly good. There were many functions, conferences and marriages. The presence of a live orchestra for many is a show of opulence,” he says. Mr. Mathiazhagan says they perform for seven months in a year and save the money to see them through the rest of the year. “Now, people will be prudent about their spending and may not hire us. This is something we are unprepared for,” he says. Mr. Vijay says the only way to get out of the slump is to ensure that they begin performing again at weddings. “At events, nobody comes near an orchestra. We will be about 12 musicians on stage. We will ensure social distancing,” he says. He is worried that the lockdown will drive performers away from this profession. However, any new job will have to be learnt from scratch, he says. “Getting up on stage and entertaining people are our only skills,” he says. He adds that there is no welfare board for them to get assistance from the State government. The association submitted petitions to Collector T. G. Vinay and Revenue Minister R. B. Udayakumar. “Hope they can empathise with us as they would have hired musicians for their family functions,” Mr. Vijay says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-work-no-income-for-orchestra-musicians/article31830159.ece
15 June 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Two arrested for bike theft||Subramaniapuram police have arrested K. Vijayan alias Samuel, 38, pastor of a church at Thanakkankulam, for stealing bikes. Investigation showed that Samuel pledged the two-wheelers with a second-hand vehicle dealer, Selvam, 42, in Tirupparankundram. He too was arrested. Samuel, who was running the church for the last few years, could not make both ends meet. Hence, he resorted to stealing bikes, especially women’s scooters with keys in the ignition. He parked his bike nearby and rode away with the stolen two-wheeler. He returned later to get his bike, police said. A crime police team, led by Inspector S. Priya, launched a search after six bikes were reported missing in Subramaniapuram in the last six months. The breakthrough came when a then sub-inspector, A. Jai Sankar, chanced upon a photo and video footage of a suspect in bike theft cases. When he took a motorbike, stolen in March, for repair to a workshop, the mechanic noted his details. After ascertaining Samuel’s whereabouts, a special team picked him up at Thanakkankulam. Eleven stolen motorbikes, six from Subramaniyapuram, four from S.S. Colony and one from Tirumangalam, were recovered.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-arrested-for-bike-theft/article31830152.ece

15 June 2020||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry CM mulls bringing back curbs||Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Sunday mooted restoration of some of the lockdown restrictions to prevent COVID-19 cases spiralling out of control. Addressing a press conference, Mr. Narayanasamy said that the measures to be taken would be decided at a meeting on Tuesday. Expressing despair over the failure to adhere to physical distancing or PPE norms in public places, he urged the public and the trading community to proactively adopt measures to help the administration in checking the spread of the pandemic. With the number of active COVID-19 cases increasing every day, the government has been hardpressed to increase the strength of doctors, nurses, ASHA workers and ANMs in the government hospitals and to procure equipment such as testing kits and medicines. The government will appoint doctors and other medical personnel on a contract basis to augment health manpower to tackle the pandemic, the Chief Minister said. Hits out at Centre Mr. Narayanasamy slammed the Centre for failing to release funds to Puducherry and other States to tackle the pandemic crisis. Pointing out that the Centre was duty-bound to bail out the states during the current alarming situation, the Chief Minister said the failure to provide funds was causing great hardships to Puducherry. The UT which had already suffered drastic decline in revenue because of the lockdown was in crisis because of the lack of fund support or GST payment from the Centre. Mr. Narayanasamy said he would flag the financial crunch faced by the administration at the video conference convened by Prime Minister on June 16-17.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/puducherry-cm-mulls-bringing-back-curbs/article31829854.ece

15 June 2020||RAMESWARAM,TAMIL NADU||Poor catch, say fishermen||After nearly three months of fishing ban period and the COVID-19 lockdown, the fishermen who ventured into sea for fishing on Saturday and returned on Sunday, claimed that the catch was moderate and not exciting as it used to be. Attributing climate change and lesser working hours in the sea, fishermen association leader Jesu Raja said that the factors against the fishermen had resulted in very little catch this season. Though the governments had announced June 1 for fishing, the fishermen in this region decided to venture into the sea only in mid-June as they wanted time to repair their boats and also prepare for the fishing during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The catch, according to the fishermen, was far lower than the earlier seasons. “Usually, after the annual fishing ban period of two months, when we venture into the sea, each fisherman would return with at least 400 to 500 kilograms of fish and prawns. This time, we could get only 150 to 200 kgs,” said Antony, a fisherman. Moreover, the climate change too had played a spoilsport for them, he added. Another fisherman pointed out that they would normally set off into the sea for more than a day or two, while this time, they returned within 20 hours. Hence, the catch was not as expected. A fisheries department official said that the physical distancing was adhered to by the fishermen at the market place and those who returned to the shore were directed to wear face masks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/poor-catch-say-fishermen/article31830146.ece

15 June 2020||THENI,TAMIL NADU||Producers pour milk on road protesting Aavin attitude||Milk Producers Unions in the district have expressed concern and disappointment over the lackadaisical attitude of some Aavin officials here. To show their protest, some of the milk producers poured milk on Bypass Road. “At least 5,000 litres of milk was poured on the road,” said a policeman at the intersection. This was the second day that the milk producers staged the demonstration on Sunday, he added. When The Hindu contacted the members of the milk producers’ union here, they said after the State government announced certain relaxation in COVID-19 lockdown, they started supplying milk to Aavin. Every day, Aavin, procured around 1 lakh litres. With COVID-19 pandemic, many milk producers suffered huge loss and the refusal to procure milk from the registered unions irked them, they said. The members also said Aavin had reduced procurement price from Rs. 31 to Rs. 27 per litre citing COVID-19 pandemic and poor quality of milk. However, when contacted, an Aavin official, requesting anonymity, said they had a capacity to procure up to 1.20 lakh litres daily. Two days ago, there was some fault in the chilling plant and milk producers were fully aware of it. But Aavin had already procured 1.32 lakh litres. Hence, it returned about 7,000 litres. The milk producers were also informed that Aavin would compensate for the loss. The official said they also supplied 90,000 litres of milk to Madurai Aavin and another 45,000 litres to Kancheepuram and Thiruvannamalai districts. It took three days for the tankers to return. Any delay in this routine might complicate the cycle as the chilling facility had to be enhanced at the plant here, he said.  A functionary of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam alleged that a prominent politician in the district and his family members who had a role in the functioning of Aavin were aware of the issues, but were not keen on solving them. “They were more interested in encouraging private players in the milk industry,” he claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/producers-pour-milk-on-road-protesting-aavin-attitude/article31830144.ece

The entire inflow would be stored for a few hours. Arrangements were in place to open the shutters of Grand Anicut at 11 a.m. on Tuesday. The regulator at Mukkombu across the Cauvery has been checked and fine-tuned for opening the shutters. The water release into the Cauvery river would in no way affect the construction work of a new regulator at Mukkombu across the Kollidam river, official sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cauvery-water-crosses-mayanur-barrage/article31830211.ece
15 June 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||HM, son held for poaching||A Forest Department team arrested a headmistress of a govt. school and her 30-year-old son under the Wildlife Protection Act. They were charged with poaching wildlife. The charge against headmistress Lakshmi (53) was that she had cooked meat of animals allegedly poached by her son Prabhu alias Kavikumar. Lakshmi was the headmistress of a govt. middle school at Neyikulam. The crime came to light based on an information that Kavikumar’s Facebook account had photographs of him poaching and consuming the meat. Acting on this information, a Forest Department team went to his house at Padalur near Siruganur and conducted inquiries with mother and son. It was said that Kavikumar had a hunting dog and used to hunt in Nedungur reserve forest. He is alleged to have hunted a hare, deer and a wild boar. The team seized a cell phone containing video clips, head lights, mutton chopper, and a rechargeable headlight from his house. A senior official said it also came to light that Kavikumar had been having an online chat with a group named Pakistan Hunting Club. Officials said that Lakshmi was aware of the offence being committed by her son and used to cook the meat of animals poached by her son. The Forest Department arrested the mother and son on Friday and got them remanded in judicial custody on Saturday. A case was registered under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 read with section 66 (A) of the Information Technology Act, 2000. The duo was produced before the Judicial Magistrate court at Lalgudi and remanded. The woman was lodged in the Special Prison for Women, while Kavikumar was lodged in Central Prison, Tiruchi. Based on information provided by Kavikumar, the team arrested one Mahalingam (58) and seized from him a country gun.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hm-son-held-for-poaching/article31830213.ece

15 June 2020||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Concern over leucism among wildlife in Nilgiris||A leucistic Indian gaur has become the latest animal in the Nilgiris to have been recorded with the rare genetic condition. Over the last few years, leucism — a condition which causes partial loss of pigmentation and manifests itself in a change in the skin pattern of the animal — has been recorded in two tigers, a Sambar deer, and even a three-striped palm squirrel in the Nilgiris. This has raised concerns among environmentalists that the fragmentation and isolation of wildlife populations could be driving the prevalence of the condition among species in the upper Nilgiris. A. Samson, a research biologist at the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), who had recorded albinism in a three-striped squirrel in Gudalur and photographed a leucistic Sambar deer in the Nilgiris, said that the genetic mutation that causes leucism, albinism and melanism among wildlife populations could be due to a number of underlying factors. “The mutation could be caused by a number of factors, including in-breeding, pollution, environmental alterations, low-quality diet or follicular damage,” Mr. Samson said. The expression of these genetic mutations could signify a much more serious problem that needs to be addressed, he added. “The fact that we are witnessing leucism or albinism among wildlife populations in the Nilgiris is not a good sign. Animals with these mutations may not only be genetically predisposed to contracting certain diseases due to a compromised immune system, but also face the prospect of having a reduced chance of survival in the wild due to a lack of camouflage,” he explained. “Lack of genetic diversity among mating populations of a species is a major factor behind leucism and albinism among wildlife,” said B. Ramakrishnan, assistant professor at the Department of Zoology and Wildlife Biology of the Government Arts College in Udhagamandalam. “The upper Nilgiris is primarily comprised of 80% grassland and 20% Shola forests. With grasslands being destroyed, corridors connecting different habitats and populations too have been disturbed, and in many cases, completely severed,” Mr. Ramakrishnan said. “As populations of wildlife have become more isolated, it would not be a surprise to learn that there is a lot of in-breeding taking place, resulting in these mutations,” he said. The only way to ensure genetic diversity was to restore destroyed wildlife corridors, which will facilitate the mixing of different populations, he said. Forest Department officials in the Nilgiris division said that more research was needed to determine whether there was a higher rate of leucism or albinism manifesting in wildlife populations in the upper Nilgiris.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/biologists-flag-mutation-in-nilgiris-wildlife/article31829856.ece

After movement of elephant herd was noticed in the area, officials have increased night patrolling and villagers have been made aware against venturing out in the dark. They have been told to alert officials, if elephant movement is noticed. Recently, a herd of five elephants from Erode forest ranges camped in tapioca and corn farmlands within Mettur forest range. Forest officials later drove them away with the help of Erode forest personnel, revenue and police officials and villagers. District Forest Officer R. Murugan said that trenches have been set up here to check elephant movement and to prevent them from damaging farmlands. He added that a special team has been formed to conduct regular patrolling in the area to check elephant movement. According to forest officials, a seven-member team has been formed to conduct patrolling, besides 25 anti-poaching watchers.

This was the first COVID-19 related death reported in the district. According to health officials, the patient was admitted to the hospital on June 12 after her test results returned positive for the disease. Officials said the patient had travelled to Velankanni recently and tests were conducted after she suffered from fever. During contact tracing by health team, the patient’s husband, a sanitary worker with the Salem Corporation, and their two children also tested positive for COVID-19 and are undergoing treatment at the hospital here. According to city health officials, the funeral was conducted following COVID-19 protocol and the body was packed with double body cover and each layer was thoroughly disinfected. Officials said that the body was cremated and staff at the cremation centre were provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. The husband and two children of the deceased were allowed to attend the funeral wearing PPE and were taken back to the hospital. City health officials said that extensive contact tracing is being conducted and persons in the neighbourhood have been provided with immunity-building concoction. Officials said that they are maintaining strict surveillance in the area. In Krishnagiri, a 63-year-old armed forces veteran died due to COVID-19 during the late hours of Saturday. Health officials said the patient was admitted to Krishnagiri Government Hospital on Saturday morning and his samples were collected for COVID-19 tests. V.

Authorities are now looking for potential sites that can be converted into such facilities. "As of now, we can accommodate about one lakh COVID-19 patients, who are moderately or mildly symptomatic, in school and college buildings and the like. But, it is better to arrange for more such facilities in case more cases are reported," the senior official said. A major challenge facing the Tamil Nadu government in terms of beds reserved for COVID-19 patients in government and private hospitals is the duration of hospitalisation. "On an average, a patient with severe symptoms requires a bed for about 10 days. This means that a bed will be occupied for 10 days when over 1,500 fresh cases are being reported daily," he said. The status of health infrastructure in the State is being monitored daily and the number of beds needed and beds available calculated every single day, he said. Epidemiologists have informed the government that ‘herd immunity’ in the State is possible only if 55% to 60% of the population contracts a mild infection. “It means there will be many more cases and the idea is to keep the spread slow to ensure our health infrastructure is sufficient,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-identifying-places-to-set-up-care-centres/article31829859.ece

Removal of the concrete dump by the department promptly has helped in smooth movement of vehicles. Saravanan Natesan Puthanampatti   Absence of a protection wall for the sewage running along the roadside at Karumandapam on Dindigul highway poses a threat to vehicle users. Road users have a constant fear of meeting with an accident at the spot. Intervention by the authorities concerned will be helpful. X. Rosario Rajkumar  Karumandapam   With COVID-19 virus being highly contagious, it is necessary to refuse handshake or physical contact to greet others. Fortunately, the country’s tradition of greeting people with folded hands will keep the people safe. It will be ideal if the people adapt to the method of greeting others by waving, nodding, or placing the hand over the heart. The traditional way of greeting with folded hand is slowly becoming the accepted norm the world over and replacing the conventional handshake. M. A. Aleem  Tiruchi   Physical distancing is not apparently being followed scrupulously in all government offices. At the tax collection office in Abhisekapuram, for instance, no one follows the physical distancing protocol for preventing the spread of COVID-19 virus though circles are marked in gaps of one metre. Likewise, at the Main Post Office, senior citizens at the cash payment counter do not maintain distancing. Unfortunately, the seating arrangement is also not conducive for physical distancing. The spread of the virus can be brought under control only if these shortcomings are rectified by the authorities without any room for laxity. Kanagaraj Arthur  Ramalinganagar South Extension    Inter-city and inter-State travel should be permitted only after August 2020. Countries in Western Europe lost many lives in the absence of proper social distancing and screening in the initial months. These countries have opened their borders for travel only after six months. India being a highly-populated country, needs to be even more careful as otherwise it will become difficult to handle the surge in the number of COVID- 19 positive cases. Prevention and control is the key factor to tackle this epidemic of immense proportions. Those who do not cooperate with the initiatives of the healthcare officials must realise that they are doing so at their own peril. T. M. Ranganathan  Srirangam    Relaxations are being announced at a time when there is escalation in the number of COVID-19 positive cases, lulling people into a sense of complacency. One could see the people letting down their guard gradually with regard to social distancing and wearing face masks during travel or while shopping at commercial establishments. People need to realise that this is the time when extreme caution must be exercised. Vetrivel  Tiruchi   Against the backdrop of increase in COVID-19 positive cases triggering panic, the government has to expand scope for conduct of tests by authorising labs and government hospitals, besides creating facilities for testing at government offices. Since Covid tests are mandatory for conduct of any medical procedure in private hospitals, it becomes difficult for patients to wait in queues in front of the medical college hospital. In Thanjavur, for instance, increasing facilities for Covid-19 testing will also prevent crowding at the Medical College Hospital. J. Eden Alexander  Thanjavur   Since e-pass is mandatory for inter-district movements, the government has a responsibility of responding swiftly to the travel needs of people for emergency situations. It would be better if death certificate is not insisted upon. Instead, the undertaking given by the local competent authorities must be accepted. For example, a letter from the hospital concerned must be accepted, so that the people do not face difficulties in travel. S. Krishnan  Thippirajapuram   Parking of vehicles on both sides at Big Bazaar Street along the stretch extending from Gandhi Market to Rock Fort Temple is causing severe traffic congestion. Alongside refusing permission for parking vehicles on the roadside, the local authorities must also make the stretch a one-way in the interests of the general public. M. Raja  Tiruchi   Hygiene has taken a beating at the Cantonment area due to waste piling up everywhere. Removal of garbage bins for the purpose of waste segregation at source has not worked in Warners Road where water canals are clogged with plastic waste. So much so for the city that once enjoyed the privilege of top-ranking for cleanliness. It is time the city regained its past glory. Amjad Salman Cantonment   Benwells Road, a prominent landmark in cantonment area has a board titled ‘litter-free street’ at the entrance. But right from the beginning of the street, huge heaps of garbage can be found. The garbage dumps are breeding grounds for various diseases. Concrete steps are necessary to make the street litter-free in the real sense of the term. S. Raghavan Cantonment   Uyyakondan Thirumalai on Vayalur Road is a growing neighbourhood with several residential colonies springing up over the last few years. Though the population in the area has gone up, a full-fledged post office has not been opened as yet. The extension office of the Postal Department offers only limited services.

15 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Council polls: political activity to gain momentum from today||Political activity over the selection of candidates to contest in the elections to seven seats in the Legislative Council is set to gain momentum. The elections are scheduled for June 29. While the BJP’s core committee is set to meet on Monday to identify candidates for the four seats the party can win, Congress leaders are also meeting to make a shortlist of the names. A JD(S) legislature party meeting has been convened where the issue is likely to be discussed. The Congress can win two seats while the JD(S) can win one. The last date for filing ofnominations is Thursday. Sources in the BJP said the party was likely to accommodate only two legislators who crossed over to it, eventually leading to the toppling of the JD(S)-Congress coalition government last July. Party sources said that of the five former legislators who have thrown their hat into the ring, only two can be accommodated; the other two will be from within the saffron party. However, after the recent loss of face for the party’s regional leadership over the selection of candidates for Rajya Sabha seats, the core committee is expected to choose cautiously, sources said. In the Congress, sources said there were at least 20 leaders competing for the two seats. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah and Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president-designate D.K. Shivakumar are likely to meet on Monday to make a shortlist of candidates for recommendation to central leaders. “So far, leaders have not met to discuss the candidates. Whether the party will go for a caste combination or regional representation willbe discussed on Monday,” a source said. Meanwhile, the JD(S), whose leaders have been besieged with requests from former legislators for the single nomination, is likely to discuss the matter at the legislature party meeting. A senior legislator confirmed that the party was yet to decide on the candidates. He said the final decision would be taken by senior leaders H.D. Deve Gowda and H.D. Kumaraswamy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/council-polls-political-activity-to-gain-momentum-from-today/article31829797.ece
15 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Tourism sector sees signs of revival after the knock-down||The tourism sector has had a slow start since the Centre allowed opening on Monday, having missed out on a big ticket holiday period that is usually the summer vacation. This year, the holiday period coincided with the lockdown enforced to contain COVID-19. Having lost two peak holiday months, the sector is seeing a slow start with tourists trickling in. The Karnataka Tourism Forum (KTF) said the government nod for the sector to re-open after over two months of lockdown brought huge respite to the industry that is also a big avenue for employment. The few days so far, the forum said, have shown ‘encouraging signs of revival’ in leisure hotels and resorts, and the first weekend is seeming more optimistic. Seeking change “The frustration of having been locked down at home is making people now seek a change of scenario and drive to leisure destinations close to their cities. Kabini, Kodagu and Chikkamagaluru are seeing traction as far as bookings are concerned. Resorts have seen 30% to 35% occupancies, which is assuring, considering these were down to zero,” KTF president Sanjar Imam told The Hindu.  He also said the hotels have had ample time to prepare for reopening and have sensitised and trained their staff on SOPs as guided by the State government. Some hotels have also experimented with the pre-purchase model at discounted prices and have had encouraging to overwhelming responses, he added. “It is early days yet and there is euphoria towards opening up, so we will need to see how it plays out and if the booking trends sustain. Hopefully, precautions are practised strictly by both service providers and customers and one doesn’t see an escalation in infections. Karnataka has had a relatively low number of cases compared to other States and the hope is it will continue to stay this way. This will keep the travel industry optimistic,” Mr. Imam said. Travel not priority The Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) decided to open properties in a phase-wise manner, but has not seen much traction so far, though Jungle Lodges saw a good response. “It is slowly picking up, but occupancy is very poor. We have received about 30 bookings only and the occupancy rate is less than 10%. We expect travel and tourism to pick up slowly, but again it will be directly dependent on the spread of the virus in the State. We also need to understand that travel is not a priority for anyone right now,” explained Kumar Pushkar, MD, KSTDC. ‘In city travel’ Hotel chain OYO said they anticipate demand to slowly increase in States like Karnataka, and pointed to the trend of in-city travel. Higher hygiene standards, minimal-touch services, affordability and enhanced credibility top the list of consumer requirements.“We have seen a positive response to our hotels reopening with a significant part of this demand being driven by metro cities, including Bengaluru, Gurugram, Noida, Kolkata and Hyderabad. With most people opting for personal means of transport, bookings trends so far show guests’ preference towards same-city travel in these cities. We have seen an uptake in travellers opting for in-city staycations. A majority of the bookings are being made by SMEs and business travellers who are travelling inter-State to procure goods and services as businesses reopen under Unlock 1.0.,” said an OYO spokesperson. OYO also said the near future could see a boost in road trips and domestic tourism in the State with even ‘habitually international travellers’ turning to domestic tourist hubs such as Mysuru, Hampi, Karwar and Chikkamagaluru, as well as go on pilgrimages to Dharmasthala, Gokarna and Udupi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tourism-sector-sees-signs-of-revival-after-the-knock-down/article31829785.ece
15 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BMTC sees steady rise in ridership||The Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has reported a steady increase in daily ridership figures. In the last week alone, after it extended operations from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m., the bus transport corporation recorded over 10 lakh passengers. Daily ridership increased from 10,000 on the first day on May 19 to 7.2 lakh by June 1. On June 8, the number of commuters using BMTC buses crossed the 10-lakh mark. “On June 11, we had around 10.48 lakh passengers and on June 12, around 10.76 lakh,” a BMTC official said. The numbers, however, are low when compared to pre-lockdown days, when the daily ridership averaged at 35 lakh. “Even for 10 lakh commuters, we are operating over 4,800 buses every day so that we can ensure social distancing and provide services frequently,” said BMTC managing director C. Shikha. Prior to lockdown, the corporation was operating around 6,000 buses daily. Routes to Kengeri, K.R. Puram, Hoskote, Attibele, and Tumakuru Road are seeing higher ridership. “We do not know when we will return to complete normalcy. Ridership will gradually increase once more people report to work and schools and colleges re-open,” said another senior official. Penalty  BMTC will impose a fine of Rs. 500 on drivers and conductors who do not wear masks while on duty. A circular issued on Friday warned that strict action will be taken against those who are fined more than once.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bmtc-sees-steady-rise-in-ridership/article31829777.ece

15 June 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Parents protest ban on online learning||A group of parents in Karnataka, on Sunday participated in a ‘TweetStorm’ to protest the ban imposed by the State government on online classes for students up to class 7. In a span of three hours, more than 7,000 parents took to Twitter to voice their dissent with the hashtag #righttolearn. Many of them also tagged Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar and urged him to revoke the ban. Parents argued that the government’s decision went against a child’s right to education and violated their right to decide what was best for their children. Online learning has divided parents with many also opposing it. The government has formed a committee to frame guidelines on the dos and don’ts of online learning and to ensure that children who do not have access to smartphones and laptops are not left behind.

15 June 2020||Benglauru,KARNATAKA||Malls remain empty as wary citizens stay indoors||The first weekend since malls reopened after a lockdown of over two months did not go as retailers had hoped. Footfall was low as citizens, wary of the rising number of positive cases, remained at home on both Saturday and Sunday. Anbu Kumar, a parking assistant at a mall, summed it up best. “It was very hard to find parking for even a bike on Sunday evenings. But today, the parking lot is empty.” Though malls have implemented several precautionary measures, including sanitisation tunnels, mandatory masks and digital payments for contact free shopping, patrons are worried. “Many feel that the city unlocked is more risky than the one under lockdown. There is pressure from within families on those who want to step out,” said Ramesh Babu, a senior manager at a clothing store in a mall in the city. Not all shops have opened for business, and retailers say that around 30% are still shut. “Business is not viable even with restrictions eased. So many have decided to open their outlets only after footfall improves,” said Mr. Babu. Uday Garudachar, who owns the chain of Garuda Malls — three in the city and one in Mysuru, said it may be at least a year before business picks up in malls. “For instance, at Garuda Mall off M.G. Road, we did an average business in the range of Rs. 90 lakh to Rs. 1.1 crore during weekdays, and Rs. 1.5 crore to Rs. 2 crore on weekends. The first day the mall was reopened on June 8, the total business was less than Rs. 10 lakh, which peaked to around Rs. 30 lakh on Saturday,” he said. He pegged the business turnover to be 10-15% of pre-COVID times this past week. The situation is bleak for other malls, too. The few people who visited malls on Sunday said they were frustrated being indoors for several months. “We cannot let COVID-19 to rule us with fear. We need to return to normal lives but with adequate precautions. My parents were apprehensive when we came out today. But there are no people here and it seems safe,” said Shubha R., a resident of Malleswaram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/malls-remain-empty-as-wary-citizens-stay-indoors/article31829781.ece

Such centres should be set up in all urban and rural primary health centres, she said. Further, Ms. Deepa asked the officials of the Department of Health and Family Welfare to arrange for gathering information about those visiting hospitals and pharmacies with complaints of cold, cough and fever, trace them and help them undergo COVID-19 test. Besides, she said, Arogyasetu App should be utilised to trace persons with COVID-19 symptoms and make them undergo test. In case such persons fail turn up for testing, the local Health Department staff, anganwadi workers and ASHAs should go to such persons for personal verification, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dharwad-to-have-more-swab-collections/article31829963.ece
15 June 2020||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Many historical sites in famed Halebid cry out for attention||While Halebid is a much-visited tourist spot, vast areas around the Hoysaleshwara and the Jain temples have remained unexplored. Though a couple of temples, a fortification around the township and traces of an ancient water-management system are visible among the ruins, a lack of attention by the local administration has led to private constructions and cultivation in this archaeologically important locality. As of now only the Hoysaleshwara Temple at Halebid, once the capital of the Hoysala kingdom, is popular, attracting hundreds of devotees from different places. “If we excavate the ruins, we will get more details to study the people’s lifestyle during the Hoysala rule,” said Aravazhi P., an assistant archaeologist of Archaeological Survey of India. He has been researching the Hoysala period out of his interest. The entire Halebid township existed within a fort, with temples and other buildings. Fort remains Even today, remains of the fort can be seen, though some entrances have been covered by overgrowth over the years. A stone duct, which is intact even today, connects the fort to the historical Dorasamudra tank. “This duct is an outlet for the rainwater that collected in the township. Besides that, there are three ponds, one below the other, within the township. The design is such that the water flowing from the top is filtered by the time it reaches the bottom pond. We need to study all these things,” he said. The village settlement around the Jain Temple (Basadi) is called Bastihalli. While walking in the agricultural fields there, one can easily find ruins of an old temple being neglected. Another historical temple, the Lakkada Veeranna Temple, has been demolished to build a new one. “Going by the remnants of the temple seen, it must be a Jain temple,” said Mr. Aravazhi. The temple is now amidst maize fields. The ASI has control over only the monuments in the town, while the rest of the area remains unprotected. “Unless the local authorities become aware of the historical importance of the place, it is difficult to protect the area. Cultivation has been allowed and some concrete structures have also come up in the unexplored area. It is not right to blame the local people. The local administration has a role in protecting the area,” the officer said. Encroaching upon the erstwhile palace area, a resident of the town is building a house. A portion of the outer structure of the palace grounds has been disturbed for the construction. The local officers of ASI have brought this to the notice of local panchayat and Revenue Officers. However, there has been no action to stop the work. P. Kishore Kumar Reddy, Conservation Assistant of Hassan Sub-Circle (ASI), told The Hindu that the local officers had complained to the police about the encroachment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/many-historical-sites-in-famed-halebid-cry-out-for-attention/article31829804.ece
15 June 2020||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Cameras to monitor COVID-19 patients in isolation wards||The government has decided to install high-quality cameras at all isolation wards in the State to create uniform treatment protocol and close monitoring of every single COVID-19 patient, Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar has said. After chairing a review meeting on COVID-19 situation he was speaking to presspersons in Kalaburagi on Sunday. Dr. Sudhakar said that the State government launched Tele-ICU service two months ago and now, by installing cameras at isolation centres which will be connected to an ICU Care Centre at Bengaluru, from where critical care specialists will monitor a patient’s condition and review him remotely through an online monitor. “Both the Tele-ICU and installation of cameras will go hand-in-hand and help doctors in creating a uniform treatment protocol, reducing alarm response time,” he added. Providing COVID-19 data, Dr. Sudhakar said that the death rate due to coronavirus in the State was 1.1 percent, which is lower than the national figure of 2.8 %. The State’s recovery rate is 53.4 percent. As much as 94% of active cases are asymptomatic, he added. “Cumulatively, 4,35,458 tests have been done so far, of which 6,824 tested positive for COVID-19. Of those who tested positive, 3,648 people have recovered. As on June 13, there were 3,176 active cases in the State of which only 188 of them are symptomatic and 2,988 people are asymptomatic for the infection. Around 94 % of active cases do not have COVID-19 symptoms. Of the 188 patients, only 15 of them are in ICU across the State — 11 in Bengaluru, two in Bidar and one each in Kalaburagi and Mandya district.” he explained. Initially, there were only two COVID-19 testing laboratories, now the State government has set up 71 laboratories. So far, Kalaburagi district has reported 833 cases, of which 780 cases were reportedly migrants who returned from other States. Only 97 cases have been reported in the district. Refuting the allegations that the State government had delayed in bringing back migrants stranded in other States, Dr. Sudhakar said that the State was the first to impose lockdown and limit the COVID-19 outbreak with aggressive surveillance and quarantine strategy. He also directed the officials of the Health and Family Welfare Department to create awareness among the people about the revised guidelines for quarantine and encourage them to visit fever clinics. Replying to a query, Dr. Sudhakar said that as per the regulations of the Indian Council of Medical Research all medical colleges and hospitals should have COVID-19 testing laboratory.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cameras-to-monitor-covid-19-patients-in-isolation-wards/article31829958.ece

15 June 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Pandemic forces homestays in Kodagu to register themselves||The post-COVID-19 era has provided a window of opportunity to unauthorised homestays in Kodagu to get registered with the Tourism Department to continue to be in the hospitality sector and for hassle-free operations. For, the Kodagu district administration has issued permission only to registered homestays to operate from June 8 after the lockdown curbs were eased. With this, unregistered ones have no option but to fall in line, submitting relevant certificates and documents if they wish to continue in the tourism business. In view of more powers vested on the district authorities under the Disaster Management Act to combat the pandemic, the homestay market is expected to be reigned in to make tourists’ stay safe and protected. As many as 800 homestays had registered with the department so far and over 450 of them had received certificates as well. The registration was done online with a simple procedure. Deputy Commissioner Annies Kanmani Joy has warned of legal action against unregistered homestays if they flout rules and operate. The taluk-wise registered homestays can be accessed by visiting http://kodagu.nic.in/en/tourism /accomodation Speaking to The Hindu , Assistant Director of Tourism Raghavendra said inquiries from homestay operators had increased after the warning. “Many want to register now after the SOPs were issued and are asking us the procedure. It’s a simple process with a fee of Rs. 500. The department has been empowered to book cases if they do not comply with the rules,” he added. Mr. Raghavendra said people can report the operation of illegal homestays to the department for immediate action. “The department is ready to facilitate registration provided the documents are valid,” he said. Unconfirmed reports and estimates said Kodagu has over 4,000 homestays with about 20,000 rooms. Nearly 50-60% of them are being operated without valid licences. Kodagu Home Stays’ Association president B.G. Ananthashayana said the association has 300 members whose properties had been registered and operated lawfully. “The DC has promised action this time,” he added. Homestays are eligible to get registered if they have a maximum of five rooms and a minimum of two with attached bathroom, ample parking and CCTV surveillance. The property owner should reside on the same premises and the guests should have ample space to move around. The NOC from the jurisdictional gram panchayat and the police are a must for approval. The approval is valid for five years. Last year, after the floods, the department during a safety audit rejected approval for some homestays as it found them located in unsafe conditions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pandemic-forces-homestays-in-kodagu-to-register-themselves/article31829790.ece
15 June 2020||MYSuRU,KARNATAKA||KAT order on pay parity not yet executed||The Karnataka Administrative Tribunal (KAT) directive to the State government to revise the pay scale of Deputy Range Forest Officers (DRFOs), to bring it on a par with what their counterparts in other departments get, is yet to be implemented. The order came in respect to a petition filed in 2016 under Section 19 of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, by seven DRFOs seeking a revision of the pay scale with all consequential benefits.The crux of the issue revolved around the equal qualification prescribed for various posts for recruitment and the disparity in pay scales. The prescribed qualification for the post of DRFO was B.Sc. in Forestry from a recognised university (or B.Sc. with two or more of the following subjects — Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Botany, Zoology, Geology, Microbiology, Biotechnology, or Biochemistry). The counsel for the petitioners had argued that the government cannot discriminate by fixing different pay scales for employees in different departments such as Police, Horticulture and Agriculture, when the appointments are based on similar academic qualifications. The government pleader had argued that the nature of the work of DRFOs was different from that of Assistant Agricultural Officers/Assistant Horticultural Officers. Arguing that enhancement of pay scale for any particular post would only be granted on the recommendation of the pay commission, the government sought that the petition be quashed. The tribunal ruled in favour of the petitioners. The final order was issued on January 10, 2020. It said that the pay scale fixed for DRFOs at Rs. 12,500 to Rs. 24,000 could not be justified and directed that it be enhanced to Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 36,300, besides the grant of consequential benefits accruing from it.  The State government was instructed to implement the orders within six months from the date of issue of order.The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Head of Forest Forces (PCCF-HoFF) wrote to the Additional Chief Secretary on May 19, drawing his attention to the issue. But there are no signs of a pay scale revision as of now. Sources said that if implemented, the pay scale would benefit nearly 2,200 DRFOs in the Forest Department posted across the State. DRFOs are recognised as frontline staff in the conservation and preservation of forests, vested with the responsibility of taking measures to ward off forest fires, maintaining vigil in anti-poaching camps, and guarding wildlife from poachers, apart from taking stock of wildlife raiding agricultural fields and handling conflict situations. “Though the job is as risky and strenuous as that of the police, the pay scales are below that of the likes of Assistant Horticultural Officers,” said a source, adding that pay parity would help boost the morale of the fieldstaff.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kat-order-on-pay-parity-not-yet-executed/article31829800.ece
15 June 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||ODL students already enrolled in various universities can complete courses||Students admitted to open distance learning (ODL) courses in conventional universities in the State will be permitted to complete their academic programmes as scheduled, even though the universities have no option but to discontinue the courses, with the Mysuru-based Karnataka State Open University (KSOU) getting the exclusive right to offer distance education courses hereafter. Many State universities, including the University of Mysore (UoM), had introduced ODL courses. But KSOU took objection and urged the government to stop them from doing so for its continued existence. The State Cabinet recently decided to confine ODL courses to the State’s lone open university. The decision will see conventional universities withdraw their courses and no admissions can happen from the next academic year. KSOU had questioned the legality of conventional universities offering ODL courses when there is a university whose sole purpose is distance education. “When regular universities run ODL courses, what is the point in running an open university?” experts associated with ODL had asked. University of Mysore Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar told The Hindu , “We will comply with the government’s decision. Those who enrolled in programmes this year and in previous years will be allowed to complete them. We may not be allowed to go for admissions from next year.” UoM currently has 11 ODL courses and had plans to establish 20 study centres in colleges coming under its jurisdiction to facilitate admissions. This way, it wanted to attract more students. The ODL courses were introduced two years ago. KSOU’s woes KSOU, which had a vast studentbase before its de-recognition by the University Grants Commission (UGC) in 2015, started a new inning after its recognition was restored in 2018. But it did not attract the kind of admissions it used to draw in the past. An anxious KSOU management sought the government’s intervention for retaining its identity and purpose. Sources told The Hindu that conventional universitiessuch as UoM had introduced ODL programmes after getting the UGC nod. “We did not flout any rule…started admissions with due clearances,” a university official said. At present, about 33,000 students pursue 36 or so courses at KSOU, which has set up 90 study centres and 19 regional centres across the State. KSOU has set a vision ofattracting a large number of students like it used to by introducing new courses and laying emphasis on quality education and inclusive self-learning material. KSOU Vice-Chancellor S. Vidyashankar said the Cabinet decision would protect KSOU’s identity, besides expanding its student base and providing all-encompassing self-learning material. “The sole right on ODL in the State rests with KSOU now. This will help us grow further, especially after the de-recognition episode,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/odl-students-already-enrolled-in-various-universities-can-complete-courses/article31829795.ece
15 June 2020||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||High Court moved against Hubballi-Ankola rail line project||Environmentalists have approached the High Court of Karnataka to stall the controversial Hubballi-Ankola railway line project, which was cleared by the State government in March. Sources said the petitioners have questioned the legality and the manner in which the project was pushed through in the State Board for Wildlife despite opposition to it, apart from underlining the environmental ramifications of the project. The petitioners will underline the fact that the project was rejected repeatedly by the State Board for Wildlife and expert committees, constituted by the Central Board for Wildlife, the sources added. The Forest Department too had rejected the project earlier on the grounds that it was environmentally disastrous. Felling of trees It will also result in the felling of nearly 3 lakh trees, according to environmentalists. An expert committee report, commissioned by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), had also rejected the project and questioned its economic and commercial viability. This was in the light of the decline in mining activities and the presence of an alternative railway line that already links the mining areas to the ports on both the west and east coasts. The project was first mooted in 1998, and in 2002 the Forest Department rejected the proposal as it entailed diversion of 1.3 lakh hectares of forest land in Uttara Kannada district. Between 2002 and 2014, the project was deliberated at various forum in the Forest Department, by the Central Empowered Committee of the Supreme Court and was rejected. It was rejected by the National Board for Wildlife on two occasions and faced opposition in the State Board for Wildlife when it came up for deliberations again. However, political leaders across party lines have backed the project brushing aside environmental considerations. Rich fauna The railway line alignment cuts through the wildlife habitat that is rich in highly endangered species, including tigers, elephants, lion-tailed macaques, gaurs, sloth bears, sambars, chitals, mouse deers, common giant flying squirrels, striped hyenas, jackals, common wolf, Indian fox, Indian porcupines, common mongoose, small Indian mongoose, hare, common langur, Indian pangolin, wild pig, chowsingha, black buck, toddy cat, jungle cat, bonnet macaque, among others. The ecosystem also harbours 650 tree species of which 352 are endemic, 157 species of reptiles, of which 62% are endemic. and 219 species of fish of which 53% per cent are endemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/high-court-moved-against-hubballi-ankola-rail-line-project/article31829811.ece

Addressing presspersons here, association representative Korangrapady Dayananda Kotian said that the tailors were already reeling under the onslaught of readymade dresses, and the lockdown had compounded their woes. Due to lockdown, celebrations and functions had stopped. As a result, tailors hardly got any orders to stitch clothes. Many of them were staring at a bleak future, he said. Mr. Kotian said that one of their colleagues, Raghunath Serigar (55), a tailor, had ended his life here on June 11 as he had no work and could not bear the financial hardship. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa should provide a relief of Rs. 5 lakh to the kin of the deceased, he said.

15 June 2020||Vijayapura,KARNATAKA||Kudgi plant sees slump in power generation||The nationwide lockdown has impacted electricity generation at the NTPC’s plant at Kudgi in Vijayapura district, which is NTPC’s only thermal plant in Karnataka. The Kudgi thermal power plant has three generating units, with a capacity of 800 MW each, and there has been a drastic slump in the power generation owing to a reduction in demand. According to the officials of NTPC-Kudgi, the plant generated only 212 million units (MU) of power since April, compared to the 1,353.423 MUs for the corresponding period in 2019. “This is the least power generated so far at the NTPC-Kudgi plant after its operations reached full capacity in September 2018,” said the official. “The huge quantity of electricity is mainly required by industries, corporate houses, public sector/service providing companies. These major electricity consumers remained shut and there is literally no demand for power,” the official said. It may be noted that as per an understanding between the NTPC and the State government, of the total electricity generated 50% is reserved for Karnataka as it has given the land. The remaining power is distributed to Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Kerala. Informing about the coal requirement for the plant, the official said that for producing 2,400 MW of power, the plant needs nine rakes of coal daily. He said that the situation may continue for a few more months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kudgi-plant-sees-slump-in-power-generation/article31829808.ece

15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||CoP||Getting all mixed up while briefing reporters on Cabinet decisions seems to be becoming something of a habit for Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy. In the latest case, last Thursday, the Minister announced as a “decision” an issue that was only discussed in the Cabinet. While briefing the media, he said that a decision had been taken on extending the ban on online lessons for students up to class 7. Sources in the Cabinet said that a few Ministers had merely discussed the issue in detail and suggested that it would be better if the ban in force till class 5 could be extended till class 7. After reading news published online, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar tweeted that extending the ban up to class 7 was “only a suggestion from a few Cabinet Ministers... not a decision”. In an earlier instance, Mr. Madhuswamy had said that the State had “banned” the entry of people from five States instead of saying that restrictions had been imposed.   While most people and leaders aged above 60 chose to remain indoors during the COVID-19 crisis, Kannada Chaluvali Vatal Paksha president Vatal Nagaraj (in picture) found a cause to stage a protest in front of the Vidhana Soudha. Mr. Nagaraj, 71, staged a protest last Thursday seeking a ban on online classes for primary and high school students and for the promotion of class 10 and class 12 students without examination. He argued that parents of students have no money because of the closure of all business activities and loss of jobs during the lockdown. As such, he said, they cannot afford online classes. He said that some school managements have been denying passwords to log in for online classes and have been demanding the payment of a full year’s fee with donation. He also pointed out that a large number of students reside in rural areas with poor or no Internet connectivity.   MP for Dakshina Kannada and State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel, who got a lot of flak for the enormous delay in completion of the Pumpwell Flyover on NH-66 in Mangaluru, has been in the news these days for a contrasting reason. He has won praise for the record completion of a major bridge across river Phalguni near Gurupura in lieu of the nearly century-old dilapidated steel bridge on NH-169 connecting Manga-luru with Karkala via Moodbidri. Work on the Rs. 40-crore bridge commenced in February 2019, and the contractor had two years to complete it. However, while the civil works were completed by February this year, the finishing touches could not be given because of the COVID-19 lockdown thereafter. The bridge was inaugurated by Mr. Kateel and Minister Kota Srinivas Poojari last Friday, giving a breather to many road users.

15 June 2020||KALPETTA,KERALA||Greens express concern over sand mining||Environmental activists in the district have urged the district administration to withdraw its direction to civic bodies for mining sand from rivers in order to remove debris and silt to avoid flooding during monsoon. Speaking to The Hindu, N. Badusha, president of Wayanad Prakruthi Samrakshana Samithi, said civic bodies in the district had started sand mining from rivers and rivulets following the directive. But the major reason behind the flood-like situation the district witnessed in the past two years was the large-scale felling of trees on hill slopes for granite mining and construction of resorts, which resulted in landslips and flash floods, Mr. Badusha said. Unscientific filling of paddy fields for construction and opening of shutters of reservoirs like Banasura Sagar also resulted in it, he said. Some grama panchayats had started to remove silt and debris by bulldozing banks of rivers, Thomas Ambalavayal, secretary of the organisation, said. A sand audit had been conducted by the Centre for Water Resources Development and Management (CWRDM) in 2014 in Kabani river and its tributaries, and had recommended a total ban on sand mining. Sand audit Moreover, sand mining without a sand audit was against the existing norms and it would result in further depletion of groundwater level and lead to acute water shortage during summer, Mr. Ambalavayal said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/greens-express-concern-over-sand-mining/article31830081.ece

The sea conditions have been rough for a couple of days and it was decided that the dredger engaged by the contracting company would be brought closer to the shore. But the weather conditions deteriorated on Saturday night, resulting in the dredger breaking loose. Earlier efforts to hold it had failed. An official of the Irrigation Department said the incident occurred on Saturday night even as geotextile bags were being stacked to prevent sea erosion in places such as Velankanni, Bazaar, Vachakkal and Companyppadi. The geotextile tube works are being overseen by the Irrigation Department. The incident has once again affected the work to protect the coast of Chellanam from sea erosion. The present work was tendered for laying geotextile tubes along 1.10 km of the coast at a cost of Rs. 7.5 crore with an additional 20%, considering the delay due to various reasons including the lockdown. The demand for laying geotextile tubes or erecting bulwarks against coastal erosion has been a long standing one. The demand became louder after Cyclone Ockhi hit the shores of Chellanam in December 2017. The government had promised to complete the works to assuage the fears of the coastal village.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/work-to-lay-geotubes-on-chellanam-coast-suffers-setback-again/article31830089.ece

Hiked fee, health check-ups, and strict physical distancing norms are awaiting tourists at these centres, where they could once stroll freely. The lockdown culminated in huge revenue loss and denial of livelihood options to hundreds of workers engaged by the Eco Development Committees (EDC) and Vana Samrakshana Samithi (VSS). Employing tribespeople The nearly 60 ecotourism centres of Kerala together employ around 5,000 persons, including tribespeople. With the closure of ecotourism activities, the service of a large number of persons, who were otherwise dependent on tourism for their livelihood, were used for forest protection activities, including fire protection, said a senior forest official. The employment of around 50 persons in the PTR for supporting tourism activities had to be limited to 15 days a month. An order from the Chief Wildlife Warden is required for resuming the activities, said K.R. Anoop, Field Director of the Reserve. 4,000 people a day The PTR is one of the top revenue earners in the State with an average annual income of Rs. 13 crore. During the peak season, the reserve attracts up to 4,000 people a day. Once the operations are resumed, strict procedures would have to be put in place for the visitors as well as employees, Mr. Anoop said. The park administration has sought revision of boat and bus fares and entry fee as they can be operated only with half the capacity. A government order revising the fares is awaited. Thermal scanners and steps for disinfecting the vehicles coming into the reserve have to be introduced. The employees should be provided with Personal Protective Equipment, which is cost-intensive, he said. Besides the EDC and VSS, there are a few local bodies such as Kumily, Munnar and Sultan Bathery that depend heavily on ecotourism centres for its revenue. The lives of millions of traders, workers, hoteliers and tourist vehicle operators of these local bodies have been in a quandary. The Forest Department would review the situation in these centres, said Surendrakumar, Chief Wildlife Warden.

Thomas, MLA, completed a survey of the Edappally-Thykoodam stretch on NH Bypass during the past few days to ascertain problems such as shabbily-maintained, flooded and encroached upon service roads, following which a samiti has been formed. The Edappally-Thykoodam NH Samrakshana Samiti attributed waterlogging in 20 locations on the stretch to canals and drains being replaced with pipelines. This affected the free flow of water, causing flooding on service roads and at some places even the NH Bypass. This could be overcome if culverts were built across the NH Bypass, said Mr. Thomas, who inspected the entire stretch by walking, accompanied by representatives of residents’ associations, councillors representing different corporation wards, and officials of the NHAI. Mr. Thomas said that service roads on the busy NH stretch were heavily encroached upon and being misused for illegal parking and dumping of abandoned vehicles. In addition to culverts, the NHAI must urgently build drains on service roads to prevent waterlogging. The samity would also act as a check on dumping of garbage and septic tank waste into service roads, Mr. Thomas added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mla-inspects-nh-stretch/article31830085.ece

Jackson was in Vienna and Fr. Jerin in Bengaluru. But they persisted and created the song “I can’t breathe”. It had attracted over 4,000 views when it was uploaded in the YouTube channel of Fr. Jackson. Plea before death The composition is steeped in Blues and Reggae, two music streams popular with the African-American community, and Fr. Jackson has used the falsetto style of rendering to capture the anguished plea of George Floyd before his death: ‘I can’t breathe’! An imaginative tweak of a likely conversation between the victim and his tormentor makes the rest of the song. “More than registering a protest, the idea was to convey the pain of that man as life was being sucked out of him. We didn’t want to dilute that emotion in anyway and that’s why we resisted the urge to mix the videos with snapshots of global protests over the incident,” said Fr. Jerin. The video shot in Vienna and Bengaluru, where Fr. Jackson and Fr. Jerin are doing their music courses, using mobile phones was mixed and edited under three days. Fulfilling The song has been emotionally fulfilling for its creators, but it seems to have evoked a mixed response among the audience. “Some of our own friends, especially in the IT sector, have been sceptical of sharing the video for fear that many of their ‘white’ clients won’t take it lightly. Shockingly, some people were not even aware of the incident until they watched our video,” said Fr. Jerin.

15 June 2020||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Kumarakom welcomes visitors||Nearly three months after the picturesque canal banks and the tree-lined pathways here suddenly turned desolate, Kumarakom is now opening its doors to visitors once again. The backwater village, home to a chain of luxury resorts and homestays, welcomed its first batch of guests after the COVID-19-induced lockdown when a four-member family from Kochi checked-in at a resort here on June 13. This was followed by a few more guest arrivals on Sunday. K. Arun Kumar, secretary, the Chamber of Vembanad Hotels and Resorts (CVHR), said at least five out of the 25 hotels in the region were preparing to receive guests in the coming days. “The hotel staff have been imparted training to work in the new landscape of face masks, temperature checks and social distancing,” he said. According to him, the travel and tourism industry in Kumarakom will look to build on its reputation as an international destination and remake its popular image as a destination for inter-State tour groups. “The cumulative loss for the tourism industry here over the last three months is estimated to be over Rs. 100 crore. Given the restrictions on international and inter-State travel, getting the business as usual will take a lot of time and for the time being, we are reorienting our focus towards the guests within the State,” he added. Commenting on the development, K. Rupesh Kumar, Coordinator, State Responsible Tourism Mission, said the agency had already begun to receive enquires on Kumarakom even from abroad. “As many as 180 foreign and 40 domestic enquiries have been received for December this year. We will be confirming these visits based on the directions of the government,” he said.  Huge blow The outbreak of COVID-19 in March dealt a huge blow to this internationally acclaimed village destination. The local economy too came to a standstill during the period, leaving the stakeholders such as artisans, tour guides, restaurants offering ethnic cuisine and the local transport operators in dire straits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kumarakom-welcomes-visitors/article31830195.ece

15 June 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Helping out deprived students||Students who were deprived of facilities to attend online classes across the Malabar region are getting good support from people and organisations. Apart from local groups, the trend now being popular as ‘TV Challenge’ is evoking hearty response from Non-Resident Keralites as well. Sreekanth, a native of Kodiyathur, is the latest beneficiary whose wish for electricity connection and a television set for his children got fulfilled within just 24 hours. Their plight was brought to light by a local journalist. It was after a wait of 16 years that the family got the power connection. Knowing their plight, the Mukkom police also decided to build a new house for the family. Sreekanth says they will be able to spare one of the new television sets they got for another family. A group of former students purchased 10 TV sets for students at Engapuzha. At Kakkodi, it was a co-operative society that came to the help of a needy student. Illath Jigeesh, an expatriate, says the gesture of an American woman was unforgettable. “The woman, named Gail Allison, was responding instantly to purchase four television sets when she came to know the struggle of students from Kannur’s Chala Government Higher Secondary School,” he said. In Malappuram, Kozhikode and Wayanad districts, libraries are opening up their facilities for students to attend online classes. V. Noushad, a resident of Thamarassery, says some youths are conducting simplified online classes for students who miss the formal online classes. Education Department officials say there are 650 common study centres in Kozhikode district ready to facilitate online classes from Monday. Minister for Excise and Labour T.P. Ramakrishnan will formally open the facility. About 4,500 students will be able to make use of the facility after maintaining the physical distancing norm.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/helping-out-deprived-students/article31830073.ece

15 June 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||As cases surge, govt. rolls out plans to decongest MCHs||In anticipation of a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases, the Health Department has decided to decongest Medical College Hospitals (MCHs), which are currently COVID-19 hospitals, by ensuring that all mild symptomatic and asymptomatic positive patients are referred back to COVID first-line treatment centres (CFTCs). All Category A patients (COVID-19 positive, mild symptoms but no fever) and the asymptomatic patients will be moved out of MCHs and accommodated in CFTCs in COVID-19 wards from next week onwards. Senior doctors at the MCH said that decongesting tertiary care hospitals was important to make more ICU space and nursing care available to severe or critically ill patients, whose numbers are sure to rise in the coming weeks as the epidemic peaks. Back referrals “Kozhikode MCH has already started back referrals and at present have only 12 patients. Thiruvananthapuram MCH on the other hand has nearly 200 patients in the COVID-19 pool (in individual isolation rooms) and another 45 positive patients. Nearly, 70-80% of them are Category A patients and need only careful observation,” a senior faculty at the MCH said. Even though the concept of CFTCs had been mooted two months ago with the aim of decongesting MCHs, back referrals were not happening as most of the CFTCs did not have proper in-patient facilities. At CFTCs, where medical assistance will be available round-the-clock, the doctors will assess and monitor the clinical condition of the patients systematically and consult the teams at the COVID-19 hospital for necessary advice and assistance. What is adopted is a hub and spoke model, wherein the COVID-19 hospitals will act as the hub and remain in close consultation with the CFTCs linked to it. If any patient progresses from Category A to Category B, the CFTC medical team, in consultation with hub-team will refer the patient to the COVID-19 hospital, if necessary. Oxygen levels Hypoxia or drop in oxygen saturation, resulting in insufficient oxygen to the cells being one of the danger signs of COVID-19, pulse oximetry will be performed twice in all the patients admitted to CFTCs. Any drop in oxygen saturation below 94% will be immediately moved to the linked COVID hospital. “The time is now right to activate CFTCs because the skill, expertise and human resources in tertiary care hospitals are better utilised for patients who really need it. CFTC teams can have tele-consultation with the linked COVID-19 hospitals and they have been given a clear check-list, which they can use in case they need to refer any patient to COVID-19 hospital,” a senior doctor said. The government’s plan is to hike the number of COVID-19 hospitals as well as the CFTCs linked to each, as per requirement, as the epidemic progresses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/as-cases-surge-govt-rolls-out-plans-to-decongest-mchs/article31830104.ece

A total of 2,263.18 acres of land need to be acquired from the private estate in the Kottayam-Pathanamthitta border. The proposed airport, the fifth international airport in the State, will be 2.5 km from the Theni-Kottarakara National Highway and close to Erumeli town. Government should issue notification for the consultant, Louis Berger Consulting Private Limited, to prepare the Detailed Project Report. “We have submitted the files to the government for issuing the notification,” Special Officer for Sabarimala airport V. Thulasidas told The Hindu . Surveys Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), soil survey and other surveys will have to be carried out for getting the mandatory clearance from various ministries of the Union government. A three-member committee, comprising the then Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue) P.H. Kurien, the then managing director of Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) M. Beena and the then Pathanamthitta District Collector R. Girija, tasked with site selection had recommended that the Cheruvally estate was the ideal spot. The estate located on the way to Sabarimala is 136 km from the State capital and 113 km from Kochi. The estate in Kanjirappally taluk, which is under litigation now, is mostly plain land, situated close to two National Highways and five PWD roads. “The terrain is good and this will make the job easy for us. The airport can be commissioned in three years,” Mr. Thulasidas, who is also the Managing Director of Kannur International Airprt Limited, said. In-principle nod The Cabinet had already given the in-principle approval for the greenfield airport. Besides catering to the needs of travellers in central Travancore, the airport is expected to reduce the heavy traffic on the roads leading to Sabarimala during the pilgrim season and boost overall and tourism development in the region. “The airport can cater to the strong NoRK population in the region. There is no concern over the air traffic,” Mr. Thulasidas added. The airport has been proposed in place of the Aranmula airport project, which was dropped following public protest over environmental issues.

According to representatives of the protesting agents, the company representatives had promised to settle all issues within a month. The company also agreed to reverse the suspension of five agents who had tried to prevent deliveries by a few agents who did not join the protests. “We had multiple videoconferences with our fleet manager, who had held conferences with the central team. They said that they have a single structure for incentives across the country. The company said it needs a month to meet our demands on reinstating the earlier incentive structure. Five of the agents were suspended on Saturday after some restaurants sent to the company the clippings of them preventing others from taking deliveries. They have now been reinstated,” said Manoj Komalan, a representative of the agents. Company’s statement On Friday, The Hindu had reported on the drastic reductions in the incentives per delivery as well as the weekly incentive from Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 1,000, which led to the agents logging off from the mobile application en masse. Swiggy representatives, in a statement mailed to The Hindu on Saturday, said that the company was “forced to take actions that secure the future of the organisation thereby enabling support to our valued stakeholders given the unprecedented circumstances”. “Since the beginning of the lockdown, Swiggy has invested a substantial amount of resources to ensure the safety and well-being of our valued delivery partners,These investments include payouts as part of the daily guaranteed earnings, additional COVID-19 insurance cover and others,” said the statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/swiggy-delivery-agents-call-off-strike/article31830125.ece

For the past two weeks, Mini has been catching up on the First Bell online classes for schoolchildren at her neighbours’ houses for there is neither TV nor a mobile phone in her own dwelling. With the rain here and frequent power supply disruptions deep inside the forest, her teacher Ancy N. feels the arrangement will not work for long. Good at studies Ancy, who lives at Mankayam, says Mini is good in studies, but like in the case of many tribal children, the shift to online classes has brought with it many challenges, the most pressing being lack of access to facilities. Ancy says with the school too lacking such facilities, she will need to go to Mini’s house with downloaded content to teach her. “In areas such as these where Internet connectivity or electricity supply is a problem, this seems to be the only alternative,” says Palode assistant educational officer (AEO) Sindhu J. With the First Bell classes set to move on to the next phase from Monday, a massive mobilisation for arrangements is on at the ground level in the district.  Samagra Shiksha In the Vithura and Peringamala areas, 17 students from tribal areas had been identified as lacking TV or mobile phones. By Saturday, arrangements had been made for them to reach any of the 30 common centres, such as libraries or anganwadis or the like, identified for the telecast of the classes. Ten TVs received on Friday were despatched to these centres by the Samagra Shiksha’s block resource centre. In Nedumangad, arrangements have been made by the Samagra Shiksha for 60 students of the Meenangal tribal high school to access the classes at the common study centres. One aided school headmaster has purchased smart phones for two of his students who live in isolated areas and are unable to reach the centres, says block programme officer Sanal Kumar. Smartphones are also being sponsored for students who live in makeshift houses without proper walls making it impossible for electricity connections to be provided to them. While Samagra Shiksha, parent-teacher associations, teachers’ associations, district industries centre, and so on are providing TVs in many areas, cable connections are being provided for free by cable operators as also dish antennae. Facilities arranged Nedumangad AEO K. Siyad says facilities have been arranged at the Nedumangad block resource centre for anyone in need. Arrangements made for students at the common centres will facilitate the centres’ transformation into cultural spaces in the long term, he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/massive-effort-to-ensure-access-for-all-to-online-classes/article31830190.ece
15 June 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Drive to protect domestic workers’ rights||As Unlock 1 picked up, Cicily (name changed) headed to a house in the city to resume her job as a domestic worker. When the COVID-19-induced lockdown began in mid-March she was given wages for the number of days she had worked for, some extra money, and a provision kit. Without any income, the next two months were difficult. When Cicily went back, there was no talk of being paid for the months she was unable to come to work despite her difficult circumstances. Jenny fared worse. One of her employers told her not to come back because she had used public transport. At another house, she was told to come only two days a week. She is not allowed inside the house though. Suma says it is unfair that domestic workers are kept away as if they are carriers of COVID-19.  The SEWA Union, which has 15,000 domestic workers registered with it, has now launched a campaign ‘My fair home’ in connection with International Domestic Workers’ Day on June 16 (Tuesday) to create awareness among the public of domestic workers’ right to livelihood, income, and dignity. Sonia George, secretary of the SEWA Union, says the campaign was kicked off on June 8 in all districts to send across the message that it is not right to keep away domestic workers as if they are carriers of the virus. The SEWA Union estimates that 95% of the domestic workers registered with it have not been paid during the lockdown. The Planning Board has estimated a loss of Rs. 12,000 a month in earnings for domestic workers during the lockdown period, Ms. George points out. Timely discourse The plan is to continue the campaign to reach maximum residential pockets. Such a discourse is needed at this time or domestic workers will become totally marginalised, Ms. George says. “When we give out notices and explain to people what the campaign is all about, they too start thinking and understand that it is not right to keep us away, especially as we play an important role in keeping their household running,” says Jenny.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/drive-to-protect-domestic-workers-rights/article31830097.ece

The results are awaited. Following confirmation of his swab test, the inmate was shifted to a COVID Care Centre, instead of a district hospital, as he had very mild symptoms and remained asymptomatic most of the time, said Jail Superintendent Narasimha Reddy. Health officials told the authorities that the other prisoners too would have to undergo testing, adding that it can, however, be done after a week as the symptoms might not manifest immediately, even if they had contracted the virus. As soon as the test turned positive, the authorities swung into action and sanitised the entire premises. “We are ensuring that all precautions, as per the protocol, are being followed in the jail,” said Mr. Narasimha Reddy. The inmate was lodged in the jail for kidnap and criminal intimidation and was facing charges under sections 363 and 506 IPC, in addition to four others. He had applied for bail in the case and would be produced in the court in the next couple of days.

The wildlife authorities observed that a major portion of the fresh water lake was dried up during summer and many migratory birds left the place to other water bodies in Andhra Pradesh and other States. However, the officials were taking steps to maintain water level in the ponds, canals and pools to ensure that the birds remain in the lake. Many birds, including pelicans, painted storks, white ibises, black-winged stilts, great cormorants, purple herons, green-winged teals, gadwalls, open bill storks are found in Kolleru.  Intense patrolling Atapaka Bird Sanctuary was the safest and largest bird habitat in Kolleru Lake. Thousands of pelicans and painted storks roost in the sanctuary and the wildlife management officials have made several arrangements for the birds in the sanctuary. “We are maintaining about five-feet water level at Atapaka. Instructions have been given to intensity patrolling to prevent hunting and fishing in the lake to protect the birds and provide food for them,” a forest officer said. “Villagers of Atapaka, Kolletikota, Agadala Lanka, Prathikolla Lanka, Pedda Kothada, Pallewada, Bhujabalapatnam, Kovvada Lanka, Gudivada Lanka and other island villages treat the birds as their guests and are habituated to living along with them. In some villages, locals make special arrangements for the winged visitors to stay through the winter and do not cause any harm to them,” the official added. But, some people are hunting birds to eke out their living. The Forest department officials booked cases against such poachers on many occasions. “Special teams have been deployed to conduct raids on the shandies at Kaikaluru, Akiveedu, Bhimavaram, Korukallu, Gudivada, Undi, Kalla, Palakollu, Narsapuram and other markets,” the officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/officials-take-measures-to-protect-migratory-birds-at-kolleru-lake/article31829753.ece
15 June 2020||Santosh Patnaik,ANDHRA PRADESH||Reverse migration not on expected lines in North Andhra||Reverse migration of workers due to COVID-19 pandemic has not taken off in North Andhra on expected lines aggravating the woes of the entrepreneurs badly hit by the lockdown. The relaxation of norms for ensuring full-fledged revival of operations which raised the expectation of entrepreneurs has remained short-lived though they are hopeful that in the coming months the workers who migrated to their native places will come back due to financial compulsions. “Though some started to migrate to Reddivalasa in Vizianagaram and other parts of North Andhra, resistance from locals due to fear of spread of coronavirus has prevented others from coming back. Hostile reception may go once the number of positive cases come down,” MD and CEO of Vijayanagar Biotech Ltd Datla Tirupati Raju, said. Mr. Raju, AP unit vice chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry, told The Hindu that the migrated workers from Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and other States were unfortunately facing problem in their home States due to mandatory quarantine and not encouraging response from the places where they used to stay after their return to workplaces. Sravan Shipping Services managing director G. Sambasiva Rao said reverse migration had started. In Visakhapatnam, almost 10% of migrated workers had come back and resuming work after undergoing home quarantine for seven days. He hoped that reverse migration would pick up momentum in next two to three months with the restorations of normal operations of trains and buses. For A.K. Balaji, president of Visakha Autonagar Small-Scale Industrialists’ Welfare Association (VASSIWA), the revival operations in manufacturing and MSME units like re-rolling mills, ice plants, rice mills, ferralloys and processing plants had been hit hard for want of migrated workers. He said acceptance level of migrated workers in their neighbourhood was low due to fear of virus spread and hoped that in the next few months the acceptance level would go up once COVID-19 situation improved. HPCL Visakh Refinery Contract Workers’ Union president Neerukonda Ramachandra Rao said for want of migrated workers the expansion project of Visakh Refinery from 8.3 to 15 million tonne had been badly affected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/reverse-migration-not-on-expected-lines-in-north-andhra/article31830270.ece

One of the arrested, Chilukuri Jawahar Bala Kumar, had allegedly duped young, educated and well-established women in various cities such as Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Visakhapatnam and Coimbatore.

He targets gullible women after doing a brief research and approaches them. He sweet talks them to friendship and later proposes them. Taking advantage of their vulnerability, he allegedly sexually and financially exploits them. He also allegedly clicks intimate photos and blackmails them to extort money and in some cases he also tried to force them into doing immoral things, said Mr. Meena. Sources in the police say that Jawahar creates high flying profiles, where he makes people believe that he is a big time entrepreneur and poses with high-end cars.

Property sale He also brushed aside the talks that the TTD was arbitrarily selling away its properties. “The TTD has been selling unviable lands since 1974 and the decision to sell these properties was taken years ago by the ten trust board, which was misinterpreted by ‘vested interests’ to defame the institution,” he said. Mr. Singhal expressed his displeasure over the manner in which the decision of making the laddus available to the devotees during the lockdown was “mocked at by dubbing the move as selling the prasadam as sweets”. “The TTD has sold laddus at Rs. 25 a piece during the lockdown in all district headquarters of the State, apart from Hyderabad and Bengaluru, despite incurring Rs. 45 per piece as the expenditure,” said Mr. Singhal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tirumala-temple-to-remain-closed-on-june-21/article31829741.ece

15 June 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Left parties stage dharna against petrol price hike||Members of the Left parties staged a demonstration at the Ambedkar Circle in Tirupati on Sunday, protesting against the steep hike in the prices of petroleum products. During the dharna by AITUC workers led by district secretary P. Murali, the agitators pulled an auto rickshaw by using a rope, to indicate that the new fuel prices were ill-affordable to the common man. Mr. Murali wondered how the Central government could let the oil companies increase prices at will, though the price of the crude was touching the nadir at the international market. The present round of hike would not be the end and there were more to come, he predicted, citing economic experts. The agitators also worried that the price hike would have a telling impact on transportation sector and subsequently, the prices of essential commodities, thus adversely affecting the common man. Ignoring the fervent appeals of the poor to reach out to them during the lockdown, the Centre was instead bent on breaking their back, the demonstrators lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/left-parties-stage-dharna-against-petrol-price-hike/article31830230.ece
15 June 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||ACB to verify call data of accused in ESI scam||Officials of the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), who are investigating the multi-crore scandal in the purchase of drugs and other material in the Employees’ State Insurance (ESI) hospitals and dispensaries, are planning to verify the call data of all the accused involved in the case. Former Labour Minister and TDP MLA K. Atchannaidu, three ESI directors, five joint directors, a couple of civil surgeons, pharmacists, senior and junior assistants, and central drug store in-charges are allegedly involved in the scam. The Vigilance and Enforcement (V&E) and ACB officials visited several ESI dispensaries and diagnostic centres across the State, interacted with the employees, and submitted a report to the government on the irregularities. The ACB sleuths had so far arrested Mr. Atchannaidu and six others – retired directors C.K. Ramesh Kumar and G. Vijaya Kumar; retired joint director V. Janardhan; senior assistant in the Director of Insurance Medical Services (DIMS) Ivana Ramesh Babu; DIMS superintendent M.K.P. Chakravarthy (under suspension), and an employee of the central drug store Venkata Subba Rao. ‘19 accused identified’ Special teams are on the look out for Jercon Enterprises director Ravi Tejasri; Tele Health Services Private Limited director T. Pramod Reddy; Prodigy Computers and Labs director T. Dinesh; and Jalam Environment Private Limited director G. Murali Krishna. “So far, 19 accused have been identified . More arrests will be made soon. The accused had purchased materials worth Rs. 988 crore in the last four years without calling for tenders and by avoiding e-procurement (in some purchases), thereby causing Rs. 150 crore loss to the government,” said ACB Joint Director P.V. Ravi Kumar. The police will verify the call data of the mobile phones of all the accused to know since how long the ESI officials have contacts with the representatives of the firms, and to identify the other accused in the scam. Bank accounts of all the accused will be frozen in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and other States, and verified by following the legal procedure. “We will probe into whether or not the companies are registered, if they are given any contracts by A.P. or any other State earlier, and the track record of the managements. We will seek permission from the court if necessary” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/acb-to-verify-call-data-of-accused-in-esi-scam/article31830248.ece
15 June 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Examination failure, low scores do not mean end of the world, says Minister||Terming many Intermediate students ending their lives over poor results as unfortunate, Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh on Sunday said that low scores or failure in an examination could never mean the end of the world. Low percentage of marks, in fact, can be the launching pad for a promising career if one sincerely and diligently works for the set target, he said. ‘Confidence matters’ “The students must not lose their confidence. They should rather introspect and find what went wrong. Scoring in examination and knowledge are two different things,” he emphasised. The Board of Intermediate Education (BIE) released the intermediate first and second year results on Friday. In the wake of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown and other guidelines such as social distancing, the results were released online. Server issues While the Minister and the department officials released the results at 4 p.m. most students could get access to the websites with the results only after a couple of hours due to what officials called “heavy pressure on the servers”. Though many students resorted to the extreme step on Saturday, they were surfaced only on Sunday morning. “Teens taking their lives over lower percentage of marks or failure in examination is a disturbing trend,” said the Minister. “Parents have a key role to play. They should counsel their children to deal with the stress and depression. They should support their childrens’ aspirations and encourage them in all possible ways to face the challenges in life,” said Mr. Suresh. The Minister also underscored the need for educational institutions to do their bit in counselling children against harbouring negative thoughts and encourage them to chase their dreams with hard work and commitment. Education reforms “There is no need to give undue importance to marks and grades that is so typical of the corporate education system. This is why the government is focussing on reforms . We are determined to end the corporate culture and help children gain knowledge in a very conducive atmosphere. The reforms introduced in both, school and higher education sectors, aims at changing the face of the education scenario,” said the Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/examination-failure-low-scores-do-not-mean-end-of-the-world-says-minister/article31830240.ece
15 June 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Focus on creating skilled work force, says official||Around 10,000 migrant labourers from the States like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, who worked in the dairy sector in Prakasam and fisheries sector in Nellore and West Godavari districts, have left in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Their exit has created a vacuum and we intend to develop skilled work force in the post-COVID period,” said the Managing Director and CEO of Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) Arja Srikanth. He was addressing a south zone training partners’ meet, organised by the Agriculture Skill Council of India, that focussed on the effect of COVID-19 crisis on skill development in agriculture, short-term training prospects post COVID-19, proposed changes in the Prime Minister Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), prospects of apprenticeship in agriculture and a discussion on challenges faced by the training partners. Speaking about post-COVID skill programmes to be taken up with focus on agriculture sector and allied activities, Mr. Srikanth said post-harvest technologies was another focus area. Under agriculture mechanisation, the State planned to develop ‘cluster hiring centres’ and engage skilled youth in them.  Women workforce Mr. Srikanth also suggested integration of all the skill components implemented by the various ministries like the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDUGKY) and the National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM), to create livelihood activities. He also referred to plans of creating a women work force by skilling them in post-harvest technology and mooted apprenticeship programme for skilled and semi-skilled youth in the State. State Engagement Officer at National Skill Development Corporation Karnataka, Goa and Tripura Capt. Kaustav Nath said agriculture segment was set to play a vital role in future. Calling for more awareness on e-skilling and e-learning, he said instead of whining about the lockdown, one must try and find opportunities in the situation. Dairy farming and vermi-composting, he said, were grass-root level activities where women could be engaged in a big way and cited the examples of Amul dairy and Lijjat papad. He said women were the most versatile entrepreneurs and said small self-help groups engaged in agriculture activities could do wonders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/focus-on-creating-skilled-work-force-says-official/article31829742.ece
15 June 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Will knock on HRC’s door: Naidu||The TDP on Sunday decided to lodge a complaint with the Human Rights Commission (HRC), denouncing the manner in which party deputy leader in the Assembly and Tekkali MLA K. Atchannaidu was arrested ignoring his medical condition, following which he developed bleeding from a surgical wound. “Mr. Atchannaidu may have to undergo a second surgery because of the wicked and illegal act of the YSRCP government. The TDP will not rest until the culprits are booked and punished,” TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu asserted. Addressing the elected party representatives and village committee in-charges via a video link, Mr. Naidu said that Mr. Atchannaidu, who had undergone a surgery, was forced to travel by road. “It reflects the demonic rule in the State,” he observed. ‘TDP leaders targeted’ “At a time when COVID-19 is spreading fast, the government is targeting TDP leaders,” he said, and cited the arrest of another party leader J.C. Prabhakar Reddy and his son in Anantapur. “Both Mr. Atchannaidu and Mr. Prabhakar Reddy have neither succumbed to the YSRCP’s intimidatory tactics nor fell to the lure of money,” Mr. Naidu said, adding, “We will lodge a complaint with the HRC in Mr. Atchannaidu’s case.” ‘Abuse of power’ Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s one-year rule was full of human rights violations, abuse of power, fabricated cases and illegal arrests, he alleged. “Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy is taking revenge on the Opposition leaders for exposing his party’s massive scams ranging from sand to liquor to coronavirus testing kits,” he charged. Mr. Naidu exhorted the cadres to be bold and expose the ruling party’s “corrupt practices and excesses” in all the Assembly segments in the State. “Besides condemning the YSRCP’s maniacal policies, every leader should confront the ruling party leaders’ mafia activities involving sand, land, wine and mines,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-targeting-tdp-leaders-says-naidu/article31829675.ece

In a letter to Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney, he said he thought that the new government had taken the correct decision when it cancelled the questionable LuLu land deal in Visakhapatnam.

Chandrababu of nervous over the State government’s vigorous fight against corruption and declared that arrested former Minister K. Atchannaidu was not a true BC leader. He told the media that Mr. Naidu was scared of exposure of the irregularities committed during the TDP rule from 2014 to 19 as the government had decided to hand over the probe into corrupt deals to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Mr. Rao scoffed at the projection of Mr. Atchannaidu as a BC leader and claimed that he never vouched the cause of the BCs. Mr. Raosaid he was arrested over his alleged involvement in the ESI scam when he was the Labour Minister. He also justified the arrest of former MLA J.C. Prabhakar Reddy and his son for the forged invoice and insurance scam in the buying of trailer trucks by the transport firm owned by their family. The YSRCP leader said it was wrong to claim that the government was resorting to political vendetta when it was keen on reducing expenditure and bringing the corrupt to book as per law. He said, “Law will take its own course and what’s wrong if action is taken against Mr. Naidu and his son Lokesh for their involvement in various scams.” He alleged that the TDP president and his party leaders were trying to divert attention of people from corrupt deals and project as if the government was taking vendetta against them. “These are cheap tricks being played by the Opposition party which is on the verge of extinction. If Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy gave his nod, then almost all the MLAs from the TDP would have crossed over to the YSRCP by now,” he said and claimed that the Chief Minister had already made it clear that they would not encourage defections and one had to resign from membership of the Assembly to join the ruling party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-nervous-over-govts-fight-against-graft-alleges-dadi/article31830267.ece

Mr. Vishnu Kumar Raju said there was a danger of COVID-19 spreading rapidly due to lack of social distancing norms at wine shops.

15 June 2020||BHADRADRI-KOTHAGUDEM,TELANGANA||TSWREIS’ online drive a boon for students||Undeterred by the lockdown-induced educational disruptions, Ayesha, a B. Com first year student of Khammam-based Telangana Social Welfare Residential Degree College (TSWRDC), is relentlessly exploring new vistas of knowledge using a smartphone from her home at Yellandu. The well-timed online-based collaborative initiatives of the Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (TSWREIS) are proving to be a boon for several enthusiastic undergraduate students like Ayesha hailing from underprivileged sections to continue their pursuit of expanding the frontiers of knowledge despite the present turbulent times. Ayesha and three other undergraduate students Githanjali, Prudhvila and Reena, of the Khammam-based TSWRDC bagged the opportunity to participate in the two-week long “Virtual Exchange Fellowship (VEF)” by excelling in an English proficiency test and interview held in online mode amid lockdown, a couple of weeks ago, sources said. Students from seven other countries, including neighbouring Sri Lanka and Pakistan, are participating in the VEF being conducted by the International Association of Students in Economics and Commercial Sciences (AIESEC) on the digital platform. “It is a unique learning experience to interact with student delegates from various countries representing diverse cultural backgrounds on specified themes on the online platform,” said Ayesha, daughter of Mohammad Ghani, a lorry driver of the coal town of Yellandu. “I am using my mother’s smartphone to attend the online seminars on select dates,” she said. “We had an online session on cross-cultural interaction and leadership involving delegates from different countries yesterday,” Ayesha told The Hindu . “I am grateful to TSWREIS secretary R.S. Praveen Kumar for providing an enabling environment for online learning during shutdown of all educational institutions,” she remarked. “The interactive sessions are very edifying as they are deepening our understanding of diverse cultures of the world and inclusiveness, the prerequisites for embracing leadership roles as socially conscious global citizens,” she said. “I consider this a stepping stone to realise my life ambition of becoming an IAS officer,” Ayesha asserted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tswreis-online-drive-a-boon-for-students/article31830035.ece
15 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Lack of clarity on testing keeps COVID suspects on the edge||The rising cases of COVID-19 in the State has kept people anxious. So, it is natural for those developing symptoms like fever, sore throat or cold to seek immediate testing to know if they are infected by the virus. However, most of them are refraining from approaching government hospitals. The reason seems to be a gaping information gap that is leaving people confused about the hospital they must approach to give swab samples for testing. Moreover, some fear that they might contract the infectious disease, if they already don’t have it, upon visiting a government hospital. Or, that they might be admitted to the hospital when their samples are collected for testing. Most people seem to be aware that samples are collected at Sir Ronald Ross Institute for Tropical and Communicable Diseases (Fever Hospital), Nallakunta. Social workers, who work with the homeless in basthis of Hyderabad, said as per their knowledge, samples are exclusively collected at Fever Hospital. However, they are also collected at the District Hospital in King Koti. Doctors at the two hospitals assess a suspected patient’s symptoms and health condition, and decide if a test is required. People with COVID-19 symptoms or high risk contacts of a coronavirus-positive patient can walk into the hospital for tests. Besides the Fever Hospital and District Hospital in King Koti, if anyone with symptoms approaches Basthi Dawakhanas or Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC), they are referred to either Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital in Mehdipatnam, or any other health facility to undergo tests. “Our staff directs the suspects,” a health official said. Superintendent of Fever Hospital K. Shankar said when samples are collected from suspected patients, they are admitted at the hospital until results are received. This brief admission is what some people seem to fear. Senior officials in the Health department said the condition of a few COVID-19 patients worsened in matter of a few hours and they needed constant monitoring. “The suspects are admitted since early detection of their health complications, in case they have COVID, helps save their lives,” an official said. Dr Shankar said that if someone tests negative, they are sent home. If results turn up positive, the place of isolation (hospital or home) depends on severity of the infectious disease. Samples are collected at the hospital twice a day after completing paper work. Doctors assured that microbiologists who collect samples are trained to avoid cross-contamination among patients and suspects, hence people need not fear approaching a government hospital to give samples. Corporate hospitals Of late, some symptomatic persons and high-risk contacts are approaching corporate hospitals for testing. Doctors there said they prescribe a CT scan of chest, as per guidelines. “If pneumonia is observed, then their oxygen levels are checked using Arterial Blood Gas tests and Oximeter. If there are abnormalities, they are referred for further tests. The medical reports have to be cited along with the reference. All these tests cost around Rs. 5,000,” a corporate hospital doctor said, on the condition of anonymity. Samples from corporate hospitals are tested at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), Panjagutta. Mujtaba Hasan Askari, trustee of the NGO Helping Hands Foundation, recalled a case where a 10-member family in Hyderabad chose not to go to a government hospital after developing symptoms, fearing that they might contract the disease there. “Another person chose to undergo only symptomatic tests rather than give samples at government hospitals. The issue could get resolved if testing is ramped up such as doorstep collection of samples or drive-through tests and even allowing private laboratories to conduct testing,” Mr Askari said. Other districts In other districts, if a patient with symptoms visits a Primary Health Centre (PHC) or any other health facility, they are taken to district hospitals and samples are collected for testing. “If they are symptomatic, they are quarantined at the district hospital till their results are received,” said B. Venkateshwar Rao, Medak’s District Medical and Health Officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/lack-of-clarity-on-testing-keeps-covid-suspects-on-the-edge/article31829992.ece
15 June 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Why no doctor or patient at Gachibowli facility, asks Revanth||Congress working president A. Revanth Reddy has said that the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS) at Gachibowli neither has a single patient nor a doctor even three months after the State government declared it a COVID-19 specialised hospital. The Malkajgiri MP, who made a surprise visit to the hospital, said he found just four security personnel in the entire building. He later released a statement along with a video in which he said it reflected the government’s negligence even as COVID cases were rising by the day. He said Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had announced about the 1,500-bed TIMS on March 27 on a grand scale and it was opened on April 19. He had also announced that 100 doctors from the districts would be deputed to the hospital. However, 75 days later, not a single doctor has been appointed nor has a single patient been admitted there, he claimed. When doctors at Gandhi Hospital are protesting over work overload and unfair distribution of patients, what is preventing the government from using the facility, questioned Revanth, alleging that the CM is just misleading people with grand statements and doing little on the ground. Mr. Reddy said Telangana’s poor testing numbers are now catching the nation’s attention, and claimed it stands at 22nd place in the country with less than 50,000 tests. The neighbouring Andhra Pradesh has done more than 5.5 lakh tests, he said and blamed it on the CM’s negligence. He claimed that the government had saved Rs. 3,500 crore, slashing the salaries of employees and raised another Rs. 4,000 crore through bonds. It also received donations of about Rs. 3,000 crore so far but the government was not taking the COVID situation seriously, he claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/why-no-doctor-or-patient-at-gachibowli-facility-asks-revanth/article31830023.ece
15 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Centre must step in, says Laxman||Former State BJP chief K. Laxman urged Union Health Minister Harshvardhan to hold a virtual meeting with State Health Minister Eatala Rajender, Health officials and heads of hospitals treating COVID patients to assess the ‘grave situation’ here. In a communication to the Minister, a copy of which was released to the media on Sunday, he requested for a delegation from the Centre, vested with power to take instantaneous decisions, to save the people of Telangana and save Hyderabad, showing signs of rampant community spread. “The Telangana government has been utterly negligent in following the Centre’s advisory and is allowing COVID-19 to spread further,” he said. “For inexplicable reasons, the government has been callous in improving the public health infrastructure and insensitive to the fears and anxieties of people. It is neither testing people on a large scale nor allowing individuals to approach labs and hospitals for tests when they have an element of doubt,” he charged. Mr. Laxman also said that Gandhi Hospital was declared a COVID facility but there was no hygiene there with stinking wards. “There is not enough sanitation staff at the hospital and as a result, conditions are very bad,” he alleged and pointed out that the 1,500 bed hospital at Gachibowli remained unused with no recruitment of extra doctors or para-medical staff.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-must-step-in-says-laxman/article31830018.ece

Vamshichand Reddy said that the TRS government has failed to instil confidence among people on facilities at Gandhi Hospital after COVID positive TRS MLA Yadagiri Reddy was admitted to a private hospital. “How valid is CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s claims of providing the best treatment to COVID patients at Gandhi Hospital if his own MLAs are being admitted to corporate hospitals,” he questioned. “This is substantial evidence to prove that facilities at Gandhi Hospital are not up to the mark. Moreover, doctors there are overburdened without rest and proper equipment. It is unfortunate that a ruling party MLA refused to get admitted to a government hospital,” he claimed. He also said that while the rich and influential are ‘ignoring’ the government facility for coronavirus treatment, the poor and middle class are being made to suffer without good facilities. Community transmission? The findings of the serological survey conducted by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) could not be used to make claims of ‘no community transmission’ in Telangana as the survey was done in specified areas only for just two days, said Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) treasurer Gudur Narayana Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-mlas-do-not-trust-gandhi/article31830025.ece
15 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Genetics to help diagnose diabetes||A new way of using genetics to diagnose diabetes could pave the way for better diagnosis and treatment as features of diabetes among Indians might vary from standard Western textbooks. Until recently, it was widely believed that Type 1 diabetes appeared in children and adolescents, and Type 2 in obese and older people, typically over 45 years of age. However, recent findings have shown that Type 1 diabetes can occur later in life, while Type 2 diabetes is on the rise among younger and thinner Indians. Distinguishing between these two types of diabetes has, therefore, become more complex. The two types follow different treatment regime with Type 1 diabetes needing lifelong insulin injections but Type 2 diabetes often being managed with diet or tablet treatment. Misclassification of the type of diabetes may lead to complications. A new publication conducted by researchers at KEM Hospital, Pune; CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad and the University of Exeter in the UK shows that a genetic risk score is effective in diagnosing Type 1 diabetes in Indians. The genetic risk score, developed by the University of Exeter, considers detailed genetic information known to increase the chance of developing Type 1 diabetes at the diagnosis. So far, most research in this field was conducted among European populations. Now, in a paper published in Scientific Reports, researchers have analysed whether the European risk score is effective in diagnosing Type 1 diabetes in Indians too. For this, the team studied 262 people from Pune with Type 1 diabetes, 352 people with Type 2 diabetes, and 334 people without diabetes. The research found that the test is effective in diagnosing the right type of diabetes in Indians, even in its current form, which is based on European data, yet the test could be further improved to enhance outcomes for Indians due to the genetic differences. “Diagnosing the right diabetes type is an increasingly difficult challenge as Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age. This task is even harder in India, as more cases of Type 2 diabetes occur in people with low BMI. We now know that our genetic risk score is an effective tool for Indians to help get people get the right treatment avoiding life threatening complications like diabetic ketoacidosis,” said University of Exeter Medical School’s Richard Oram. KEM Hospital & Research Centre’s Chittaranjan Yajnik agreed: “Escalating epidemic of diabetes in young Indians makes it imperative that we diagnose the type of diabetes correctly to avoid mistreatment. The new genetic tool will be a great help in this as physical characteristics of diabetic patients differ from the standard description”. The authors found nine genetic areas or ‘SNPs’ that correlate with type 1 diabetes both in Indian and European populations, and can be used to predict the onset of Type 1 diabetes in Indians. “It’s interesting to note that different SNPs are more abundant among Indian and European patients. This opens up the possibility that environmental factors might be interacting with these SNPs to cause the disease,” said CSIR-CCMB chief scientist G.R. Chandok.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/genetics-to-help-diagnose-diabetes/article31829990.ece
15 June 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||IIT-H, NIT-W set new benchmarks in rankings||Two institutes from Telangana made a huge mark in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranks this year — the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H), which stood top among the second generation IITs and the National Institute of Technology, Warangal, (NIT-W) that jumped 15 positions above, perhaps the biggest for any institute in the country. Ranked 17th in the overall category this year, the IIT-H picked up five ranks above its last year’s position, taking a huge leap based on its improved research and teaching and learning resources. In the engineering category, it, however, retained its earlier eighth rank. The NIT Warangal improved 15 positions to bag 46th rank from 61st rank last year in the overall category while in the engineering colleges category, it improved its position to 19th compared to 26th rank last year. A few more points could have placed it in a much better position among the NITs as the margin of score was very less. The IIT-H performed extremely well in all the parameters in the engineering stream like Teaching, Learning and Resources (82.51), Research and Professional Practices (52.47), Graduation Outcome (71.54), Outreach and Inclusivity (55.98) and Perception (60.42). Similar was the performance in the overall category like Teaching, Learning and Resources (69.97), Research and Professional Practices (48.99), Graduation Outcome (66.96), Outreach and Inclusivity (58.36) and Perception (46.7). NIT Warangal director N.V. Ramana Rao says rank-wise, NIT-W in both overall and engineering colleges categories saw the biggest improvement for any institute in the country. “Our hard work has paid off and it is a reflection of the quality of our faculty and students,” says Prof. Ramana Rao, who introduced several innovative programmes in the last five years. Director ofIndian Institute of Technology--H B.S. Murthy attributes the improved rank to each member of the institute and says they would continue to work to climb the ladder to reach the top. The IIT-H was set up in 2008 along with five others — at Gandhinagar, Jodhpur, Patna, Bhubaneswar and Ropar. Though the decision to establish IIT Indore and IIT Mandi was taken at the same time, they started operations the next year. Six new IITs were set up in 2015 and 2016, including IITs in Tirupati, Palakkad, Dharwad, Bhilai, Goa and Jammu. The ISM Dhanbad was also upgraded to an Indian Institute of Technology during the same time. UoH slips The University of Hyderabad (UoH), which has made immense progress over the years, however, slipped four positions to be ranked 15th in the overall category. Among the universities, it stood at sixth place. However, the pride of Telangana — Osmania University — fared poorly compared to last year. It secured 53rd rank, dropping from its 43rd last year, in the overall category.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/iit-h-nit-w-set-new-benchmarks-in-rankings/article31830004.ece
15 June 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘101 banyans damaged on Chevella road’||A field survey conducted by nature enthusiasts from the city on Chevella road found a total of 101 banyan trees burnt to varying degrees, damaged or uprooted. Damage to a large number of these trees was severe, while several were toppled, the report filed by them said. Based on the data, a fresh online petition has been moved by concerned citizens, with the title ‘Save Chevella’s banyans’. A previous petition with the same objective had received 35,000 signatures, forcing the National Highways Authority of India to shelve its highway expansion project which endangered the banyans. The latest citizens’ action has been initiated following a recent report by The Hindu , which brought focus on scores of banyan trees being felled or burnt on the highway between Moinabad and Manneguda via Chevella. A data sheet has been diligently compiled by a group of three persons, Rashmitha T. Juvvadi, N.Ram Reddy and Pranay Juvvadi, noting distance, kilometre reading, exact location of each banyan on the route and severity of the damage. According to the report, a total of 64 trees are severely burnt, while 16 have been toppled or dead. Twenty-one banyans are moderately burnt. “I have been frequenting this route for the last 20 years, and noticed that there are several gaps where trees stood earlier,” said Mr. Pranay Juvvadi, who is an avid researcher on birds. He said trees with moderate burns were the ones with minimal or no injuries to the cambium (protective bark outside). Several others sustained severe burns due to injuries to the cambium, due to which these trees hardly stand any chance of recovery, and may topple in due course of time. Following the compilation, a letter signed by 12 tree lovers has been addressed to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests R. Shoba, which mentioned that this year, the burning is more widespread and appeared to have been done systematically. The undergrowth where the trees stand has been razed mechanically and set on fire, it noted. Banyans between Manneguda and Vikarabad, however, suffered no razing of undergrowth or systematic burning, the letter said and urged the PCCF to investigate the matter and take immediate action against the miscreants. “We are all nature lovers from different walks of life, who have come together as a group by being part of organised tree walks conducted by experts. We noticed the tree burning last year and filed a police complaint. This latest damage is distressing to hear,” said Tejah Balantrapu, another member of the group. The online petition to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao termed the burning of the banyans as the most barbaric act which is nothing but “butchery of the stately trees”. Commending him for the ‘Haritha Haaram’ programme, the petition urged the Chief Minister to take urgent action in this matter and ensure that the trees are saved for future generations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/101-banyans-damaged-on-chevella-road/article31830006.ece

15 June 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||NIA arrests vice-president of TPF||Nalamasa Krishna (41), vice-president of Telangana Praja Front (TPF), was arrested by the National Investigation Agency in Khammam on Sunday. Officials said he was the ‘key aide’ of the banned CPI (Maoist) in Telangana Vidyarthi Vedika (TVV) president Bandari Maddileti’s case. The investigators said Krishna, a resident of Hyderabad, played a key role in furthering the activities of the CPI(Maoist) . The case was first registered at Nallakunta police station of Hyderabad on October 8, 2019. Based on the seizure of incriminating documents and material from the house of Maddileti by Jogulamba-Gadwal police, a case was subsequently re-registered by the NIA. “Our investigation revealed that Krishna regularly visited the top leaders of CPI(Maoist) in Chhattisgarh forests and passed on their directions to Maddiletti. He was instrumental in directing frontal organisations like TPF and TVV to take up agitations and activities, as per the outlawed party’s strategy,” the officials said. Under the garb of agitations for people’s causes, he had misused the democratic setup, they said. On October 15 last, the Jogulamba-Gadwal police arrested Maddileti and Krishna from the TPF office in Bagh Lingampally, where they went to attend a round-table. While Maddileti was taken into NIA custody in March this year, Krishna, who was recently released on bail, was arrested on Sunday. Condemned Khammam Special Correspondent writes: Condemning the arrest of Krishna, TPF president K Ravichandar said it was made when he had been under treatment at a private hospital in the town for a respiratory ailment.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is slated to hold a meeting of district collectors and senior officials on Tuesday to review the implementation of MGNREGS works. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar convened a meeting of Panchayat Raj and Irrigation departments’ officials on Sunday to explore options on dovetailing MGNREGS works with those taken up by these two departments. The meeting discussed about taking up desiltation of canals and construction of feeder channels under NREGS. Officials were asked to focus on wage component and labour intensive works over the next 30 days as it would not only help provide the much-needed employment but also ensure money in the hands of the rural poor. Officials should identify works beneficial for villagers and in turn contribute to restoration of economic activities in the State. Desilting works in major, medium and minor irrigation projects, including check dams, could be taken up immediately while canal repairs and field channel works could also be taken up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/meet-on-linking-nregs-pr-and-irrigation-works/article31830017.ece

15 June 2020||KARIMNAGAR,TELANGANA||Now, tests in Karimnagar town soon||Thanks to the district administration’s measures to check the spread of COVID-19, the district headquarters hospital is coming up with a virology laboratory with equipment such as TrueNat and CBNAAT machines and others to conduct tests in the town. Earlier, the authorities after collecting samples used to send them to Hyderabad for analysis and wait for reports. Now tests would be conducted at the Civil Hospital here. The TrueNat machine provides results in two hours with accuracy and helps the doctors to take up faster diagnosis and the patients can get access to treatment much earlier. Similarly, the virology laboratory would be also equipped with CBNAAT (cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test) machine. Actually, the primary tests are conducted on TrueNat machine. If it is negative, another test is conducted on CBNAAT machine. If the second test states it as positive, then it would be treated as COVID-19 positive. The virology laboratory, which was developed at a cost of Rs. 70 lakh, would be inaugurated very soon and made available for the benefit of people. The district authorities have provided special training to 10 medical fraternities including doctors, lab technicians and nurses for conducting tests on the new machines. The laboratory was developed to conduct at least 100 tests every day. The district authorities have set up separate COVID-19 isolation ward with 100 beds and 10 ventilators in the district headquarters, which would be used only for the patients of bifurcated Karimnagar district. Other districts have also opened isolation wards in Sircilla, Sultanabad, Godavarikhani, Peddapalli, Metpally and Jagtial hospitals. From other districts Only the samples from other districts would be bought to Karimnagar virology laboratory for tests. After the conduct of tests, the suspected patients would be kept at home quarantine if the case is not serious, for 17 days. If the virus is not cured, the positive patient would be referred to the government isolation ward in Karimnagar town, later to MGM Warangal and finally to Gandhi Hospital for treatment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/now-tests-in-karimnagar-town-soon/article31830000.ece
15 June 2020||NIZAMABAD,TELANGANA||Schools reopening uncertain||Generally by this time every year, schools would have got reopened and new academic year begun. There used to be a festive atmosphere with students and teachers coming to schools and new students getting admissions. However, this is conspicuous by its absence this year. On the other hand, uncertainty prevails over the reopening of schools, colleges, universities and other educational institutions amid the rapid spread of COVID-19. Though online classes are going on , students are not happy as poor signals are making online classes tedious.Managements and teachers of private schools though are on the job of collecting e-mail IDs and mobile phone numbers of students and asking them to download Zoom app for video conferencing even as many students are complaining that they have no smartphones of their own. Middle-class parents are providing separate mobile phones with Internet connections to their wards whereas for the poor it has become an additional burden in this critical period. As regards the students of Government residential schools, it is not a difficulty as they have been given tabs. However, as they are staying at their homes with schools remaining closed, many of them have no Internet facility.“Classes are getting interrupted often in the middle with disruptions in Internet signals. If a student uses his or her parent’s mobile and the latter takes away the phone for a call, the class is interrupted,” says Sulakshana Pawar, a teacher in a private school. Mandal Educational Officer, Balkonda, B. Rajeswar, said that he was not sure of reopening of schools in June or July and there was no talk about the subject among authorities at present. “Clarity would come only after August and till then classes may not run,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/schools-reopening-uncertain/article31830033.ece

15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||SSC results in Telangana make history||This is the first time in the history of SSC exams that the results will not be declared since there is no question of judging who all passed or failed because the State government has decided to promote all Class X students automatically due to lockdown. As a consequence, there will not be supplementary exams. The sole interest was now focussed on grades by children on the basis of their performance in internal assessments. Of the 5.35 lakh children who enrolled for the exams, nearly 3.75 lakh were from private schools which were blamed for awarding internal assessment marks to their children at free will. It was said that they awarded 20 out of a maximum of 20 marks in each subject to 1.5 lakh students. Since there is a weightage of 20 marks for internal assessment, as many marks are multiplied five times for the overall grade points in each subject. The grade point average for these students was likely to be 10/10.    The surge in number of COVID cases has apparently created panic among elected representatives. With some of them testing positive, ministers and MLAs are taking care to avoid mass contact. Some ministers are going ahead in asking people not to meet them directly and instead, represent their grievances over phone. Elected representatives of Warangal resolved unanimously and assured people of their constituencies that arrangements will be put in place to receive their grievances round-the-clock. It is indeed a tough decision taken by them because politicians prefer to be among people all the time, especially at a time when solutions to crying problems did not appear in the near future.   At a time when there’s large-scale retrenchment in private sector due to severe slowdown of the economy under the impact of COVID-19, some blessed ones in the public (government) sector are getting extension of services even after attainment of superannuation age. With the help of their reach in the corridors of power, such individuals are getting extension of service denying senior positions to those down the line or an opportunity to the unemployed. Although there are several bureaucrats and other officials clinging on to one post or the other, including the role of advisors even after retirement, the classic example is that of an engineer holding a key position in the Irrigation Department, who has been getting extension since July 2013. Another senior irrigation engineer who was in-charge of executing the head works of one the two most spoken about projects in Telangana was denied extension of service mid-way through execution of works in spite of his “commendable” work. More recently, a lecturer in Higher Education Department and another official in Excise Department were given extension of three years each as their kin are office-bearers of an employees’ association and have close ties with political bosses. Hopes of transfer in police department were raised once again as some officials are slated to retire by the end of this month. At least five senior officers, including Warangal Commissioner V. Ravinder, SIB chief T. Prabhakar Rao, State Police Housing Corporation MD B. Malla Reddy, Cyberabad Joint Commissioner A. Venkateshwar Rao and Nirmal SP C. Shashidhar Raju, are demitting office. With this, several officers are hoping that they will get new assignments. The grapevine is that at least two superintendents of police from north Telangana and one from West Zone are likely to find a place in three urban commissionerates, while a few deputys in Cyberabad and Rachakonda are hoping to get transfers to districts. Moreover, aspirants for promotion, especially Group-I officers from 2009 batch, are pulling the levers of power to find good placements.  (N. Rahul, M. Rajeev, B.

15 June 2020||BHUBANESWAR,||Community spread worries Odisha govt.||Detection of rising local COVID-19 cases, which now account for 10% of persons testing positive in the month of June, has left the Odisha government worried. The State government dubs June as the pandemic’s peak period. Of the total 3,909 positive cases traced in the State since March 15, as many as 1,805 cases have tested positive in just the last 13 days. The past two weeks’ tally accounts for 46.17% of the total detection. Prior to June, most of the persons testing positives were from quarantine centres set up by the government and they had little interaction with the outside world. June began with a bang with 31 of 141 positive cases tagged as local. The subsequent days consistently recorded infection in the community, putting the administration in a spot of bother. Of the 1,805 positive cases detected in the past 13 days, 181 were local. Although the government came out with an assurance that aggressive contact tracing had been carried out, there was no end to emergence of local cases. “The COVID-19 pandemic is at its peak during June and carries tangible risk for everyone. Self-regulate yourself and save your family from coronavirus. Use face mask, maintain social distancing and hand hygiene,” advised State Health and Family Welfare department in a Twitter message.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/community-spread-worries-odisha-govt/article31829940.ece
15 June 2020||FARIDABAD,||MSMEs wait for work as demand slumps post lockdown||“We don’t want help. We want work,” asserts Vinod Kumar Jaiswal of Jaiswal Grinding, a workshop in Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Nagar here. Though there are no exact figures, estimates suggest around 4,000 Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises running from this colony employ 30,000-40,000 workers. But 80% of them are now feared to have lost their jobs due to slump in demand post lockdown. Jaiswal Grinding had ten workers, but now has only three. Even as the month draws to a close, Mr. Jaiswal is worried about paying salaries to his employees. “If it continues like this, I will be forced to lay-off even these three,” says Mr. Jaiswal, adding that there is no work. He hopes the government will help create the demand soon by allow big companies to work and lift all restrictions. “There seems little coordination between the governments. The borders are sealed and de-sealed. It is not good for business,” says Mr. Jaiswal, his clothes reeking of oil and grease. A rickshaw-puller attached to his unit would make a decent Rs. 12,000-15,000 per month earlier, but he too is now hand-to-mouth. The tea-stall owner across the road and a food stall vendor catering to the workforce in the area have not returned to work since the easing of restrictions.  Long recovery time Dotting the Dabua-Pali Road in this industrial town, hundreds of MSMEs are open for more than a month now, but there is little business. Demand has slumped to 30-40% and most unit owners agree that it may take months before the situation improves. However, the most common refrain remains the “inadequate” efforts of the government for small businesses. Benefits, even if announced, have not reached many. Fixed charges on electricity bills remains a point in question. Though the Haryana government announced certain relief on fixed charges for the lockdown period, many ended up paying it. Komal Goyal of “Goyal Steels” says he paid Rs. 25,000 electricity bill two days ago and did not get any rebate on the fixed charges. Jaspal Singh, running a repair unit from inside his house in Dabua Colony, says he got Rs. 13,000 bill for the lockdown period with the fixed charges, but was not in a position to pay it. He has also not paid his monthly loan instalments of Rs. 18,667 for the past three months. “How can I pay when there is no work?,” he argues. Kushwaha Engineering Tools, a three tier-supplier to Maurti Suzuki, in the neighbourhood has no fresh orders since it opened on May 7. Of the 40 workers, only 10 have been called for work.  ‘A drop in the ocean’ V.P. Goyal has been running a cardboard boxes unit, “Anand Packs”, on Dabua-Pali Road for more than two decades. He feels that the announcements from the Union government are “a drop in the ocean” for small businessmen like him. He operates with Rs. 30 lakh Open Cash Credit limit, and hopes that 30-40% credit on this could have helped ease the liquidity crunch for him, especially when his over Rs. 50 lakh is stuck in the market due to the slump. He finds the government’s announcement of 10% credit on OCC for the MSMEs grossly insufficient. Taking a dig at the government’s stimulus package, Mr. Goyal remarks: “We got nothing from the Rs. 20 lakh crore. Don’t know who the government has helped.” Like many others, he too feels the most appropriate time to impose the lockdown was now, when the cases are on the rise. Mr. Jaiswal says that ideally the government should have stopped all payments, including loans, electricity bills and school fee, after the lockdown was announced. “How could people pay when there was no work? Though the government ordered landlords not to ask for rent and schools not to charge fee, but no one is listened to it. I had to pay my daughter’s college fee after the school struck her name off online classes,” says Mr. Jaiswal. Neeraj Sharma of R.S. Engineers and Fabricators suggested that a fortnight of curfew would have done more good than the two months of lockdown. “Cases are on the rise. We have achieved nothing from the lockdown. Despite the lockdown, the people were still out on the roads causing the virus to spread,” said Mr. Sharma. ‘No aid from govt.’ Though many unit owners claimed that they had retained their staff in the hope of the demand to augment, they conceded that it would be difficult to do so beyond a few months if the situation persists. Prashant of “Press Metals Engineers”, a three-tier supplier to Maruti Suzuki, manufacturing air-conditioner parts, says that none of his workers got ration and financial aid from the government. He says he could not pay his workers for the month of April, but any government aid to them would have been a big help for him. Summing up the mood among the MSMEs, Mr. Jaiswal says they all are starting from a scratch and the government should hold their hands to help them stand on their feet again.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/msmes-wait-for-work-as-demand-slumps-post-lockdown/article31829945.ece
15 June 2020||FARIDABAD,||Faridabad RWAs can now impose night curfew in their respective areas||In view of the rising cases of COVID-19, the Faridabad district administration has empowered the Residents Welfare Associations to impose night curfew in their areas with the help of the police and ensure single entry and exit points for residents. The directions, issued by the District Magistrate Yashpal Yadav, in the exercise of his powers under the Haryana Epidemic Disease, COVID-19 Regulations, 2020, also directed the RWAs to conduct temperature screening of residents. The Station House Officers concerned will assist the RWAs to ensure the implementation of the orders. The orders said the RWAs should monitor the movement of the residents at the entry-cum-exit gate. The directions came amid accusations against certain RWAs in the National Capital Region of wielding excess powers and imposing unreasonable restrictions on the residents during the lockdown such as not allowing them to take walk inside the society premises. Many RWAs have yet to allow entry of domestic help and the movement of delivery boys and newspaper vendors inside its premises despite government orders. Deputy Commissioner Yashpal Yadav said RWAs were an important link between the administration and the residents in the fight against the deadly virus. He added that the administration would need them for the management of patients in future and contract tracing. Therefore they need to keep them in the loop and empower them. Mr. Yadav said three officials would work with these RWAs and corrective measures will be taken against the associations if they are found exercising their power in excess.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/faridabad-rwas-can-now-impose-night-curfew-in-their-respective-areas/article31829927.ece
15 June 2020||GURUGRAM,||Efforts of administration to tackle hunger have been inadequate: report||Dwindling cash reserves, rising debt and food distress remain the plight of workers as Haryana transitions out of the lockdown, stated a report by civil society group Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch. Based on telephonic IVR-based surveys and on-ground conversations with workers, the report stated that the administration’s efforts to tackle hunger have been “inadequate”, and added that delay in distress-ration distribution during the peak period of food distress in Gurugram had made matters worse. The 12-page report also noted that withdrawal of cooked meal facilities had compounded the distress of around 37% workers who were dependent on them. Stressing on how workers were left with little cash due to the lockdown, the report said that 87% of daily wage workers and 75% of those with regular monthly incomes had less than Rs. 500 with them. Work in stasis Though all industries have been allowed to work at full strength in Gurugram and the markets are also open, the report found that 60% of daily wage labourers and 42% of those who worked in factories had not started working. It said the demand for workers in factories was low owing to social distancing norms and disrupted supply chains. Also, 44% of self-employed workers had not yet been able to restart work owing to negligible demand, and lack of capital to restart business, the report said. Debt on the rise Debt has also been on the rise, especially among the self-employed. Around 44% borrowed between Rs. 5,000-Rs. 8,000. A third of daily wage workers and permanent workers borrowed up to Rs. 2,000 and one-fifth borrowed between Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 5,000. “Also, 30% took loans of up to Rs. 2,000, 24% between Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 5,000; and 8% above Rs. 8,000,” said the report, titled ‘Caught In a Bind: A Status Report on Uncertainty and Distress Among Gurugram’s Unorganised Workers’. The report found that rental demands were not persistent, but were a source of anxiety. Only 25% of the respondents faced pressure from landlords to pay rents, but in the absence of moratoriums or waivers, cumulative rentals owed to landlords are a source of anxiety for migrants. A higher proportion of migrants from Assam, Bihar and West Bengal wish to return immediately, according to the report, but a large proportion from Uttar Pradesh, around 64%, are willing to wait for employment. Of the total respondents, 30% of migrants are eager to return immediately, 40% planning to wait and only 30% have no intention of leaving the city. The administration’s handling of migrants transportation via shramik trains and buses had been chaotic with last-minute announcements resulting in mismatches between reporting travellers and available seats. The manch demanded that the administration expedite distress rations to all non-ration card holders and make applicant and verification lists public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/efforts-of-administration-to-tackle-hunger-have-been-inadequate-report/article31829929.ece

15 June 2020||GUWAHATI,||Lockdown looms large as cases rise in Assam||The possibility of Assam going back to the total lockdown days loomed large on Sunday as the total number of COVID-19 positive cases neared the 4,000 mark. By 6 p.m. on June 14, Assam recorded 3,943 positive cases with 1,972 of them active and 1,960 having recovered. Eight people have died so far while three migrated to other States after detection. State Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had on Saturday said the total lockdown may be reimposed if the outcome of tests in Guwahati, to be ramped up to 50,000 from June 15, demands. Health officials said lockdown may be reimposed if about 500 people test positive. Assam’s northeastern neighbour Mizoram had reimposed total lockdown for two weeks from June 9 in order to ramp up testing, primarily for returnees. Guwahati, considered as the communication hub of the northeast, has been the focus of testing for COVID-19 as most returnees to the region have to pass through the city. Assam’s worry, however, has been the infection of people without any travel history. At least 25 such people have tested positive in Guwahati leading to 36 localities being declared as containment zones.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/lockdown-looms-large-as-cases-rise-in-assam/article31829942.ece

15 June 2020||LUCKNOW,||‘Real’ Anamika Shukla gets a job||Anamika Shukla, an unemployed woman from Gonda who had alleged that her educational certificates were misused to provide jobs to several “fake” teachers in Kasturba Gandhi Balika Schools across Uttar Pradesh, has now landed a job in a private school in her home district. In Gonda, the ‘real’ Anamika Shukla was recruited as an assistant teacher in the primary section of the Bhaiya Chandrabhan Dutt Smarak Vidyalaya. While offering her the appointment letter, school manager Digvijay Pandey said the committee had passed a resolution to employ Ms. Shukla as it had an excess of students. Ms. Shukla said the school had considered her “talent” while employing her. “ Bahut acha lag raha hai (I am feeling really good),” she told reporters. Last week, a new twist was added to the teacher recruitment scam in U.P. when Ms. Shukla submitted her documents at the office of the Basic Education Officer in Gonda, stating that she never worked as a teacher despite applying in five districts since 2017. FIR lodged On her complaint, the Gonda police have now lodged an FIR against persons accused of impersonating her to get employed as teachers, said Additional SP Mahendra Kumar.  Meanwhile, in Mainpuri, the police from Ambedkar Nagar arrested a woman, Anita Devi, on charges of getting employed as a teacher on forged documents of Anamika Shukla. Ms. Devi had been teaching at a Kasturba Gandhi Balika School in Ramnagar for a year using fake certificates, said Ambedkar Nagar SP Alok Priyadarshi. As per “the deal” between Ms. Devi and Pushpendra, who allegedly prepared her fake papers, she would receive Rs. 10,000 in cash while he would keep the rest of the monthly salary, Rs. 22,000, that was deposited in an account in her name, Mr. Priyadarshi said. The Kasganj police on Thursday nabbed Jaswant Singh, Pushpendra’s brother, who allegedly arranged jobs for several women on fake certificates. Jaswant was arrested on the inputs of Ms. Supriya, the first woman to be arrested in the case. G.S. Chandrabhan, SP Kasganj, said Jaswant, a college dropout, was himself working as a regular teacher in a school in Kannuaj with fake B.Sc, B.Ed. and NET certificates using the alias Vibhav Kumar. With Pushpendra, considered the main accused in the case, Jaswant claimed they had provided jobs to 17-18 women under the name of Anamika Shukla, said Mr. Chandrabhan.

15 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||Capital toll climbs to a new high with 56 deaths, over 2,000 cases||The Capital reported 2,224 COVID-19 cases and 56 deaths on Sunday, stated a health bulletin issued by the Delhi government. This is the highest spike in COVID-19 cases in a day. The total number of cases now stands at 41,182 out of which 24,032 are active cases. The total number of deaths here stands at 1,327. The government added that 878 more patients have recovered, taking the total recoveries to 15,823. This spike in cases came on a day when Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal met Union Home Minister Amit Shah along with other officials to take stock of the COVID-19 situation here. The Delhi government said the meeting between Centre and the State was very productive and key decisions were jointly taken. “The Centre and the Delhi government agreed on an immediate action plan to increase capacity of beds, testing and other important initiatives,” the government said. After the meeting, Mr. Kejriwal tweeted: “Extremely productive meeting between Delhi government and Central government. Many key decisions taken. We will fight against COVID-19 together.” Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the government has formed three teams to inspect hospitals here. “The teams will make rapid assessment of existing capacity...associated aspects of COVID-19,” Mr. Vardhan said. The order issued by the Ministry of Health and Family said these teams comprising doctors and experts from AIIMS Delhi, DGHS, MoHFW, Delhi government and officers from the Municipal Councils will make the assessment. “The teams will inspect the COVID-19 facilities and suggest specific measures for betterment of such facilities and patient care services,” the order said. The Chief Secretary of Delhi also issued instructions to ramp up testing facilities to 10,000 in the next two days and conduct 100% house-to-house survey in containment zones and other points. The government withdrew with immediate effect an order it passed on June 13 asking keepers of all nursing homes — having bed strength between 10 and 49 — declaring them as COVID-19 nursing homes. The government had declared all small and medium nursing homes having bed strength between 10 and 49 beds as COVID-19 nursing homes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/capital-toll-climbs-to-a-new-high-with-56-deaths-over-2000-cases/article31829935.ece
15 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||Meeting between Shah and Kejriwal a pointless exercise, says Congress||The Delhi Congress on Sunday said the meeting between Home Minister Amit Shah and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was a “pointless exercise” as both the Central and the Delhi governments have failed to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Shahwas living in a “make-belief” world as he had tweeted that the country was “strongly fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic” when in reality the number of cases had surged, the party alleged. Delhi Congress chief Ch Anil Kumar said Mr. Shah’s “false hopes and assurances” will only take the country’s situation to doom as the need of the hour is to take fool-proof measures to launch an all-out attack against the pandemic. He accused Mr. Kejriwal of sitting at home and trying to “fight” the pandemic instead of meeting experts and frontline fighters like healthcare workers. He added that the Capital has three big hospitals under the government, which are ready for inauguration. “Ambedkar Hospital with a capacity of 600 beds, Burari Hospital with a bed strength of 700-800 and the Indira Gandhi Hospital at Sector 9, Dwarka with a capacity of over 1,200 beds should be utilised instead of availing the 500 train coaches offer by Mr. Shah,” Mr. Kumar said.  Free tests He added that the Delhi Congress has been insisting that COVID-19 tests should be the right of every citizen of Delhi, and it should be done free of cost and that Mr. Kejriwal should take strong measures instead of giving false assurances to the people. He also alleged that several letters written by the Delhi Congress to Mr. Kejriwal has gone unanswered which shows that the government was not interested in consultation. He, however, added that he would participate in an all-party meeting of Delhi parties that has been called for by Mr. Shah on June 15.  Ambedkar Hospital with a capacity of 600 beds, Burari Hospital with a bed strength of 700-800 and the Indira Gandhi Hospital at Sector 9, Dwarka with a capacity of over 1,200 beds should be utilised instead of availing the 500 train coaches offer by Mr. Shah Ch Anil Kumar Delhi Congress chief||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/meeting-between-shah-and-kejriwal-a-pointless-exercise-says-congress/article31829933.ece
15 June 2020||New Delhi,||Hindu Rao Hospital to treat COVID-19 patients||In the wake of cases mounting here, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Hindu Rao Hospital was designated as a COVID-19 facility on Sunday. The order, issued by the Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, cited projections of a surge in COVID-19 cases and the need to urgently augment bed capacity in designating the hospital under the Delhi Epidemic COVID-19 Regulations and the Epidemic Act, 1897. The Medical superintendent of the hospital has been directed to make all all beds available to admit COVID-19 patients by Tuesday. About 209 patients currently admitted at the hospital will be shifted to other facilities run by the municipal corporation, including the Giridhar Lal Maternity Hospital (GLMH), Kasturba Hospital and to Ranjan Babu Institute of Pulmonary Medicine and Tuberculosis (RBIPMT), a municipal spokesperson said. The hospital has a total of 980 beds, out of which 37 are unavailable as they are in a part of the building that has been declared dangerous and 111 are complement beds, the civic body said. In terms of facilities, there are 17 ventilators, eight ICU beds and four HDU beds. Additionally, about 250 beds are said to be equipped with oxygen cylinders. While the hospital has already started its sampling clinic, certain modifications to manpower deployment, infrastructure and facilities related to patient care and healthcare workers would have to be made to treat only COVID-19 patients, hospital authorities said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hindu-rao-hospital-to-treat-covid-19-patients/article31829938.ece
15 June 2020||New Delhi,||Market associations to keep stores open: CAIT||Traders’ body, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), on Sunday said that subsequent to interventions made by Home Minister Amit Shah and his meeting with the Delhi government, market associations have decided to keep stores open in the Capital. Earlier, the traders’ body had carried out a comprehensive survey of market associations in the city, according to which nearly 88% market associations were in favour of shutting down markets to curb the spread of COVID-19, it said. The Sarojini Nagar Mini Market Association plans to shut stores on Monday in the usually busy market, given the lack of footfall and rapid spread of the virus. Options suggested While appreciating the steps announced by the Home Minister, CAIT said that if the situation warranted so, respective associations will take a call about the markets, either to open on an odd-even basis or on some other formula such as staying open for four days a week. At a meeting of about 275 trade leaders, it was decided that “since each market has different dynamics in terms of wholesale or retail and customer flow is different for each market, the social distancing norms vary from market-to-market and based on their own perception and number of COVID-19 positive cases, individual markets may take their decision in the best interest of the traders and customers of Delhi”, the traders’ body said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/market-associations-to-keep-stores-open-cait/article31829937.ece

An HC Bench also noted that the petitionerdid not point out any other part of Defence Colony where there is a cluster of COVID-infected persons. The court’s decision came after the Delhi government said that a lane (house numbers C-54 to C-65) in the colony has been declared as containment zone. The Delhi government also submitted that if in a particular colony, one or two houses, or a particular area within the colony, have a concentration of COVID patients, it does not mean that the entire colony will be required to be declared as a containment zone. The petition by Mr. Singh had sought for enforcing strict cluster containment or sealing as per guidelines of the government. He also sought to ensure availability of adequate number of beds in the hospitals in the State (private as well as government hospitals) and provide adequate facility for admission of persons requiring treatment for COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/entire-defence-colony-cannot-be-containment-zone-says-hc/article31829926.ece
15 June 2020||Mumbai,||23-year-old man held for rape, murder of minor girl in Dongri||The Dongri police on Saturday arrested a 23-year-old man for allegedly sexually assaulting and murdering a seven-year-old girl from his locality. The girl had been missing since May 30 and her body was recovered on Sunday, following the accused’s confession and arrest. CCTV clues According to the police, the victim was reported missing at 9.30 p.m. on May 30. The police said she had stepped out of her Dongri residence in the evening to play, but never returned. After searching for her at all possible spots, her family members approached the police. In keeping with the procedure for missing minors, the police registered a case of kidnapping against unknown persons and initiated inquiries. Investigating officers said the first clue came from CCTV cameras installed in the area. “We scanned footage from scores of CCTV cameras in and around the area till we found a man heading out of a locality with a gunny sack on his shoulder late at night. We obtained stills of the footage and started looking for the man, till we found a possible suspect matching his description on Friday,” an officer with the Dongri police said. The suspect was picked up and brought to the police station. For nearly a day, he held up under sustained questioning, claiming that he had been taking garbage from his house to dispose of. Finally, on Saturday, the suspect allegedly confessed to committing the crime. ‘Secluded spot used’ “The accused is from the same area and convinced the victim, who he saw while on his way home, to come with him. He took her to a secluded spot in the locality, which he knew is deserted at night and forced himself on her, after which he strangled her to death. He then stuffed her body in a sack, which he had in his house, and dumped it close to the railway tracks near the Sandhurst Road station,” senior police inspector Sandeep Bhagdikar, Dongri police station, said. The accused was arrested and charged with kidnapping, sexual assault and murder under the Indian Penal Code along with sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. He has been remanded in police custody till June 20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/23-year-old-man-held-for-rape-murder-of-minor-girl-in-dongri/article31830171.ece
15 June 2020||Mumbai,||Monsoon has arrived: IMD||Monsoon has officially arrived in Mumbai and entire Maharashtra, said the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday, forecasting heavy to very heavy rain for Monday and Tuesday. The ‘normal’ date for onset of monsoon in Mumbai is June 11. However, last year it was the most delayed in 45 years, arriving only on June 25. This year, however, the city experienced showers throughout last week. Mumbai has received 208.5 mm rainfall in pre-monsoon showers since June 1 but is yet to see heavy rain. Orange alert issued In its district-wise forecast, IMD has issued an orange alert for Mumbai, Thane, Palghar for Monday and Tuesday. An orange alert signifies ‘heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places’. Rain will continue on Wednesday and Thursday as well. “In the next five days, Maharashtra will see good rainfall. Some parts of Konkan, central Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha will see very heavy rainfall,” said Shubhangi Bhute, senior scientist at IMD, Mumbai. From 8.30 a.m. on Saturday to 8.30 a.m. on Sunday, Mumbai had received 19.7 mm rainfall. However, the city did not see any rain on Sunday, despite the declaration of monsoon. Explaining this, Ms. Bhute said, “There are several criteria for declaration of onset including upper air observation, ground observation, thunderstorm and 2.5 mm rain in two days among others. All of these indicated the onset of monsoon. It has been raining in Mumbai for several days now. Even an hour of heavy rain is enough.” Apart from Maharashtra, IMD also declared onset of monsoon over Gujarat. It has forecast that the monsoon will advance further north in the next two days. “Active monsoon conditions are expected over West Coast and interior Maharashtra in next two to three days,” IMD said in a press release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/monsoon-has-arrived-imd/article31830173.ece
15 June 2020||Mumbai,||ISBC has kept boxing fraternity live indoors: Narsi||Boxing administrator Kishen Narsi (80) would have in early March been in Wuhan as part of a technical panel appointed by AIBA (world boxing association) to oversee a competition in China. “Travel arrangements were made; I had my visa in hand and was ready to leave. Fortunately, the Asia/Oceania Olympic Qualifying Tournament was moved to Jordan, else I would have been in the middle of it (the outbreak in Wuhan); god is great,” Mr. Narsi said. The Mumbai-based chairman of the Asian Boxing Confederation’s competitions committee, relieved to have escaped a health hazard due to the change in venue, returned after a fortnight of work in Amman’s Prince Hamzah hall, straight to the monotony of home quarantine. “For two weeks, I was inside my flat, helping my wife in anyway that I could, besides working out. I walked inside the house for two hours and did my abdomen exercises, apart from the household chores,” he said. The curbs on outdoor sporting activity have been frustrating for the former boxer, who earned international reputation as a referee/judge and jury for tournaments at the Asia and World level, besides the Olympics. He was also an executive committee member of AIBA for 10 years. “I quit competitive boxing in 1962, then kept my body and mind active by playing different sports, especially tennis, snooker and bridge. Sports is a way of life,” Mr. Narsi said. He used the extended lockdown to participate in the Indian Shadow Boxing Challenge (ISBC), 2020 (see box). Mr. Narsi has submitted a 30-second clip of him attacking and defending against an imaginary opponent in an imaginary ring at home. ISBC is a shadow boxing competition organised by the Mumbai City Boxing Association, open to Indian citizens worldwide, and classified into different age categories. Mr. Narsi believes though he may be old in age, he is young at heart. “My wife asked me if I was sure about doing the boxing home video, and even pointed out that I didn’t have boxing gloves. But you don’t need equipment for shadow boxing, so I went ahead and submitted the video,” he said. The retired boxer said AIBA had also asked him to fly to London to oversee another event post the Amman qualifiers, but he excused himself to give his wife company in Mumbai. “I have not stepped out of my flat since I returned from Jordan. I keep wondering when this lockdown will end and I can go out to play tennis at the Bombay Gymkhana,” Mr. Narsi said. The veteran said he would be more than happy to lend a hand to the city association’s move to popularise shadow boxing. “The ISBC has brought about a feeling of being together, it has kept the boxing fraternity alive. Now that we are all indoors anyway, it helped to continue training. Most of our boys are training through this,” Mr. Narsi said. The experienced administrator also noted that boxing had evolved beyond a competitive sport into a fitness sport. “There are people I know ready to give fitness training at home for those between 45 to 50 years. Once you get involved in boxing, there are a lot of avenues. Like in Haryana for example, many have started their own boxing clubs,” he said. Boxing took off in the northern State following Vijender Singh’s emergence in world boxing. Singh’s career highs being the bronze medals won at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing and the 2009 World Boxing Championships at Milan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/isbc-has-kept-boxing-fraternity-live-indoors-narsi/article31830176.ece

The victims, aged 9 to 12 years and related to each other, went to the pond in Gungardi village on Saturday evening, an official from Garbada police station said. “While taking bath, one of the girls started drowning following which the other three tried to save her. However, later all of them started drowning and died while trying to save each other,” police sub-inspector Yogesh Rathwa said. Divers later fished out the bodies which were sent to a local community health centre for post-mortem, he said, adding further investigation is under way.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/four-girls-drown-in-pond/article31829948.ece
15 June 2020||Mumbai,||Govt. to use social media to identify blood donors||The Maharashtra government has decided to utilise the services of social media platforms to coordinate between blood donors and patients in need of blood. Around 71 government blood banks will be registered on Facebook’s blood donation tool. When needed, a blood bank can get in touch with the tool to identify donors in the vicinity. “We decided to use the tool as the government is extending a number of relaxations after the lockdown. It has been said time and again that the State requires blood not only for COVID-19 patients, but also for those suffering from other diseases. The Facebook tool is an attempt to ensure more donors get connected,” said State Health Department’s principal secretary Pradeep Vyas, on the occasion of World Blood Donation day. Mr. Vyas said 71 government blood banks will be registered on Facebook’s blood donation tool. “When requirement arises, a request will be made on the digital platform. Those who have registered with the social media platform, will be notified about the need,” he said. A message will be sent to the donors in the vicinity about the required blood group and address of the blood bank. “The rapid communication due to digital platforms will save lives,” he said. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been highlighting the requirement of blood in the State’s blood banks. The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown have restricted the flow of usual blood donors. Several youth organisations, including those of the three ruling parties of Congress, Shiv Sena, and Nationalist Congress Party have been organising blood donation camps, while adhering to physical distancing norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/govt-to-use-social-media-to-identify-blood-donors/article31829953.ece
15 June 2020||Mumbai,||Uddhav to kick-start Magnetic Maharashtra 2.0 with 12 pacts||Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday will launch Magnetic Maharashtra 2.0 to revive the economy in post-COVID-19 times, as part of the State government’s ‘Mission Begin Again’. This will be the first major government event promoting the industrial development of the State, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The State will be signing 12 memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with Indian as well as companies from the U.S., China, South Korea, and Singapore. The foreign companies, from diverse sectors such as engineering, car and spare parts manufacturing, information technology, logistics, chemical, and food processing, have agreed to invest in the State, according to an official from the Industries Department. A special session via videoconferencing will be held at 6.30 p.m. on Monday, which will be attended by industrialists, ambassadors from several countries, and investment agency representatives, along with Mr. Thackeray, Industries Minister Subhash Desai, and other officials. The official said Maharashtra is a preferred destination of businesses and aims to re-establish a supply chain in south-east Asia. “Monday’s event will kick-start Magnetic Maharashtra 2.0. The State has offered plug and play infrastructure, a land bank of over 40,000 acres, flexible rent and cost mechanisms, and automatic licences in 48 hours through Mahaparvana and labour bureau to fulfil the need of workers. All these initiatives by the State will surely attract more investments,” the official said. The previous government had launched the Magnetic Maharashtra summit with an aim to bring in investments worth Rs. 10 lakh crore. Though the then government had claimed several MoUs were signed, the Opposition had questioned how many translated into investments on the ground. While the lockdown has hit industries and trade, relaxations offered by the State are beginning to restart the economic cycle. The Industries Department claimed that it had begun over 60,000 businesses and over 15 lakh workers had reported for duty.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/uddhav-to-kick-start-magnetic-maharashtra-20-with-12-pacts/article31829950.ece
15 June 2020||Mumbai,||State forms committee to probe issues related to barrage in Telangana||The Maharashtra government has formed a six-member committee to examine the problems that arose following submergence of land in the State due to the Medigadda barrage in neighbouring Telangana. It is possible Telangana constructed the barrage “in a different manner” than what it had conveyed to Maharashtra, the Uddhav Thackeray-led State government said in a recent order. Pact signed in 2016 Land was acquired in Sironcha of Gadchiroli district for the project. The barrage was inaugurated by Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao last year at an event, which was also attended by then Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. The two States had signed a memorandum of understanding for the construction of the inter-State irrigation project in August 2016. “It is possible that Telangana constructed the barrage in a manner different from what it had conveyed to the Maharashtra government when the inter-State agreement with regard to the barrage was reached,” the Shiv Sena-led government said in its order. “Also, it needs to be examined what is (the area of) the forest land that will be submerged (due to the barrage),” the government said. Government criteria It also needs to be probed whether the certificate issued by the forest department was issued as per the government criteria or under somebody’s pressure, it said. “The local office of deputy conservator for forest had raised objections on certain aspects while the construction was on, but the then district collector instructed him not to act; this be probed under whose pressure it was done,” said the committee’s terms of reference.  Compensation The committee will take up with the Telangana government the issue of compensation for farmers in Sironcha, whose land was submerged, the order said. The panel, to be headed by Nagpur divisional commissioner, has been asked to submit its report within a month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/state-forms-committee-to-probe-issues-related-to-barrage-in-telangana/article31830187.ece
15 June 2020||Mumbai,||SBI shuts three branches in Mumbai, Thane after spike in COVID-19 cases||The nation’s largest lender, State Bank of India, has temporarily closed three branches — two in Mumbai and one in adjoining Thane — after eight staff tested positive for COVID-19, bank employees said. The bank’s main branch in Thane was shuttered last week after seven of the 25 staff were found COVID-19 positive, according to a senior bank employee. A cash officer at the local cheque processing cell (LCPC), also known as the clearing department, in Jogeshwari (East) was found COVID-19 positive, leading to temporary closure of the branch early last week, said another employee. As a precautionary measure, the bank temporarily stopped operations at its LCPC located in Andheri, after a gardener working there was founded to be infected with the virus, the employee said. When contacted, the SBI said, “Our quick response team headed by a general manager is continuously monitoring the situation in the entire country and due protocol is followed in case of any infection. Many of our staff members, who got infected, have recovered and are contributing to the functioning of the bank in these trying times.” Over the past few days, three SBI employees — Sandu Borade of the Churchgate branch; Anirban Datta of the Belapur CBD branch; and Ramesh Rane of the Ghatkopar branch — were lost to the coronavirus infection. On the death of these staffers, the SBI statement said, “A few unfortunate deaths have happened and we are deeply saddened by the incidents. The compensation (including COVID-19 compensation amount) is paid as per the established rules of the bank.” “Safety protocol is complied with and all possible support is provided. We salute our employees who are contributing to the nation in these trying times,” the statement said. Another SBI employee said despite such a high number of cases being detected, the bank management is asking them to come in full strength and branches are back to normal operations. A third employee said that the mortgage divisional headquarters in Thane is carrying out “full documentation” and let applicants visit the branch where no physical distancing is possible.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/sbi-shuts-three-branches-after-spike-in-cases/article31829951.ece
15 June 2020||Panaji,||Hit hard by lockdown, museums in Goa await govt. approval to reopen||Owners of Goa’s heritage museums, which are struggling to stay afloat due to the COVID-19 crisis, are hopeful that the State government will allow them to reopen their premises for visitors soon. Though a lot of curbs have been lifted in Goa, museums have not yet been allowed to reopen. Goa, which is popular among tourists as a beach destination, is also home to several museums that showcase the rich culture and heritage of this former Portuguese colony. Since the lockdown came into force in March, these museums, which used to attract hundreds of visitors on normal days, have remained closed. Talking to PTI , Maendra Alvares, the curator of ‘Big Foot’ museum at Loutolim village in South Goa district, said his gallery has been shut for over two-and-a-half months now. But, he is hopeful the government will allow museums to reopen. “When the State borders open for tourists, we also expect to get visitors. We used to host nearly 400 visitors a day at the museum earlier, but now the footfalls are likely to decrease,” he said. Limca Book of Records Spread across 12 acres, the museum has a sculpture of ‘Mirabai’, which has been registered in the Limca Book of Records as the longest laterite sculpture in India. Mr. Alvares said he is aware that all precautions will have to be taken while reopening the museum. “Very soon, people will be used to living with the coronavirus. People are bored of sitting at home, so they will prefer visiting places like ours.” The ‘Goa Chitra’ museum, another popular tourist attraction at Benaulim in South Goa, has been shut since the lockdown began in March. Its curator Victor Hugo Gomes is also waiting for the government’s order to open the premises for visitors. “We have temporarily closed the place. It has been financially draining, but personally I got time to sit and document whatever I have been collecting all this while,” he said. Mr. Gomes said he is ready to open the museum, which has a rich collection of artefacts dating back to pre-Portuguese era, whenever allowed by the authorities. ‘Sanitisation booth’ “We have already installed a sanitisation booth for visitors. They will be provided with face masks and physical distancing will be maintained during tours of the place,” he said. He is optimistic that once the museum opens, the footfalls will not be less than earlier. The United Nation’s cultural agency last month warned that nearly 13% of museums around the world may never reopen, as about 90% of them globally have had to close their doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two studies by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation and the International Council of Museums said museums have been especially affected by the pandemic, with nearly 90% of them, or more than 85,000 institutions, having closed their doors for varying lengths of time during the crisis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hit-hard-by-lockdown-museums-in-goa-await-govt-approval-to-reopen/article31830186.ece
15 June 2020||Washington,||U.S. official resigns over black man’s death||The police chief in the U.S. city of Atlanta resigned after an officer fatally shot a black man during an arrest, the Mayor said Saturday, with the new killing injecting fresh anger into protests against racism and police brutality. Images on local media showed hundreds of protesters in the streets on Saturday and flames engulfing the Wendy’s restaurant where 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks was killed. The officer who shot Brooks was dismissed on Saturday and identified by Atlanta police as Garrett Rolfe. The second officer was placed on administrative duty, according to ABC News. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms — who has been touted as a potential running mate for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden — earlier announced the resignation of Chief Erika Shields. Asleep in car Wendy’s employees called police on Friday night to complain that Brooks was asleep in his car and blocking other customers on the premises, an official report said. He failed a sobriety test and resisted when police tried to arrest him, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) said. Surveillance video showed “that during a physical struggle with officers, Brooks obtained one of the officer’s Tasers and began to flee from the scene,” the report continued. “Officers pursued Brooks on foot and during the chase, Brooks turned and pointed the Taser at the officer. The officer fired his weapon, striking Brooks,” it said. Brooks was taken to hospital but died after surgery, it said, adding that one officer was injured. An attorney acting for the dead man’s family said disproportionate force was used in the confrontation. “In Georgia a Taser is not a deadly weapon — that’s the law,” L. Chris Stewart told reporters. “Support came, in I think 2 minutes. He would have been boxed in and trapped. Why did you have to kill him?” “(The officer) had other options than shooting a man in the back.” Brooks has four children, Stewart added, and had celebrated the birthday of his eight-year-old girl earlier on Friday. His death is the 48th shooting involving an officer the GBI has been asked to investigate this year, according to local newspaper the Atlanta Journal-Constitution . Fifteen of those incidents were fatal. Reckoning on racism The unrest comes as the U.S. faces a historic reckoning on systemic racism, with mass civil unrest ignited by the May 25 killing of another African-American man, George Floyd, while in police custody. Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Protests which spread first around the country then the globe, have forced a conversation on the legacies of slavery, colonialism and white violence against people of colour, as well as the militarisation of police. Police chief Shields had worked for Atlanta’s police department for more than two decades.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-official-resigns-over-black-mans-death/article31829667.ece
15 June 2020||Washington,||Trump sidesteps controversies in address||U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday addressed the new graduating class of the West Point military academy, praising the “righteous glory of the American warrior” but largely sidestepping recent controversies over racial unrest and the military’s role in putting it down. “America is the greatest country in human history,” Mr. Trump told the 1,107 newly minted second lieutenants as they sat, well-spaced, under a bright sun on the parade ground of the U.S. Military Academy. Racial challenges But he made no direct mention of the recent racial turmoil and only glancingly referred to recent dissent from top military figures over his threat to employ active duty troops to put down protests. Mr. Trump’s closest mention came when he said, “I also want to thank the men and women of our National Guard” for responding to “challenges from hurricanes and natural disasters to ensuring peace, safety and the constitutional rule of law on our streets.” The President, who was introduced by the academy’s first black superintendent, Lieutenant General Darryl Williams, also referred only passingly to the nation’s racial challenges. Remark on segregation “The army was at the forefront of ending the terrible injustice of segregation,” he said, and it was West Point graduates who led the fight in the Civil War to “end the evil of slavery.” Mr. Trump did not mention that one West Point barracks still bears the name of General Robert E. Lee, who led the break-away Confederate forces during that war, which brought an end to slavery. Mr. Trump has rejected recent demands to rename U.S. military bases bearing the names of Confederate officers. Tensions between Mr. Trump and the military had soared since he threatened to call out active duty troops to put down sometimes violent protests. The academy had been shut and students sent home because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But Mr. Trump abruptly announced in April that he would address the graduates in person.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-sidesteps-controversies-in-address/article31829668.ece

The poll was due to be held on April 25 but was put off and then postponed indefinitely due to the epidemic, which official figures show has infected nearly 2,000 people and killed 11. The Election Commission said on Wednesday that the vote would be held on August 5. The new health measures — to be implemented at polling booths and counting centres — were trialled in four of the 22 electoral districts, Commission chairman Mahinda Deshapriya told reporters. “We were very pleased to see that all those who volunteered to take part in this exercise today wore face masks,” he said. “Officials and polling agents will be behind clear plastic screens or wear face shields. We have also ensured that voters will stand a metre apart when they queue up.” Voters will also be required to bring their own pen or pencil to mark ballot papers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-holds-mock-poll-to-test-health-measures/article31829664.ece

The search giant said the photo’s removal from its horizontal list atop search results for former British Premiers was due to an automatic update and “not purposeful”, but apologised “for any concern”. It noted that the issue only applied to its so-called “knowledge graph” listing and that many images of Churchill were still easily found on its search engine. “We’re aware an image for Sir Winston Churchill is missing from his knowledge graph entry on Google,” the firm’s search liaison arm said on Twitter. “We apologise for any concern. This was not purposeful & will be resolved. Images in such panels are automatically created & updated. During an update, they can briefly disappear.” The statement added his photo would be restored.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/churchills-photo-goes-missing-from-search-results/article31829665.ece

15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,||The need for an anti-discrimination law||Sport is often a microcosm of society. Much as we might sometimes see it as a leveller, it invariably tends to underscore more endemic inequities. Recent revelations made by the former West Indies cricket captain Darren Sammy, therefore, must awaken us to a problem that goes far beyond the cricket field and its narrow confines, of a society replete with racism. Voices in sport In our country, this problem is only exacerbated by other historically ingrained forms of discrimination, along the lines of caste, class, gender, and religion among other things. Indeed, in reacting to Mr. Sammy’s statements, the former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan pointed not only to how players from the south of India routinely faced abuse from crowds in the north — something which the Tamil Nadu and India opener Abhinav Mukund too attested to — but also to another form of prejudice even more entrenched in society. On June 9, Mr. Pathan said, in a tweet, that racism in our country goes beyond the colour of our skins, that enforcing embargoes on people seeking to buy houses based on their faith ought to equally be seen as a feature of prejudice. Predictably, Mr. Pathan faced a volley of abuses for his tweet. A number of people told him that India had given him everything — love, fame and money — and that he should check with Pakistan on how they were doing. But, if anything, these responses only reinforced his argument. Here was a cricketer, who had represented India on the world stage with some distinction, being asked to prove his loyalty all over again, simply on account of his faith. So vitriolic were some of the responses that Mr. Pathan was eventually forced into clarifying that his opinions “are always as an Indian and for India”. He did not need to do this, not least because his judgment had captured the kernel of the debate: that more than 70 years after Independence, our society remains rife with structural discrimination. Blow against race-neutrality These prejudices, which pervade every aspect of life, from access to basic goods, to education and employment, are sometimes manifest. But, on other occasions, the discrimination is indirect and even unintended. The latter, however, is just as pernicious. The forms that it takes were perhaps best explained by the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Griggs vs. Duke Power Co. (1971). There, the court held that an energy company had fallen foul of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964 — which made racial discrimination in private workplaces illegal — by insisting on a superfluous written test by applicants for its better entry-level jobs. Although, on the face of it, this requirement was race-neutral, in practice it allowed the company to victimise African-Americans. In a memorable judgment, invoking an Aesop fable, Chief Justice Burger wrote that “tests or criteria for employment or promotion may not provide equality of opportunity merely in the sense of the fabled offer of milk to the stork and the fox.” On the contrary, the law, he said, resorting again to the fable, “provided that the vessel in which the milk is proffered be one all seekers can use.” That is, that it wasn’t merely “overt discrimination” that was illegal but also “practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation”. State and private contracts Both direct and indirect forms of discrimination militate against India’s constitutional vision of equality. The verdict in Griggs was notably applied by Justice S. Ravindra Bhat in the Delhi High Court’s 2018 judgment in Madhu vs. Northern Railway . There, the Railways had denied free medical treatment to the wife and daughter of an employee which they would otherwise have been entitled to under the rules. The Railways contended that the employee had “disowned” his family and had had their names struck off his medical card. The court held that to make essential benefits such as medical services subject to a declaration by an employee might be “facially neutral”, but it produced a disparate impact, particularly on women and children. But while this case concerned discrimination by the state, entry barriers to goods such as housing, schools and employment tend to function in the realm of private contracts. The Constitution, though, is markedly vocal on this too. Article 15(2) stipulates that citizens shall not on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth be denied access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment. Yet, on occasion, this right, which applies horizontally, inter se individuals, comes into conflict with the rights of persons to associate with others, often to the exclusion of certain groups. This is why every time a case of discrimination is brought, the party that discriminates claims that he possesses a liberty to do so, that he must be free to act according to his own sense of conscience. The Supreme Court, in 2005, in Zoroastrian Cooperative Housing Society vs District Registrar Co-operative Societies (Urban) and Others , endorsed one such restrictive bond, when it ruled in favour of a bye-law of a Parsi housing society that prohibited the sale of property to non-Parsis. This right to forbid such a sale, the Court ruled, was intrinsic in the Parsis’ fundamental right to associate with each other. But in holding thus, the judgment, as Gautam Bhatia points out in his book, The Transformative Constitution , not only conflated the freedom to contract with the constitutional freedom to associate, but also overlooked altogether Article 15(2). At first blush, Article 15(2) might appear to be somewhat limited in scope. But the word “shops” used in it is meant to be read widely. A study of the Constituent Assembly’s debates on the clause’s framing shows us that the founders explicitly intended to place restrictions on any economic activity that sought to exclude specific groups. For example, when a person refuses to lease her property to another based on the customer’s faith, such a refusal would run directly counter to the guarantee of equality. An overruling of the verdict in Zoroastrian Cooperative , while desirable, is unlikely, however, to serve as a panacea. India is unique among democracies in that a constitutional right to equality is not supported by comprehensive legislation. In South Africa, for example, a constitutional guarantee is augmented by an all-encompassing law which prohibits unfair discrimination not only by the government but also by private organisations and individuals. Attempts at change In India, there have been a few efforts to this end in recent times. Shashi Tharoor introduced a private member’s bill (drafted by Tarunabh Khaitan) in 2017, while the Centre for Law & Policy Research drafted and released an Equality Bill last year. These attempts recognise that our civil liberties are just as capable of being threatened by acts of private individuals as they are by the state. Ultimately, our rule of law must subsume an understanding that discrimination partakes different forms. Any reasonable conception of justice would demand that we look beyond the intentions of our actions, and at the engrained structures of society. This does not mean that we need to live under an illusion that a statute will resolve our systemic biases, that we will somehow magically transform ourselves into the kind of nation that B.R. Ambedkar envisioned. But, now more than ever, as we look to reset our societal arrangements in the wake of COVID-19, a rededication to our original constitutional commitment could be worthwhile. To that end, the idea of enacting a law that will help ameliorate our ways of life, that will help reverse our deep-rooted culture of discrimination, is worth thinking about.

15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,||The emergence of the real Kejriwal||The criticism of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) enacted by India last year to grant citizenship to Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Parsi and Christian people persecuted in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh comes from two opposing perspectives — liberals see it as an exclusionary law while nativists find it too inclusive. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) founder and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s opposition to the CAA falls in the second strand — Hindu or Muslim, persecuted or not, Pakistani or Sri Lankan, why should anyone be allowed to India at all? “I understand that the law favours Pakistani Hindus and is against Indian Hindus… We cannot and will never do that as we are deshbhakts,” he said in the Delhi Assembly in mid-March. In January, he had wondered, “What is the guarantee that Pakistan would not send spies as Hindus ...?” He has argued that as Chief Minister of Delhi, his responsibility is only to look after the welfare of its people. His decision, now overturned by the Delhi Lieutenant Governor, to limit private and State-government-run hospital services in the context of COVID-19 treatment only to the residents of the city who have the documents to prove that was, therefore, in line with this familiar position. India only for Indians; Delhi, only for Delhi-ites. Mr. Kejriwal’s three consecutive victories in Delhi had raised hopes of a new model of non-ideological politics that could potentially replace the various mobilisation strategies of legacy parties. His ability to win public approval cutting across class, caste and religion had borne out that potential. Politics was no longer about representation and empowerment; it was only about management and efficiency. For the consumer citizens, Mr. Kejriwal became the most reliable delivery boy in their conception of politics as an online marketplace. Public services in Delhi became better under Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) rule. Or so it appeared until the pandemic struck. Behind the apoliticism claim This apoliticism of the AAP, however, was always a tenuous claim. Nativism is politics and service delivery came wrapped in Hindu symbolism. Deployment of Hindu symbolism is near universal in Indian politics these days, and Mr. Kejriwal paraded them with panache, ahead of the 2020 Delhi Assembly election. He could run with the hare and hunt with the hounds on the CAA — he was counted among its opponents while pleasing anti-Pakistani voters — a politician’s dream. But the whirlwind unleashed by the Bharatiya Janata Party threw him off balance on his tightrope. Equivocation was not enough for the urban voters of the city who voted overwhelmingly for Hindutva twice between voting for him three times. In return, he cheered the stripping of Jammu and Kashmir’s Statehood even while arguing for full Statehood for Delhi. He looked the other way when an armed group went on a rampage at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi in January. He offered platitudes when communal riots shook the city and claimed more than 50 lives. The AAP’s 2020 manifesto promised patriotism courses in schools and to instil reverence for the armed forces among students. As the national lockdown (COVID-19) began, he said he and his family would use the time to read the Bhagavad Gita and urged others to follow suit. The record so far The grass-root level activists, liberal intelligentsia and Left-leaning supporters who were the most vocal supporters of Mr. Kejriwal were soon disappointed, and they were purged from the party. A recent book on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) records that its chief Mohan Bhagwat was worried over the influence of such activists in the India Against Corruption (IAC) movement in 2011-12, the precursor to AAP. The IAC was a heterogeneous crowd ranging from non-governmental organisations to the RSS; AAP metamorphosed as majoritarian in instincts and authoritarian in practice. Mr. Kejriwal had figured the cocktail that sways politics — a hybrid of left-leaning economic measures and right-leaning cultural flashing. He repudiates the market. Taking oath as Chief Minister this year he said: “Some say Kejriwal is making everything free. All the invaluable things are free, a mother’s love for the child, a father’s staying hungry to support his child’s education... Kejriwal loves Delhi’s people, they love him back; this love is also free.” He could harvest the sentiments of those disenfranchised and brutalised by the market, though they are now left to fend for themselves. He projects himself as the strong leader of the hard state. Sedition charges against JNU students were signed off by his government, after wavering over it for sometime. Privacy is a huge concern for a section of the intelligentsia, but he boasts about expanding surveillance and wins votes. Government schools in the city are rolling out a technology tool that allows parents to watch their wards real time. He feigns humility and claims to listen to the people. There is nothing between the people and the Leader — no cabinet, no media that can ask questions. The decision to shut out ‘outsiders’ from Delhi hospitals was taken after “90 percent of the people” in a digital poll wanted it that way, Mr. Kejriwal announced. People against people. It has been pointed out that in the new Delhi cabinet, there are no women. The party, however, wanted the death sentence for more types of sexual offences. A Delhi government advertisement on female foeticide is instructive of Mr. Kejriwal’s views regarding women empowerment. “I am a girl child speaking from my mother’s womb...,” the dramatised voice of a child opens it, pleading for her life. Then comes Mr. Kejriwal’s voice: “I am talking for lakhs of such unborn girls..Killing an unborn child is as bad as killing a living person... As much sin... These girls will grow up to be someone’s mother, daughter-in-law, wife..and these daughters will be our nation’s Kalpana Chawla, Sania Mirza, P.T. Usha... Will bring glory to the nation” Quite a candid explanation of the instrumentality of women in the progress of the nation. The present and the future The intelligentsia, including feminists, might find such positions detestable, but Mr. Kejriwal no longer needs them. Questioning the majority’s view is not the smartest thing in politics. Other than the Congress’s Rahul Gandhi, no other mainstream politician who has a stake in heartland politics has questioned the Narendra Modi government’s Kashmir policy. Mr. Kejriwal’s deputy, Manish Sisodia, briefly appeared to empathise with the anti-CAA protesters in Delhi and almost lost his Assembly seat, even though he is in charge of education which appears to be doing well. Mr. Kejriwal was thought of as an alternative to Prime Minister Narendra Modi by many. He might want to be his successor still, and if he actually makes it, it will not be by challenging Hindutva. Meanwhile, his claims of efficiency in governance are under the first real life test in Delhi as the city, and the AAP government, wake up from the lockdown slumber to a collapsing health-care system and bourgeoning cases of COVID-19. varghese.g@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-emergence-of-the-real-kejriwal/article31829651.ece
15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,||Making public transport safe during COVID-19||Central to India’s lockdown to control the spread of COVID-19 was a complete shutdown of the transport system. Now, as the country emerges from the lockdown, a proper ramping up of the transport system is needed. This should not be done in haste, however. Can COVID-19 spread through public transport systems? It is difficult to answer this question with numbers. A recent paper from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology argued that New York’s subways seeded the epidemic in the city. While the research fails to establish causation from the observed correlation, as the author had admitted, it cannot be discarded as implausible. It is commendable that India shut down public transport before it could contribute to the spread, with an early lockdown. We now need to consider what can ensue on a restart, especially of metro rail.  COVID-19 and public transport Fearing crowd infections, commuters prefer travelling in private modes like two-wheelers. Cities like Delhi, that resumed services nearly four weeks ago, observed less ridership than the allowed 20 passengers per bus, despite the limited frequencies on many routes. Although bus crowding is seen in some cities such as Mumbai, it is temporary and due to a lack of alternatives. A significant drop in public transport ridership can be expected for months after resumption, based on opinion surveys. That means measures are needed to gain the public’s confidence in mass transport modes, to avoid a significant modal shift to road traffic. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has released guidelines to tackle several social distancing and sanitisation concerns, and to address the possibility of viral transmission through tokens, push buttons on lifts, and handrails at the station elevators. Other metro rail systems are also expected to follow similar guidelines. Are these measures enough to prevent serious viral transmission? Unfortunately, public transit agencies around the world face the problem of a dearth of research by scientists on the specific modality of COVID-19 transmission during public transport commute. Confidentiality laws usually prevent the availability of contact-tracing data to extract the precise details of how any individual got infected. There have been some notable research efforts, currently under peer review, that did use detailed contact-tracing data from China and Korea. One study says that SARS-CoV-2 does not seem to get transmitted much outdoors. In fact, only a single cluster of two cases out of nearly a thousand was traced to an outdoor infection in China. Correlation to the effect of air conditioning airflow has also been established based on precise seating locations of those infected at a restaurant and at a call centre. Indian authorities who were already working under similar assumptions on the effects of AC will be proven justified by the conclusion of such research that there is clearly high risk in indoor areas under AC with focused air flow. From the above research we can conclude that a non-AC bus with open windows offers a much less risky outdoor-like environment. However, it would be wrong to conclude that an AC metro rail coach is risky – for a different reason, in that contact-time is also very important in viral transmission in indoor spaces. A majority of metro rail trips in Indian cities are no more than 20 minutes long, and there is research indicating that this may not be long enough for significant viral densities and inhalation of sufficient viral particles, even without social distancing. It is unlikely for any significant level of public transport infections to happen via inhalation or even crowding and clothed-body contact, though we cannot say it with certainty. However, hand contact with common surfaces must be considered, as it is well-known to cause significant COVID-19 spread. The guidelines being developed in India address some of the related issues. However, they leave out certain key elements that should be taken very seriously – the handgrip rings and handrails from the ceilings, the stanchion poles, and any grabrails on the seatbacks. If an infected asymptomatic person deposits viral particles on such surfaces, and another person grabs the same spot even briefly, the viral particles could be picked up by their hand. The second person could later deposit the particles on his/her face. Probabilities may help, and another person may not hold on to the exact 3-inch long area before the virus dissipates, in all cases but one – that of the handgrip rings. Their surface is potentially the most dangerous inside a coach. Every successive individual who hangs on to the handgrip where one infected person deposited the virus can pick up the virus at a high density from the same spot. Then the probability is quite high that, within an hour, two or three others could pick up the virus left by one person on a handgrip. There is also a high probability that those people will touch their faces soon after. Suggestions for more safety Considering such possibilities, we offer a few safety suggestions that can be implemented immediately. The first is to employ staff to wipe the handgrips at frequent intervals, constantly moving from end to end in the train. Any handgrips in buses also need to be cleaned often. Another is to give wet sanitising wipes to every traveler entering a metro rail coach with a suggestion to have it in their palms before touching or gripping anything. Wipe disposal bins will be needed in the coaches. The metro rail agencies’ focus may need to shift to the egressing passengers, as it is important to prevent them from transferring what is on their hands to their faces after egress. We should expect a lot of passengers to leave in a hurry and to not bother with cleaning their hands, even if hand sanitiser dispensers are available. Paid staff or volunteers dispensing hand sanitisers on platforms can be an option. Offering contact-less wash basins with soap dispensers at the platform level could be effective. Signs on hand hygiene vis-a-vis touching surfaces are needed. There are possible options in metro trains to create external airflow to dissipate viral particles. Metro rail authorities are planning to leave the doors open at the terminal before the next run of each train. Since a majority of metro rail stretches in India are elevated, there are other creative options, if safety considerations will allow them. One would be to have staff onboard to direct passengers away from a certain coach to other coaches. The doors of the empty coach can be opened during a run for two or three minutes. We are not aware of such operations anywhere, so any attempt must only be after careful experimentation. Eventually, metro rail AC systems could be changed to High Efficiency Particulate Air filters with frequent circulation of fresh air. Actions are needed from both authorities and the public to keep our public transport systems safe. If no such actions are taken and a serious level of viral transmission is later traced to public transit, the result will be a mode shift to private vehicles. As pollution and accidents kill more people in India than COVID-19 does now, a mode shift away from public transport will have long-term consequences. Our buses and trains must be perceived as safe, so it is vital to assure ourselves that public transport is for the public – not the virus. R.

15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,||The data story||A report in this newspaper, “India may have undercounted cases” (June 14), based on a serological survey by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), has reignited the debate on the accuracy of COVID-19 data. While it is impossible for any news organisation to authenticate numbers put out by official sources, let me assure readers that The Hindu data team follows certain guidelines to document the daily numbers. I say this as some readers have cited different sources to question the figures published by the newspaper. For instance, Zaheeb Ajmal sent us a number of screenshots and PDFs to contest the numbers published by The Hindu . His source is Worldometer. Another reader, Somak Basu, from Trichy was unhappy with the newspaper’s interpretations of doubling time and felt that they showed India in a poor light. The newspaper sources its data from State governments, the Central government, the World Health Organization (WHO) and respected academic organisations. It tries to avoid data from websites where the data sources are suspect. The Hindu is transparent about its sourcing of data. This does not mean that data furnished by agencies cannot be questioned or subjected to a closer scrutiny. Tracking data  The Hindu data team uses two trackers for page 1 news and for other COVID-19-related stories. At times, there may be some variations in the total number of cases and deaths as some States (Tripura and Delhi, for example) tend to release their numbers late. The newspaper’s robust reporter and desk network works round the clock to update a master sheet on daily COVID-19 cases across States by sourcing numbers from the health departments of the respective States. Normally data from most States are available by 10.30 p.m. These are the numbers the newspaper uses to update the daily count on page 1. The full data on the master sheet are also used to generate maps and updates for its live page (thehindu.com/coronavirus).   Data related to testing/samples, etc. are also gleaned every day by The Hindu data team which maintains a more detailed break-up of State-wise COVID-19 numbers here (https://www.thehindu.com/data/covid-19-state-wise-tracker-for-coronavirus-cases-deaths-and-testing-rates/article31248444.ece). The aim of this tracker is to provide the infection and fatality curves of each State and compare the testing and positivity rates of these States on a regular basis. Why does the data team prefer to use State trackers instead of Central government data? The reason is simple. The State governments release data earlier than the Union Health Ministry. This helps the newspaper stick to deadline. Initially, The Hindu reported both State and Central numbers on page 1. But when the data team realised that the State tracker was stable and, more importantly, available before the print deadline, the newspaper abandoned reporting the Union Health Ministry’s numbers. For page 1 updates, the data team also uses the ICMR’s daily release of the number of total samples tested. This is published along with the State-wise updates on cases and fatalities. Reliable data For comparison across countries, the data team uses the ‘COVID-19 Global Cases’ tracker provided by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). The Hindu data team prefers the JHU tracker for many reasons. One, it is one of the earliest trackers that listed worldwide information on cases and deaths. Two, it provides an API interface and hosts the data on an open source GitHub account from where base data can be easily sourced. Three, it relies on data from official sources from the respective countries and lists these data properly. Four, it provides up-to-date data faster than, say, the WHO’s tracker. Many readers cited the disputed figures from the website, Worldometers.info, to contest The Hindu ’s headline “India’s COVID tally fifth highest in world” (June 7). On the day of reporting, both the JHU tracker and the WHO showed that Spain had close to 2.4 lakh cases. When India’s tally crossed the mark in JHU’s table, The Hindu team used that for the headline. The JHU’s number matched the official tally of Spain’s Health Ministry, whereas the Worldometer’s tally did not. Besides stories related to testing, infection rates, doubling time and fatalities, the data team has also looked at the impact of the lockdown on the economy. Each of these stories cited the sources from where the base data was taken, analysed, and reinterpreted. readerseditor@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-data-story/article31829654.ece
15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,||Silence of the stars||The recent killing of George Floyd has led to large-scale riots and public demonstrations across the U.S. Angry mobs have taken to the streets protesting the inhuman treatment meted out to Floyd and several others like him — a violence which has become systemic. A filmmaker friend from Minneapolis wrote to me saying that people are angry and fed up. James Baldwin immediately comes to mind. Amongst others, he wrote about the problem of being black in America. I will never forget how hauntingly he wrote about the colour of his skin on account of which he was constantly stared at a small village in Switzerland. Barry Jenkins’ masterful adaptation of Baldwin’s novel, If Beale Street Could Talk (2018), features an African-American man being wrongly charged for a crime he never committed. When They See Us (2019), a web television miniseries created for Netflix, is based on a real incident. In it, five teens of colour from Harlem are falsely accused in a rape case and sentenced to prison. The U.S. has a long history of racial violence, which is deplorable to say the least. India has its own ugly realities to deal with. Caste-based crimes are rampant even today. For many living in metropolitan India, news items on caste-based discrimination and violence introduce us to a reality that many may not have personally encountered. Cinema can play a significant role in initiating these dialogues owing to its wide reach. Contemporary Tamil cinema, for example, with proponents such as Vetrimaaran and Pa. Ranjith, does a fantastic job of delineating caste injustice in contemporary India. Selective in espousal of causes During the ongoing protests in the U.S., certain sections of the Indian media chose to highlight reactions from mainstream Bollywood stars sharing their anguish about the spate of events in faraway U.S. Many of these actors perpetually live in denial of the reality of their land. They are never seen or heard speaking about issues closer to home. For them and many of their followers, Black Lives Matter is just another hashtag that trends on social media. It is reduced to an empathy-generating spectacle. One wonders how the same brigade remains silent when caste atrocities and events of other injustice are committed on a daily basis in the country they call home. Their studied silence during the recent protests in India owing to the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens bears further testimony to such behaviour. Why is mainstream Bollywood selective in its espousal of causes? Or do stars only want to be vocal about events which may not directly impact the fate of their films upon release? To say the least, this is an escapist attitude. Of course, it’s true that a small coterie of progressive faces from the industry is seen at protests. Some also speak up every other day on social media. But by no means should this be deemed representative of the industry. These are individual voices who also endorse these values through their films. Their number is small, though necessary.  Focused on economic gains During a recent conversation, a Bollywood actor mentioned that there’s a lot of money at stake when a film is released. This could explain the silence of actors during moments of turmoil. But is that an excuse at all? What kind of a film culture have we created and endorsed that doesn’t think beyond economic gains? Having said that, another question to ponder is, why should we care about what Bollywood thinks when the answer is already known? After all, Bollywood has never been the conscience-keeper of the country save for a few isolated attempts. While a lot is being said about the aftermath of the pandemic, I cannot help wonder if it would also change the way film celebrities are treated in this country. Will we still care for empty rhetoric? Or will we, at least now, listen to those who lead by action through participation in long-term social change projects and who inculcate progressive values amongst their fan base?

15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,||Behind the curve||Meeting for the second time since the pandemic took hold in the country, the GST Council, last Friday, decided to relax late fees and interest payable for those taxpayers failing to file returns on time. For businesses with no tax liabilities under the indirect tax regime, the late fees were completely waived. This is in line with similar relaxations announced by the Centre in March, before the lockdown was declared, to ease compliance deadline worries of small businesses in particular. Since the full lockdown lasted longer than initially envisaged, and only began to unwind this month, the forbearance on offer was a necessary step. But given the extent of economic damage as well as the States’ fiscal positions in the period between these two meetings of the Council, its decisions are far from sufficient. In March, GST collections had slipped to Rs. 97,597 crore after surpassing the Rs. 1-lakh crore mark over the previous four months, and the numbers for April and May will not be known before July. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has told State representatives in the Council that just 45% of the indirect tax target had been met in the past two months. Although aware of the dwindling tax kitty during the lockdown, States have had their hands full managing the pandemic. It is for this reason that several States have been urging the Centre to extend emergency fiscal support and release past GST compensation dues enshrined in the pact that allowed the new tax regime to take off three years ago. In its stimulus package, in May, the Centre enhanced States’ power to borrow, but only part of that was completely unconditional, and a large chunk was contingent on States undertaking specified reforms. These reforms may be long-pursued ideals, but whether this is the right time for prioritising them has been questioned. GST compensation (for revenue shortfalls in the first five years of GST) due to States for December 2019 to February 2020 was only released on June 4. Perhaps, it was timed to pre-empt discontent in the Council’s meeting. Yet, Centre-State ties could turn more fractious, especially in the GST Council where things have usually evolved with consensus so far — thanks to the failure to finalise the way forward for paying States the compensation. One of the ideas on the table, officially discussed for around two months, is to raise loans against future GST cess accruals in order to recompense States. Any decision on this front, along with proposed GST rate rationalisations in the textiles, footwear and fertilizers sectors that were on the Council’s agenda, can now only be expected at a special meet in July. Procrastination is not an appropriate response at this arc of the curve — be it the pandemic or the economy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/behind-the-curve/article31829644.ece
15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,||No longer special||After months of brinkmanship, India and Nepal have brought their relations to the edge of a precipice. The Oli government’s decision to pass the constitutional amendment ratifying a change in its maps that include Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura, territories that India controls, marks a decidedly new phase in ties. While the issue is an old one, it resurfaced in 2019 when New Delhi published new political maps to reflect the changes following the decision on August 5 to reorganise the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and Nepal objected to the depiction of disputed territory. In 2000 and 2014, India and Nepal agreed to hold talks about Kalapani and Susta, without much success. Matters snowballed when India’s Defence Minister inaugurated a surfaced road over the territory; when Nepal protested, Indian Army Chief, General Naravane, suggested it was at the “behest” of China. At the base of the rift is the lack of diplomatic manoeuvring to allow a step back from the brink. While New Delhi contends that it was willing to discuss matters “at a mutually convenient date”, Kathmandu says the MEA has rejected two dates suggested by the Nepal MoFA, and has routinely dismissed requests from the Nepal Ambassador for a meet with the Foreign Secretary. That the MEA said Kalapani talks could wait until both countries had dealt with the coronavirus pandemic first, further enraged the Oli government, which has pointed out India’s participation by videoconference in bilateral and multilateral meetings. Meanwhile, Mr. Oli’s purposeful manner in pursuing the amendment at exactly the same time as the India-China border stand-off bolsters the belief among some in New Delhi that he is speaking with confidence borne from Beijing’s backing. Regardless of the truth of those accusations, or who is more responsible for the downslide in ties, the speed with which the constitutional amendment was passed has left little space for diplomacy now. That the vote was unanimous should also inform New Delhi of the futility of casting Mr. Oli alone as the ‘villain’ of the piece. It is necessary the two nations resolve their issues through dialogue lest they face more serious consequences. The Modi government has in the past not flinched from taking tough measures, including the 2015 blockade that severely affected India’s land-locked neighbour. The Oli government, which seeks to build its legacy by overturning what it calls “unequal” agreements made by the monarchy, could also cause a security nightmare for India if it opens up other parts of their long boundary, and reverses old commitments on open and unsecured border posts. Both sides moved quickly this week to manage the fallout of border firing by Nepali police on a group of Indians that left one dead. The same alacrity is needed to manage the fallout of Saturday’s amendment vote, on the once celebrated “special” relationship between the two countries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/no-longer-special/article31829643.ece
15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,||Flight from East Pakistan||The Home Secretary of West Bengal, Mr. B. R. Gupta, told newsmen the other day that 3,000 refugees were arriving every day from Pakistan and that since January a total of 70,000 persons had crossed over. The Chief Minister of Assam, Mr. Chaliha, has said that a total of 4,360 refugees entered his State during the first quarter of 1970 and that others had come through Tripura. While some of the migrants into Assam are Muslims, the vast majority of the refugees are Hindus. Mr. Chaliha thinks that the new flight of Hindu refugees from Pakistan had probably been set in motion by the election campaign in Pakistan. The Hindu minority in East Pakistan has obviously been alarmed by the rise of Islamic fervour in the election campaign. The most important political parties in East Bengal, the Awami League led by Sheikh Mujubir Rehman and the National Awami Party led by Maulana Bhashani, have taken a stand on regional autonomy and socialism. They include in their ranks a large number of Hindus. They have thus become a target for the Jamaat-i-Islami, which is accusing them of preaching secession and conspiring with elements in West Bengal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/flight-from-east-pakistan/article31829652.ece
15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,||Get rid of EMIs, go for investments||“Not having the burden of EMI is a big relief,” a banker who had retired from a foreign lender at a senior level had told me once. His comment surprised me a little. As a banker all his life, he was supportive of loans. In fact, he had even resisted my recommendation to pay back his home loan at an early date. However, he said, he had realised the stress it had caused on the family and after retirement, even he was not comfortable with it. This is not a stray experience for me. A CEO of an MNC was relieved when his loan was paid back. He was not happy in his job, it was turning out to be stressful and he was missing spending time with family and pursuing hobbies which he wanted to do all his life. Once the loan was paid back, he immediately switched over to a job which demanded less of his time. It, of course, paid less but gave him more time. According to him, “Now that the loan is behind me, I am feeling like a free bird.” In the current times, when we are facing turbulence in income, erosion in wealth and experiencing issues concerning health, those who do not have liabilities, will be more at ease. As a professional, I have been witness to the other extreme also. “If there is an EMI, it helps me control and stay focussed on the expenses. If there is no EMI burden, I tend to splurge.” This was told to me by a youngster. I find it weird. It is like saying, ‘I have cough and cold, I am fairly indisciplined about taking medicines, so, I have hired nursing staff at home to give me medicines.’ If we don’t do that, then why do we continue with a loan? As an individual, if there is a fixed monthly commitment to be honoured, what will be the preference? Paying the monthly instalment of a loan, i.e. EMI or investing every month in a mutual fund scheme i.e. SIP. In fact, even regularly setting aside an amount in a bank in the form of a recurring deposit will give more happiness and, of course, lead to long-term wealth creation. Taking on a loan is not bad; of course it should not be for splurging. But, continuing with the loan will dent long-term wealth creation. A taboo in the past About 2-3 decades ago, borrowing was taboo in this country. In 1997, I was promoting credit cards for a foreign bank. In those years, ‘loan’ was a bad word. Many youngsters would want to apply for a card but were reluctant. According to them, if elders in their family came to know about it, it would have been a big issue. As a society, we have come a long way from there. Loans or borrowing are no more bad words but still, a majority would prefer coming out of it. Currently, I don’t have the data but my gut feeling is when it comes to a home loan, irrespective of tenure for which individuals borrow, most of them get rid of the loan much before the end of the actual tenure. There are instances of individuals continuing with a loan for tax benefit, using the funds available for repayment of loan to invest. All these sound great. However, they are more like joy rides, something which gives a high for some time. The latent feeling is of following some kind of a brilliant strategy to build more wealth. Honestly, it is nothing but a kick, a feeling of a high. This is short lived. From a long-term wealth creation perspective, stick to the basics. Basics are always beautiful. Pay off the loan and invest the money saved from paying monthly loan instalments. To pay off the loan, a certain amount of capital will be used. But upon repayment of the loan, that entire asset will be a clean investment of ours. This will add to the net worth of our balance sheet. Having paid back the loan, use the amount saved every month to invest. This will also add to wealth creation. Over a period, both the fully paid asset and regular investments will add to our net worth. Net worth means the clean assets we have in our balance sheet after paying back all the loans. Therefore, always focus on ‘My EMI.’ ‘My EMI’ is not ‘My Equated Monthly Instalment’ but ‘My Equal Monthly Investment’ for building long-term wealth.

15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,||The numbers must stack up||How much insurance should I have? This is a billion-dollar question to almost all insurance prospects. In fact, nobody on earth can either mitigate or indemnify the loss and the hardship faced by the deceased’s dependants. But to arrive at an approximately equal and justifiable value of human life, there are certain thumb rules or empirical formulae. Human Life Value (HLV) Insurance companies generally go by this rule. Let’s not deeply delve into those actuarial calculations, which have far too many complex details. Suppose the breadwinner of a family is going on a tour for two to three days. He arranges a few thousands of rupees for his spouse and children to spend until he returns. If the same person has to go for a two- or three-month period on project work, he provides Rs. 40,000 or Rs. 50,000 depending on his earning capacity and the spending habits of the family. And, if the same person disappears suddenly, the amount he might have provided for his family for maintaining the present standard of living during their lifetime determines the HLV of that person. To arrive at that value, let’s not go deep into factors such as inflation rate adjustments, yield earned on investments, increase in incomes, decrease in expenses, and the like. Let’s restrict ourselves to some thumb rules to make it simple. To put it straight, ascertain your income minus loans, expenses, savings and the like. Calculate this up to your retirement. That amount will be the value of insurance you have to take. Let’s take an example: Mr. Raj, aged 35, has the following income and expenses per month: Income (net after tax) — Rs. 1 lakh; EMIs on loans — Rs. 50,000; family expenses — Rs. 30,000; savings — Rs. 10,000; emergency fund — Rs. 10,000. As such, if Mr. Raj can provide Rs. 30,000 per month to his family, they may survive. But he had taken loans worth Rs. 60 lakh, both for housing and vehicle put together. Some companies offer insurance against outstanding loan on diminishing balance method — the premium for such a policy will be added to the loan principal and the EMI will be fixed. This is also one of the options. To get a recurring income of Rs. 30,000 a month at present rates, one needs a corpus of Rs. 60 lakh at 6% return; or Rs. 72 lakh at 5% return or Rs. 90 lakh at 4% return. Add the Rs. 60 lakh loan to this. Both these put together, will be the amount of insurance Mr. Raj needs viz. Rs. 1.20 crore, Rs. 1.32 crore or Rs. 1.50 crore, respectively. Traditional policies for such a huge amount will cost heavily. Hence, it will always be better to opt for a term insurance cover or join a group insurance (if you are an employee and your employer provides the same). Here also, the most important thing to bear in mind will be to have a provision for coverage of your outstanding loans. Otherwise, the entire claim amount arising out of a policy may or may not be sufficient to clear the debts of the deceased. That defeats the basic purpose of insurance. Almost all insurance companies offer online sale of term policies. As per the table, Mr. Raj is eligible for Rs. 3.60 crore term insurance. But, given his commitments and necessities, he may opt for Rs. 1.20 crore; Rs. 1.35 crore or Rs. 1.50 crore term insurance, as the case may be. Before taking a policy, one has to ascertain the premium rates, riders offered and claim settlement ratios of the insurance company. Under- or over-insurance These are two major problems that prospects generally face while taking an insurance policy. Under-insurance means the insurance policy one takes is not sufficient to meet his obligations. In our example, if Mr. Raj takes insurance, say, for Rs. 50 lakh sum assured, how will it be sufficient to maintain his family and repay the outstanding loans in case of any contingency? This is under-insurance. Likewise, if one is over insured i.e. insurance not commensurate with one’s income and expenditure, the policy premium becomes a white elephant for him to continue and ultimately results in lapsation, which is a great loss to the policy holder. Opt for longer tenures It is always better to choose longer term policies. As the age advances, the premium rates will be very high and one has to undergo many tests to get the same coverage as one gets at a younger age. The most important thing to remember here is at a younger age, one will not have any medical history which is a favourable sign for companies to offer insurance at lower premiums and for longer terms. Advanced age is the time when there is a real necessity for insurance. Hence, it will always be better to choose a term up to the maximum age allowable under term insurance.

15 June 2020||June 15 2020 00:00 IST,||ASK US||Q.My wife and I have separate PANs and file income tax returns separately. My wife has no income per se but taking a PAN and filing ITR were done to facilitate domestic use as I was an NRI then. Now, I have returned to India and am paying taxes/ filing ITR of my own. Is it feasible to discontinue with my wife’s ITR in this context? Vijay Krishnan and Gita A.An individual is not required to file an ITR if he/she does not have any taxable income in a particular assessment year or if income does not exceed the maximum amount which is not chargeable to tax. However, it is advisable to verify the 26AS of that assessment year in order to ascertain if any amount is credited by way of TDS (for NRIs, TDS will be deducted by the bank even for SB interest unless the bank is informed of the change in the status of residency) and accordingly file the ITR even if the basic exemption limit is not exceeded in order to claim refund and also to avoid any notices from the department due to mismatch between TDS records and non-filing of ITR. Q.I'm a senior citizen aged 64. I own a flat that I had purchased in 1989. Now, I want to sell the flat and buy a new one. In view of my age, I wish to buy the flat in the name of my daughter. Can I save capital gains tax by investing the sale proceeds in purchasing the new flat in my daughter’s name? V. Ayyappan A.Under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act, an assessee can avail the benefit of capital gains on selling one residential property and using the proceeds to purchase another residential property in India. Thus, the new residential property must be registered in your name in order to avail the exemption. This view can be deduced from a plain reading of the legislature. However, contrary views have been adopted by certain appellate forums of the department and High Courts wherein exemptions were extended to the spouse of the assessee, considering the section to be beneficial in nature and must be viewed in a such manner. Although such a stand has not been established in a father and child relationship, you may consult your auditor in this matter to seek further guidance before the sale is done. Q.I satisfy the conditions for making payment of self-assessment tax and for the past three assessment years, I have been making payment in one lump sum before filing the return. I would like to know whether it can be paid in instalments (may be one or two payments in a month) before filing the return? I would also like to mention that I paid one instalment on April 5,2020 for AY 20-21. N. Venkatesan A.Yes, self-assessment tax can be paid in instalments; it is advisable to file the return after payment of all the self-assessment instalments. It is worthy to note that the payment of self-assessment tax can be made only after April 1 of the concerned assessment year; (ie for the Assessment Year 20-21, self-assessment tax can be paid only from April 1, 2020). Further, you also have the option of paying income tax in instalments for a particular assessment year based on an estimation of tax liability by way of advance tax. Though there are provisions in the Act requiring only certain assessees to pay advance tax in instalments, you may still pay advance tax in your name for a particular assessment year depending on your fund flows and availability. At the time of payment of advance tax, you have to be careful in choosing the correct assessment year.

15 June 2020||MADRID,||Barcelona back in action with a bang||Lionel Messi returned without a beard and with a goal and two assists as Barcelona resumed its LaLiga title challenge on Saturday with a thumping 4-0 victory over Real Mallorca. Barca exploded into the lead with just 64 seconds played when Arturo Vidal headed in before Martin Braithwaite struck first-ever goal for Barcelona, from a Messi-headed assist. Fan intrusion Jordi Alba latched onto a Messi pass to add a third but not before play was briefly stopped by a pitch invader, who was able to run on, despite the match being closed to fans. Messi then scored a fourth in injury time for his 25th goal of the season. Clean shaven, and without any sign of the thigh problem that prevented him from training earlier this month, Messi played 90 minutes and looked like he had never been away. “I’m happy because starting like this is an enormous boost for what’s to come,” said Barcelona coach Quique Setien. Diego Costa scored his first goal since October but Atletico Madrid missed the chance to move into the top four by drawing 1-1 away at Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.  In the Bundesliga, Bayern Munich moved to within just one win of an eighth straight Bundesliga title as a late Leon Goretzka goal sealed a 2-1 victory over Borussia Monchengladbach in Berlin. Teenage striker Joshua Zirkzee put Bayern ahead before Benjamin Pavard’s own goal levelled for Gladbach, but Goretzka netted his third goal in five league games with four minutes remaining. Victory at relegation-threatened Werder Bremen on Tuesday will confirm Bayern as German champion for the 30th time in Hansi Flick’s first season in charge.  The results: LaLiga: Athletic Bilbao 1 (Muniain 37) drew with Atletico Madrid 1 (Costa 39);   Saturday: Celta Vigo 0 lost to Villarreal 1 (Trigueros Munoz 90+1); Leganes 1 (Rodriguez 84-pen) lost to Valladolid 2 (Unal 2, Alcaraz 54); Real Mallorca 0 lost to Barcelona 4 (Vidal 2, Braithwaite 37, Alba 79, Messi 90+3).   Bundesliga: Mainz 0 lost to Augsburg 1 (Niederlechner 1);   Saturday: Bayern Munich 2 (Zirkzee 26, Goretzka 86) bt Borussia Monchengladbach 1 (Pavard 37-og) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/barcelona-back-in-style/article31829761.ece
15 June 2020||KOLKATA,||Pravin Jadhav targeting the Olympics with confidence||Archer Pravin Jadhav says the confidence he gained on winning the recurve men’s team silver at the World championships last year will help in his preparations for the Olympics. Jadhav, who claimed the Worlds medal with Atanu Das and Tarundeep Rai, believes composure is the key to success. “Most archers shoot well in windy conditions at home, but get disturbed by the normal wind while shooting abroad. It’s most important to hold your nerve. If you let pressure get to you, performance gets affected,” Jadhav told The Hindu . “My target is to replicate my practice scores in competitions,” he said. Jadhav, who was into 400m and 800m running before switching to archery seven years ago, said his athletics experience had benefited him in archery. “In a race, you cannot relax at any moment. That fighting spirit helps me in close competitions.” In training The 23-year-old Armyman, who last visited his home in Satara district of Maharashtra during the 2018 Diwali celebrations, is happy to be training at the Army Sports Institute in Pune during the lockdown. “I am lucky to be spending time with three established archers – Rai, Vishwash and Sukhchain Singh. We are maintaining social distance and training with shorter targets (about 10-15m), and it’s good to be in training. “I shoot around 300 arrows per day. I need to raise that to 500-600 to get back my rhythm. I can achieve that in about two weeks,” said Jadhav.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pravin-jadhav-targeting-the-olympics-with-confidence/article31829906.ece
15 June 2020||Chennai,||India needs a pro-league: Walsh||Former Indian women’s coach Francisco Garcia and renowned coach J.D. Walsh, who has conducted clinics across the country, headlined a coaches conclave, organised by the Integrated Basketball Players Association (IBPA) in association with the Indian BasketBall Fans. Garcia, who was at the helm of the women’s team from 2013-15, spoke about coaching techniques to improve the standard of the sport in the country. “Focus should not be on more number of drills but on concentrated drills,” said the Spaniard. “When correcting players, too much information should not be put in their head. Players should be told about their faults in a precise way so that they have concrete information to process. Drills should also be made more dynamic.” Walsh, who has run numerous camps across 25 Indian cities, urged coaches to work on sharpening the athletes’ skills like dribbling, passing and catching as it is a skill-based sport. The American said: “Basketball is a game of skill and more than drills, the focus should be on skill and endurance training. Consistency and a good skill development programme can prove beneficial in creating world-class talent in India.” Walsh added that the country needs a pro-league that basketballers can aspire to play in a club-type system. The session — moderated by former international Balakrishnan Jayaram and Jayashankar Menon, Asian All-Star player and IBPA secretary-general — was held in memory of the late Dr. Subramaniam who helped produce more than 50 internationals, including Satnam Singh, Amjyot Singh Gill, Yadwinder Singh and Jagdeep Singh.

15 June 2020||NEW DELHI,||When Balaji created a traffic jam||He is supremely fit, soft spoken and mild mannered. Davis Cupper, Sriram Balaji, who has won nine singles titles (Futures) and 48 doubles trophies (Futures and Challengers) was encouraged to recall many lively stories by coach M. Balachandran, in an Instagram conversation. Playing alongside Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan, also his current partner on the Tour, Balaji missed the doubles gold in the South Asian Games in Kathmandu last year, but had a golf story to tell. While playing a second round at a 9-hole facility, Balaji’s shot on the sixth swerved to the adjacent road which was leading to the airport. “There was a traffic jam, as the ball had smashed the windshield of a truck. Luckily, the club had insurance. I didn’t have to pay any money’’, said Balaji. Having been addicted to golf and travelling with Jeevan -- whose wife Neha Tripathi is a top level golfer — Balaji said that he was carrying a golf kit “everywhere.” Balaji, a Madras Engineering Group (MEG) employee for the last three years, was proud about winning the singles medal at the World Military Games. Having shown early promise at the PERKS Academy, close to his home in Coimbatore, Balaji was taken in by the Tamil Nadu Tennis Association. The support gave Balaji a chance to train at the Nick Bollettieri Academy in Florida, apart from centres in Spain and Germany. Tipsarevic’s tips Sessions with the former top-10 player from Serbia, Janko Tipsarevic, at the Waske Academy in Germany taught him a lot and he expressed gratitude for the fitness programme that he follows on the advice of the Serb’s trainer. “I trained with Tipsarevic, and Rainer Schuettler. They hit a heavy ball. The speed was normal. I was only 10% of their level, in terms of heaviness in the stroke. I became more hungry to work hard and develop my game,” said Balaji.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/when-balaji-created-a-traffic-jam/article31829825.ece
15 June 2020||KOCHI,||Sreedhar Shenoy passes away||A little more than a decade ago, R. Sreedhar Shenoy frequently turned up at newspaper offices with results of school hockey tournaments. The veteran coach often appeared weary but always had a ready smile and a glint in his eye. He was passionate about hockey at the grassroots level and went from school to school to introduce the sport to children. Shenoy, who has produced more than 5000 players including Olympian Dinesh Naik, passed away after a brief illness here on Sunday. He was 72. One-man show A NIS coach, Shenoy was virtually a one-man show for many years when it came to nurturing hockey at the schools level. He was coach, tournament organiser and also made sure the young players’ performances were known to the rest of the State. “He was not my coach but he was a great mentor. He is also one reason why I’m here...he taught my coaches Jayakumar and Ramesh Kolappa,” Indian goalkeeper P.R. Sreejesh told The Hindu from the Bengaluru national camp. “I’ve never seen him without a smile, he was a positive influence for me. He always used to guide me and when I was down, he used to say positive things. In the early seventies, we had a traditional way of playing but after he came, he changed the entire thing. That is why we call him the ‘Dronacharya of Kerala hockey’.”  “If at one time a lot of schools in Kerala had hockey, I’d say the man responsible would be Sreedhar Shenoy only. He was crazy about hockey, totally dedicated and even as a Kerala Sports Council coach he never used to bother about timings and he introduced hockey in many schools in Ernakulam,” said Joseph Paul, former secretary of Kerala Hockey Association. “If Ernakulam has this many hockey players, he is mainly responsible for that. I’d say he was married to hockey.” Shenoy’s family was loaded with decent cricket and hockey players. “But Sreedhar never cricket, he played hockey for the Ernakulam District and was the coach for the State senior and junior hockey teams,” said his cousin Vasant Shenoy, also a former KHA secretary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sreedhar-shenoy-passes-away/article31830038.ece
15 June 2020||HYDERABAD,||‘HFC a platform for young talent’||Football greats and former India captains — Shabbir Ali and Victor Amalraj — feel that with Hyderabad FC making its debut in the ISL, the players from the State have a target to chase and make it big in the sport. “For long, the players from Telangana, especially from Hyderabad, had suffered for want of exposure and lack of competition even at home,” Shabbir said during a webchat organised by HFC in which Amalraj, TFA secretary G.P. Palguna and TFA coaches committee convenor Syed Arif also took part. Big opportunity “Yes, in our days we had to look to Kolkata or Mumbai for better opportunities by playing for the big clubs there. Now, the young talent has HFC which could well provide it the platform to showcase their skills,” said Shabbir, who scored 35 goals for India.  Amalraj said with the Telangana government coming up with a new sports policy and the available infrastructure, the onus is on the young footballers and the TFA officials to take the sport forward. “Definitely, the way football is played now is so different and very professional. Not even the best of the young talent can take anything for granted. One needs to put in a lot of effort to make an impact at the highest level,” Amalraj said. “If you look at the quality of players in the ISL, it is obvious the State players have to step into a different zone and it is possible if everyone concerned, including the TFA, the government and the corporates support the sport in a big way,” he said. No job security Shabbir said that compared to his times, the modern-day players don’t have job security which is so important. “Any parent will be looking for job opportunities for his kids as they dream to make it big in sport. So, unless they get that assuring touch, they will not be able to make headway,” he said. Palguna suggested to the HFC to use the international standard football grounds at Sreenidhi FC near here for regular practice sessions to motivate the youngsters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hfc-a-platform-for-young-talent/article31829977.ece
15 June 2020||New Delhi,||Chhetri has glorified Indian football: Stimac||National team head coach Igor Stimac on Sunday hailed Sunil Chhetri, saying the talismanic captain was one of those who “glorified” Indian football with his dedication in the 15 years of his illustrious career. The 35-year-old Chhetri on Friday became only the second Indian after legendary Bhaichung Bhutia to complete 15 years in the Indian jersey. He made his debut in a friendly against Pakistan in Quetta in 2005, scoring in the 1-1 draw. According to Stimac, Chhetri is someone who always goes the extra mile, which encourages youngsters to emulate him. “I see him as someone who always pushes the bar in training and never compromises with the regime. He drives the team and he is the character who defines the team. Numerous characters have glorified the Indian football history and he’s definitely one of them who have made his country proud,” the Croatian tactician said. “Dedicated, workaholic and team man — those are some of the attributes which define Sunil Chhetri,” he said in a release issued by the All India Football Federation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chhetri-has-glorified-indian-football-stimac/article31829973.ece

According to the Bandra Police, the incident came to light at around 12.30 p.m. when his house help noticed that he had been in his bedroom for a long time. “Rajput had excused himself after breakfast and gone to his bedroom. Around 12.30 p.m., his servant found that he had locked himself inside. The door was broken down and Rajput was found lifeless, after which his friend called the Police Control Room,” an officer with the Bandra Police said. The body was taken to the Cooper Hospital in Vile Parle for post mortem examination, while his family members in Patna were informed. Officers said that his sisters reached the city late in the day to complete the requisite formalities, as his father’s health took a turn for the worse after he heard the news.  “We have not found any note and the motive behind his extreme step is still not clear. Investigations are underway with all possibilities in mind,” Mumbai Police spokesperson Deputy Commissioner of Police Pranaya Ashok said. He added that no evidence had come to light that Rajput had been undergoing treatment for depression.

15 June 2020||MUMBAI,||A shooting star with a sparkling legacy of films||Thirty four years of age, with barely a decade in the world of entertainment and 11 odd films behind him, Sushant Singh Rajput deserved much more of them all — life, movies, roles, plaudits and his due place in the sun — but could not enjoy them for the vicissitudes of stardom, and the ups and downs of life itself. He was a true blue shooting star who leaves behind a prematurely abbreviated but sparkling legacy of films. He debuted on television in Balaji Telefilms’ Kis Desh Mein Hai Mera Dil (Star Plus) and endeared himself to everyone as Manav Deshmukh in Pavitra Rishta (Zee TV), also a Balaji Telefilm production, in a role for which he went on to bag many an award. Manav’s character was underlined with a sincerity and maturity, and sincere is the quality for which industry insiders remember Rajput most. Top form He was in top form in his big screen debut in 2013 — Abhishek Kapoor’s Kai Po Che! , based on Chetan Bhagat’s book The 3 Mistakes of My Life . Rajput played Ishaan, a frustrated, angry and agitated local cricketer who tames his restlessness to help a poor child, Ali, become the best batsman of the country. You couldn’t take your eyes off him on screen and the finale left a lump in the throat, quite like the sudden vacuum his passing has created among his admirers today. Three years later, Rajput embraced cricket again, in one of the biggest hits of his career — Neeraj Pandey’s M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016). “Mahi maar raha hai (‘Mahi is hitting it’),” shouted a fan in the film. One saw a similar thrill and electric urgency, and also many a wet eye, cheering on for Rajput as Mahi on the big screen. Industrious Most remember him as an extremely hard-working actor who also took pride in his industriousness. There was an inherent energy and dynamism, youthfulness, spontaneity and likeability about him. It got channelised really well in films like Maneesh Sharma’s Shuddh Desi Romance (2013), about young people’s views on love, commitment, live-in relationships and marriage. But he tried not to bracket himself in the youthful romance zone. There were duds like Dinesh Vijan’s Raabta (2017), or the recent Drive (2019) on Netflix. However, despite this not being so evident to many, Rajput kept making very interesting choices, whether they hit the bull’s eye is another story. He opted to play a small role in Rajkumar Hirani’s PK (2014), became the lead in Dibakar Banerjee’s ambitious Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! (2015). In times of political polarisation, he opted to play a Muslim pitthu (porter) Mansoor, who transports pilgrims and their luggage to and from  Kedarnath in the 2018 film of the same name by Abhishek Kapoor. He never fitted in any mould, didn’t belong to any camps in Bollywood. Last year, he appeared as a baaghi (rebel, dacoit) in the 1970s Chambal, in what is arguably the best film of his career — Abhishek Chaubey’s Sonchiriya . This was followed by one of his biggest hits, Nitesh Tiwari’s Chhichhore . Ideally, 2020 should have been the time for him to peak. For now, Mukesh Chhabra’s remake of The Fault in Our Stars titled Dil Bechara is all we have left of him. In Sonchiriya , the title is a metaphor for a rare bird of redemption. “ Apni apni Sonchiriya, apni apni mukti ” goes a line in the film. It’s all about a journey towards finding your own bird of salvation. Like in the film, Rajput has also opted to go on his own journey to infinity. A journey that he embarked on way too soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/a-shooting-star-with-a-sparkling-legacy-of-films/article31829758.ece

15 June 2020||New Delhi,||Price of admission||On May 14, Tushar Jindal, 40, a kidney patient, tested positive for novel coronavirus and the family made calls to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. The private hospital allegedly asked for an advance deposit of Rs. 5 lakh for admission. As the amount was too high for the family, following advice from his nephrologist, they admitted him at Max Hospital in Saket, where an advance of Rs. 2.5 lakh had to be paid. “While I was admitted there, I barely received any treatment as my condition was stable. I was discharged within four days, but I was handed an exorbitant bill of Rs. 1.98 lakh,” claimed Mr. Jindal. He has sent a legal notice to the hospital contesting many of the items charged for and claiming that the bill issued to him was “faulty and fake and carries a lot of unnecessary and unreasonable charges”. Mr. Jindal’s notice states that medicines and drugs which were not administered to him have been charged for in the bill and a charge of Rs. 71,000 for “investigation” offered no other detail. Specifically, the notice states that being a kidney transplant patient, Mr. Jindal takes a particular brand of medicine prescribed by his nephrologist and he has been charged for a medicine he “can never take, as it belongs to another company”. He claims he consumed his nephrologist-prescribed brand but has been charged for an alternative at four units, six times a day. Mr. Jindal was also charged Rs. 8,900 per day for PPE kits amounting to Rs. 35,600, hospital bills show. He was also charged Rs. 52,000 for “other charges”, which the notice terms “irrelevant and fake”. Responding to queries, a Max Healthcare spokesperson said: “A patient’s attendants are counselled about the estimated cost of treatment at the time of admission itself, and they are required to sign an informed consent form for all treatment and procedures. Bill updates are also shared on a day-to-day basis on registered mobile numbers of attendants for any immediate concerns. The attendants of the patient were explained the overall consumption of PPEs during a 24-hour cycle, which is approximately nine PPEs per day per person in the COVID ICU, and the costs charged to the patient are in line with the costs incurred by the hospital in sourcing the PPEs.” D.S. Rana, chairman of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said the upfront payment is to tide over issues such as the family of a COVID-19 patient not being allowed to come to the hospital due to fear of infection. “How will they make payments? We ask for Rs. 5 lakh as advance from COVID-19 patients and refund the money if the bill is less than that,” he said. Dr. Rana said the hospital follows a similar process for non-COVID-19 treatment too. “There is nothing to hide. Our expenses have gone up since the virus outbreak. Our hospital is just meeting expenses, not making any profit. The government can audit our accounts if they want,” he said. Cases one too many Tushar Jindal’s is not a stray case as the pandemic grips the Capital with increasing ferocity. The Hindu interviewed six persons who said that they were either asked to pay an advance deposit ranging from Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 6.5 lakh or charged “exorbitant” rates for COVID-19 treatment by private hospitals in the city. Vineet Wadhwa’s harrowing experience in finding treatment for his 58-year-old uncle led him to file a PIL in the Delhi High Court calling for the capping of rates at private hospitals, among other interventions. Mr. Wadhwa said after his uncle was found positive on June 8, they tried admitting him at Akash Healthcare in Dwarka but were deterred by the charges. Patients were being charged around Rs. 40,000 per day or encouraged to take up a “10-day package”. These ranged from “economy” costing Rs. 3 lakh, “sharing” costing Rs. 3.5 lakh to a “deluxe” package of Rs. 4 lakh, he said. “In case of the package, even if a patient is discharged within three to four days, the full amount is charged,” claimed Mr. Wadhwa, adding that these details were communicated orally and the hospital refused to share any rate sheet. The hospital authorities did not respond to calls regarding the same. Ashutosh Kumar, 46, a yoga teacher from South Extension, said he fell ill during the last week of May and was later tested positive for COVID-19. “My brother first called up Max Saket and they asked for a Rs. 5 lakh deposit. Then he called Ganga Ram and was asked for Rs. 6.5 lakh as advance. We could not afford it. Then we found a hospital which took only Rs. 1.5 lakh as advance,” he said over phone from the hospital. Issuing a clarification to the media on Saturday, Max Healthcare senior director and CFO Yogesh Sareen denied accusations of profiteering: “Our COVID-only facility in Saket, which was fully occupied for the month of May 2020, incurred huge losses. This, when we had cut salaries of our senior clinicians and management by 20%-50%.” The family of a COVID-19 patient who went to a private hospital for treatment said they were asked to deposit Rs. 2 lakh on the day of admission. Government inaction Highlighting the issue, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a press conference on June 6, “A few days back, a person came to me and said that he was denied a bed by a private hospital, and after many requests they asked him Rs. 2 lakh for admission. I didn’t believe it... then on a live TV programme aired a few days ago, an anchor called up a hospital saying that he needs a bed for a corona-positive patient in his family. First he was denied the bed, and then on live TV told to pay Rs. 8 lakh for admission.” Mr. Kejriwal said that the government would not allow ‘black marketing’ of beds in private hospitals. But a week later, there are no details in the public domain of action taken against any hospital for such incidents by the government. According to experts, the non-regulation of charges for different procedures at private hospitals and people opting for these hospitals even when beds are available in government hospitals is adding to the problem. The Delhi government is yet to announce any capping of rates in private hospitals. At two separate media briefings in the past week, Health Minister Satyendar Jain said that the government had asked for rates from private hospitals and is “looking into it”. According to the Clinical Establishments (Central Government) Rules, 2012, charges at private hospitals should be within a “range of rates” fixed by the government. “The clinical establishments shall charge the rates for each type of procedures and services within the range of rates determined and issued by the Central Government from time to time, in consultation with the State Governments,” reads one of the conditions for registration and continuation of such establishments. But the rules are not applicable to Delhi, as the 2010 Act based on which the rules were formed has not been adopted by the Delhi government. Fixing not practical? “According to rules in Delhi, the rates are not fixed but hospitals have to display them so that people can choose according to their ability. The clinical establishments Act and the rules are not practical. Has the Central government or the States which have adopted it been able to fix rates?” said a Delhi government official. States including Bihar, Assam, Uttar Pradesh and all Union Territories except Delhi have adopted the Act, according to the Central government. In May 2018, the Delhi government came out with a draft policy to regulate private hospitals and to cap profits. Health Minister Satyendar Jain had said that it was to control “exploitative profit” made by private hospitals and nursing homes through “overcharging patients for medicines, investigations and other medical procedures”. The draft policy recommended a number of measures, including a 50% profit cap over procurement of medicines and other consumables. But the policy is yet to become a law. When contacted, the Delhi government spokesperson did not offer a comment. “They are not supposed to take such huge amounts as advance. And private sector hospitals charging high rates is happening not just in Delhi but also in Chennai and Mumbai,” said Sakthivel Selvaraj, who works as a director at Public Health Foundation of India, Delhi. “None of the States, including Delhi, apart from one or two have implemented the clinical establishments Act,” he said. “Without regulation or display of charges, it becomes a fish market.” Dr. Selvaraj said the Delhi government should follow Mumbai’s example and take over private hospital beds and also cap rates for different services such as ICU, ventilator and rooms. But Narendra Saini, former secretary general of the Indian Medical Association, said capping of prices is not as easy as it sounds. “You cannot have the same charge for the same service in a hospital such as AIIMS, a big private hospital and a 50-bed private hospital. The cost inputs, including the payment to specialists, cost of land, machinery are different. The government should set up an independent committee or agency to study the cost in primary, secondary and tertiary government healthcare institutions; then factor in land, machinery, and capital costs; and then come out with three sets of rates for three types of private hospitals for the same services or procedures,” he said. Improving public hospitals “But the question is, why do people do not want to go to government hospitals? Beds are free in government hospitals and people are still rushing to private hospitals. The government should make its hospitals better,” said Mr. Saini. Delhi Medical Association president Girish Tyagi also highlighted the issue. “Government hospitals should improve infrastructure, housekeeping, manpower, and staff should be empathetic towards patients. It is because of these deficiencies that people are going to the private sector,” he said. “In most of the OECD countries — apart from the U.S. and a few others — rates of different procedures and services offered by private hospitals are fixed by the government. Health care is not like any other commodity,” said Dr. Selvaraj. Dr. Tyagi said the Delhi government should audit charges in both government and private hospitals and cap the prices for COVID-19 treatment. “People should not be harassed. But private hospitals should also be taken into consideration as their expenses have also increased due to the virus outbreak,” he said. Meeting on prices Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will hold a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority tomorrow to discuss fixing a price ceiling for treatment of COVID-19 at private hospitals. The meeting will also discuss charges levied by private ambulance services; and reducing the price charged for COVID-19 testing by private, drive-thru labs. For Delhiites, it has come not a day too soon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/price-of-admission/article31829910.ece
15 June 2020||New Delhi,||Two security guards beaten to death with sticks in Narela||Two security guards deployed at a private company died after being allegedly beaten up with sticks by a group of men in outer Delhi’s Narela, the police said on Sunday. The victims succumbed to injuries later during treatment, they added. The deceased have been identified as Amit (22) and Sunil (24), both residents of Gautam Colony in Narela, they said. The police said that the incident took place on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday.

The two did not suffer any apparent injury on the head and other vital parts of the body but did sustain fractures in the limbs which indicated that the assailants intended to severely beat them and not murder them outright, the officer said. Preliminary investigation has also hinted at involvement of acquaintances, including those who were deployed at the site, the police said. They added that there had been incidents of fights in the past among other guards on petty issues. The police, however, has not ruled out involvement of outsiders in the incident. A case has been registered and an investigation is under way. A hunt for the accused is on.   The victims were on night duty when they were beaten up.

15 June 2020||New Delhi,||HC questions stalling of Rajasthan cadre IAS appointments||The Delhi High Court has called into question the stalling of the appointment process for Indian Administrative Service (IAS) of Rajasthan Cadre for the year 2018 due to the non-appointment of two members on the Interview Committee, even as the appointment process for 2019 has begun. “It seems quite incongruous that the process for 2018 appointments, having not been concluded, the appointment process for the succeeding year has commenced,” Justice Prathiba M. Singh remarked. The High Court asked the Centre’s counsel to give reason for the non-appointment of the two members on the Interview Committee by the Central government. It also asked about the status of the 2018 appointments before the next hearing on July 16. In the meantime, Justice Singh said the process for appointment for the year 2019 may continue. However, before taking any final decision, the UPSC would have to inform the High Court first. The court order came on petition filed by 20 candidates who were selected for the interview process for appointment to the IAS of Rajasthan Cadre for the year 2018 in the Non-State Civil Services Officers category. The scrutiny committee had identified four vacancies and had finalised the list of five times the vacancies i.e. 20 candidates whose interviews were to be conducted. The select list was forwarded by the Rajasthan government to UPSC in November, 2019 and the interviews were scheduled for December 31, 2019. However, at the last minute, the interviews were cancelled due to non-appointment of the two Central government nominees to the Interview Committee. The petitioners submitted that since the interviews were cancelled, no further progress has even been intimated to them. They approached the High Court after the appointment process for the 2019 vacancies for the same category commenced in May 2020. UPSC told the court that it could not have conducted the interviews without the two nominees being appointed by the Centre. It also questioned the maintainability of the plea as the jurisdiction of the case would fall at the Central Administrative Tribunal. Rajasthan government also challenged the territorial jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court in the case as the entire cause of action has arisen in Rajasthan. The Centre’s counsel said that its submissions on maintainability and jurisdiction are the same as those of UPSC and Rajasthan govt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hc-questions-stalling-of-rajasthan-cadre-ias-appointments/article31829908.ece
15 June 2020||New Delhi,||Man planning to kill former partner arrested||A 32-year-old man who was planning to go to Punjab to allegedly kill his former partner was arrested in outer Delhi’s Samaipur Badli, the police said on Sunday. A countrymade pistol and a live cartridge were seized. The accused, Lalit Kumar, is a resident of Haryana’s Panipat. He was planning to kill his former girlfriend for having dumped him, the police said. “During interrogation, the accused said he was in a relationship for the past two years with a married woman, who is a resident of Moga [Punjab]. He used to meet all her expenses but her demands had no limit,” said Gaurav Sharma, DCP (Outer-North). Kumar started duping people to arrange money. In the meantime, the woman dumped him. He was later arrested by U.P. Police in connection with cheating cases. He was in Dasna Jail from September last to January 2020, where he met one Aman, he said. After his release, he contacted Aman who gave him the pistol and cartridge. However, before he could execute the plan, he was held.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/man-planning-to-kill-former-partner-arrested/article31829913.ece

15 June 2020||New Delhi,||Open book exam: DUTA writes to principals||The DU Teachers Association (DUTA) on Sunday wrote to principals of all colleges of the university, calling upon them to “intervene” in the conduct of open book examinations (OBE) in the interest of students and their institutions. Following reports that colleges will be conducting mock OBEs, the union argued that such an exercise would not address any of the problems outlined by students and teachers, as it would not simulate the real conditions and circumstances students will face during the examinations. Apart from this, it argued that it would put “additional stress” without any benefit. For one, the mock exam would engage the college portal which would be different from the issues that may be faced via the university portal. Additionally, students who are already in difficult situations, would endure the stress and cost of appearing for an exam more than once. The union also reiterated its objections to the action taken by DU and appealed to principals to “play a positive role”. It highlighted that the decision to grant degrees on the basis of the students’ past records has been accepted at various institutions in India and abroad and was “perhaps the best possible decision, given the conditions.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/open-book-exam-duta-writes-to-principals/article31829915.ece
