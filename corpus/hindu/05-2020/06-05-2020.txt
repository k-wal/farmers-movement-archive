06 May 2020||VIJAYAWADA,||Liquor prices hiked by another 50%||In tune with its policy of imposing prohibition in a phased manner, and in the wake of heavy rush at liquor outlets, throwing caution to the winds in the times of COVID-19, the Andhra Pradesh government on Tuesday increased the prices of liquor by an additional 50% with immediate effect. This, in addition to the 25% increase in the rates announced on Sunday, a day before reopening the outlets, takes the overall hike to 75%. “The move is aimed at discouraging consumption of alcohol. The number of liquor shops will also be slashed by this month-end,” an official statement said. Hours after the shops reopened on Monday, thousands of people turned up, standing in long queues without following the social distancing guidelines. Controlling the people had become a Herculean task amidst the threat posed by COVID-19. Delhi model Taking a cue from the Delhi administration, the State government too increased the prices of liquor. The statement said the enhanced rates would come into force with immediate effect and that they were aimed at discouraging people from consuming alcohol.

06 May 2020||NEW DELHI,||AI to charge commercial fares from stranded Indians||Indian citizens, returning from the Gulf and Southeast Asian countries in the first batch of evacuation flights, beginning May 7, will be charged commercial fares of upto Rs. 1,00,000 per ticket. According to Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri, flights from Chicago, San Francisco, Newark and Washington will cost nearly Rs. 1,00,000. A flight from London to Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and New Delhi will cost Rs. 50,000 per passenger, tickets from Dubai will cost Rs. 13,000 and from Abu Dhabi Rs. 15,000. Flights from Singapore and Malaysia will cost Rs. 20,000. The entire operation will be managed by Air India. Passengers will also have to pay for quarantine facilities on their return, but a final decision will be taken by the State governments, he told journalists. To a question why passengers were being charged airfares on par with commercial rates, Mr. Puri said, “It is equivalent to a commercial service. The exchequer doesn't have the space to bear the cost of repatriation. The service is being carried out by air carriers, which will have to go empty one way. Air India is already receiving government subsidy; we can't subsidise this travel on the taxpayer's money. Equally, if you look at the financial situation of other airlines, they are living a hand-to-mouth situation and are in a precarious situation. Every month, I have to seek an injection of Rs. 500 crore-Rs. 600 crore.” 64 flights As many as 80% of the flights planned will be sent to the Gulf countries and Southeast Asia. A large chunk of these flights will be destined for Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Air India will operate 64 flights between May 7 and 13, Mr. Puri said during the video conference with journalists. He added that the government would consider roping in private carriers in subsequent phases. These flights will bring back 14,800 Indians. Fifteen flights will return 3,150 persons to Kerala, 11 flights will bring back 2,150 to Tamil Nadu, 1,750 will return to Telangana in seven flights, 650 will return to Karnataka in three flights, and 3,100 passengers are estimated to return to Delhi in 11 flights. Some of the flights from India may also ferry foreign nationals, including those who hold visas in a foreign country at least for a year, U.S. green card and OCI card holders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ai-to-charge-commercial-fares-from-stranded-indians/article31514033.ece
06 May 2020||HYDERABAD,||Lockdown extended till May 29||The lockdown in Telangana has been extended till May 29 with a few riders. The lockdown in State was to end on Thursday. At a post-Cabinet press meet late on Tuesday night, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said the decision to extend lockdown was taken irrespective of the Central government date for the same till May 17 for more effective implementation of restrictions to tackle COVID-19. He assured to implement the Centre’s guidelines on lockdown in the State but refused to accept its suggestion that shops be opened in six red zones in Telangana, including Hyderabad. Only house construction activity will be allowed in red zones and the consequent trade to sell cement, steel, hardware and electrical goods. Liquor shops will be permitted in the entire State as it shared borders with four other States where they are open. Mr. Rao based the government’s decision on prolonged lockdown till May 29 on the feedback from doctors and informed people as also unanimity at the Cabinet meeting. However, the government will review the situation on May 15 going by the experience in opening up of markets in New Delhi, Chennai and Bengaluru. In 27 districts covered by orange and green zones, Mr. Rao said all shops will be permitted on conditions. The shops will be allowed 100% in rural areas but only 50% shops can function alternately day-after-day in municipal areas. The selection of shops will be done by lottery.

06 May 2020||NEW DELHI,||70% markup fails to dampen Delhiites’ spirits||Despite a ‘special corona fee’ — 70% of the maximum retail price of liquor bottles — being imposed in the Capital, scores of buyers gathered outside liquor vends on Tuesday. Serpentine queues could be seen outside the shops even before they opened shutters at 9 a.m. While some were forced to shut down within a few hours as people were not following social distancing, others remained open for business through the day with policemen keeping vigil. The customers said they were ready to pay the hiked price as it would help the government earn revenue, but they were dismayed at the lack of organisation outside the vends leading to chaos and crowding. “What we need is a token system like some banks have introduced. Customers can collect a token and wait for their number to be announced. But who will introduce this system,” asked Nishant Pai, a buyer. On the ‘special corona tax’ being imposed, Kaushal, a customer, said, “The government will have to increase taxes on non-essential commodities. Looking at the number of people willing to buy liquor, it may not be a bad idea.” However, Sanjay, another customer, said that those who are addicted to alcohol would buy it at whatever cost. “There are many daily wage earners here who cannot afford to buy liquor but are still waiting. We will have to see what social challenges opening liquor shops throws up.” The Delhi government on Tuesday requested assistance from the Delhi police to enforce social distancing at liquor vends. Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) Jasmeet Singh said, “Wherever people stood in queues, followed social distancing norms and adhered to the directions given by police officers, vends were allowed to open. For instance, a wine shop was allowed to open in Kalyanpuri in the morning because people followed social distancing, but was shut in the afternoon when the crowd increased.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/70-markup-fails-to-dampen-delhiites-spirits/article31514223.ece
06 May 2020||Bengaluru,||State not to operate any more trains for migrants||The State government has decided that no more trains will be run to ferry migrant labourers from Karnataka to various destinations across the country from Wednesday. The government has written to the Indian Railways to cancel all trains scheduled from Wednesday. N. Manjunath Prasad, nodal officer for inter-State travel from Karnataka, said that while most of those who had already booked tickets had left, the authorities would “convince others to stay back” as economic activity would begin. A senior government functionary said the decision was taken following a meeting Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa held with leading builders and developers in the city. “We want the migrant labourers to stay back. They are the backbone of our economy without whom we cannot kick-start the economy. We will take good care of them,” said the source. Interests of workers Vinay Sreenivasa of Naavu Bharateeyaru, a social welfare coalition working with the labourers, said the government ought to consider best interests of the workers and not view them only from the perspective of their employers.

06 May 2020||New Delhi,||TRF a Pak. ploy to avoid scrutiny, says J&K’s DGP||Security forces say there is nothing alarming about The Resistance Front (TRF) as all attacks carried out by the Pakistan-backed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) are being pinned on the newly formed “seasonal” group in the Kashmir Valley in order to escape international scrutiny. J&K Director General of Police Dilbag Singh told The Hindu that TRF, a front of the LeT, was promoted by Pakistan and created in August following the withdrawal of Article 370. The TRF had claimed responsibility for the April 5 incident along the Line of Control in the Kupwara sector, where five Army personnel were killed. The Army had chased a group of militants for five days after they infiltrated from across the border and killed five of them, of which two were Pakistanis. “The initial social media chatter and activity around TRF was being pushed by Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) in Karachi,” said Mr. Singh. “This is a bid to give the group an indigenous shade; they are all backed by Lashkar-e-Taiba… Pakistan has been smuggling weapons from across the border to arm them,” he asserted. A group of 7-8 trained foreign militants, who recently infiltrated from across the border, were said to be behind a spike in attacks in north Kashmir, an area that had largely remained incident free in the past decade, an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/trf-a-pak-ploy-to-avoid-scrutiny-says-jks-dgp/article31514031.ece

From putting money in people’s hands to reviving demand and from issuing temporary ration cards for providing foodgrains to cancelling debt, Prof. Banerjee offered a range of suggestions to absorb the shock of a prolonged lockdown, especially with regard to migrant workers and micro small medium enterprises (MSME). “A lot of us have been saying that we need a stimulus package. That’s what the U.S. is doing, Japan is doing, Europe is doing. We really haven’t decided on a large enough stimulus package. We are still talking about 1% of GDP. The U.S. has gone for 10% of GDP,” Prof. Banerjee said. “Giving money in the hands of everybody, so that they can buy in stores or they buy consumer goods ... I think spending is the easiest way to revive the economy. Because then the MSME people get money, they spend it and then it has the usual Keynesian chain reaction,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-needs-a-big-stimulus-package-abhijit-banerjee/article31514038.ece

CID has reportedly found key evidence suggesting criminal conspiracy behind the letter purportedly sent by former State Election Commissioner (SEC) N. Ramesh Kumar to the Home Secretary on March 18 over postponement of local body elections. According to sources, the forensic lab report suggests that there was no evidence that a letter was typed in a laptop at the instance of the former SEC or it was scanned in the desktop at his office. “There was no evidence of the alleged WhatsApp communication between N. Ramesh Kumar and his Assistant Secretary K. Samba Murthy,” a senior official said on condition of anonymity.

06 May 2020||Kolkata,||Seven more deaths, 85 new infections in Bengal||Seven more deaths and 85 new cases of COVID-19 infection were reported in West Bengal on Tuesday, taking the count to 1,344. While 980 are active cases, the number of deaths has increased to 140. The State government maintains that “68 deaths are due to COVID-19 infection and 72 due to co-morbidities where the infection was the incidental finding”. Though the audit committee set up by the State government is no longer looking into every death due the virus infection, it has not included 72 deaths in its official tally. In the past 24 hours, 2,455 samples were tested taking the number of samples tested to 27,571. So far, 264 persons have been discharged from health facilities. Responding to questions on the high mortality rate, Home Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay said, “The more positive cases you test, the lesser will be the mortality rate”. Till a month ago the State had only one testing centre and it now has 15, he said. In the first few days of the outbreak, the State was testing only “acute cases” and hence the mortality was high, Mr. Bandyopadhyay. On Monday, the Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) had highlighted that the mortality rate in West Bengal, at 12.8%, was the highest in the country. ‘Massive survey’ Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee took to social media to say a massive door-to-door surveillance had been going on for the past one month to identify Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) and Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases across West Bengal. “This herculean effort has been undertaken by 60,000 specially-trained ASHA and health workers non-stop for the past four weeks. It gives us early warning signals and is an important proactive step in fighting COVID-19,” Ms. Banerjee said. In the 5.57 crore household visits conducted from April to May 3, she said, “872 cases with SARI and 91,515 cases of ILI have been identified and given health advice”. As many as 375 people have also been admitted to health facilities, of whom 62 have tested positive for COVID-19, the Chief Minister added. Train from Ajmer Meanwhile, the first train carrying over 1,000 persons reached the Dankuni railway station from Ajmer. After being screened, the passengers were given guidelines to isolate themselves. Another train from Kerala has also left for West Bengal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/seven-more-deaths-85-new-infections-in-bengal/article31513976.ece
06 May 2020||NEW DELHI,||70,000 migrants return on 67 trains||The Railways on Tuesday said it had run 67 ‘Shramik Special’ trains since May 1, transporting about 70,000 stranded migrants. “Till now 67 ‘Shramik Specials’ have been run by various zonal railways. Till May 4 [Monday], we had run 55 trains,” a Railways spokesperson said. He said 21 more such trains were expected to be run from places such as Bengaluru, Surat, Sabarmati, Jalandhar, Kota and Ernakulam. Union Home Ministry spokesperson Punya Salila Srivastava said these special trains had so far ferried about 70,000 migrants. “On an average, these trains are carrying 1,000 passengers each,” the Railways said. Each coach is carrying only 50 due to social distancing norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/70000-migrants-return-on-67-trains/article31513995.ece
06 May 2020||New Delhi,||Delhi teen detained in Instagram chat case||A 15-year-old boy has been apprehended after he was allegedly found to be a member of an Instagram chat group called ‘Bois Locker Room’ where the members used obscene language for minor girls, shared their pictures and talked about rape. A Delhi police spokesperson said, “As of now, about 10 members of the group have been identified. The identified members who are major are being examined. The minor members are being dealt with as per the provisions of Juvenile Justice Act.” The police said the devices used to engage in the offensive, vulgar communication had been seized. They have asked Instagram to provide the details of the accounts involved in the group. Several girls were spoken about in the screenshots that went viral, and one of them who was among the first women who revealed the chats, said her security was threatened. On her Instagram profile, she wrote, “My security is being threatened so I’m going off.” Later, she wrote, “I hope that people learn from this incident (both boys and girls) and try to make a difference in this society.” She also wrote, “Since the very beginning, I’ve been saying no matter who it is, a girl or a boy, they’re both equally wrong. That group chat called ‘Boys Locker Room’ had girls in it too. They even supported and defended those guys despite everything they said and did… Don’t make this a gender thing.” The police on Monday registered a case under Sections 465 (forgery), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), 469 (forgery for purpose of harming reputation), and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the IPC and Sections 67 (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) and 67A (publishing or transmitting of material containing sexually explicit act in electronic form) of the IT Act. They said that the group members belonged to four or five south Delhi schools.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-teen-detained-in-instagram-chat-case/article31514004.ece
06 May 2020||New Delhi,||Convene House panels: Cong.||The government is trying to hide behind rules to escape parliamentary oversight, national spokesperson for the Congress and Lok Sabha member Manish Tewari said on Tuesday. “In this pandemic, why can’t parliamentary committees meet virtually,” asked Mr. Tewari, speaking to The Hindu . “There seems to be an attempt to hide behind the rules to escape parliamentary oversight,” he contended. The Congress MP, who is a member of the parliamentary panel on Finance, wrote a letter to the panel chairperson, Jayant Sinha, on April 18 urging him to arrange for a meeting. “Isn’t the central government running on videoconferencing? Isn’t the world running on videoconferencing, isn’t G20 happening on videoconferencing? Then how are the parliamentary committees an exception,” Mr. Tewari wondered. Confidentiality issues The functioning of the Parliamentary Standing Committees has been suspended due to the lockdown and both the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha secretariats have refused to permit meetings of the panels via videoconferencing. The secretariats have contended that holding such meetings, where the government shares critical information, virtually could violate the confidentiality clause. Chairman of the IT committee Shashi Tharoor and Chairman of the committee on Home Affairs Anand Sharma had both written to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu seeking permission to hold the meetings. Mr. Tharoor announced on Twitter on April 20 that Mr. Birla had permitted holding the meeting by videoconference. Four days later, he tweeted that the Lok Sabha secretariat was yet to approve the “amended rules”. Pandemic the prority Addressing a meeting on Monday, Mr. Naidu had observed that there was a need for undivided focus from the Executive on containing the pandemic, adding that a view on holding meetings of the department-related standing committees would be taken later. Mr. Tewari contended that to say that somebody was too busy to attend Parliament was not acceptable and was misleading as regards the role of the legislative institution. “When Britain was fighting the Second World War, Parliament sat regularly for five years. That was a country at war, the Executive was busy discharging its responsibilities and yet it found time for Parliament. Even during the First World War, the House of Commons kept meeting,” he added. Observing that the committee meetings were not only a one-way affair with MPs asking questions, Mr. Tewari said the government was also “enriched” by the inputs that came directly from the ground.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/convene-house-panels-cong/article31513962.ece
06 May 2020||Bhopal,||11 more deaths reported in M.P.||Eleven persons died of COVID-19 in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday while undergoing treatment at hospitals, taking the State-wide death toll to 176, the Directorate of Health Services said. Five persons died in Ujjain, two each died in Indore and Jabalpur and one each died in Bhopal and Satna, according to the bulletin issued by the Directorate. The case fatality rate in Ujjain, which has reported 184 cases and 40 deaths so far, touched 21.7%. The recovery rate in the city stands at 14%. Meanwhile, 107 new cases were registered in the State on the day. The overall count surged to 3,049. Indore, the worst hit city, has registered 1,654 cases and 79 deaths so far. As many as 468 persons have recovered from the illness in the city. Higher recovery rate Across the State, 144 patients recovered from the illness on the day. The State’s recovery rate stands at 32.8%, higher than the national average. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan ordered the treatment of COVID-19 patients at the trauma centre in Ujjain. Further, he directed a medical specialist from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal, to reach Ujjain to monitor treatment of patients there. He pointed out that at present around 3,000 samples were being tested for the illness in the State every day. In the coming week, the capacity would be ramped up to 3,500 samples a day. ‘Rs. 1 crore to Railways’ Additional Chief Secretary, Commercial Tax, I.C.P. Keshari said to facilitate the return of workers stuck in other States, the government had paid Rs. 1 crore to the Railways. Mr. Chouhan reiterated that in no condition should travel fare be collected from workers. In the first phase, around 75,000 workers had returned to the State. In the second phase, around 70,000 more workers will be brought back this week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/11-more-deaths-reported-in-mp/article31513978.ece
06 May 2020||New Delhi,||Centre sets rules for bringing back Indians||The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Tuesday issued guidelines to enable persons, including foreigners who have been stranded in India due to the ongoing lockdown, to return from abroad or fly overseas from the country. Those coming from abroad would have to submit the result of the RT-PCR test to the Indian missions where they have registered and also give an undertaking that they would be willing to undergo institutional quarantine for a minimum period of 14 days, at their own cost, on arrival. Setting out the Standard Operating Protocol, the MHA said those who want to return would have to register with the Indian missions and give an undertaking that they were making the journey at their own risk. “Based on the registrations received, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) will prepare flight/ship wise database of all such travelers, including name, age, gender, mobile phone number, place of residence, final destination and information on RT-PCR test taken and its result,” the MHA said. “This database will be shared by the MEA with the respective State in advance,” it added. Thermal screening of passengers would be done on arrival and “all passengers shall be asked to download Aarogya Setu app on their mobile devices”. The same protocol would be followed for passengers crossing over from land borders. Symptomatic passengers would be immediately taken to a medical facility and the remaining persons to institutional quarantine to be arranged by the State government. “If they test negative after 14 days, they will be allowed to go home and undertake self monitoring of their health for 14 more days as per protocol,” said the MHA. Only those crew and staff who had tested negative for COVID-19 would be allowed to operate the non-scheduled commercial flights and naval ships to bring back those stranded. Passengers to pay fare The cost of travel would have to be borne by the travellers and the MEA would post the details of the flight schedule on the concerned platform at least two days in advance, the MHA said. The Ministry also issued the SOP for “movement of persons stranded in India who are desirous to travel abroad.” These passengers would be accommodated on the flights being arranged by the Ministry of Civil Aviation to bring back Indians stranded abroad, from May 7 onward. Air India would operate 64 flights between May 7-13, mainly to the Gulf and Southeast Asian countries. The MHA said that only those persons would be allowed to travel to the destination countries who were “citizens of that country, green card or OCI card holder” or in the case of a medical emergency or a death in the family, Indians holding six-month visas could also be allowed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-sets-rules-for-bringing-back-indians/article31513993.ece
06 May 2020||Mumbai,||‘Copycat’ groups come to the fore||Even as the Delhi police cracked down on the ‘Bois Locker Room’, an Instagram page where teenage boys were allegedly discussing gangrape of minor girls, cyber experts have observed scores of ‘copycat’ groups with similar names or themes that were formed within hours of the matter becoming public knowledge. Cyber experts said the copycat groups were trying to capitalise on the dubious fame and gain followers. Mumbai-based expert Shubam Singh told The Hindu that from Monday night to Tuesday morning, he had confirmed the details of eight members of the Instagram group and shared them with the Delhi police. “Even as I was working on this, I saw several such pages, some of them newly formed, on Instagram. The pages were created with the obvious intent to cash in on the attention and gain followers. As news of the incident spread, those who did not know about it started searching online and in the process came across these pages and started following them,” Mr. Singh said. Rumour-mongering He added that another fallout of the matter was the rumour-mongering that started either to take focus away from the core issue or to malign others in a similar way with fabricated evidence. Supposed screenshots of chats from a Delhi-based group where members ostensibly admitted to having taken advantage of a girl started doing the rounds on Twitter on Monday evening, but could not be verified. “There were also reports of one of the members of the Bois Locker Room committing suicide on Monday night, which I later confirmed to be false,” Mr. Singh said, who has received calls from several people to discuss cyber crime. Ritesh Bhatia, another expert, has also been besieged with calls from people seeking to report similar pages. “The major problem is that there are no clear laws for many of the instances that are coming to light. For example, there are so many instances of body shaming but no laws that deal with cyber bullying. If people have no fear of the law, such incidents will continue,” Mr. Bhatia said. He referred to a similar case that had come to light in a Mumbai-based school last year, where there was ultimately no police case, nor were there any steps taken by other schools to spread awareness. He added that responsibility also lay with parents, who need to make children aware that such behaviour can attract serious consequences. “Today, instances of people breaking traffic laws are decreasing not because they have suddenly developed respect for the law but because there are speed cameras, e-challans and increased fines. It works the same way with cyber crime,” Mr. Bhatia said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/copycat-groups-come-to-the-fore/article31513998.ece
06 May 2020||Bhopal,||M.P. caught between pandemic and penury||The stringent lockdown imposed to curb the COVID-19 outbreak has had a crippling impact on the economy of Madhya Pradesh, where tax collection — SGST and IGST put together — dropped by close to 85% in April. “We collected around Rs. 250 crore, which is about 15% of the amount collected for the month last year. It is much lower than the target,” said Additional Chief Secretary, State Finance Department Anurag Jain. Mining activity remains suspended across the State. Liquor shops will remain shuttered in the three red zone districts of Bhopal, Indore and Ujjain, but be partially open in the remaining six, during the continuing lockdown. There will be no curbs on liquor sales in the other 43 districts. Falling fuel VAT “In mining and excise, there is [now] hardly any revenue. The VAT on petrol and diesel has also come down to 60-65%,” said Mr. Jain. As regards GST arrears, the Centre has settled only part of the pendency for December and January. The compensation loss for February and March of about Rs. 2,100 crore, and the remaining dues are still outstanding. Staring at an imminent financial crunch, the State advanced its borrowings for April and May. The government borrowed Rs. 1,000 crore each on April 3 and April 10, while preparing to meet demands at least until April 14, when the lockdown was initially supposed to be lifted. Now, it plans to borrow another Rs. 1,000 crore in May. The advance borrowing is vital given that the open market borrowing limit is considerably lower than the State’s urgent needs. Further, the priority is on only essential expenditure at present, relating to managing the COVID-19 pandemic, sustaining the lives of the poor, employment generation, and capital expenditure. Under different schemes, the government has infused an additional Rs. 1,000 crore in the Health department to help it deal with the outbreak. Other departments will have to stick to the expenditure limit set for them. “Until now, we have not allowed the capital expenditure to suffer. But a situation may arise that some cuts may have to be made,” said Mr. Jain. Returning to power in March after a dramatic, month-long, political tussle, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan faced the twin challenge of making up for time lost by ramping up containment efforts and shoring up a floundering economy, as the growth rate countrywide continued a downward trend. He requested the Centre for additional borrowing for the year. “At a time like this when the demand is low, the government should make increased meaningful expenditure, which has a bigger multiplier effect, to revive the economy,” said Mr. Jain. Relief from RBI Necessary relief has come from the Reserve Bank of India, which has hiked the Ways and Means Advances limit of Rs. 1,600 crore by 60%. To sustain up to June, Madhya Pradesh has planned to harness the raised Rs. 2,560 crore limit. The new regime, where 24 Assembly constituencies will hold byelectiona in four months, has begun doling out sops and freebies. Social security schemes Mr. Chouhan relaunched social security schemes for unorganised workers the Sambal Yojana, a pet scheme of his previous tenure that was scrapped by the Congress regime. On May 5, he transferred Rs. 41 crore for the scheme which credits money via DBT. In addition, Madhya Pradesh recently paid its share of the premium for the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana for the past two cropping seasons. Blaming the previous Congress regime for the pendency, Mr. Chouhan paid Rs. 2,200 crore. However, former Chief Minister Kamal Nath pointed out that the dues for kharif 2019 and rabi 2018-2019, had not been paid by Mr. Chouhan when he took over in 2018. The State still needs to pay its share for most recent season. The Finance Department believes the actual payout will be much more, as the consequent claim received by farmers will help pump a multiplied sum of cash into the economy. On May 4, Food Minister Govind Singh Rajput announced that in just 16 days, the government had procured a record 50% more wheat than last year. This entailed a purchase worth Rs. 3,171.26 crore, of which around Rs. 2,420 crore has already been paid to the farmers. Although the Centre bears the chunk of the payment, even the meagre 5-7% contribution from the State is likely to further strain its finances. In a bid to revive industries, Mr Nath has advised Mr. Chouhan to ensure that half the SGST collected is refunded as tax subsidy every other month. At least until March 31, he has suggested, the refund must be given to businesses and industries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mp-caught-between-pandemic-and-penury/article31513960.ece
06 May 2020||AHMEDABAD,||Centre steps in as cases rise in Gujarat||With 49 deaths caused by COVID-19, Gujarat recorded the highest single-day fatality in the country, with the entire State now engulfed in the surging pandemic. On Tuesday, 441 cases were reported from the State, bringing its numbers to 6,245 while the number of fatalities climbed to 368. The State’s fatality rate is now almost 5.9 %. On Tuesday, 186 persons were discharged, taking the recovery numbers to 1,381 so far. Ahmedabad is the worst hit with as many as 39 deaths and 349 cases on Tuesday. The city’s overall numbers had jumped to 4,425 infections and 273 deaths as on Tuesday. Meanwhile, alarmed by the spike in cases and fatalities in the State, the Central government has reportedly directed Chief Minister Vijay Rupani’s administration for course correction to contain the pandemic and manage the situation. Accordingly, the government on Tuesday roped in senior IAS officer Dr. Rajiv Kumar Gupta, handing him overall charge of Ahmedabad city that has emerged the largest cluster with a steep spike in infections and deaths. Dr. Gupta will now oversee the pandemic containment and management efforts of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. The Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner Vijay Nehra has been sent on a two-week home quarantine after he came in contact with an infected person. Senior IAS officer from Gandhinagar Mukesh Kumar has been made Commissioner in-charge of the civic body. Another senior IAS officer Pankaj Kumar has been made in-charge to guide the State Health Department in its COVID-19 management efforts. This move is aimed at curtailing the powers of Principal Secretary (Health and Family Welfare) Jayanti Ravi, whose performance was not as per the expectations of senior leaders in Delhi. “New Delhi was not happy with the way the situation was being handled in Gujarat,” an official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-steps-in-as-cases-rise-in-gujarat/article31513972.ece
06 May 2020||Pune,||Maharashtra virus tally breaches 15,000 mark||The number of cumulative COVID-19 positive cases in Maharashtra breached the 15,000 mark to reach 15,525 cases, while the State’s death toll rose to 617, with 34 fatalities being reported on Tuesday. While the difference between yesterday’s case tally (of 14,541 cases) and today’s tally (of 15,525 cases) was a surge in 984 cases, the State Health Department said that only 841 new cases were reported in the State today, while 143 more patients were backlog cases that had been added to the data. “Barring the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), the data cleaning process of all other districts and municipal corporations [in the State] has been completed as per Central Government’s instructions. Therefore, there has been an increase in the cumulative figures. Because the laboratory report scrutiny and the availability of figures accordingly is an ongoing process, State cumulative numbers are subject to change. In the last 24 hours, 841 new cases were reported in the State and 143 more patients have been added because of the data cleaning process,” read the explanation given in the medical bulletin issued by the State Health Department. Of the 34 fatalities, Mumbai reported 26, while six were reported from Pune city, one from Aurangabad and one from Kolhapur. “82% of the deaths reported today had high-risk co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma and heart disease,” said State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate. Mumbai city reported 635 of the new cases as the city’s cumulative tally soared to 9,945 cases. As many as 354 persons were discharged today, taking the cumulative discharged till date to 2,819, said Dr. Awate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-virus-tally-breaches-15000-mark/article31513985.ece
06 May 2020||NEW DELHI,||Ships on way to the Maldives, UAE||The Navy dispatched two ships, INS Jalashwa and INS Magar , to Male under Operation “Samudra Setu” to repatriate stranded Indian citizens. The evacuation operations will start on May 8 as part of Phase 1 efforts, the Navy said on Tuesday. Defence sources confirmed that INS Shardul and INS Airavat had set sail to the UAE. Modalities at the port of entry were being finalised and should be in place before the ships reach, a defence source said. “A total of 1,000 persons are planned to be evacuated during the first trip, catering for COVID-related social distancing norms vis-a-vis the carrying capacity and medical facilities available on board,” the Navy said. The evacuated personnel will disembark in Kochi and entrusted to the care of the State authorities, the Navy said. INS Jalashwa is set to reach Male on May 8 and INS Magar on May 10.  INS Jalashwa can normally accommodate 1,000 people but will take 800. The other three amphibious ships are landing ship tanks (LST) and can normally accommodate 500 people each but the capacity will be reduced to 300-350, officials said. The Navy said the ships had been suitably provisioned for the evacuation and those evacuated would be provided basic amenities and medical facilities during the sea passage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ships-on-way-to-the-maldives-uae/article31513989.ece
06 May 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Fare will put evacuees in a tough spot’||The Indian flights to operate from this week to evacuate nationals from all over the world will be commercial in nature. Informed sources on Tuesday clarified that the largest-ever evacuation of expat Indians from abroad will be carried out by “non-scheduled commercial flights” that will allow only those passengers who can buy tickets. The commercial condition has drawn criticism from a veteran diplomat who played a crucial role in evacuation of Indians during the 1990 Gulf crisis. The sources indicated that they are aware of the hardships that expats are facing because of global economic downturn and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic saying the States and Central Ministries will receive database for future employment of the returning expats who have lost jobs in the Gulf. 1990 operation The planned evacuation of Indians from the Gulf is set to commence from May 7 but unlike the operation of 1990 Gulf War the Indian nationals will have to pay for boarding the aircraft that will fly them home. According to available information, passengers boarding the Kuwait-Ahmedabad flight will have to pay around Rs. 20,000 and passengers for the Abu Dhabi-Kochi and Dubai-Kochi flights will have to pay around Rs. 15,000. Former Indian Ambassador K.P. Fabian, who was the Joint Secretary of the Gulf Division in the External Affairs Ministry during the 1990 Gulf War, said this was going to place the expats in a difficult position as many of them were facing financial hardships. “In 1990, we had taken a decision that the Government of India will bear the expenditure for the entire operation. We did not have a contractual arrangement with Air India but it was a smooth tie-up as the Ministries of Civil Aviation, Finance and External Affairs coordinated. After the operation, MEA paid Air India for the airlift,” said Mr. Fabian who travelled to Baghdad where he and External Affairs Minister, the late Inder Kumar Gujral, met Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein. Mr. Fabian also visited Jordan subsequently to work on the logistics of the plan which led to the airlift of around 1,76,000 people by civilian airliners. The operation remains a record.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/fare-will-put-evacuees-in-a-tough-spot/article31513990.ece

Till recently, a 50-kg bag of salt cost Rs. 170. Around 8 kg to 10 kg of salt is needed to produce one quintal (100 kg) of dried fish. However, post the lockdown, the price of salt almost doubled and made the production of dried fish practically unviable. Some families started using commercial salt from grocery stores to produce dried fish. “But it increases production cost, so we only make it for own use or in case some one places order,” said M. Kumudu, a fisherwoman. No stock Fishermen used to procure the cheaper product from the salt beds near Humma in the district. But production by the Humma Binchanapalli Salt Production and Sales Cooperative has dwindled considerably over the past few years. K. Duryodhan Reddy, a former secretary of the cooperative, said there was presently no stock. Samudram, a community-based federation of women self-help groups has stopped production of dried fish and other value-added seafood products, said B. Chitamma, its managing director. Others have started making dried fish without salt. But the market for this is low — dried fish without salt is mostly bought only by poultry feed manufacturers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/as-salt-too-turns-dear-fisher-families-worry/article31514002.ece

06 May 2020||NEW DELHI,||Unions write to PM to seek help for workers||Ten central trade unions wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday seeking immediate cash support for workers hit by the lockdown, free rations and arrangements for those stranded across the country to travel back to their home States. The letter, released by the unions on Tuesday, said they had been drawing the attention of Mr. Modi and Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar to the plight of workers since the lockdown began. “We have been raising the issues time and again that in crisis situation the buffer stocks of Food Corporation of India be opened to feed all working masses universally without requirement of any cards/documents. But from our ground reports, even those who are card-holders of categories such as Antyodaya – BPL-APL... are not covered fully,” the unions wrote. They reiterated their demand that the public distribution system be opened up for all those who need it. The unions said making workers who have been left with no income for over a month pay for the rail fare to travel back home was “the height of insensitivity.” “These workers are already in distress and they should not be pushed into further miseries,” the letter stated. The unions asked for urgent cash support of Rs. 7,500 a month for three months. For the MSME sector, the unions said, there was a need to subsidise wage payment for three months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/unions-write-to-pm-to-seek-help-for-workers/article31513987.ece
06 May 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘States, Railways final judge on ticket fare’||The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to intervene in a plea alleging that stranded migrant workers journeying home amid COVID-19 lockdown are charged 15% of their rail ticket fare. A three-judge Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan on Tuesday said it was not for the court but the State governments and the Railways to take steps. The Centre was responding to arguments made by advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for a former IIM(A) faculty member Jagdeep S. Chhokar, and lawyer Gaurav Jain that even the 15% fare was too high a burden for the workers. Mr. Bhushan said the government should transport them free of cost. Nevertheless, the court heartily agreed with Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta that necessary steps were indeed taken to care for the thousands of migrants and their families, mostly poor labourers wanting to return to their native villages to escape starvation and homelessness in the big cities. The court, under the context, found no reason at all to step in. The Bench said the petition had wanted a direction to the government to allow migrans to return to their native villages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/states-railways-final-judge-on-ticket-fare/article31513996.ece

06 May 2020||SRINAGAR,||‘Darbar Move’ burdens exchequer, says J&K HC||The Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Tuesday asked the Centre and the Union Territory (UT) administration to take a final call on the continuation of the 148-year-old practice of shifting capitals annually between Srinagar and Jammu, “which burdens the exchequer”. A Bench comprising Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Rajnesh Oswal, hearing a petition against the ‘Darbar Move’, observed, “There are limitations on the extent of our jurisdiction on making a declaration on the permissibility or the continuation of the ‘Darbar Move’. We defer this task to the best wisdom of those on whom the Constitution of India bestows this duty. Let the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Chief Secretary of the Union Territory of J&K examine it and take a considered decision.” Evaluating the cost incurred by the ‘Darbar Move’ on the exchequer, the court noted: “If this practice was rationalised, the amount of money, resources and time which could be saved, could be utilised towards the development of the Union Territory, which has otherwise witnessed much turmoil.”  “The ‘Darbar Move’ results in wastage of tremendous amount of time, efforts and energy on inefficient and unnecessary activity [say, packing of records]. It is taxing for security forces too,” the court observed. The practice was introduced in 1872 by a Dogra monarch to escape the harsh winters of the Kashmir Valley. Regional parties advocated the continuation of the practice “to help in the emotional integration between two diverse regions” of J&K.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/darbar-move-burdens-exchequer-says-jk-hc/article31513957.ece
06 May 2020||NEW DELHI,||‘Lockdown violation cases won’t be quashed’||The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a petition filed by a former Director-General of Police of Uttar Pradesh to quash FIRs registered against ordinary citizens for violating the COVID-19 lockdown. “There cannot be a super government. Everyone is going through difficult times,” a Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan remarked orally while rejecting the plea. Vikram Singh, the former DGP of Uttar Pradesh, had cited data collected by a think-tank Centre for Accountability and Systemic Change (CASC) — of which he is the chairman — to show that 848 FIRs were filed between March 23 and April 13 under Section 188 of the IPC (disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant) in 50 police stations in Delhi alone. The petition cited the Uttar Pradesh government website to say that 15,378 FIRs were registered in Uttar Pradesh against 48,503 persons under Section 188 IPC. Mr. Singh had argued that there were several judgments of the Supreme Court itself that FIRs cannot be registered under Section 188 IPC. “Police action on an individual who is perhaps suffering from distress and lack of information as a result of the circumstances has ramifications which can extend beyond the coronavirus lockdown, and cannot be good for a constitutional democracy,” the petition had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/lockdown-violation-cases-wont-be-quashed/article31513955.ece
06 May 2020||NEW DELHI,||Ramesh withdraws plea in SC, writes to Paswan||Rajya Sabha member Jairam Ramesh on Tuesday sent a detailed representation to Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Ram Vilas Paswan, voicing his deep concern about chinks in the public distribution system and food security for the poor amid the COVID-19 lockdown. Mr. Ramesh addressed his representation to the Minister within hours of the government’s assurance in the Supreme Court that his concerns would be “duly attended to.” “Over the last several weeks of the nation-wide lockdown and subsequent extensions of the same, numerous reports are coming in from across the country regarding inadequate food stocks and wide variances in distribution of the same amongst beneficiaries,” Mr. Ramesh wrote. Earlier in the day, Mr. Ramesh, represented by senior advocate Salman Khurshid, sought a non-discriminatory implementation of the National Food Security Act. However, during the court hearing, Mr. Ramesh’s side went on to acknowledge that they had come directly to the court without approaching the government first. The court finally allowed him to withdraw the petition in order to “enable the petitioner [Mr. Ramesh] to submit a detailed representation to Respondent No.1 [Union of India]. Solicitor General has submitted that it shall be duly attended to.” In his representation to Mr. Paswan, Mr. Ramesh argued the urgent need to identify gaps in the supply chain by comparing data of January this year with April on active PDS outlets. He also asked the government to ensure that food grains were not denied to those who did not produce ration cards during the lockdown period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ramesh-withdraws-plea-in-sc-writes-to-paswan/article31513956.ece

06 May 2020||May 06 2020 00:00 IST,||India needs a big stimulus: Banerjee||To another query from Mr. Gandhi on whether a scheme like NYAY or minimum income guarantee for the poorest families would help, he said, “Whether it is to the poorest people, that is more debatable...I would say bottom 60% of the population, we give them some money, nothing bad will happen in my view. If we give them money, well some of them might not need it. Fine they’ll spend it. If they spend it, it would have a stimulus effect.” Talking about the two key challenges in the post-COVID world, he noted: “There are two concerns — how to avoid a chain of bankruptcies. Maybe writing off a lot of debt is the way to go...The other is demand shortfall, and getting some cash into the hands of the population is the best way to kickstart the economy.” The Nobel laureate, however, was quick to discount the notion that “only strong leaders can take on the virus” and cited the U.S. and Brazil as two disastrous examples where the leaders are “messing up right and left”. He also mentioned about their (along with Amartya Sen and Raghuram Rajan) suggestion to give temporary ration cards and make the public distribution system universal and also find a way to put cash in the hands of people who don’t have Jan Dhan accounts. On how quickly the economy could be opened up, Prof. Banerjee said, “You don’t want to take down the lockdown when a lot of people are getting sick.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-needs-a-big-stimulus-banerjee/article31513965.ece
06 May 2020||May 06 2020 00:00 IST,||TRF a Pak. ploy to avoid scrutiny, says J&K’s DGP||The group is suspected to have attacked a police picket at Wangam in Kupwara on Monday, an atack in which three CRPF men were killed. Security agencies assert that the TRF was formed to help Pakistan evade scrutiny by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and avoid further sanctions. The global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog is to review Pakistan’s performance in acting against terror funding at its next meeting in Beijing in June. A senior government official said that TRF also includes members of the Hizbul Mujahideen, another banned terrorist group. One of the three militants killed in Kulgam’s Qazigund on April 27 — an attack that was claimed by the TRF — was associated with the Hizbul for many years, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Two other fresh recruited men were also killed in the encounter with forces. The official said the group was mainly concentrated in south Kashmir but the number of locals who had joined the group was not known yet. “We have information that 2-3 boys who went to Pakistan on visas for educational purposes have also joined the group. There is a concerted effort by Pakistan to lure them to join the TRF, projecting it as a local movement,” said the official. “TRF is more of a social media sensation. If TRF is suddenly active, can we say that LeT, Hizbul, Jaish and other terror groups backed by Pakistan have become redundant,” the official asked rhetorically. A third official described the group as an “online project”. “Pakistan wants to project Kashmiri terrorism as a resistance movement by Kashmiris. So far Hizbul and LeT have come under TRF’s umbrella,” the official said. On March 23, J&K police arrested six members of the group from three districts — Sopore, Kupwara and Handwara in North Kashmir. The group included an engineer, a shopkeeper, a baker and a government hospital employee. Police said the group received instructions from their handler — “Andrew Jones” on Telegram. The handler’s WhatsApp ID was “Khan Bilal”. Huge amount of arms and ammunition smuggled from Pakistan were also recovered. Four of the group are yet to be arrested. Police had then said that the group was not armed with firearms yet, but were involved in grenade attacks and overground activities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/trf-a-pak-ploy-to-avoid-scrutiny-says-jks-dgp/article31513963.ece
06 May 2020||May 06 2020 00:00 IST,||His many names||Rama was born a prince, but suffered in exile. Krishna was born in a prison, but was pampered like a prince in Gokula. But in His Vamana avatara, the Lord was not born a prince, and did not enjoy any comforts. He was the son of a sage, and had no riches. To retrieve Indra’s kingdom, He begged from Mahabali. Did He have to do all this? But, if He had not taken the Trivikrama avatara, how would the Vedas have been able to praise Trivikrama, asks Kooratazhvan. In the Vishnu Sahasranama, there are many names which refer to the Trivikrama avatara, elaborated M.A. Venkatakrishnan, in a discourse. He is Upendra (153rd name in Parasara Bhatta’s classification). Indra was Atiti’s son, and since Vamana appeared later as Atiti’s son, the Sahasranama refers to Him as Upendra, the one younger to Indra. Vamana is the 154th name. It was as Vamana that He approached Bali. Another name in the Sahasranama is Praamshuh. This refers to His assuming the huge form of Trivikrama, when He covered all worlds. He is Amoghah, because He was merciful to both Indra and Mahabali. Indra got back his kingdom, but Bali was not left out. He was given patala loka to rule over. The Lord is Suchihi, because although He was kind to both Indra and Bali, He expected nothing in return. He is Oorjithah, because He had the capacity to control all those who opposed Him, like Namuchi, for example. Namuchi was the son of Mahabali. Although He is Upendra, the One younger than Indra, yet He is Ateendra, that is One whose prowess far exceeds that of Indra. Sangraha and Sargaha, indicate that He is easy of access to His bhaktas. Dhrutaatma means that because He is so approachable, He saves jivas. He is Niyamah, because He humbles enemies like Bali. He is Yamah, because He is inside everyone, directing them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/his-many-names/article31513986.ece

Coordination between officials in Tamil Nadu and the Karnataka police helped a young girl in Theni, suffering from Maple Syrup Urine Disorder (MSUP), get medicines from Bengaluru in record time. The 11-year-old girl’s father works as a supplier in a small restaurant in Periyakulam, and her mother is a daily wage worker. With both unemployed due to the lockdown, getting meta nutrition, the required dietary supplement for their only daughter, from Bengaluru seemed near impossible. For the past three years, the family has been procuring it through courier service. “With prohibitory orders in vogue, we did not know what to do as there is no movement of goods... ,” the mother told The Hindu . A campaign vehicle appealing to people to remain indoors while distributing pamphlets with a control room number proved a godsend for the desperate parents. After the girl’s mother called the control room, her request was passed to nodal officer Kavita, who in turn, spoke to Collector M. Pallavi Baldev. A team of officials visited the family at Aranmanaipudur panchayat near Periakulam and obtained details of the shop in Bengaluru. When Ms. Kavita contacted the dealer, he was initially reluctant to open the shop but later agreed to keep the medicine ready. She then sought the help of the Bengaluru City Police Commissioner, who made arrangements to get the packet delivered to the Hosur checkpost. A two-member team from Theni then made a 14-hour journey to the checkpost and back to Periakulam to deliver the medicine to the family, leaving them overwhelmed by refusing to accept money for the supplements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/officials-turn-couriers-amid-lockdown/article31514230.ece
06 May 2020||Ariyalur,TAMIL NADU||Heavy blow for tuberose farmers||The prolonged COVID-19 lockdown period has dealt a heavy blow on cultivators of tuberose as there are hurdles in transporting the produce. To stabilise the standing crop, the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Ariyalur, has advised farmers to cut the flower stalk at the base of the plants. Tuberose is cultivated on 100 hectares in Ariyalur district and about 500 farmers are dependent on the crop. While a section of farmers have harvested the tuberose and were selling the produce at low price, many have chosen not to harvest the flowers due to non availability of marketing facility and transportation hurdles. However, scientists have cautioned that leaving well-grown tuberose unharvested is detrimental to the health of the plants. G. Alagukannan, Senior Scientist and Head, KVK, Ariyalur, who visited various fields along with Horticulture Scientist Y. Raja Joslin, have suggested that the blooming stalks, which bear the flowers, could be removed by gently cutting the base of flower stalk to block wastage of nutrients. This would help the tuberose plants to grow healthy and reach the flowering stage again in a month. This practice could be followed instead of harvesting the flowers and marketing them at throwaway prices. The tuberose stalks could be used as a cattle feed after chopping. He said that same approach could be followed in drumstick farms. In Ariyalur district, drumstick was being raised on 800 hectares and harvest was expected from the month of June. The farmers too expect to face some hurdles in marketing the produce. Hence, the farmers have been advised to delay the harvest for some time by pinching the existing flower buds and terminal shoots. It would help to save the stored food material inside the plant system and leading to blooming of buds after one month. If they followed the practice, they could harvest the pods from August to September so as to fetch a good price. the farmers could use the waste decompose for enriching the soil health and plant health during the lockdown period, the officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/heavy-blow-for-tuberose-farmers/article31514452.ece

06 May 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Govt. feels it has no option but to open liquor outlets||The proposed re-opening of Tasmac liquor shops outside Chennai from May 7 has evoked strong reactions from different quarters, but the government feels it it is justified in doing so. The Opposition parties as well as the AIADMK’s allies such as BJP, PMK and DMDK have unequivocally conveyed their disapproval of the government’s move. What the critics highlight is the timing of the decision when the number of COVID-19 positive cases is progressively rising. According to official sources, the government too was not inclined to allow opening of the liquor shops now. But, the Central government’s notification of May 1, permitting shops to be opened even in non-containment areas of all zones including red, changed its plan. With neighbouring States such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka deciding to open the shops, the government, according to officials, had no other option but to follow suit. Otherwise, illicit distillation and instances of people crossing the inter-State border to buy liquor would be taking place, which would be “very difficult” to control, they contended. Also, the concentration of the administrative machinery would be diverted to controlling crimes such as illicit transportation from the core task of tackling the adverse impact of the COVID-19, argued Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar. He emphasised that the government and his party are “committed to implementing “a total prohibition in a phased manner” and recalled how several hundreds of shops were closed in the last four years. D. Jagadeeswaran, an activist, however feels the government’s move has to be questioned in the light of the Koyambedu episode, where non-adherence to personal distancing norms led to a spike in positive cases. “What is the guarantee that people who go to the shops would not get infected with COVID-19? The same question holds good for those who man the shops.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-feels-it-has-no-option-but-to-open-liquor-outlets/article31514138.ece
06 May 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Did authorities fail to read the signs?||Months into the pandemic, pieces of the sub-cellular pathogenic puzzle seem to be falling into place. One thing amply clear now is that its spread is akin to a storm - dispersing from a focal point to a larger area. This is exactly how Koyambedu market has come to infect large parts of Tamil Nadu. An analysis of States that have had over 2,500 cases shows how it is often the biggest/busiest city that SARS-CoV-2 seems to strike in. The lesson that governments could take from this is to look for, in the initial stages, an epicentre and launch control measures. In retrospect, perhaps the shutting down of the Koyambedu market comes at least a month late. The signs were there for all to see. Chennai, which had the highest number of cases, also showed a high preponderance in its northern parts, which have a density of about 27,000 people per square km. The population density in Chennai, and Koyambedu market, are among the key reasons that make physical distancing difficult in the city. Unlike in rural areas, where the landscape offers relief, cities such as Chennai do not have any such relief, says K. Kolandaisamy, former director of public health who led the COVID-19 control efforts until recently. “Physical distancing becomes an issue here. While it is the case that the public in the city show least conformity with stay-at-home rules, it is also because in several areas, especially in North Chennai, it is nearly impossible for people to maintain distance,” he explains. “Cities are places where infection is magnified rapidly. In a village, or rural area, it will be much slower,” says T. Jacob John, eminent virologist. The driver of the epidemic will be cities, especially those with density, he adds. The sprawl of Koyambedu and the sheer number of people working there and using it should have rung alarm bells for the powers that be. A month late? “It was not just the wholesalers, or retailers, but even residents who were going to Koyambedu for a mere kilo of tomatoes, and people who picked up flowers to sell in retail,” says a top official who calls the Koyambedu situation “extremely complicated”. Health experts point out that the market should have been closed at least a month ago. Also, the practice of stopping lorry drivers at the State border, testing them, and transferring the load onto lorries that would take the produce into Tamil Nadu, could have been adopted. The jury is still out on how many cases and contacts actually caught their infection from Koyambedu. “It may take us a few days to actually get down to the number of cases, or get down to all with the ‘Koyambedu strain’. More tests need to be done, clearly,” says J. Radhakrishnan, nodal officer, Greater Chennai Corporation, for COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/did-authorities-fail-to-read-the-signs/article31514129.ece
06 May 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Home isolation is now an option for pre-symptomatic, mild cases||In accordance with the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research, patients who have been clinically categorised as having a very mild or pre-symptomatic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) would have the option of home isolation, provided they have the necessary facilities at their residence. They would have to submit an undertaking that they will adhere to self-isolation norms. Based on a proposal of the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, the government has issued an order, setting out guidelines for home isolation of very mild/pre-symptomatic COVID-19 cases. This comes at a time when hospitals across the city are shifting asymptomatic and stable patients to quarantine facilities to free up beds for those in need of treatment. Eligibility criteria People who are suspected to have symptoms of COVID-19 and are awaiting test results, as well as confirmed cases, are currently being isolated and managed in hospitals with the intention of breaking the chain of transmission. During the containment phase, patients should be clinically categorised as cases that are very mild/mild, moderate or severe, and treated accordingly in health facilities, the G.O. said. The patients should be clinically categorised as very mild cases/pre-symptomatic cases by the treating medical officer. They should have requisite facilities at their residence for self-isolation and quarantining family members, and a well-ventilated single-room, preferably with an attached/separate toilet. A caregiver should be available 24x7, and a communication link between the caregiver and the hospital is a prerequisite for the entire duration of home isolation. The caregiver and all close contacts should take hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis as per protocol and as prescribed by the treating medical officer. The patient and the caregiver should be given a course of zinc and vitamin C/multivitamin tablets for 10 days, apart from the herbal concoctions nilavembu kudineer and kabasura kudineer. They should download the Aarogya Setu mobile app, which should remain active at all times through bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The patient should agree to monitor his/her health and inform the District Surveillance Officer/Deputy Director of Health Services about his/her condition for follow-up action, and give an undertaking on adherence to self-isolation and home quarantine guidelines. Patients should self-monitor their health with daily temperature checks, and report promptly in case of any deterioration of symptoms. They should use a triple-layer medical mask at all times, and discard it after eight hours of use, or earlier if it becomes wet or visibly soiled. Masks should be discarded only after being disinfected. Patients should stay in the identified rooms and away from others residing in their homes, especially the elderly and those with co-morbid conditions like hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and renal disease. They should follow respiratory etiquette and wash their hands often with soap and water. Their clothes and other linen should be washed and dried separately. Surfaces should be cleaned with disinfectants. They should restrict their movement within their house, and should not attend any social/religious gatherings. The caregivers too should wear a triple-layer medical mask while in the same room as the patients, and use disposable gloves. They should follow hand hygiene and self-monitor their health. Both the patient and the caregiver should seek immediate medical attention if they develop the following signs and symptoms — persistent cough/continuous fever of above 102°F/difficulty in breathing, persistent pain/pressure in the chest, mental confusion, inability to arouse the patient, somnolence and poor feeding in children, seizures, decreased urine output, persistent or worsening of initial symptoms beyond 72 hours, and developing bluish discolouration of lips/face. The home isolation will come to an end once the symptoms are clinically resolved and a medical officer certifies that the patient is free of infection after laboratory testing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/home-isolation-is-now-an-option-for-pre-symptomatic-mild-cases/article31514149.ece
06 May 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Focused campaign gets nod||The Greater Chennai Corporation will start highlighting local public health issues during the awareness campaign against COVID-19. Following the visit of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to Ripon Buildings on Tuesday, the Corporation officials have been asked to create awareness among residents on the COVID-19 hotspot clusters and containment zones in their own vicinity. “Instead of disseminating the same information in all zones, we will make the residents aware of the challenges faced by others in the same area because of COVID-19. The residents will understand the gravity of the situation and cooperate with officials in the fight against the pandemic,” said an official. As many as 357 containment zones and hotspot clusters have been delineated in residential neighbourhoods. After the Corporation officials made a presentation on the containment activities to the Chief Minister, the civic body received nod to intensify awareness campaign. The Chief Minister agreed to the proposal to launch separate campaign for each residential neighbourhood, focusing on the unique problems faced by the area. Quarantine spaces The civic body has been directed to create more quarantine spaces in colleges and universities on the outskirts to house people expected to return from abroad. “We expect at least 20,000 city residents to return from foreign countries in a few weeks. More quarantine spaces for such residents who test positive will be needed,” said an official. The Chief Minister inspected the exhibition of containment activities in Amma Maaligai on the premises of Ripon Buildings on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/focused-campaign-gets-nod/article31514131.ece
06 May 2020||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||Travel arrangements being made for migrant workers, says Palaniswami||Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Tuesday said arrangements were being made to facilitate the return of migrant workers to their home towns. He said the government would provide free rations to family cardholders in June as well. At a meeting with officials, he directed them to handle the issue of migrants seeking to return to their home towns in an organised manner. “There are nearly 50,000 migrant workers here. Those who wish to go to work [in the wake of the relaxation of the lockdown] can stay here. Those who are keen on going back…you should collect their details at their place of residence and make arrangements for [their] travel,” he said. The collection of such details at their place of stay was necessary to avoid crowding in other locations, he added. Mr. Palaniswami asked the officials to provide details on travel arrangements to the workers. “The government would ensure that they are picked up at a specified time and dropped off at the railway station,” he said. The Chief Minister said he had already discussed with the DGP the need to move the workers from their current locations only after 10 p.m., as transporting them during day time would lead to traffic jams. “We cannot make arrangements for train trips for everyone at one go. We are doing it in a phased manner,” he said. Appeal to public The Chief Minister reiterated his appeal to the people to maintain physical distancing, wash their hands regularly and wear masks to curb the spread of COVID-19. The large number of COVID-19 cases in Chennai can be attributed to the density of its population, its narrow streets and increased testing, Mr. Palaniswami said. “We have 52 testing centres in Tamil Nadu and around 12,000 persons are being tested daily. Hence, the number of positive cases has gone up. People need not fear the high numbers,” he said at a meeting of officials of the Greater Chennai Corporation and the police. Bed capacity Around 4,000 beds were ready to meet any contingency in Chennai, he said. Apart from a dense population, “public toilets are used by many and the disease spreads through them as well”, he said. The containment zones in Chennai were being disinfected thrice a day, he said.  We cannot make arrangements for train trips for everyone at one go. We are doing it in a phased manner||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/travel-arrangements-being-made-for-migrant-workers-says-palaniswami/article31514151.ece
06 May 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. notifies 711 containment zones across 36 districts||As of May 2, the Tamil Nadu government has notified 711 locations across 36 districts as COVID-19 containment zones to curb the spread of the pandemic in the State. “If there are five or more [COVID-19] positive cases in a locality, it will be considered a cluster,” the guidelines issued by the government said. According to an annexure contained in a Government Order issued by Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam, Chennai had, as of May 2, the maximum number of containment zones at 189 [the figure reached 357 on Tuesday], and Dharmapuri district had just one such zone. Containment zones were important for identifying pockets in need of critical interventions for focused management of COVID-19, the G.O. noted. In urban areas, even if there was just a single case or less than five cases, the street in question should be demarcated as a containment zone, the order said. If it happens to be a long stretch, a reasonable portion could be brought under a containment zone to restrict movement. In rural areas, “the habitation” of the hamlet was to be demarcated as a containment zone, it said. In urban areas, if the cluster (five or more cases) fell within a ward, the ward in which the residences of the positive cases were located should be demarcated as a containment zone. “If the residence happens to be [situated on] the border of the ward, the adjoining wards may also be included in the containment zone,” the guidelines said. In rural areas, the whole village or the group of villages where the clustering of cases had been reported should be demarcated as containment zone(s). As for gated communities/hostels/apartments, “epidemiological factors should be taken into consideration before deciding on the strategies. Housing design, number of people living/working/visiting, floors, transport and other epidemiological factors should be considered”, it said. The list of containment zones would be revised on a weekly basis or even earlier. Based on feedback from the field and additional analysis at the State level, States may designate additional red or orange zones, as appropriate. “However, States may not relax the zonal classification of districts classified as red/orange as communicated by the Ministry [the Centre],” the G.O. said. If an area has reported no cases for 21 days, it can be considered to be at a lower level in the zonal classification, in case the district concerned is a red/orange zone. The containment zones in these districts were to be delineated based on the mapping of cases and contacts, geographical dispersion of cases and contracts, areas with a well-demarcated perimeter and enforceability. Further, a buffer zone had to be demarcated around the containment zone. The area should be appropriately defined by the district administration/local urban body with technical inputs from the local level. “In the spirit of effective containment, it is advisable to err on the side of caution,” the G.O. stated. Stringent perimeter control, active search for cases through house-to-house surveillance, testing of all cases, contact-tracing and clinical management of all confirmed cases were the necessary actions to be taken in these zones, it said. It also elaborated on the strategies for prevention and control, delaying the spread, and other containment strategies.

06 May 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Aavin sourcing milk from other dairies||Grappling with labour shortage at its Madhavaram dairy, Aavin is sourcing 2.5 lakh litres of packed milk from other dairies in the State. The Madhavaram dairy usually supplies about 3.5 lakh litres of milk daily to the city. However, after five loaders tested positive for COVID-19, the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers Federation began sourcing milk from Erode, Vellore, Tiruchi, Kancheepuram, and even Madurai dairies to maintain supply to Chennai. Aavin Managing Director M. Vallalar said that getting labourers was an issue at Madhavaram and that they were not getting replacements due to the lockdown. Sharing the burden “Other dairies are able to lend a helping hand since we are taking small numbers from several places and not adding too much burden on individual dairies,” he said. Aavin’s Sholinganallur and Ambattur dairies too have been asked to speed up their milk deliveries and pack a portion of north Chennai’s requirement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aavin-sourcing-milk-from-other-dairies/article31514135.ece
06 May 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Shifting of vegetable market out of Koyambedu begins||After last-minute sales on Tuesday, the Koyambedu wholesale market was shut, and merchants have decided to halt the trade till May 10. While the available stock in retail shops is considered sufficient for three days, the sudden closure of the wholesale hub is bound to disrupt supply of vegetables and fruits in the city, according to wholesale traders. Officials in the Koyambedu Market Management Committee said one gate was kept open till 10 a.m. to allow traders to wind up operations. “We plan to disinfect the entire premises and clear the garbage. Normally, the market generates 180-200 tonnes of garbage. We expect only up to 80 tonnes of garbage now,” said an official. As the biomethanation plant in Koyambedu is under repair, the garbage collected from the market would be sent to the dump. On Tuesday, the market received 80 to 100 truckloads of vegetables. However, sales were dull and prices dipped as only retail traders from the city and its outskirts visited the market for making last-minute purchases. M. Thyagarajan, president, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants’ Association, said, “We have decided to source arrivals and halt business till May 10. We plan to approach the government to [urge it to] reconsider its decision on shutting down the market. Instead, they may allow the market to function with restrictions, including on the number of shops and vehicles in Koyambedu, to keep prices under control.” Meanwhile, arrangements are being made to set up the temporary market in Thirumazhisai satellite town. “A total of 100 wholesale shops will be set up. Direct vehicle-to-vehicle transfer will take place, i.e., vegetables will be transferred from a bigger vehicle into a smaller one, and taken to different parts of the city and the district,” Tiruvallur Collector Mageswari Ravikumar said. Around 100 police personnel would be deployed to monitor the functioning of the market.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/shifting-of-vegetable-market-out-of-koyambedu-begins/article31514146.ece
06 May 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK pitches in to ease pandemic pain||When a few DMK volunteers in Kanniyakumari reached the house of a man in Rajakkamangalam, who had dialled the party’s helpline for those hit by the COVID-19 lockdown, they were in for a surprise. “The man turned out to be a BJP supporter. He refused to accept the package of essential commodities [offered to him]. When I pointed out to him that it was he who had sought help, he said he just wanted to determine if the DMK was really sending help. We did not persuade him to accept the hamper. But many AIADMK supporters have accepted our help,” former Minister and DMK MLA N. Suresh Rajan claimed. According to DMK leaders, every day, thousands of people from across the State call the helpline — 9073090730 — set up by the party under its ‘Ondrinaivom Vaa’ (Let’s unite) initiative. The party’s high command sends their names and addresses to the district secretaries. “I have even appointed five persons in my office to go through the list being sent regularly from Chennai. Our party members then distribute the assistance. We have to send the photographs of the beneficiaries to the headquarters by WhatsApp after reaching out to them,” Mr. Rajan said. Party president M.K. Stalin said lakhs of people had been covered since the launch of the scheme. Besides monitoring the relief efforts, Mr. Stalin is staying in touch with party leaders through video-conference. Apart from providing rice and other essential commodities, the DMK has set up community kitchens in 25 districts to feed over 25 lakh poor people. K. Thangaraj from Erode, a beneficiary, wrote to Mr. Stalin, expressing his gratitude. “I am embarrassed to say that I am an AIADMK man. The government has not done anything for the people,” he had claimed in his letter. “We also distribute medicines to people suffering from chronic diseases, irrespective of political considerations,” former Minister Thangam Thennarasu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-pitches-in-to-ease-pandemic-pain/article31514154.ece

The date of reopening would be announced later. The government on Monday decided to reopen all liquor outlets, closed for over a month as part of the lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19, except those located in containment areas, from May 7. On Tuesday, the government issued a release that said that Tasmac outlets in Chennai would not be opened on May 7. Over 700 shops are located in the city. The government had cited the reopening of liquor shops in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, which led to residents in border areas crossing over and posing problems for the authorities, for its decision to reopen Tasmac outlets.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/liquor-outlets-in-chennai-to-stay-shut/article31514133.ece
06 May 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Minister rebuts Stalin’s allegation of irregularities in tenders||Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar on Monday rebutted the allegation of DMK president M.K. Stalin of irregularities in tenders being floated by the State Highways Department. “We are still receiving bids, as the invitation for e-tenders [electronic tenders, meant for the performance based contract in Thanjavur district] was issued only on February 25. The financial sanction for the project was given on February 19. No practice has been violated by floating the tender. It is amusing to hear Mr. Stalin’s allegation of irregularities in the Highways Department as it was his party, while in power, that had followed the system of issuing tender forms only to its favourites and receiving such bids on the boxes,” Mr. Jayakumar said, in a statement. Debunking the DMK leader’s charge (based on petition filed in the Madras High Court) of the value of the tender having been quoted higher by Rs. 700 crore than the normal, the Minister said the financial sanction had been given for the project on the basis of “best estimate” made by technical experts. Any qualified contractor could participate in the tender process which was being held electronically. Tender forms could not be issued only to the select contractors. As for the litigation about the tender in the Madras High Court, the Minister said the court had adjourned the case and held hat there was no basis in the public interest litigation filed by Durai Jayakumar, a contractor.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/minister-rebuts-stalins-allegation-of-irregularities-in-tenders/article31514136.ece
06 May 2020||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Re-engaged railway staff may get the axe||Hundreds of retired railway employees, including officers, re-engaged to fill huge vacancies across the network, may lose their jobs as the Ministry of Railways has decided to terminate their services considering partial attendance of 33% for operations during lockdown and age factor. Southern Railway on Tuesday terminated 368 retired employees re-engaged in workshops. The notices were served through SMS/WhatsApp/email mode, official sources said. In view of the partial attendance due to lockdown and also greater risk involved in the case of those above 60 years of age due to COVID-19, it is decided that the services of all the re-engaged retired staff of all workshops of Southern Railway are to be terminated duly, giving 15 days’ notice. The 368 re-engaged staff were working in the Carriage Works, Perambur, Locoworks, Perambur, Signal & Telecommunication Workshop Podanur and Engineering Workshop, Arakkonam. The status of other retired employees, including ex-servicemen, employed in different assignments will be known soon after the lockdown. In May last year, the Railway Board cleared a proposal to engage ex-servicemen to fill up thousands of vacancies in safety categories across zones on contractual basis. All India Railwaymen Federation national working president N. Kanniah said the decision to re-engage retired employees when several lakhs of young graduates were jobless was a wrong decision. Urgent steps should be taken to fill up the 1 lakh plus vacancies in various safety categories considering the fact that full-fledged passenger train operations commence post lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/re-engaged-railway-staff-may-face-the-axe/article31514142.ece

Those who arrive at the inter-State border with symptoms of the disease would be sent to the quarantine facilities. “Medical teams at the border points would decide who should be sent to institutional quarantine. They would check whether the person has Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) or Influenza-like Illnesses (ILL) and decide accordingly,” the official said. “As of now, we are planning to send all international passengers [who are likely to arrive later this week] to institutional quarantine,” he added. When asked about the possibility of special trains or government-arranged vehicles ferrying migrant workers, he said this would be sorted out soon.

N. students, parents set to return from Kota||A total of 78 persons from Tamil Nadu comprising students and parents, who were stranded in Kota, Rajasthan, the hub for coaching for competitive exams, due to the COVID-19 lockdown, are set to return following approval from the State government. V. Saravana Kumar, Commissioner of Horticulture Department for the government of Rajasthan, who is the Nodal Officer for Tamil Nadu, confirmed the development to The Hindu on Tuesday. The students got the permission on Monday night, after Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami signed the order for their return, he said.

06 May 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Tangedco told to collect 20 % minimum demand charges from HT consumers||The Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC), in a suo motu order issued on May 4, has directed the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) to collect 20 % of the contracted demand or recorded demand, which is higher, as minimum demand charges from high tension (HT)consumers. The Commission said that in view of the epidemic in the State, as notified by the State Government, most of the industries were prevented from using electricity up to the sanctioned demand, except those units that were exempted and allowed to operate. Studying the situation and based on representations, the Commission said that in the case of HT consumers whose recorded demand does not exceed 20 % of the sanctioned demand during the lockdown period, only 20 % of the contracted demand or recorded demand, whichever is higher, should be recovered apart from the charges for actual consumption. The State Government has also granted exemptions to some sectors, permitting HT consumers in these segments to operate during the lockdown. Hence these consumers should be billed for electricity consumption under the routine billing method. If the government adopts partial lockdown, the Tangedco can accept the permission granted for functioning of industries to operate and the minimum charges can be decided accordingly. The Tamil Nadu Electricity Consumers Association, representing HT electricity consumers in the State, has welcomed the direction. It also sought waiver of fixed expenses and collection of charges only for recorded demand in the coming months. In a communication dated May 5, the Tangedco said Low Tension industrial and commercial consumers, who had been billed under previous month billing or through self assessment and who had to make the payments between March 25 and May 17, have time till May 22 to pay the charges as the Central Government has extended the lockdown till May 17. In the case of LT domestic consumers, the payments made for previous month billing will be adjusted after taking the reading next.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tangedco-told-to-collect-20-minimum-demand-charges-from-ht-consumers/article31514173.ece

06 May 2020||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Siruvani water to last till June||Amid concerns arising out of the impact of COVID-19, there is a reassuring message on the water supply front. The quantity of water in Siruvani Reservoir will help the city tide over this summer. Sources in the Coimbatore Corporation say the water level at 16.96 feet will help the civic body supply water to the city’s residents till mid-June. The full reservoir level is 49.50 feet. The Corporation drew around 60 – 70 million litres a day and that withdrawal brought down the water level by five cm. The dip in water level would increase to 10 cm a day in the next couple of weeks as the dam was narrow at the bottom. But there was nothing to worry, the sources reassured reiterating that the city would get Siruvani water till mid-June. The Corporation supplied the Siruvani water to 42 wards - 31 in full and 11 in part - in six to eight-day cycles. Though the full reservoir level in Siruvani was 49.50 feet – the height to which water could be stored – this time the Corporation did not have the luxury of having water to that height as the Kerala Government, following floods, had reduced the maximum water storage level to around 45 feet.  Pilloor The sources said there was nothing to be concerned about the quantity of water the Corporation drew from the Pilloor as well. The Corporation was drawing over 110 million litres a day to maintain the water supply cycle.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/siruvani-water-to-last-till-june/article31514178.ece

06 May 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||MV Act to be strictly enforced||With certain relaxations in the COVID-19 lockdown set to take effect from Wednesday, the Madurai City police is charting a new strategy to maintain order without harassing the public. Commissioner of Police, S. Davidson Devasirvatham, said the police would stick to enforcing the Motor Vehicles Act. “We will strictly enforce MV Act and also ensure that not more than one person rides on a two wheeler and not more than three persons (including driver) travel in a four-wheeler under the relaxed lockdown conditions,” he told the media on Tuesday. Policing was restricted to vehicle checking and at ensuring social distancing at market places in the initial days of the lockdown. “But, later on, with the number of containment zones increasing, considerable strength was diverted to provide bandobust at those (15) zones apart from providing security to ration shops,” he said. Two to three police personnel would be deployed at the Tasmac shops that would be opened from Wednesday to maintain social distancing, he added. Mr. Davidson said it would not be possible for the police to take up intensified vehicle check like earlier, as stopping of vehicles could lead to traffic jam and putting hurdle to movement of essential services, he added. Besides, social distancing would also be not possible if vehicles were stopped for intensified checking, he said. Stating that 2,100 police personnel were being deployed in the city for various policing work, he said besides putting police personnel on different shifts, adequate rest had to be given to them. “The police would not be harassing people seeking their e-passes in general. However, the police would continue to intercept suspicious people. In the last few days, we have come across people in families moving from one place to another to visit their relatives. Such people would be detained and their vehicles seized,” he said. Meanwhile, returning of vehicles that were seized during the first phase of lockdown was under way, he added. When asked about the likelihood of people from containment zone sneaking out to get liquor bottles as Tasmac shops would be opened from Wednesday, Collector, T.G. Vinay, said the police bandobust would be reviewed. Additional barricading would be done and gaps would be filled. The district administration would take a relook at the opening of Tasmac shops in the city area if there were gross violations of curfew order, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mv-act-to-be-strictly-enforced/article31514441.ece

Scores of north Indian youths on Tuesday thronged Madurai Collectorate seeking e-pass to leave the State. However, they were asked to register themselves with their personal details as the State government was yet to make arrangements for their return. One of them, M. Ramkesh, 27, of Uttar Pradesh, who has been selling pani puri at Teppakulam for nearly four years, wants to go home as he could not face the inconvenience any more after being rendered jobless for more than 40 days. “We are 27 members of different families living here at Mela Anuapanadi. We live by selling pani puri at different places in 15 carts,” he said. However, after the lockdown, life has become very difficult as they have run out of all resources. “The Government gave us groceries only once. A police team arranged food materials once. We have borrowed money as well. But, now it has become unmanageable and we need to go home in Jalaun district,” he said. Stating that their family members do not have any more money, he said he would borrow money for travel and repay on returning to Madurai later. He said the workers could manage at their homes as food grains for the farming family would not be a problem at all. Another youth, Pawan Kumar, had come to the Temple City for the Periyar Bus Stand work under Smart City project six months ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/migrant-workers-longing-to-return-home/article31514439.ece

06 May 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Revive MSME, retail sectors through fiscal incentives’||The Central and State governments must introduce a wide range of fiscal incentives to micro small and medium enterprises (MSME) and retail sectors, which have been hit hard by the COVID-19 lockdown, said Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In a release, it said lakhs of people were employed in the MSME and retail sectors which together contributed about 40% to the country’s Gross Domestic Product. Post-lockdown, the retailers would find their stock damaged or expired. They would also be saddled with rent arrears, electricity charges, GST and income tax dues and salary dues to employees. So only government intervention through incentives would help them get back on track with ease. Banks must offer fresh credit of up to 50% of the existing loans without demanding additional collateral, and waive interest dues for March to June. Employees State Insurance Corporation must disburse salaries for employees of private companies for the lockdown period. For employees of organisations that do not come under the ambit of ESIC, 50% of their salary for the lockdown period must be borne by the government. The GST slabs of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% must be correspondingly reduced to 3%, 9%, 12% and 18%. The benefit of recently announced corporate tax reduction to 15% for new manufacturing units must be extended to all corporate units and partnership firms. Rent payable for private buildings from March to June must be permitted to be paid in six instalments from July. For revival of the economy, the government must allow 12-hour shifts with 50% additional wages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/revive-msme-retail-sectors-through-fiscal-incentives/article31514426.ece
06 May 2020||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Plea to allow sale of edible oil in loose||Madurai Oil and Oil Seeds Association has urged the State government to postpone the plan to ban sale of edible oil in loose from June 1. In a statement, it said poor people would be affected should the ban come into effect as the cost of 200ml packaged edible oil could go up by Rs. 8. Loose edible oil is cheaper and affordable when compared to packaged edible oil. “When sold in loose, customers can ascertain the colour, quality, flavour and taste of oil so that they can make an informed choice. Packing edible oil will also increase the selling price,” the statement said. “It is mandatory to get licence for packing edible oil in pouch or bottles and it becomes a burden for small retailers. There will be practical difficulties during transit of oils sans label.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-allow-sale-of-edible-oil-in-loose/article31514427.ece

In a statement issued to the press, the secretary, CPI Ammapettai Union, R. Senthilkumar claimed that some of the family cardholders in Puliyakkudi in Papanasam taluk received SMS alerts stating that rice over and above the quantity allotted to their cards had been delivered to them. Around 200 cardholders received messages stating that 45 kilograms of rice had been issued to them though they had received just 20 kilograms of rice. Hence, he urged the Civil Supplies officials to look into the matter and help the needy receive their due share of enhanced rice quota as announced by the State government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cpi-alleges-malpractice-in-pds-distribution/article31514458.ece
06 May 2020||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||Automobile dealers seek permission to run service stations||Relaxation in the lockdown restrictions announced by the State government seems to have put the automobile dealers at crossroads as they are unable to get a clear indication from the revised guidelines whether they can open shop. As per the guidelines, automobile showrooms continue to be barred from functioning during the lockdown period till May 17. Incidentally, these showrooms comprise two sections – sales and service stations. While the sales sections comes under the purview of Shops Act, the service area comes under the purview of Factories Act, pointed out an automobile showroom owner at Thanjavur. Keeping the unit under lock and key for too long a period would result in serious damage to the vehicles kept on display and as well as those parked in the stockyard, he claimed. Further, shutting down service stations has also put the customers in a disadvantageous position as they were unable to get their vehicles serviced as per the free service schedule. Moreover, any major complaints of malfunctioning of vehicles particularly four wheelers were generally attended at the service stations as the original spares and technical know-how would only be available with the dealers.  Applying the Shops Act for the entire automobile showroom overlooking the fact that service stations fall under the purview of the Factories Act should be reconsidered, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/automobile-dealers-seek-permission-to-run-service-stations/article31514447.ece

Jayaseelan said here on Tuesday. Addressing a meeting to discuss modalities of reopening business establishments in the city, Mr. Jayaseelan said traders should ensure the minimum physical distance of three feet between customers, who should wear masks. Although the State government had allowed functioning of mobile phone shops, only 50% of them located in commercial complexes would be allowed to open on a specific day so that all shops in the building could conduct business on alternate days. While multi-storeyed AC complexes would not be allowed to open during the extended lockdown, home appliances and automobile showrooms could transact business with skeletal staff strength. “All shops should keep sanitisers for customers,” he said. On shops located on narrow streets, he said the assistant commissioners of the particular zone would take the final call after discussing it with traders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/shops-to-open-on-alternate-days/article31514419.ece
06 May 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Random tests for traders at wholesale vegetable market||Health authorities in Tiruchi have begun conducting random COVID-19 tests among vegetable and fruit traders at the temporary wholesale market functioning at G. Corner grounds in the city. The move comes in the wake of the outbreak of novel coronavirus among workers at the Koyambedu vegetable market in Chennai. Health workers of Tiruchi City Corporation visited the temporary market on Monday night and subjected traders above 50 years of age to COVID-19 test. The traders, with co-morbid conditions such as asthma, sugar, blood pressure (BP) and those taking medicine for heart ailments, were also asked to undergo the test. Blood samples were taken from those who volunteered for the virus test. The swab and blood specimen of about 190 traders were collected. A. Jaganathan, City Health Officer, Tiruchi Corporation, told The Hindu that the traders, who had co-morbidity and health issues, were mainly subjected for the virus test. The samples have been sent to the laboratory at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) for testing and the results were expected within a day. It has also been decided to collect swab and blood samples of all pregnant women and elderly patients, who visited the Urban Primary Health Centres in the city for treatment.

The phone up initiative of calling up women affected by domestic violence earlier was put in place to find out if such offences against them continued and if the trend was on the rise when the prohibitory orders was in place. Law enforcers in Tiruchi Range had taken up domestic violence cases / complaints reported in the last three years from 2017 to March 2020 in which the number of women affected were found to be 14,930.

06 May 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Construction sector takes baby steps||There were indications of revival of activities at construction sites after a hiatus, albeit on a dull scale, as the sector awaits a higher degree of relaxation of restrictions in the district categorised as an Orange Zone. In the absence of bus and train services, labourers from villages in the radius of 10 to 15 km from the city who constitute the workforce for the construction industry have not been able to turn up in full strength as yet. Builders have been told by the district administration that they will have to make arrangements for the stay of the labourers at the construction sites in compliance with the social distancing requirements. “The activities have nevertheless resumed at sites where there are facilities for stay of labourers,” S. Anand, Managing Director, Jeyam Builders, said. Builders have been given permission for one-time movement of labourers from the villages to the work sites. The activities could be resumed partially with less than half the strength of the workforce, Mr. Anand said. The construction activities can be sustained only after restoration of the transport facilities. But not all builders are prepared to take the risk of resuming activities due to the sudden spurt in COVID-19 positive cases in the neighbouring districts of Ariyalur and Perambalur, Babu, a building contractor said. Meanwhile, small industries have received guidelines from the Industries Department for reviving manufacturing activities from May 6. But, proprietors say they have been left high and dry by the government without cash infusion at such a critical juncture. Alongside waiving of interest for the entire duration of the lockdown months, and postponing payment of GST and loan dues to banks, the MSME sector was keenly awaiting announcement of cash grants to revive manufacturing activities. The small industries have been pushed into a precarious situation, R. Ilango, president of Tiruchi District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/construction-sector-takes-baby-steps/article31514445.ece
06 May 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Srirangam flower market to be shifted temporarily||The flower market at Sathara Veedhi in Srirangam would temporarily function from The Boys Higher Secondary School grounds in Srirangam from Thursday. A decision to this effect was arrived at after the flower traders resumed trade at the market since Monday. On finding a heavy rush at the market on Tuesday, senior Revenue, Corporation and police officials held talks with the flower commission agents and traders. As the market had remained closed for nearly a month during the lockdown, the commission agents were anxious to resume operations on Monday. About 1,500 to 2,000 farmers from villages in and around Srirangam such as Ettarai, Koppu, Nachalur, Kallanai and Pachur sell their produce at the flower market every day. About 400 retailers from neighbouring Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Perambalur, Ariyalur and other towns purchase flowers from the market. As the market was not functioning, several floriculture farmers were unable to sell their flowers. “The officials visited the market on Tuesday morning and felt there was too much crowd and wanted some regulation,” said V. Varadharajan, president, Srirangam Flower Dealers Association. Officials led by Srirangam Tahsildar Sridhar and Corporation Assistant Commissioner S.Vaidyanathan held talks with the traders representatives. Following talks, it has been agreed to temporarily shift the market to The Boys Higher Secondary School grounds. “We have also agreed to follow safety norms such as wearing face mask and adhering to social distancing norms,” Mr. Varadharajan said. A Corporation official, when contacted, confirmed the move to shift the market temporarily to a portion of the school grounds. “Since arrangements have to be made for our functioning we will move to the grounds by Thursday,” Mr. Varadharajan said. “We have requested the officials not to insist on closing the market on Saturday and Sundays (as was being done with the temporary retail vegetable markets in the city) as flowers, if left unplucked for two days, would wither and cause heavy loss to the farmers,” Mr. Varadharajan said and hoped that the officials would accede to their demand as a special case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/srirangam-flower-market-to-be-shifted-temporarily/article31514454.ece

It has stocked materials at the project site. “A few activities have begun by engaging a part of labourers and we follow safety norms,” a senior official said on Tuesday. The work, which was apace in the last leg of nearly 70-km stretch, came to a grinding halt when lockdown was announced. The RVNL was electrifying the 228-km mainline section from Villupuram to Thanjavur via Cuddalore, Chidambaram, Mayiladuthurai and Kumbakonam. It had energised two stretches: Villupuram to Cuddalore and Cuddalore to Mayiladuthurai via Chidambaram. The official said the project would be carried out in full-scale as and when all restrictions go and labourers, who had left for their home states, return. There were around 150 labourers at the project site where hand sanitisers and masks have been provided as a safety measure. The labourers were subjected to medical screening using thermal scanners and sensitised to follow social distancing norms. ‘The project would accelerate when more materials required for its execution keep coming from suppliers who were from northern States,’ the official added. The entire project is being executed at a cost of over Rs. 300 crore on this single line.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rvnl-resumes-overhead-electrification-work/article31514451.ece
06 May 2020||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Industries get set to achieve targets||As they get ready to resume production activities, employers and workers of industries on Thuvakkudi-Pudukkudi stretch extending to a few km along the Tiruchi-Thanjavur National Highway are relieved as their two-way movement will not be hindered any more. During the lockdown, passes for inter-district movement are given to applicants after a due process of scrutiny only for three purposes: marriage, death or medical emergency. The Tiruchi district administration took cognisance of predicament of employers in the industrial stretch on Monday and decided to facilitate industrial activities. Many industries undertaking conversion work for BHEL, Tiruchi, have their own materials and they have to re-start the process. They are racing against time to fulfil orders. The objective is to restore jobs to workers based in rural areas, including migrant labourers. Though it is tough to operate under the present circumstances, industries have no other option as it is an opportunity to put machines to use and prevent damage arising from disuse and rust, according to an industrialist. ‘Though the profit margin will be meagre, re-starting production means a lot for industries that have raw materials,’ president of Tiruchi District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association P. Elango said. Cash flow is a problem for many industries for sustaining production activities, he said seeking steps from the State and Central government for processing loads sent by ancillary industries for BHEL’s projects in other States. About 90 vehicles sent from BHEL’s ancillary units are unable to unload at Patratu Thermal Power Station, Ramgarh district, Jharkhand, due to extension of lockdown. NTPC, of which PVUNL is a subsidiary, had awarded Engineering, Procurement and Construction contract of the mega project to Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited. The 2,400 MW project is a joint venture between PVUNL and the Jharkhand Government. Several fabrication units in Tiruchi are pre-occupied with production targets for timely completion of the project. As per the schedule, the first unit of 800 MW capacity, for the mega project, is expected to be commissioned in 2022. The other two units have to be commissioned later within a year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industries-get-set-to-achieve-targets/article31514446.ece

06 May 2020||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Case against villagers for threatening officials||The V. Kalathur police in neighbouring Perambalur district has registered a case against a section of residents of Pasumbalur village for allegedly threatening revenue officials when they went to set up a quarantine facility at the village. The incident took place on May 3 when a revenue team went to the village to set up a quarantine facility at the government high school for a group of persons of the district who had returned from Chennai. Police sources said the revenue team, including Veppanthattai Tahsildar R. Kavitha, had made necessary arrangements at the school to serve as an institutional quarantine. On coming to know of this, a group of villagers reportedly besieged the Tahsildar and the revenue officials. The villagers allegedly abused the team besides threatening them with dire consequences. Attempts by the Tahsildar and the revenue team members to drive home the rationale behind setting up the quarantine facility at the village failed to evoke positive response from the villagers. The villagers also threatened to douse themselves with kerosene and consume poison if the team went ahead with their plan.

06 May 2020||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Tirunelveli Collector holds brainstorming session||Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish on Tuesday held comprehensive discussions with officials and representatives of traders and entrepreneurs on the issue of reopening businesses in the district. Chairing the meeting at the Collectorate here, the Collector said large commercial complexes, supermarkets, teashops, salons, beauty parlours, massage centres, automobile and jewellery showrooms, air-conditioned textile stores, domestic appliances outlets, cabs and autorickshaws would not be allowed to function as per norms. Big industries should apply separately for permission to resume operations. Shops in urban areas would be allowed to function from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., while those in rural areas could start their operations an hour earlier. Restaurants and eateries could allow only ‘takeaways’ as serving food on the premises was strictly prohibited. Construction workers should be allowed to stay at their workplace instead of being ferried to the site everyday. At the same time, there would be no bar on hospitals, pharmacies, agriculture and related businesses, Ms. Shilpa said. Gunasingh Chelladurai, president, Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Tirunelveli, suggested that cement and hardware dealers might be allowed to work twice a week so that aspiring buyers could stock construction material for the next couple of weeks. “It will be a win-win situation for all concerned. While this arrangement will fulfil consumer needs, it will also ensure decent business to the stockist. At the same time, shops functioning for only two days a week will not affect vehicular traffic within the city,” he said. The Collector agreed to the suggestion. On the possibility of opening centrally air-conditioned supermarkets, jewellery and textile showrooms, Ms. Shilpa made it clear that multi-storeyed buildings could not be allowed to reopen as per norms laid down by the government during lockdown. “Though shops with ‘ground plus one’ structure can open and transact business, there should be proper ventilation on the first floor as per the norms,” she pointed out, indicating that prospects for resumption of business were not bright. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order), Tirunelveli City, S. Saravanan said supervisors of liquor shops, which would be opened on May 7, should erect casuarina poles and draw 100 circles to make the crowd line up within them. “The supervisor should ensure that there is no crowding at any point of time.” Although retail vegetable sale went on at Schaffter Higher Secondary School, the wholesale market continued to function from Nainarkulam Market for transporting produce to various destinations including neighbouring Kerala. Fearing that the gathering of a large number of traders at the spot would lead to viral contraction, civic officials sealed the market on Tuesday. When the wholesale traders appealed to the Collector to allow them to continue their business from the same place, Ms. Shilpa told them that they should cooperate with the district administration and shift their shops temporarily to the now deserted new bus-stand at Vaeinthankulam. But traders, who were not in the mood to shift, indefinitely closed the market, which was subsequently sealed by the Corporation.  Partial relief  To open: hospitals, pharmacies, agriculture and related businesses; TASMAC shops (May 7)  Not to open: large commercial complexes, supermarkets, jewellery, textile, automobile showrooms, teashops  Only takeaways: restaurants and eateries  Temporarily shifted: Nainarkulam Market to Vaeinthankulam bus stand||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tirunelveli-collector-holds-brainstorming-session/article31514420.ece
06 May 2020||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Keeping the oath||When an ambulance entered Narikurava Colony in Poonga Nagar near Valliyoor on Sunday evening, the nomads could hardly believe their eyes. Since they pitched their tents in the area, they had not received any medical assistance at the doorstep. No wonder that they were shocked to see a female physician, Jaya Ponraj, getting down from the vehicle and announcing the purpose of her visit: to test pregnant women and others in the colony. A gynecologist and resident of Reddiyarpatti, located on the outskirts of Palayamkottai, Dr. Jaya Ponraj was undeterred by the lack of facilities. Over the years, she had offered similar medical assistance to orphan children, HIV positive patients, transgenders and juvenile offenders. During her two-hour sojourn, she screened women — six of them pregnant — children and babies, courtesy a resident who allowed her the use of his house to check them one by one. The physician’s sense of duty had been triggered by a recent report that she read in The Hindu on the sad plight of babies and children in the colony as their mothers could not afford to buy milk to feed them. “Though the purpose of the visit was to meet the babies and their young mothers, I was happy that I could screen six pregnant women there,” she told The Hindu . “All enjoy good health. Their blood pressure is normal,” she said. She also screened babies, who recently suffered from an upset stomach. “We do not have money to buy milk for our babies, but a group of people sponsored for 28 children for five days. Later, officials distributed milk powder,” the young mothers told her. Realising that that the dairy product was fed to the young ones without diluting it to the desirable level, leading to stomach upset, Dr. Jaya taught them the right way to prepare milk with the powder. She also distributed vitamin tablets and tonic, which brought a smile to their face. “After a newborn died recently in the colony, the pregnant women were apprehensive. Now, the doctor’s visit has given them a lot of confidence and allayed their fears,” said Mary, a resident.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/keeping-the-oath/article31514422.ece

In Tenkasi district, a 54-year-old man from Puliyangudi, which already has 46 positive cases, tested positive. Sources at Melapalayam Government Urban Primary Health Centre, where the naso-pharyngeal swab was taken as sample from the woman, said the patient was asymptomatic. “After a long gap, a woman from Melapalayam tested positive, which means the number of tests in the area, already housing four containment zones, should be increased to identify every positive patient there,” they said. While one more positive case was reported in Virudhunagar district, three patients who recovered from the viral infection were discharged from hospital. The district has 13 active cases now. A person who had sneaked into Tiruthangal from Chennai on May 2 tested positive on Tuesday, said Collector R. Kannan. The district administration has identified 70 persons who had come to the district from various parts of the State without informing authorities. “We identified them through ground-level revenue and police staff. Samples have been taken from them,” the Collector added. A 20-year-old man from Sellur in Madurai tested positive on Tuesday.

06 May 2020||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Hoffer, sniffer dog who kept Mudumalai free of wildlife crime, dies||Sadness pervaded the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) on Tuesday as the beloved sniffer dog, Hoffer, who had played a pivotal role in detecting and preventing wildlife crime in MTR and surrounding forest divisions, died suddenly. The five-year-old dog, a Belgian Malinois, joined the fight against wildlife crime in the tiger reserve in November, 2016. It was donated to the tiger reserve by TRAFFIC, India, an organisation working to prevent the illegal trade in wildlife. Since then, Hoffer, who was a very popular figure among forest staff in the reserve, helped crack a number of crimes and even helped the police find a person who had gone missing inside a forest in Masinagudi. “Hoffer has had a highly distinguished career as a sniffer dog in MTR. He has helped crack a case involving the trade of animal parts in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve, was used to nab sandalwood smugglers in Coimbatore, assisted police during vehicle checks at border checkposts and recently was involved in looking for clues at a wildlife crime scene where two tigers had died under mysterious circumstances,” said K.K. Kaushal, Field Director of MTR. Hoffer had also almost single-handedly helped the police find a person who had wandered into a forest patch in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve in 2018, officials said. N. Rajendran, Forest Range Officer, Theppakadu Range, who had looked after Hoffer for a couple of years, said the dog had fallen sick and needed veterinary treatment a couple of years ago for a liver problem. “I got a call in the morning from another ranger who was taking care of Hoffer, and we both immediately tried to take him to the veterinarian. Unfortunately, Hoffer passed away on Tuesday morning despite our best efforts,” said Mr. Rajendran, who added that the guard and watcher who handled Hoffer, Vadivelu and Sivakumar, were heartbroken at the sudden death of the animal. A postmortem was done to ascertain the cause of death, and officials said that it seemed likely that Hoffer died from liver failure. Forest department staff buried Hoffer in a small grave near to the kennel where he lived for most of his life. The beloved sniffer dog was given a guard of honour as he was laid to rest in the tiger reserve he spent his life protecting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hoffer-sniffer-dog-who-kept-mudumalai-free-of-wildlife-crime-dies/article31514194.ece

Collector R. Kannan said the focus was on social distancing and safety of workers and to contain spread of the viral infection. The district administration, while allowing some sectors to work with restrictions, continued the ban on other commercial establishments. “Some big industrial units were wary of starting work as ensuring social distancing can pose a big issue. Hence they have said they will wait before taking a final call on resuming work,” an official said. According to the Collector, the units had been advised to adopt segmentation so that one batch of workers did not have any chance of meeting others. “This way, if one person in a batch is infected, instead of sealing the entire unit, the particular segment can be disinfected and work can continue in others with a different batch.” Some of the industrial units had also proposed to start work with only local workers, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/major-industries-in-virudhunagar-district-allowed-to-resume-work-from-today/article31514424.ece
06 May 2020||May 06 2020 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||The role of palliative care||How can palliative care help when the world is reeling under this most unexpected and unprecedented pandemic, COVID-19? Palliative care is part and parcel of treatment for any patient for any disease at any stage, for any age. It is simply a ‘whole person’ approach to improving health in any patient. To allay fears and anxieties in patients and families alongside treatment of any illness is not something new in the medical profession. A 16th century aphorism describes the duty of every physician: “To cure sometimes, to relieve often, to comfort always”. The literal meaning of the word ‘palliate’ is ‘to alleviate pain — physical and emotional’, meaning, relief of suffering. ‘Suffering’ literally means ‘the state of undergoing pain, distress, or hardship’. Social suffering COVID-19, because of its unique nature and magnitude has brought in its wake, not only physical illness, but more of emotional and social suffering — fear, anxiety, uncertainty, loss of loved ones and social distress such as losing jobs and income, inability to move freely to work and other places, frustrations, staying long hours at home and other hardships, all leading to psychological disturbances for many. ‘Palliative Medicine’ is a medical specialty, which involves the treatment of pain, breathing difficulty and other distressing physical symptoms caused by chronic and life-limiting diseases and also addressing the psychological issues of both patient and family, with the sole aim of improving quality of life. It is most beneficial when started early in the disease trajectory. It is also a form of supportive care, giving that extra layer of support a patient needs, to alleviate suffering, alongside disease treatment even in acute illness. In the present scenario, in addition to what physicians are toiling with to cure patients, and the government and health care policies and strategies, palliative care can play a supportive role. The care may be needed right from the time of diagnosis, during treatment of the disease or when treatment does not help anymore to cure. Supportive role Distressing physical symptoms like pain, breathing difficulty, restlessness (delirium) and others can be well relieved or palliated with medicines in consultation with the specialists. Similarly, skilled counselling is an integral part of the palliative approach. It helps address the psychological, social and spiritual issues, which both patient and family are experiencing in the present scenario. There is a way of responding to their fears, anxieties and to questions. They rarely need antidepressants when we acknowledge their emotions as normal. Active listening is by far the most important part of counselling. Taking a nonjudgmental attitude without assuming or being philosophical, teaching them special skills in coping with the situation, with the illness or death of a loved one, but always maintaining hope are some basic aspects of communication skills. These skills can be availed of from psychologists, specialists in palliative medicine, as well as those from medical organisations who have the expertise and willingness to render their services. Common thread Palliative care is really the essence of all good medical care. It is the reinstatement of the humane aspects of medical care and is complementary to all medical specialties, a common thread running through the total care of all patients. Anyone who needs help to overcome their psychological issues can avail of this care by contacting us, lakshmipaincare@gmail.com. We can also put you onto experts who are willing to offer their time and service.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/the-role-of-palliative-care/article31514145.ece

06 May 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Mob ransacks hospital after motorist succumbs to injuries||A day after liquor sale was permitted in the city, a mob vandalised a private hospital in Jigani, Anekal taluk, and roughed up a doctor alleging that negligence on the part of the medical staff led to the death of an accident victim who had been admitted late Monday night. According to the complainant, Dr. Jagadish Hiremath, the men who were on a two-wheeler, were under the influence of alcohol. The police said three people were riding triple on the two-wheeler. The police are waiting for the postmortem report. After examining the trio, the duty doctor informed the relatives that one of the patients had critical head injuries. “He told the relatives that the patient needed to be shifted to a bigger hospital which has a 24/7 neuro care facility. However, the family refused citing financial problems,” said a police officer. Around 4 a.m. on Tuesday, the condition of the patient deteriorated, following which the doctor on duty personally took him to a bigger private hospital. Doctors at the hospital declared him brought dead. Around 5.30 a.m., a violent mob barged into the hospital at Jigani, ransacked the premises and manhandled the doctors. The situation was brought under control after the police dispersed the crowd. Based on a complaint filed by Dr. Jagadish Hiremath, the Jigani police have taken up a case. The condition of the two other patients is critical. They are under observation. In a series of tweets, Dr. Hiremath demanded strict action. “These people who binged on alcohol and then rode triple met with an accident and sustained severe head injuries but refused to go to a centre where a neurosurgeon is available round the clock...They now beat up our doctors who did their best to save him. I want police to book them under new laws,” he said in one of the tweets. He went on to explain that the hospital had admitted them as they claimed they did not have money. “I want them to be booked under all relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mob-ransacks-hospital-after-motorist-succumbs-to-injuries/article31514091.ece
06 May 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Migrant workers flock to BIEC only to be sent back home||For the last two days, Bola Yadav, a construction labourer from Bihar, and five of his friends who hail from the same village, have been visiting stations across the city trying to catch that elusive train that will take them home. On Tuesday afternoon, they landed outside the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC) on Tumakuru Road, where nearly 2,000 migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are being housed, but were caned by the police and chased away. All five had registered on the Karnataka government’s Seva Sindhu, an online platform coordinating migrants’ journey home, but they are yet to get a clear response on when they can go back home. “We have made at least two trips to railway stations in Majestic, Yeshwantpur, and Chikkabanavara. Then someone said migrants are being sheltered at the exhibition centre, so we came here. We have already spent over Rs. 1,000 running around the city and don’t have any food or money left,” he said. Vikram Prasad Gupta, a painter hailing from Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, said he has been on the road for two days with no food. “I have had enough of the city and the uncertainty over meals and now I want to go back to my village. I won’t come back until everything is normal,” he said.  The Hindu met hundreds of such labourers, carrying heavy luggage and making arduous journeys mostly on foot from one railway station to another. Most of them were armed with a printout of their registration on the Seva Sindhu portal, demanding a seat on a train. What none of them realise is that registering on Seva Sindhu does not guarantee them a train ticket. “Nodal officers appointed in each State will coordinate with Indian Railways and respective State governments, and organise a train that can carry only 1,021 passengers. When a train is organised, a set number of people registered on Seva Sindhu will get a text message on their phones with the details. Only they have to report to the station,” explained N. Manjunath Prasad, nodal officer for inter-State travel from the State. However, a majority of the migrant labourers who have registered on the portal are not tech savvy enough to understand or follow this procedure. And most have lost their patience. “We have been locked up for over a month now. Our families back home are concerned. The Union government has announced trains and we should be allowed to go home,” said Ganesh Kumar from Samastipur, Bihar. This miscommunication and desperation to go home not only led to large groups of migrant labourers on the streets — often without maintaining social distancing — braving caning by the police, but also stone pelting and violence against the police, near BIEC on Monday night. “I learnt there was some tension and rushed to the spot. Even as I was trying to reason with them, the crowd got violent and I was hit by a stone on my head,” said Mudduraju, Inspector, Peenya. “The labourers wanted to be on a train and were not ready to listen to us that the trains were yet to be organised and they should come only after they get a text message,” said a senior official at the spot. Revenue Minister R. Ashok and Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao had a tough time convincing them to return home. They were sent back to their accommodations in the city through BMTC buses organised for the purpose. A similar group of labourers from two construction sites at Attibele and Sarjapur congregated at Hudson Circle on Monday night. “They came to Majestic under the impression that there were trains to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

One of them was a 62-year-old woman from Vijayapura, a known case of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and BA (bronchial asthma) admitted on May 3 in the ICU of a designated hospital. The second was a 50-year-old woman from Davangere, a SARI case admitted with thecomplaint of breathlessness. Both women died of cardiac arrest, said Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar. As many as 22 new cases were reported, taking the total number of positive cases to 673. While the condition of 306 patients is stable, six are in ICU, the Minister said. The new cases include 12 from Davangere, three from Bengaluru Urban, two from Bagalkot, and one each from Ballari, Dakshina Kannada, Uttara Kannada, Haveri, and Dharwad. Davangere and Haveri have now become a cause for concern as they were in the orange and green zones, respectively. In terms of positive cases, Karnataka, which was in third place in March, is now in 13th place. At 3.13%, the average Compounded Growth Rate of positive cases in the State is lower than the national average of 5.97%, the Minister said. The three cases in Bengaluru Urban include a 30-year-old pregnant woman and a 34-year-old man, a contact of P-420 and a housekeeping staff member of a hotel in Shivajinagar.

06 May 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Labourers on the edge as depts. struggle with cohesion||It is like being caught between a rock and a hard place, says Suraj (name changed), a native of West Bengal who has been working for Bengaluru’s Namma Metro project. He is among around 500 migrant workers still at the metro workers’ colony in Bommanahalli, which was recently a site of unrest and violence. While the workers claimed that they were only trying to draw media attention to their plight in the colony when the police started caning them, the police said they were trying to maintain social distancing. With relaxations in place, those like Suraj can get back to work. But he points to the irony — social distancing is not easy to follow at the colony or at workplace. It is for those who have “comfortable indoor jobs,” he says. Thousands of migrant workers in the city, indispensable and yet invisible, have been ruled by fear of the disease, frustration from being away from family, cooped up in workers’ colonies and camps, and anxious over their present and future. But what many want now is to be in the safety of their homes. “Yes, we don’t have many job opportunities there. But there is no one here to take care of us even if we fall sick,” says Suraj. The city has been witnessing incidents of violence among migrant workers in the last few days, and lack of coordination among different departments is being blamed as much as the failure of employers to pay pending dues and provide them with liveable environments. Monday’s incident, which left a police officer injured, exposed the chinks in the know-how of handling the influx of workers eager to go home, catching multiple departments off guard. “The problem is that there is no clarity and everyone is putting the responsibility on the police,” a police officer said, referring to the incident where a huge crowd of around 6,000 workers thronged Bannappa park based on a rumour that trains are ready to ferry them to their native places. This, when the Karnataka government is yet to get approval from its counterparts. “These workers have been rendered jobless, without proper food and essentials during the lockdown, and are frustrated and want to return home. Added to this are pending dues. Though senior IAS and IPS officers have been assigned as nodal officers, there is no plan and they are depending on the local police for information and guidance,” a police officer alleged, adding that multiple departments need to have a plan of action with details of labour camps. Approval awaited  One of the nodal officers appointed by the government to coordinate with other States said States were yet to give approval for migrants to return from Karnataka. “It is a sensitive and complex issue. We are contacting people who are to be sent. If people have to go there, the incoming State has to approve that. Post that, transport has to be arranged, and once they reach the destination, the SOP of screening and quarantine needs to be followed. All this, while maintaining social distancing,” the officer said. “We understand their pain and agony. So we try and prioritise cases. People need to understand that even if they manage to board a train without following procedure, they can get turned back from that State,” the officer said, urging workers to use the Seva Sindhu facility, and appealed to NGOs to help them utilise it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/labourers-on-the-edge-as-depts-struggle-with-cohesion/article31514105.ece
06 May 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Peak holiday season gone bust, tourism industry struggles||The forced break on account of COVID-19 has been anything but a holiday for those who would have otherwise been ticking off another place from their bucket list. Some people been reminiscing of past holidays on social media. But for the tourism industry, the outbreak has dealt a blow that many say is a never-before phenomenon. The traditional summer vacation — the longest holiday period for many because of the academic calendar in India — has been thrown out of gear and the industry is at a loss over how to mitigate the crisis. The Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism and Hospitality (FAITH), which consists of national associations representing the tourism, travel and hospitality industries in the country, has said that the inter-State domestic season, almost 60% of which happens in the April to July period, has collapsed. In addition, India’s top-performing foreign source markets for tourism — the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, China, Japan, Singapore, Russia, Italy, and Spain — have been severely impacted by COVID-19 and people from there are unlikely to travel before the next financial year. With reduced connectivity and stringent travel restrictions likely for the rest of year, things are unlikely to pick up, the federation says. It has appealed to Chief Ministers to come up with State-specific packages, apart from waivers in utility charges, GST and other cess. A JLL India report pointed out that as on April 10, over 60% of branded hotels across various segments were shut. It stated that many hotels across India were functioning on gross operating losses. However, not left with too many options now, the likes of MakeMyTrip have started offering plans to travellers to pay now and visit later. But Sanjar Imam, president, Karnataka Tourism Forum, said the sector was the first to shut down and would be the last to be revived. Another question is how many people will be willing to travel once the lockdown ends. “People will not make investments now, no matter how lucrative. The thing with a pandemic is that nobody has the answers right now, not until a vaccine is found. But not everyone is going to stay locked down till next year either. Some people who are frustrated will want to travel,” he said. The sector expects major shifts when this happens, including a preference for domestic and short-distance travel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/peak-holiday-season-gone-bust-tourism-industry-struggles/article31514088.ece
06 May 2020||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||CM consults builders over reverse migration||The State government is now concerned about the shortage of workforce coming in the way of resuming commercial and industrial activities, particularly construction activities, as a large number of migrant workers are returning to their native places from Bengaluru. As a few thousands of workers left Bengaluru in the last three days, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Tuesday held a meeting with prominent builders in Bengaluru in a bid to involve them in the process of preventing reverse migration. The Chief Minister emphasised the need to prevent “unnecessary” exodus as activities such as building construction and industrial operations were about to begin. ‘Under control’ He said that COVID-19 was under control in Karnataka compared to many other States. In this background, the State government was keen to restart various economic activities, he said. He said there was a need to prevent unnecessary travel of workers who were leaving owing to rumours and speculation. The Minister concerned has been told to convince such workers to stay back, he said. Responding to this, builders told the Chief Minister that they had already begun construction activities and that they had extended various facilities, including accommodation to workers, a release from the Chief Minister’s office said. Builders’ take Meanwhile, CREDAI president Kishore Jain told The Hindu that return of the workers may affect the industries. “It is better if the workforce stays back as it would help both the construction sector as well as themselves.” Mr. Jain, who attended the meeting, said it may take about a week for the construction sector to gain momentum. He said the builders too would play their role in trying to convince the workers about the advantages of staying back. Meanwhile, the Chief Minister also held consultations with stakeholders on the problems being faced by weavers. A decision on measures to be initiated to help weavers would be taken after consulting the Finance Department officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-consults-builders-over-reverse-migration/article31514109.ece
06 May 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||State to continue cooked food supply||As Karnataka is grappling with the crisis of migrant workers from outside the State wishing to go back home, the government has decided to continue distribution of cooked food for a few more days. Simultaneously, it has started distribution of two lakh dry ration kits to construction workers. The cooked food distribution that was to end on Monday was continued on Tuesday even as the demand has come down by at least 30%, sources said. Decline in demand is attributed to migrant workers from North Karnataka returning to their villages in hordes over the last few days. The return of North Indian workers, in batches, has also reduced the numbers. Since April 5, the Labour Department has distributed over 35 lakh food packets to about 1.5 lakh migrant workers stuck in labour colonies. “Currently, about one lakh people are getting food twice a day. The decision to continue with food distribution is going to help those still in camps without work,” sources said. Earlier this week, Labour Department had written to BBMP that it would stop distribution of cooked food after Monday as the Karnataka Construction Workers’ Welfare Board, which was footing the bill, had decided to distribute dry ration packets to migrant workers. Sources said that the demand for cooked food packets had been coming down as relaxation of lockdown norms has led to labourers going out in search of work. “We do not find many in the earlier designated places and some are calling volunteers stating that they do not want food. But food is not going waste,” sources said. Traffic causes delay Meanwhile, volunteers distributing cooked food packets to migrant workers in designated places at ward levels are now facing a peculiar situation with increased traffic since Monday. Sources said that the point-to-point movement for distribution of food that was happening easily due to lockdown norms earlier has been hampered since Monday as traffic has increased, causing delay in dropping off food packets.   Demand for cooked food down by at least 30%, say sources Decline is attributed to migrant workers from NK returning to their villages in hordes||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-to-continue-cooked-food-supply/article31514110.ece

In a notification issued on Tuesday, the Finance Department said that the additional instalments of DA, with effect from January 1, payable to State government employees and pensioners, including employees and pensioners on UGC/ICAR/AICTE/NJPC scales of pay, would not be paid.The additional instalments due from July 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021, will also not be released until further orders, it said. However, the notification made it clear that DA would continue to be paid at the existing rates. As and when the decision to release the future instalment of DA due from July 1, 2021 is taken by the government of India, the applicable rates of DA effective from January 1, 2020, and July 1 and January 1, 2021, will be restored prospectively and will be subsumed in the cumulative revised rate effective from July 1, 2021. Employees and pensioners are not entitled to arrears of DA from January 1, 2020, till June 30, 2021, the order said. This will apply to full-time government employees, zilla panchayat employees, work-charged employees on regular time scales of pay, and full-time employees of aided educational institutions and universities who are on regular time scales of pay.

06 May 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC: Ensure smooth movement of workers||The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday directed the State government to ensure that the entire process of movement of migrant workers, who want to leave for their home town, is conducted smoothly adhering to social distancing norms. A special Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice B.V. Nagarathna issued the direction after noticing that migrant labourers are grouping up at several parts due to absence of clarity on the transport availabile to reach railway station in the city. The Bench also directed the government to inform that in what manner migrants, going out of State, and shifting from different districts to their home-districts were being facilitated, their registration and the policy on cost of their travel. The government has also been directed to submit details on whether migrant workers sent to their home districts from different districts within the State are being subject to screening for COVID-19 as not taking sufficient care could turn “green zones” into “red zones.” As it is not mandatory for migrant workers to travel back to their home States, the Bench said it is the duty of the State government to provide food, cooked or dry ration, for some more time to such migrants who are staying back in the State. Earlier, counsel for All India Central Council of Trade Unions and the People’s Union for Civil Liberties pointed out that hundreds of migrant workers were stranded at BIEC due to lack of information on travel mode available to go to their States. Metro workers Meanwhile, the Bench directed BMRCL to inform whether the workers engaged in metro rail project are being paid by the contractors and whether those who want to go back to their States are being allowed go.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-ensure-smooth-movement-of-workers/article31514106.ece
06 May 2020||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘State, Centre confusing people with lockdown orders’||Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah on Tuesday accused the State and Union governments of messing up the situation on lockdown norms and its relaxation by issuing a series of confusing orders almost on a daily basis. Addressing mediapersons here, he alleged that such orders had left the people bewildered. He also accused the State government of behaving in an “inhuman manner” over the migrant workers issue. He expressed anguish over the State government making migrant workers, who are keen to return to their native districts, walk all the way from Kempe Gowda bus stand to Palace Grounds and then to Peenya. “The scene of women and children walking all the way with their luggages brings tears to anybody’s eyes. I wonder if this government has a heart,” he said. Mr. Siddaramaiah urged the government to earmark dedicated places for migrant workers to board the buses. Taking serious exception to the Centre asking States to share the train travel cost of migrant labourers, he demanded that the Centre should bear the entire fare. He wondered why the government that wastes no time in making arrangements to fly people from foreign countries, becomes indifferent when it comes to protecting the interests of migrant workers. Claiming that industrialists and businessmen from the State had contributed nearly Rs. 1,500 crore to the PM-CARE Fund, he wondered why the Centre was hesitating to use it for the travel of migrant workers. Mr. Siddaramaiah also urged the State government to provide employment to all migrant workers, who return to their native districts, under MNREGA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-centre-confusing-people-with-lockdown-orders/article31514107.ece
06 May 2020||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Those leaving State pay for train ticket||A train with over a thousand passengers — mostly migrant labourers — left for Lucknow from the city on Tuesday evening. They had to cough up Rs. 1,000 per ticket for the journey. The money was collected by the police officials and tickets booked. This is contrary to claims that the Centre and the State government would bear the ticket costs. Maneesh Yadav, 26, a painter, was happy that he finally found a place on the train home. “I raised a loan from three of my friends for the ticket,” he said. Indian Railways had also said the State governments can either pay the consolidated cost of the trip or collect it from passengers. The Karnataka government seems to have decided to collect the fares. ‘No decision’ “We neither have any directions from the Union government nor has there been a decision to this effect in the State government. In that scenario, the passengers have to pay,” said N. Manjunath Prasad, nodal officer for inter-State travel from Karnataka. This comes days after the State government was forced to make intra-State travel for migrants free, after Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee offered to pay Rs. 1 crore towards the cost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/those-leaving-state-pay-for-train-ticket/article31514103.ece

06 May 2020||Hubballi/Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||College employees in a fix||The order of the Director of Collegiate Education asking the teaching and non-teaching staff of government and private colleges to report to duty amid the lockdown has put the education fraternity in a quandary as the ‘sudden’ order has thrown up various practical problems. The main problem is of conveyance, in the absence of public transport from different places to the institutions daily. An assistant professor in a government college in Anekal, Bengaluru, said that she had to hire a car to reach work everyday. “We cannot even share our rides and rates are exuberant. It is unfair to ask to people to come to work in the absence of public transport,” she said. T.M. Manjunatha, president, Karnataka Government College Teachers’ Association, while welcoming the move of the department to resume work on campuses, said that the government should exempt those who need to report to work but were stranded in their native places and those who travel from other districts. The unanswered question is whether the normal quarantine rules apply to them if they make inter-district travel to report to duty. The president of the Akkamahadevi Women’s University College Teachers’ Association Lingaraj Angadi said, “My institution is located in the containment zone of Hubballi. I have to plead with the police to allow me in.” Karnataka Rajya Mahavidyalaya Shikshaka Sangha has written to Commissioner of Collegiate Education on the issue seeking exemption for the teachers from attending college duties as the lockdown had been extended. Raghu Akmanchi, president of the sangha said, “We are already working from home conducting online classes for our students. But our presence will be of no use unless students are allowed to come to college.” Taking exception to the move, former Primary and Secondary Education Minister Basavaraj Horatti has urged Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, who also holds the Higher Education portfolio, to intervene and sort out the issue. Mr. Horatti has written a detailed letter elaborating the various practical problems including inter-district and inter-State travel, different academic calendars, health risks, and related issues. VTU resumes work Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), has commenced work with 33% of the staff being asked to come to work on a rotation basis at all VTU Regional Centers and government engineering colleges across the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/college-employees-in-a-fix/article31514095.ece

Chaos prevailed at Bangra Kulur from where the corporation operated its buses from Mangaluru to North Karnataka districts. Sources said that the district administration had asked the corporation to operate services from its Bejai terminal itself. However, KSRTC said that such a measure would result in chaos and instead, suggested the open space at Bangra Kulur from where it could run these special services. Neither was there any registration of workers nor any identification. Everyone, including workers, students and the general public, thronged the boarding points and the corporation had no choice but to ferry them, the sources noted.

According to V. Karikalan, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Dakshina Kannada, the bison had been spotted near Kudroli area in the city first, at 5.30 a.m. Later, it moved towards the Air India office at Hat Hill and to Lalbagh area after 10 a.m. It was tranquilised near Mangala Stadium area by afternoon. A team of 30 to 40 people, including those from the Forest Department, loaded it on to a vehicle using a crane so that it could be shifted to the ghats. Another official from the department told The Hindu that the animal stood in the forest for some time after it was released in the Charmadi Ghat section. Later, it collapsed there and died. The bison, aged between eight and 10 years, might have come to the city from the Bajpe area on the outskirts, the DCF said. Forest Department officials on Tuesday also rescued a leopard that was caught in a snare on the outskirts of the city. It was tranquilised and later released in the Western Ghats. The DCF said that the leopard, about seven years old, had been found roaming in the MRPL area for the past the few days.

06 May 2020||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Constable tests positive, visits Chamarajanagar||The district administration of Chamarajanagar — which has been a green zone so far — went into a tizzy after it realised that a head constable from Bengaluru, who visited his in-laws’ house in Belathuru village of Hanur taluk in the district on Monday, had tested positive for COVID-19. After giving a sample of his swab for the random tests conducted among police personnel in Bengaluru, but before the results were announced, the head constable, attached to Begur police station, left for Belathuru, situated around 5 km from Hanur, early on Monday. He went with his wife and daughter in his private car. “He reached Belathuru by 10.15 a.m. But the same evening, he received a call from Bengaluru informing him that he had tested positive for COVID-19. Immediately, he rushed back to Bengaluru with his wife and daughter,” said a district official. Chamarajanagar has not reported even a single COVID-19 case so far. The district administration moved swiftly and by Tuesday evening a total of 18 persons were taken into institutional quarantine at the B.R. Ambedkar Bhavan in Chamarajanagar town. Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi, who briefed reporters on Tuesday, said he has written to the Director-General of Police in Bengaluru seeking action against the policeman for allegedly violating quarantine. Mr. Ravi argued that police personnel tested for COVID-19 should have self-quarantined till the results came out. It was not immediately known whether the head constable, who was on leave, had obtained a pass to travel from Bengaluru to Chamarajanagar. “But he had flashed his identity card at the check-post to pass through,” an official said. The head constable had taken the highway passing through Sathegalla check-post. The Chamarajanagar administration will be quarantining all the personnel who were manning the check-post on Monday. All those in the house of the head constable’s in-laws, besides the neighbours who had come in contact with him, have been quarantined. While four of them are aged below 10, at least three are 60 or more.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/constable-tests-positive-visits-chamarajanagar/article31514113.ece

06 May 2020||Vijayapura,KARNATAKA||Life getting back to normal in Vijayapura||After the State government announced certain relaxations for Orange zone, which includes Vijayapura, life is gradually returning to normal with several standalone and neighbourhood shops resuming business. Roads which were looking almost empty in the last one-and-a-half months have now come back to life with people moving and coming out of their homes, primarily for shopping. Many, mainly small shop owners, who had lost a good deal of business owing to lockdown, are now heaving a sigh of relief as they are now able to do some business. “Unlike big shops that have higher earnings, people like us have limited earnings thus limited savings. Life had become tough as we were running out of savings, but I could now hope for earnings,” said Mahesh Gadale, a small garment shop owner. Since wearing mask when going out has been made mandatory, everyone was seen with them in the main market at M.G. Circle. Residents of different colonies of the city who had voluntarily put up barricades in their localities to prevent mass movement of people removed them to allow vehicle movement. The Traffic Police re-started traffic signal lights which had been stopped during strict lockdown. While a majority of services have re-started, the restrictions continued to be in place in the containment zone of the city from where most of the COVID-19 cases have been reported. Meanwhile, services of autorickshaws and public transport buses remained suspended.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/life-getting-back-to-normal-in-vijayapura/article31514267.ece

A senior official of the Excise Department said, “The government had given permission for the MSIL to operate 1,363 shops in the State, of which 815 are already open. The remaining shops can open after assessing their requirements. The Deputy Commissioners will give the final approval.” Excise Minister H. Nagesh told the media that, at present, four MSIL shops are functioning in each assembly constituency. In future, measures will be taken to open more shops after examining the requirements. The government has also decided that the local MLA’s consent is not required; the rule on seeking consent of an MLA was withdrawn a fortnight ago. Long queues The higher price of Indian Made Liquor, which came into effect on Tuesday, did little to stem the tide of people queuing up outside shops. Prasanth, a resident of Yelahanka New Town, said, “On Monday evening, I got in a line to purchase liquor. Around 6 p.m., the police asked people to leave and instructed shop owners to shut the door. So, I went back on Tuesday.” Some of the queues were longer than usual as store owners were not allowing customers inside, but had instead placed a counter near the door. In the Central Business District, people were seen braving the heat to purchase liquor. As announced by the Excise Department, customers had to pay 6% more for IML Excise Department officials estimate the number of people queueing up on Tuesday was less than that of Monday. “After an incident of a liquor store selling alcohol worth more than Rs. 52,800 to a buyer had gone viral on social media, strict instructions have been given to shops to sell liquor to customers within limits,” said a senior excise official. He added that a case has been registered with local excise officials. The shop owner has claimed that he sold the liquor to eight customers, but generated a single bill. Retailers stock up Anticipating higher sales, liquor shops across the State procured stock worth Rs. 197 crore from depots of Karnataka State Beverages Corporation Limited (KSBCL). An official of the Excise Department said that a total of 36.37 lakh litres of Indian Made liquor (IML) and 7.02 lakh litres of beer were procured by retailers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/more-msil-liquor-shops-on-the-cards/article31514092.ece

This case has come as a surprise to the BBMP, as the woman is not a resident of any containment zone. Neither does she nor her husband have any travel history. According to a senior BBMP official, the woman went for a routine check-up to a private maternity hospital in Jayanagar. With swab testing for COVID-19 being mandatory, samples were taken. “She tested positive, though she had no symptoms,” the official said and added that she had been shifted to Victoria hospital. To be completely sure, another sample was collected and will be tested at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases. Meanwhile, BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar, in a video message to the media, said that there was no plan to declare Shivajinagar ward as a containment zone after a housekeeping staff of Regenta Place tested positive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pregnant-woman-tests-positive/article31514087.ece

The decision was taken at a meeting held on Tuesday by District Collector T.V. Subhash, who is also chairman of the DDMA. While those stranded in other States have begun returning since Monday, those from abroad are expected to arrive from May 7 onwards. The DDMA decided that they would be admitted to the State after proper checks at entry points. Those with COVID-19 symptoms will be sent directly to hospitals and others will be directed to be in home quarantine. Those who cannot be quarantined in homes will be provided quarantine facilities in government-run COVID-19 care centres. A sticker with the message ‘This house is under the protection of the district administration’ will be affixed on houses where people are in home quarantine. The ‘Lock the house’ method aims to discourage unwanted visitors and to prevent those in quarantine from leaving the house. There would also be checks to ensure that quarantine conditions and Health Department’s instructions are complied with, said the Collector. Mr. Subhash said the district would implement a two-tier surveillance system led by Janatha Samithis and the police. Those who violate quarantine conditions would be transferred to COVID-19 care centres, he said. District panchayat president K.V. Sumesh, District Police Chief Yathish Chandra, Sub Collectors Asif K.

A communication from the district administration said here on Tuesday the Kochi airport and the sea port were getting ready to receive the returnees in a few days. Sources at the Cochin Port Trust said the administration had not received any schedule of arrivals but was ready to render services needed to make the flow of passengers smooth. The district administration is also gearing up to receive those who arrive by train once the rail passenger services are restored. The aspects being looked into also include quarantine requirements for returnees. A meeting chaired by District Collector S. Suhas evaluated the progress of preparations. In the first phase, there will be 10 flights bringing 2,150 passengers. Two-hundred passengers each will arrive on May 7 from Abu Dhabi and Doha; there will be 200 passengers arriving from Bahrain on May 8. This will be followed by 200 passengers from Kuwait and 250 from Muscat on May 9. There will be 250 passengers arriving from Kuala Lumpur on May 10. This will be followed by 200 passengers arriving on the following day from Dammam and Dubai. Another 250 passengers will arrive from Kuala Lumpur on May 12 and 200 will arrive from Jeddah on May 13. Disinfection work The passenger flow will be controlled in keeping with social distancing norms at arrival and exit points. Three-phased disinfection work is on at the airport now. Drills for testing different systems are complete. Apart from the temperature guns to read the temperature of passengers, the process of installing thermal scanners at the arrival points is on. The synthetic/textile wrapped furniture has been replaced with temporary plastic chairs. The timing of the arrival of flights would be intimated later, said a communication from the airport.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ernakulam-gears-up-to-receive-norks/article31514347.ece
06 May 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Panel suggests controlled release of dam waters||Flood control measures should be included in the operational policy of all reservoirs in the wake of the 2018 and 2019 floods, suggests an expert committee headed by K.P. Sudheer, Executive Vice President, Kerala State Council for Science Technology and Environment, which studied the extreme heavy rainfall events and subsequent floods and landslides in the State. The panel suggests controlled release of dam water at least once in two or three years into rivers to demarcate their natural channel boundary. The reservoirs are operated on the policy that no spilling of water over the spillways will be permitted until the water level reaches the full reservoir level. In case of floods, the policy followed till 2018 was to release flood water by following the principle that the volume of water released shall not exceed the inflow. Ban on construction The panel proposes a ban on constructions in the floodways of rivers to allow the free flow of floodwaters. In flood-fringe areas, only regulated constructions may be permitted. No construction shall be allowed in the buffer zones of rivers, which shall be at a distance from 50 metres to 100 metres. It was the oversaturation of soil that triggered landslides during the extreme rain events (ERE) in August 2018 and 2019. Landslides Generally, steep areas with more than 33% slope are vulnerable to landslide and the majority of landslides recorded during the last two years occurred in these terrains. Idukki experienced the maximum number of landslides (977) in the year 2018. Agricultural expansion and water conservation such as terracing, blocking/diversion of storm water channels and alteration of natural vegetation pattern in steep slopes have amplified the landslide susceptibility, especially at Kavalappara, Pathar and Puthumala. Soil piping too triggered landslips, especially in north Kerala. Kerala should increase the network density of rain gauges by putting up at least 500 automatic rain gauges on priority in regions receiving high-intensity rainfall in short time periods. Half the number of instruments shall be in the highlands. Considering the instability of the slopes and their vulnerability to landslips, the panel suggests preventive measures, including slope stabilisation. Curbs Cutting and levelling of land for construction of houses in regions of slopes of more than 25% inclination and a slope length exceeding 100 metres shall not be allowed. Diversion or blocking of stream channels in the upper slopes and ponding of water in the sloping sections over a 25% slope shall not be permitted. Regional extreme rain events and flood forecast system using Artificial Intelligence shall be put in place to predict flash floods and to trigger an advance warning system, it suggests.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/panel-suggests-controlled-release-of-dam-waters/article31514371.ece
06 May 2020||KOCHI,KERALA||Nod for integrated waste management||The government has approved an Integrated Solid Waste Management Strategy for the State recommending the formation of clusters of local bodies for setting up regional-level integrated solid waste management facilities. The development of regional cluster facilities has been proposed as a solution to the non-availability of land for disposal of solid waste experienced by several local bodies. Study The government will commission a study for developing the clusters of local bodies for regional-level integrated solid waste management facilities after forming a stakeholder group, says a strategy document published by the Department of Local-Self Government on May 1. The vision document states that the government would own the identified land for the regional facilities (for treatment and disposal or for disposal alone). The Sanitation Mission, which would coordinate the activities related to the solid waste management, will be empowered to develop regional-level cluster facilities in the public-private-partnership mode. The document points out that the government would find external sources of funds, especially grant funds, to make bigger projects possible. The local bodies may levy user fee for waste management services from households and business establishments. The strategy document suggests implementation of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) to promote resource efficiency and sustainable consumption by producers, brand owners, importers and manufacturers of plastic products and packaging as a solution to reduce plastic menace. The government shall prepare a policy for plastic waste management. Local bodies lacking land for disposal of non-biodegradable waste can approach the agency appointed by the government to develop a regional or cluster landfill facility. It shall serve the local self-governments that have participated in its establishment and whose waste quantities have been considered in the design of the facility. These facilities shall be owned by the Department of Local Self-Government and operated by the State-level agency or a contractor. Authorisation On the management of construction and demolition waste, the document suggested that all building construction or renovation or demolition activity shall need prior authorisation. The authorisation request shall be accompanied with information on estimated quantities of construction or demolition waste generation, estimated timeline, contractors or agents who shall be appointed for picking up the materials and strategies for reuse, recycle, and/or disposal, the document says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nod-for-integrated-waste-management/article31514369.ece

Eco Power Pvt Ltd. to set up a waste-to-energy plant at Brahmapuram, the corporation would request the government to make alternative arrangements to ensure that plans to treat waste in the district are not jeopardised. Besides the corporation, five municipalities and three panchayats in the district would depend on the plant to treat waste, Mayor Soumini Jain said at a council meeting held to discuss the matter on Thursday. Irrespective of the company implementing it, a waste-to-energy plant would have to come up at Brahmapuram and the corporation’s steering committee, along with the Leader of the Opposition, would meet the Chief Minister to ensure that immediate action is taken by the government, Ms. Jain said. A notice has already been sent to the company to initiate the process of cancelling the agreement, said Corporation Secretary Anu R. S. According to the agreement signed with the company in 2016, the company was required to produce a financial plan and demonstrate financial closure within 150 days of signing the agreement. The government order issued by the Local Self-Government Department (LSGD) last week had itself pointed out that the company had failed to show its financial capability even 1,400 days after the agreement was signed, but the corporation had not initiated any action against the company or sent a notice earlier, pointing to a failure on the corporation’s part, said V.P.

The court, while quashing the bail granted to a person accused of rape, observed on Tuesday that sexual offences against children were not adequately addressed by the laws in force nor were they adequately penalised. The court added that violence against children violated the dignity and rights of children and robbed them of childhood joys. Child abuses and sexual offences were widespread across the country, impacting children of all ages. Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar made the observations while quashing the order granting bail by the Thrissur Sessions Court to an NCC instructor of a school in Thrissur. The police case against instructor Gopakumar was that he took a student to the NCC room and sexually abused her. The court observed that the Thrissur Sessions Court had adopted a very casual approach in the case. Sessions judges need to change their mindset and should be sensitive in matters of this nature, for, lack of sensitivity would create distance between the justice seeker and justice provider.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/act-firmly-in-child-abuse-cases-hc/article31514366.ece

As per estimates, 13,950 people from abroad and 6,200 people from other States have completed registration formalities for coming back to the district. The number, however, is expected to go up. According to officials, isolation units will come up in buildings, including hotels, homestays and college hostels, besides accommodation centres of religious establishments and government-owned buildings. The authorities have also completed repair and maintenance work on these buildings, based on the inspection reports submitted by a joint team of Revenue and the PWD (Buildings Division). The space, taken over under the Disaster Management, includes 3,500 rooms attached with bathrooms and over 11,000 dormitory-like space. “Of this, around 3,500 rooms are ready to occupy while the remaining space will be ready for occupation in the next couple of days,” said an official. Meanwhile, the district administration also looks to open quarantine units at unoccupied houses to offer a common accommodation facility for returning families. Besides the charge officers for each centre, deputy tehsildars have been entrusted with coordinating the operation of these units at the taluk level. Those with symptoms Among the returnees, those developing symptoms of the disease will be shifted to the hospitals designated as COVID-19 centres for observation. If the facilities at the Government Medical College and the Kottayam General Hospital are not adequate, observation centres will be opened at various other government hospitals.

The study was undertaken to gauge the after-effects of the lockdown on the social and economic lives of the commoners. It was carried out by the Campaign Against Pseudo Science Using Law and Ethics (CAPSULE), Kerala, a platform under the KSSP. As a first step, those in the unorganised sector and their families were covered and efforts were made to find out their major problems. The survey covered 284 people in villages, urban centres, and coastal and hilly areas of Thiruvananthapuram district. Fifteen prepared questions were asked and the interaction was in the form of an interview. The survey found that 93% of homemakers in the families of unorganised sector employees were finding it difficult to tide over the lockdown period, which had been extended recently to two more weeks. Some relief They pointed out that the free distribution of essential goods by the State government was a huge relief for 83% of the respondents though they were apprehensive about difficulties that lay ahead. Daily wage labourers were the worst-hit as 94% of them lost their source of income or noticed a slump in it. This affected the quality of life of 69% of people. It was pointed out that 62% of people were forced to borrow money for their daily expenses. Some others reduced their expenses or used their savings. Lack of work was a problem for 92% of the respondents. Almost 98% of them were of the opinion that the future is going to be difficult. Functionaries of CAPSULE Kerala claimed that homemakers without regular income, daily wage labourers, and those without savings were under social and economic stress and the government should devise plans to address their concerns.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/unorganised-sector-hit-hard/article31514397.ece

Jayasree said that only 1,050 people were under surveillance here now. They include 18 people at the hospital. Twenty-three people were discharged on Tuesday. No one is undergoing treatment for COVID-19 at the Government Medical College Hospital now as all the patients have been discharged. The directive to passengers from other States was issued against the backdrop of the return of people stranded there to their native places across the State. Of the 2,039 body fluid samples of suspected patients sent for lab tests, 1,876 are negative. Results of 133 samples are awaited, the release added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/returnees-from-other-states-told-to-contact-health-centres/article31514360.ece
06 May 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Building contractors, property owners seek relaxation of norms||Small-scale building contractors and those depending on their services to set up low-cost houses are eagerly awaiting a relaxation of lockdown norms to complete construction work before the monsoon sets in. Hundreds of small-scale housing projects have been stalled due to the difficulty in permitting labourers to resume work amid continuing regulations. The return of hundreds of migrant labourers to their hometowns has also left several urban residents an anxious lot. To avoid additional responsibility during the lockdown, the contractors too encouraged migrant labourers working under them to return home in special trains operated by the government. “There should be some immediate arrangement to permit work at small-scale house construction sites as it will be a big relief for families like us,” said V. Prasad, an East Hill resident, who has been staying in a rented house since work on his new house began. The police are also clueless about how to handle requests made by those who want to resume construction work. Those who contacted the police for support have been asked to submit their application to the district administration. With hardware shops and building material supply outlets remaining closed, many are unable to carry out even small works, which do not require a large number of labourers. Relaxation of norms has also been sought by residents who want to shift to newer premises following the expiry of rental agreements. “Many are staying back in existing buildings without renewing the rental agreement,” said Mathew George of Vellimadukunnu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/building-contractors-property-owners-seek-relaxation-of-norms/article31514344.ece
06 May 2020||Kozhikode,KERALA||Connolly canal has crystal-clear water now||A miracle: the present condition of the Connolly canal in Kozhikode is nothing short of that. This was the canal that was cleaned up thoroughly through a massive public campaign in 2018. But no efforts of the Corporation or the voluntary organisations could improve the water quality in the 11.2-km-long waterbody. But the lockdown made the impossible possible. The water in the canal is clean like never before. What used to be black water is now crystal clear. More than 5,000 volunteers from all walks of life took part in Operation Connolly Canal spanning over a month. At the end of it, all vegetation on both the banks of the canal was cleared. More than 2,500 bags of plastic waste were removed and sent for recycling. In the second phase of the operation, the canal was split into eight sectors, each entrusted to a committee for upkeep. But no amount of vigilance could attain the present water quality in the canal. Babu Parambath, project coordinator of the Niravu waste management company that spearheaded Operation Connolly Canal, attributes the change to the non-functioning of polluting industries and other establishments during the lockdown. “The timber industry in Kallai was one of the major reasons for the water in the canal turning black. The water from the Kallai river would enter the canal during high tide. The industry is temporarily shut down now and, as a result, the water is clean,” Mr. Parambath said. Eateries and market Waste water from restaurants in the city and the vegetable market at Palayam was also diverted into the canal. “We have closed around 140 drains that open into the canal as part of the operation. But more needs to be done. Small treatment plants may do the trick,” Mr. Parambath said, adding that a proper dredging and de-silting of the mouth of the Kallai river was also in order. “Once there is proper flow of salt water through the canal, the water hyacinth covering it now will disappear,” he said. Mr. Parambath called upon the Kozhikode Corporation to carry out regular maintenance of the canal to keep up the present pristine condition. Mayor Thottathil Raveendran said the Corporation had already set the wheel rolling in this regard. “We have directed the restaurants not to dispose of untreated water into the drains. A major project for dredging the mouth of the Kallai river is also in motion as the funds have already been sanctioned,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/connolly-canal-has-crystal-clear-water-now/article31514373.ece

06 May 2020||PATHANAMTHITTA,KERALA||Departure of migrants to hit works||A sizeable chunk of migrant workers, mostly from West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha, who have been the backbone of the State’s construction sector are preparing to leave the State in the aftermath of the prolonged nationwide lockdown. Their departure is likely to hit development works in the State adversely. The State is not sure as to how many Non-Resident Keralites (NoRKs), who were doing more or less the same work in various construction sites abroad, are going to fill this vacuum left by the migrant labourers. The State has already announced many relaxations in the lockdown norms. Meanwhile, the outflow of migrant labour and inflow of NoRKs have gained momentum. The first train carrying migrant workers from Pathanamthitta is scheduled to leave the Thiruvalla railway station on May 10. Being a major Non-Resident Keralite pocket, the district is sure to feel labour scarcity in the days to come. In various fields The migrant workers engage in almost all activities, giving good support to the farm sector, construction sector, hotels, shops and various other business establishments. They contribute to economic development of the labour-scarce State in a big way. “Almost half of the labour at our construction sites are leaving this week. However, we are trying to complete various KIIFB-funded projects in a time-bound fashion by closing down our hollow brick units and other companies to utilise the manpower at our construction sites,” says Shaji Mathew Palathra, managing director of a leading construction company here. Travel arrangement Thiruvalla Subcollector Vinay Goyal said the district housed a total of 16,066 migrant workers and as many as 9,300 of them wanted to return to their home villages. As many as 6,655 of them were from West Bengal. District Collector P.B. Noohu said that an action plan was getting ready for their safe return journey from the Thiruvalla railway station. He said help desks would be set up at various taluks and at the Thiruvalla station to pass on all relevant information to the migrant workers camping at various labour camps in the district. Rail fare The workers would have to remit their rail fare to the village officer concerned the day before the journey date, he said. The District Labour Officer would provide masks and sanitisers to them. The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation would arrange transport facility for them from various labour camps to the railway station, said the Collector.  16,066 migrant workers in Pathanamthitta and 9,300 of them want to return Help desks to be arranged for workers Workers contribute to economic growth of labour-scarce State||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/departure-of-migrants-to-hit-works/article31514403.ece

Of the total 64 flights to be operated to 13 cities in the first phase, Kerala has been sanctioned 15, the most to any State. Four of the 10 flights to be operated on May 7 are to the State. Of the 15 flights to be operated to Kerala till May 13, 10 will be to Kochi, four to Kozhikode, and one to Thiruvananthapuram. No flights to Kannur The Kannur international airport has been left out of the list prepared by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has come out against the omission of the airport, pointing out that 69,179 people had registered to return via the Kannur airport. The flights to the State are from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and Malaysia. There are flights from the United States, United Kingdom, Singapore, the Philippines, and Bangladesh. But, these flights are to other States and NoRKs will have to fly to these cities or wait. Twelve flights will accommodate 200 passengers each and three will be able to fly 250 passengers. Thus, 3,150 NoRKs will be able to return to the State during the May 7-13 period. In all, 14,800 non-resident Indians are being evacuated from various countries in the first phase.  4.42 lakh register The government and NoRKs have raised concerns as 1,69,136 in the emergency category are awaiting their turn to return to the State. So far 4.42 lakh people have registered on the website of the Department of Non Resident Keralite Affairs to return home.

06 May 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Decision on opening liquor outlets soon: CM||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday said the government would allow the sale of legal liquor at a later stage. “Do not have any doubt. Kerala is not moving down the path of total prohibition. However, it is not the time to permit sales now,” he said. An official said the government did not want a repeat of the tight lines and rush witnessed when liquor shops opened for business in urban centres in New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Pune. Mr. Vijayan has asked Excise Minister T.P. Ramakrishnan to finalise a protocol for ensuring social distancing at government-run liquor outlets when and if they open for business before May 17. An official said the government was unlikely to allow home delivery of legal liquor or permit takeaways from closed bars or beer and wine parlours. The State was also concerned that illicit distillation would be more widespread and might mushroom at the household level among lower-income groups. The government has also factored in the entry of illicit spirit and use of narcotic drugs, including synthetic opiates and LSD stamps, as a substitute for legal alcohol. Kerala has the highest per capita consumption of liquor in the country. Alcohol policy is also a politically touchy subject with the Catholic Church and Muslim social organisations championing total prohibition. The government may slap a minimal COVID-19 cess on legal alcohol. The Cabinet might weigh the proposals put up by the Excise Department on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/decision-on-opening-liquor-outlets-soon-cm/article31514378.ece

When the COVID-19-induced lockdown came without a warning, the city Corporation rehabilitated them at the Government Central High School in Attakulangara. But instead of remaining idle, they had cleared up the undergrowth on the campus and begun vegetable farming and prepared a garden, as a gift to the school’s students, which The Hindu had reported on April 4. Now, the civic body has begun employing them on a temporary basis for sanitation as well as farming activities. According to Mayor K. Sreekumar, seventy of those staying here are being provided daily wages of Rs. 285, in addition to food and shelter. “As soon as they were rehabilitated, they quickly set up a garden and a vegetable farm. The vegetable farm is now ready for harvest. After seeing their dedicated work, the Corporation decided to use their services in its activities, including sanitation and farming. Since we are taking up farming in fallow land within the city, we can make use of their services for the same. They will be inducted into the Karshika Karma Sena,” says Mr. Sreekumar. 223 people A total of 223 people, ranging from the ages of 28 to 92, are lodged at the school. Some of them are physically challenged while some are too old to move around. There are those who came from other States to visit temples and got stranded, those who are forced to live on the streets owing to their meagre income, and even a few with criminal records.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/street-dwellers-provided-with-gainful-employment/article31514407.ece
06 May 2020||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||HC order a relief for govt.||The High Court decision against staying an Ordinance promulgated for deferring the salary of employees and teachers has come as a reprieve to the State government that is under severe fiscal duress for meeting its routine expenditure. The High Court order has stymied the Opposition bid to put the government and politically the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the dock for deferring the salary which it claimed was legally untenable. To avoid delay The decision to promulgate the Ordinance than going on appeal has proved to be a wiser option. Being hard-pressed for funds to clear the salary and pension bills, the government resolved to take the Ordinance route to avoid a delay and that move seems to have paid well to its advantage. The Ordinance robed the steam of the Opposition argument that the government’s original decision to deduct the salary lacked legal sanction and also gave sufficient elbow room to act with poise. Morale booster Once Governor Arif Mohammed Khan cleared the draft without raising any questions or clarifications considering the gravity of the crisis, it came as a morale booster for the government that is busy with the COVID-19 containment efforts. The government had challenged the attitude of a section of employees who protested against the decision by burning copies of the order. The Opposition had attempted to turn the tables on the LDF by citing similar protests the front had organised earlier and the government had to rush in with the explanation that the objection was not against the democratic right to protest but the defiance in sharing the huge financial burden imposed by the crisis. The government also took the sting off the Opposition argument that the decision was imposed without consultations. Ministers cited the rather lukewarm response from service organisations affiliated to the UDF to a Salary Challenge call during the previous floods and the current as a case in point for going ahead with their decision. The court order has cleared the air and set the ground for deducting the salary, but the political row over the Ordinance is likely to smoulder.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-order-a-relief-for-govt/article31514380.ece

Of the 502 who have so far tested positive in the State, only 37 persons are currently undergoing treatment in hospitals. A total of 21,342 persons are under surveillance, of whom 308 are in isolation wards in hospitals and the rest in home quarantine. 33,800 samples tested Kerala has tested 33,800 samples so far, of which, 33,265 have returned a negative result. About 1,024 samples were tested on Tuesday. There are no COVID-19 patients in four districts in the Sate. Kannur has 18, Kottayam 6, Wayanad 4, Kollam and Kasaragod 3 each, and Pathanamthitta, Idukki, and Palakkad have one case each. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said doctors and health-care workers in public and private sector institutions should work together in a coordinated and decentralised manner to help the State face the uphill task of containing COVID-19, alongside the monsoon epidemics which will bring hordes of people to hospitals in the coming days. 980 doctors Even as the health system is focussed on COVID-19 , the upcoming rainy season poses new and unprecedented challenges as doctors will have to distinguish COVID-19 patients from those coming to hospital with seasonal illnesses and treat both appropriately. Mr. Vijayan said he had pointed out these challenges ahead during a videoconference with the managements of private hospitals on Tuesday. As part of strengthening COVID-19 continent measures and anticipating the increased requirement of human resource in hospitals to tackle the monsoon season ahead, the government has decided to appoint 980 doctors on temporary basis for three months in primary and community health centres in the State. Those who have completed their stint as house surgeons would be appointed for three months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/three-new-cases-all-from-wayanad/article31514388.ece

06 May 2020||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC poser on guests at Nikhil’s wedding||The High Court of Karnataka has asked why the Ramanagaram Deputy Commissioner did not impose any restriction on the number of persons allowed at the wedding of Nikhil, son of former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy. The court posed this question to the State government while expressing surprise over the blanket permission granted by the DC on April 16 without imposing any limit on the number of guests. The permission letter stated that those persons identified by a representative of Mr. Kumaraswamy could be allowed into thewedding venue. A special Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice B.V. Nagarathna made these observations during a videoconference hearing on PIL petitions. The government had told the court that between 80 and 95 people attended the ceremony on April 17. Making it clear that it was not concerned only with the matter of Nikhil’s wedding, the Bench said the objective of the lockdown is defeated if the policy of the State and Union governments is that more than 50 persons can attend a ceremony during it. The Bench also noted that even the latest guidelines, issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on May 1, relaxing the lockdown norms make it very clear that “marriage-related gatherings shall ensure social distancing, and the maximum number of guests allowed shall not be more than 50”. If it is the policy of the State government to grant permission for weddings without any restriction on the number of persons allowed, then other people also should get to benefit from it, the Bench observed, pointing out that several people had to cancel weddings because of the lockdown. Clarification The Bench also directed both the State and Union governments to clarify whether the district magistrate had the power to grant permission to hold weddings, irrespective of number of attendees. As the guidelines issued by the MHA on April 15 do not indicate the number of persons allowed to attend weddings, does it mean any number of persons could have been allowed to attend such functions prior to the May 1 guidelines, the Bench asked. The Bench orally observed that at the very least, the State government should have accepted that not restricting the number of attendees was a mistake. The court adjourned further hearing on the matter till May 12 after directing the State government to also submit information on the number of vehicle movement passes issued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hc-poser-on-guests-at-nikhils-wedding/article31514010.ece

06 May 2020||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||State is ahead of others in testing: CM||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has reiterated that COVID-19 is going to be a part of everyone’s life, but since the death rate is less than 2%, people have to take certain precautions to keep the virus at bay. In an exhaustive videoconference with the district Collectors and Superintendents of Police on Tuesday, the Chief Minister asked the officers to intensify the containment measures and increase the preparedness to handle any eventuality. ‘Continuous process’ “I am happy to note that A.P. is now leading in the scale of testing as no other State has tested persons more than us. We are conducting 2,500 tests per million, which is a new record. A month ago, we had a single lab at Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS). But now, we have labs in 11 districts and TruNat kits too. I appreciate the efforts and hard work put in by the Collectors and SPs, who coordinated well with the strong network of village volunteers and ASHA workers. This is a continuous process and we have to live with it (COVID-19),” said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. ‘Quarantine facility’ Referring to the issue of migrant workers, the Chief Minister said about 2 lakh people, including one lakh migrant workers, were likely to return to the State. “To tackle the situation and strictly implement the COVID-19 guidelines, quarantine facility should be provided for one lakh people in more than 11,000 village secretariats. At least 10 persons should be accommodated in each village secretariat, where hygiene and sanitation should be maintained and proper beds and food provided to them,” the Chief Minister said. “About 25,000 single rooms and 7,500 double rooms are available to accommodate 40,000 people in various quarantine centres across the State,” he said, and instructed the Collectors to strictly monitor all thee facilities and review the works regularly. Telemedicine “With village clinics all set to come into being, the YSR Telemedicine will be much useful,” the Chief Minister observed and instructed the Collector to play a key role in strengthening the programme.

06 May 2020||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Want the bottle? Get an umbrella!||Want to buy a liquor bottle? Then, bring an umbrella with you! This is the latest diktat that the Guntur Rural Police have imposed in the areas where sale of liquor is allowed as per the guidelines of the State and Central governments. Why an umbrella? The police have caught on to the idea to make umbrella mandatory as it covers the person and ensures that sufficient physical distance is maintained among those standing outside the wine shop. Unwittingly, an umbrella can also provide cover from the blistering Sun in summer. A day after serpentine queues were witnessed outside the liquor shops, throwing caution to the winds, the SP of Guntur hit upon the idea of making umbrellas mandatory for tipplers. The idea seemed to have caught on, with almost everyone following suit. The idea was implemented at Kollur and replicated across the district. “We made umbrella mandatory in the entire Rural Police District as part of our efforts to maintain social distancing among people waiting at the wine shops. The State government has permitted sale of liquor between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m., but we are witnessing quite a rush in view of the long lockdown,” said Superintendent of Police, Guntur Rural, Ch. Vijaya Rao. The entire Guntur Urban Police District is in the red zone. However, many mandals in Guntur Rural such as Tenali, Bapatla in the delta region and a few mandals in Palnadu are in the orange zone, where sale of liquor is allowed. For those without an umbrella, a bottle of liquor may be a far cry!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/want-the-bottle-get-an-umbrella/article31514042.ece

06 May 2020||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Film industry at war with ‘fake news’ websites||Amid a world fighting the coronavirus pandemic, the Telugu film industry is engaged in a different kind of war, with what they call ‘fake news’ websites that rob them of their dignity and resort to personal attacks. It all started with Tollywood angry young man Vijay Deverakonda releasing a video with anguish and pain, accusing some web portals of tarnishing his image as he ignored their requests for interviews. A particular website had questioned the sincerity on his fund raising effort to help the film workers forced out of work due to suspension of shootings. The anger of the young sensation was visible in the video and he was particularly annoyed that a website with malicious intent was creating a wedge between him and Megastar Chiranjeevi, who started a similar campaign. He is not alone in this web of falsehood spread under the garb of journalism, the actor argued and said many actors, directors, and producers were victims, apart from the readers. “They use us and feed us with false information. They will also thrust upon their wrong opinions on us and make money out of it.” Top stars take to Twitter Then the fire caught on, and as if the volcano was building up to erupt for some time, all top stars took to their personal Twitter and Instagram accounts extending their support with the hashtag #KillGossipWebsites. Superstar, Mahesh Babu was the first to react followed by a deluge of posts from all top stars including Chiranjeevi, Daggubati Rana and Ravi Teja. Actresses Raashi Khanna, Kajal Aggarwal followed by top directors Koratala Shiva, Anil Ravipudi, Krish Jagarlamudi, Harii Shankar and Sandeep Vanga joined. Pent-up anger Mahesh Babu was particularly harsh accusing the websites of destroying their fans’ love earned with sacrifice and passion, just for their next paycheck. “I call upon the industry to act upon these websites that live off us and disrespect and lie about us collectively,” he tweeted. Chiranjeevi was more diplomatic asking “Journo friends not to peddle individual views as news.” I was also the victim of my family’s privacy being violated, he reminded while extending support to Vijay Deverakonda. The solidarity with which the entire film industry stood behind him reflected the pent up anger against websites that over the years have been surviving solely on gossiping and exploiting the fans’ weakness to attract their eyeballs, a young director agreed. “And there isn’t a better time to kill the fake news websites and youtube channels that have mushroomed with no room for journalistic values and ethics.” Will the industry heads act tough now? With digital platforms gaining popularity in the entertainment industry and high stakes of industry honchos in the sector it looks quite unlikely now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fake-news-websites-raise-the-hackles-of-film-personalities/article31514295.ece

06 May 2020||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala HC refuses to stay salary ordinance||The Kerala High Court on Tuesday declined to stay the Ordinance empowering the government to defer payment of salary of the employees of the government and government-run institutions for six days for five months in view of the COVID-19 crisis. Justice Bechu Kurian Thomas, while refusing the plea for a stay made by counsel for various service organisations, observed that the court could not question the wisdom of the government in bringing the Ordinance which did not appropriate the salary but only deferred payment. The court also prima facie found that the Ordinance was enacted under the legislative competence of the government. It was promulgated as the State was reeling under a very difficult situation and was intended to overcome such situation. The court could not interfere with the Ordinance at this stage. The court said that the exclusion of health workers from the salary deferment Ordinance was a matter for the government to consider and take a decision. Merely because the health workers were not exempted from the Ordinance was not a ground to issue a stay order. Petitioners’ contention According to the service organisations, including the Kerala NGO Association, the Kerala Disaster and Public Health Emergency (Special Provisions) Ordinance which makes for deferment of pay of employees of the government and its institutions in part in the event of disaster and public health emergency in the State was illegal. Govt. contention Advocate General C.P. Sudhakara Prasad argued that the government had the legislative competence to resort to promulgation of such an Ordinance. The unprecedented situation warranted hasty promulgation of the Ordinance. In fact, the government did not deduct or reduce the salary of its employees and it only deferred payment of the salary. He also submitted that the salary amount deduced would be utilised only for the management of the matters arising out of disasters and public health emergencies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-hc-refuses-to-stay-salary-ordinance/article31514012.ece

06 May 2020||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tobacco farmers on a warpath||Farmers led by YSR Congress Party farmers wing Prakasam district president Mareddy Subba Reddy staged a demonstration in front of the Tobacco Board regional office here on Tuesday in protest against lacklustre market for the export-oriented crop. Crop holiday sought Leading the protest, Mr. Subba Reddy said the lockdown which coincided with the marketing season of the principal winter crop in the district had led to piling up of stocks with the farmers. Though the auctions were restarted on a low key after a gap of about 40 days in the auction platforms coming under green zone, the market remained sluggish due to poor participation by traders, he said. Farmers in the auction platforms coming under red zone had to wait for a longer time for the e-auctions to recommence. The restive farmers raised slogans demanding crop holiday during the next cropping season if the Tobacco Board which fixed the crop size is not in a position to come to their aid to market the produce. They were able to market only about 2.38 million kg of the produce at an average price of Rs. 155 per kg so far as against the estimated production of about 85 to 90 million kg in the traditional tobacco growing areas, they said.  Meanwhile, Tobacco Board Chairman Y.Raghunatha Babu tried to allay the fears of farmers saying that the board would do all that was necessary to liquidate their stocks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tobacco-farmers-on-a-warpath/article31514479.ece
06 May 2020||ONGOLE/NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||More persons cured of virus in Nellore, Prakasam districts||In a positive development, eight more patients-two in Praksam district and six in SPSR Nellore district were cured of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours. With this, the number of active cases has come down to nine in Prakasam district and 33 in SPSR Nellore district. As many as 108 persons, 56 in Nellore and 52 in Ongole, have been cured of the viral disease so far. Meanwhile, a person from Stonehousepeta area in Nellore city tested positive for the disease, taking the total number of confirmed cases in the district to 92, health officials said. Civic officials sanitised the area and implemented the cluster containment action plan. “Nine patients under treatment at the Government General Hospital in Ongole are also recovering fast. They will be discharged later during the week,” said COVID-19 nodal officer, John Richardson, after giving a warm send-off to two discharged patients. They will have to remain in home isolation for another 14 days. The test reports of 1,234 persons received on Tuesday turned out to be negative, as per the Prakasam district health bulletin. However, reports of yet another batch of 5,011 persons are still awaited. ‘No liquor sale here’ Liquor shops in Prakasam district did not open on Tuesday, disappointing those who thronged the retail outlets in large numbers. The excise officials ruled out opening of the shops immediately as the two liquor depots came under the COVID-19 containment zones. In Chirala, where seven persons had contracted the disease, a cinema hall was turned into a parking place for hundreds of vehicles seized from lockdown violators and from those who stepped out of their homes without any valid reason. Meanwhile, a group of women wearing masks staged a protest in Nellore against the State government’s decision to open liquor shops. It was unfortunate that the government, which opened shops selling vegetables and other essential commodities only for a short period, allowed sale of liquor after hiking its price, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/more-persons-cured-of-virus-in-nellore-prakasam-districts/article31514477.ece
06 May 2020||Rajulapudi Srinivas,ANDHRA PRADESH||Migrant labourers’ cup of woes overflows||Even as the government was making tall claims over shifting of migrant labourers, troubles of workers stranded in Andhra Pradesh were continuing. Thousands of migrant labourers, who have been waiting in shelter homes since ‘Janata Curfew’ and the subsequent lockdown, were staging protests demanding that they be sent back to their home States. “The government is asking us to pay Rs. 150 to Rs. 300 per head for providing transportation in Shramik special trains. Many of us cannot pay for the journey. What will be their fate?” Nanavath Ramulu, a labourer, questioned. According to sources, more than 50,000 labourers migrated to AP to take up rabi harvesting operations. Besides, many workers from Odisha, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh arrived to work in aqua and spinning units, brick kilns, sand reaches, catering companies, construction sites and other sectors. Many of the labourers started on foot to their native states and a few have reportedly died en route. Several workers were stranded in different places and suffering due to lack of money, food and shelter. Departments clueless The Centre, which stopped public transportation to prevent the spread of COVID-19, asked the States on April 29 to allow transportation of stranded students, labourers and tourists and directed them to make necessary arrangements. “Though the Centre directed the States to provide facilities for labourers, no arrangements have been made. We don’t have mobile phones and money to enrol with the officers,” says a group of labourers who got stuck in Jaggaiahpet of Krishna district. Interestingly, the Industries, Labour, Revenue and Factories departments did not have any data on migrant labourers. Fear outdoes “We made many attempts to travel to our native place, but the police stopped us and the locals did not offer us food or water due to fear on COVID. Many families, including pregnant women and children, are suffering a lot due to the lockdown and poor planning of the officials,” said Kishan Singh, a migrant labourer. A couple of days ago, 1,500 labourers working in cement factories at Darsivarappadu Thanda in Jaggaiahpet in Krishna district, staged a dharna demanding that they be sent back. Police resorted to a lathi-charge when about 2,000 labourers of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand staged a protest and started trekking at Kovvur in West Godavari district on Monday. Officials said many migrants were stranded in Krishna, West Godavari, Guntur and other districts and efforts were on to arrange special trains for them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/migrant-labourers-cup-of-woes-overflows/article31514053.ece

He launched a ‘Green Van’ of the ARTS non-governmental organisation in Srikakulam on Tuesday. The Speaker said that buying of products made by tribals was also essential since they were facing many difficulties. ARTS Director N. Sanyasi Rao and Manya Sahaja Farmers Association CEO B. Sankara Rao said that tribal products were being procured and sold through mobile markets. He said that essential commodities were supplied to people living in remote areas of Palakonda, Sitampeta and other areas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ensure-tribals-get-essentials-says-speaker/article31514487.ece
06 May 2020||Theni,ANDHRA PRADESH||Officials turn couriers amid lockdown to help young girl||A distress call to the Theni district control room proved that States can work together in times of emergency, despite the stringent COVID-19 lockdown. Coordination between officials in Tamil Nadu and the Karnataka police helped a young girl in Theni, suffering from Maple Syrup Urine Disorder (MSUP), get medicines from Bengaluru in record time. The 11-year-old girl’s father works as a supplier in a small restaurant in Periyakulam, and her mother is a daily wage worker. “It is a food for special medical purpose for our daughter,” the girl’s mother told The Hindu over the phone on Tuesday. “My daughter has urinary disease. She cannot consume anything else other than the tinned food,” she added. This special food is available only from one outlet in Bengaluru. For the past three years, the family has been procuring it through courier service. “With prohibitory orders in vogue, we did not know what to do as there is no movement of goods... Both of us are jobless since March 25 as well. We did not know how to go about as we had no money or means to procure the medicine,” the mother told The Hindu . A campaign vehicle appealing to people to remain indoors while distributing pamphlets with a control room number proved a godsend for the desperate parents. After the girl’s mother called the control room, her request was passed to nodal officer Kavita, who in turn, spoke to Collector M. Pallavi Baldev. A team of officials visited the family at Aranmanaipudur panchayat near Periakulam and obtained details of the shop in Bengaluru. Family overwhelmed When Ms. Kavita contacted the dealer, he was initially reluctant to open the shop but later agreed to keep the medicine ready. She then sought the help of the Bengaluru City Police Commissioner, who made arrangements to get the packet delivered to the Hosur checkpost. A two-member team from Theni then made a 14-hour journey to the checkpost and back to Periakulam to deliver the medicine to the family, leaving them overwhelmed by refusing to accept money for the supplements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/officials-turn-couriers-amid-lockdown/article31514085.ece
06 May 2020||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Quarantine must for those coming home’||Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday said non-resident Keralites (NoRKs) returning home from abroad would have to be in mandatory quarantine in government-controlled facilities for a minimum of seven days irrespective of their COVID-19 status or age. The government has readied 2.5 lakh beds to accommodate them. The government would not permit them to go home directly from the airport. Doctors would subject them to a PCR (polymerase chain reaction ) test after a week. The doctors would hospitalise those who test positive. Those who turn negative could quarantine themselves at home. The government would use a combination of geolocation logging mobile phone applications and regular visits by police officers, health workers, and local body members to ensure that the returnees remained safely isolated at home. The same procedure would apply to citizens returning home from 10 other States categorised as “intense disease transmission” zones. The same protocol would also apply to those entering Kerala via seaports. Obligatory testing The Centre’s decision not to conduct the obligatory medical checks on those bound for home at the very port of their departure has necessitated the radical change in the State’s containment protocol. The Centre plans to fly back citizens irrespective of their COVID-19 condition in the closed environs of airline cabins. The chance of an entire lot of passengers getting infected is high in the cramped air-conditioned environment. It is a flagrant violation of the universal safety procedure decreed by the World Health Organization. The Centre’s stance could imperil the entire country and retard the joint struggle against the pandemic. Mr. Vijayan had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to send advance medical teams to the Gulf, the U.S. and the U.K. to screen Indians before they boarded the special flights home. Mr. Vijayan warned parties against organising receptions for those returning from abroad to maintain social distancing norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/quarantine-must-for-those-coming-home/article31514013.ece

Six discharged from SVR Ruia Government General Hospital were identified as cases hailing from Thottambedu, Varadaiahpalem, Tirupati Urban, B.N. Kandriga, Yerpedu and Puttur mandals.

Of the eight persons discharged from the government hospital in Chittoor town, four are from Srikalahasti, three from Yerravaripalem and one from Chinnagottigallu. With this, the district has 14 active cases as on Tuesday. TUDA Chairman and government whip Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy, who announced financial support for people getting discharged from isolation and quarantine centres, handed over cheques to people from his Chandragiri constituency leaving the Padmavathi Nilayam quarantine centre on Tuesday. Nineteen of the quarantined received Rs. 3,000 each and the positive person from A. Rangampet who was discharged after 14-day isolation received Rs. 10,000. He appreciated TUDA Secretary and quarantine in-charge S. Lakshmi and District Medical and Health Officer Penchalaiah for reaching out to the quarantine inmates on time. Srikalahasti MLA Biyyapu Madhusudhan Reddy visited Musalipedu and Bathinaiah SC and ST Colony in Yerpedu mandal and distributed essential commodities, vegetables and eggs to more than 600 families that stayed put at home during the lockdown period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/20-discharged-in-chittoor-district/article31514481.ece
06 May 2020||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Regulars upset over steep hike in liquor price||After Monday’s kill, the liquor outlets remained closed for the first half of Tuesday, making the waiting ‘consumers’ turn impatient. By noon, they became restive and started staging protest in front of a state-run liquor outlet on Tilak Road. Confusion prevailed for long hours with the State deciding to hike the liquor prices by 50%, over and above the 25% hike effected on Monday. As the new tariff was not clear and the government blaming the law enforcing authorities for not maintaining order and social distancing at the outlets, the shops remained closed beyond noon. Many eagerly came forward to give ‘interview’ to waiting media personnel and flayed the government for its arbitrary decision. “We did not expect the outlets to open, but when they did, they disappointed us by charging liquor at such a huge cost,” a masked ‘consumer’ gave vent to his grievance. Though the shops were opened after 3 p.m., there were not many takers in view of the steep hike in prices. The turnout was almost feeble when compared to Monday’s crowd, as most of them were from lower income groups. Buyers were in shock to find their regular brands sold at almost double the actual amount it had cost them before the lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/regulars-upset-over-steep-hike-in-liquor-price/article31514483.ece

With the officials turning them back with an advice to get themselves registered online, the workers, most of them in the semi-literate bracket, offered resistance. As they continued to mob the premises, the police got into action and chased them away. Meanwhile, the IFTU district leaders came forward to get them registered online. Clarity seems to elude even the official machinery, as the waiting list is already huge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-chase-away-migrant-workers/article31514472.ece

Tripura former Chief Secretary Usurupati Venkateswarlu, who hails from Suddagunta in Karvetinagaram mandal of Chittoor district, helped reach essential commodities to more than 200 families in his native mandal, after the lockdown turned several families jobless. As per his guidance, his family members purchased and distributed rice, pulses, oil and other groceries to the public. “Apart from the health workers who are striving to keep our vicinity clean in Karvetinagaram major Panchayat town, we identified cobblers, our neighbourhood Gorkha, village talaris (revenue staff) and also the temple priest who have been rendered jobless due to lack of activity,” explains the former bureaucrat’s brother U.

As the bills could not be hand-delivered to the domestic consumers owing to fear of COVID-19 spread and lockdown situation, the company had initially advised the consumers to pay the bill amount of March for the month of April too. However, it reverted to actual consumption-based calculation system with the facilitation of spot billing system after the lockdown was relaxed.

06 May 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Govt. unveils fishermen-friendly steps||The State government will provide financial assistance of Rs. 10,000 to each fisherman family under YSR Matsyakara Bharosa. It is aimed at helping the community during the marine ban period and in the wake of the lockdown. The amount will be credited into the accounts of fishermen on Wednesday. As many as 1,32,332 fishermen stand to gain from the scheme. The government issued administrative sanction for enhancing the monetary relief from Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 10,000 per head to all fishermen who venture into the sea. Fishermen in the age group of 21- 60 years who are operating motorised and non-motorised boats during the marine ban period/lean period from April 15 to June 14 under the scheme during the financial year 2019-20 are eligible. However, fishermen who are availing other benefits such as Rythu Bharosa or disability schemes are not eligible. As per the direction of the Centre, the State government has imposed a ban on marine fishing by all motorised and non-mechanised fishing vessels exempting the traditional non-motorised crafts in the territorial waters off the Andhra Pradesh coast.  During this period, even though non-motorised crafts are allowed for fishing, due to the rough and unfriendly environment in the sea, country boats are also considered and the operators are put within the purview of the scheme. Diesel subsidy Financial assistance would be extended to operators of rafts along with motorboats. The government has increased subsidy on diesel per litre from Rs. 6.03 to Rs. 9. The government has taken care to reduce the diesel oil rate while filling the oil by identifying dedicated bunks for the subsidy. The government last year provided the aid on the World Fisheries Day on November 21, according to a press release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-unveils-fishermen-friendly-steps/article31514014.ece
06 May 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Lockdown policy: Naidu dares govt. for referendum||TDP national president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has dared the State government to go for a referendum on its policies and decisions taken during the lockdown imposed to contain coronavirus. “The government owes an explanation as to why it opened liquor shops amid the pandemic. The government has no rights to play with the lives of people to fill its coffers,” he told the media here on Tuesday. Drawing a parallel between Kerala, which registered the first corona case in the country, and Andhra Pradesh, Mr. Naidu said the Kerala government had succeeded in controlling the pandemic with the cases only 499 now. “Not a single case was reported during the last two days in Kerala. The government supplied essential commodities at the doorstep there. The other States have also optimally utilised the lockdown to contain the coronavirus. Whereas, in Andhra Pradesh, the YSRCP leaders are violating the lockdown rules and this has led to spurt in the cases,” alleged Mr. Naidu. Central guidelines Taking strong exception to opening of liquor shops, Mr. Naidu said that Andhra Pradesh was the only State in the South India to open liquor outlets amid the lockdown. “The government’s argument that the Centre has given clearance to open liquor shops does not hold water. The Centre has also asked for classifying red zones taking districts as units, but A.P. is not following it. The government is using the Centre’s guidelines as per its convenience,” Mr. Naidu pointed out. He further alleged that police and school teachers were being used to control the crowd at liquor outlets. “The government is supplying the substandard liquor with an eye on revenue,” he alleged. Migrant workers Mr. Naidu appealed to the people to observe self-regulation. He urged the State government to provide help and assistance to the migrant workers at Kovvuru in West Godavari district. Mr. Naidu urged Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to consider the plights of the workers and extend immediate help. Over 300 migrant workers have been seeking help for the past three days. The migrant workers and the police clashed at Kovvuru on Sunday . It may be recalled that the workers have been eager to return to their respective home states in North India in view of the extended lockdowns and loss of work opportunities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/lockdown-policy-naidu-dares-govt-for-referendum/article31514501.ece
06 May 2020||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Decision to sell liquor a recipe for disaster: AIDWA||The Jagan Mohan Reddy government has jacked up the price of liquor by a whopping 75 % calling the steep hike a step towards the promised prohibition in a phased manner. But the decision to allow liquor shops to open at the time of the lockdown which has deprived a vast population of its jobs and livelihoods, has not gone down well with many sections, especially women activists. “If the government is sincere about implementing prohibition in the State, it should utilise the gap during the ongoing lockdown period. Since people have not had the opportunity to consume alcohol this long, it will be easy for them to kick the habit now,” said D. Rama Devi, Andhra Pradesh State secretary of All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA). “We are planning to mount pressure on the government by roping in like-minded organisations,” she added. Ms. Rama Devi said when shops selling essential commodities are allowed only for three hours daily, why are liquor outlets being kept open from morning to evening. The AIDWA plans to make known its strong reservations against the government’s decision by meeting in small groups at Dharna Chowk here on Wednesday, maintaining physical distancing. ‘Disturbing reports’ “There are already disturbing reports that domestic violence has increased two-fold even during the lockdown period. The State decision will aggravate the problem. With no means of livelihood, desperate men will sell whatever household articles they can lay their hands on to buy liquor. We have been dealing with such cases on a regular basis. Incidents of domestic violence have a close connection with liquor sales,” said B. Keerthy, president of Vasavya Mahila Mandali. “The entire police force is being used to enforce the lockdown. Who will look into domestic abuse cases that are bound to increase?” she wondered. Sai Padma, an advocate in Visakhapatnam, termed the decision a “sure-fire recipe for spurt in domestic violence, drunken brawls and more significantly, more infections of the virus.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/decision-to-sell-liquor-a-recipe-for-disaster-aidwa/article31514046.ece

During the review meeting on agriculture intelligence here on Tuesday, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that District Collectors would be responsible for smooth functioning of the RBKs which would also take up the supply of seeds, fertilizers and pesticides in the coming days. He said that names of the beneficiaries of RBKs should be displayed at the village secretariats so that nobody feels that they were left out. Agriculture assistants, at the village secretariats level, would send market intelligence reports to District Collectors daily. The District Collectors, in turn, would update them on a regular basis. The process helps in ensuring remunerative price to farmers’ produce through market intervention scheme, if required, he said, adding, “Gear up to procure the agricultural produce at village level. Study the procurement process in depth and put an end to lapses if any in procurement.” Credit cards Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that there was a proposal to give credit cards to farmers by October. Farmers can utilize the cards either to get loans or for the purchase of seeds, fertilizers and pesticides so that farmers do not face any difficulty during agricultural operations. The village assistants at the RBKs would also help in e-cropping for which the banks would have to provide credit to farmers without fail, he added. The officials informed him about the market intelligence app. The app is named as comprehensive monitoring of agricultural price and procurement (CM app).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rythu-bharosa-kendras-to-be-launched-on-may-30/article31514043.ece

06 May 2020||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Plan to open quarantine facility in residential area opposed||A tense situation prevailed in Pithapuram Colony of Maddilapalem areas on Tuesday when the residents gathered in large numbers to protest against the opening of a quarantine facility in the colony. The authorities chose a new shopping complex constructed in the colony for setting up of the facility. The ground floor is allotted to shops while the first floor of the complex is vacant. On Tuesday, mattresses were brought to the centre in a mini-truck. Knowing about it, the residents including women staged a protest. The residents said that water tap connections and other works were pending and asked how a quarantine facility could be set up in a residential area. The authorities seemed to have shed the plan as the mini-truck carrying mattresses left the place after the protest. The opening of quarantine facilities in residential areas has been drawing flak from the residents for several weeks now. A few weeks ago, the residents of PM Palem had staged a similar protest against opening of a quarantine facility in a private college in the colony. Dynamic numbers More than 7,000 persons have been lodged in 34 quarantine facilities in the district. “The number of persons and the centres keeps changing as the inmates who do not develop symptoms after 14 days are sent home,” said P.V. Sudhakar, principal of Andhra Medical College. He said there was no reason for the people in the neighbourhood of quarantine centres to get panic. “There is no threat of contracting the infection as long as the people remain in isolation. This is similar to home quarantine as the inmates will not be allowed to come out of their room till completion of the observation period,” said Dr. Sudhakar while trying to allay the apprehensions. Residents of villages are also protesting against the opening of quarantine facilities in their localities. “Most quarantine facilities in rural areas are opened in government buildings, and to the extent possible those are being set up on the outskirts of the villages,” said Collector V. Vinay Chand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/plan-to-open-quarantine-facility-in-residential-area-opposed/article31514506.ece

The health department, police and district administration are on their toes to control the spread of the virus in the area. Nearly 40,000 residents from 11,000 households live in 19 various colonies of Dandu Bazaar. Of the COVID-19 cases which were reported in the district, this was the first area where officials observed that the virus spread to neighbours from a positive patient. In all the rest of the cases, it was only family members or close contacts who were infected. In most of the lanes in the red zone area of Dandu Bazaar, houses are located in congested areas. In the new positive cases which were reported from the area, all of them are neighbours, said a health official in the district. “As they had a lot of free time during the lockdown, families had lunch/dinner together. They would play indoor games in the afternoon. Because of this free mingling, the infection spread,” the official said. Testing on pace Health officials have been conducting testing for all those residing in surrounding lanes of the first COVID-19 case from Dandu Bazaar.

According to reports reaching here, the mishap occurred when the workers were attending to track work on the section. V. Suresh (39), who was posted at the S. Kota railway gate, was killed in the mishap. The six injured persons were shifted to the Government Hospital at S. Kota. Boulders fell on the track in the ghat section between Chimidapalli and Borra Guhalu, around 75 km from Visakhapatnam, after incessant rain during the past few days, in the early hours of Tuesday. Some railway staff and contract workers went to the spot to clear track. However, while the men were at work, there was another boulder collapse at around 1 p.m. resulting in injuries to the railway employees and contract workers. The deceased railway employee is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter. An accident relief train was sent from the Divisional Headquarters in the city to the accident spot. The track clearance is likely to be delayed in view of the second boulder fall. Normally, 12 goods trains a day are operated, mainly for movement of iron ore from the Bailadila Mines in Chhattisgarh to the Visakhapatnam Port. At present, only around five goods trains are being operated on this section in view of the shortage of labour due to the lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/railway-staffer-dies-six-hurt-as-boulders-fall-on-kk-line/article31514508.ece

The incident came to light on Monday after some teachers and their associations submitted a representation to the District Education Officer (DEO), urging him to relieve them from working at the wine shops and also from the COVID-19 duty. Nearly 600 teachers have been rendering assistance to the police at various areas for the past one month.

As many as 191 people crossed the Inchivila check-post on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border near Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday. Teething issues persisted there for the second day and several families were forced to wait for over four hours after the Tamil Nadu Police insisted on obtaining transit passes issued by their government. This prompted the Kerala officials to send back around 40 people who came in 10 vehicles soon after they crossed the border. The frustrated lot argued that they had cleared all formalities by obtaining the passes issued by the Non-Resident Keralites Affairs Department (NoRKA) and the Collector of their native district. With the police unrelenting, the families were compelled to apply for the e-pass and await its issuance. Finally, they were allowed to cross the border after the server of the registration portal crashed. Walayar As many as 2,377 Keralites returned home through the Walayar check-post in Palakkad district on Tuesday. District officials said 1,063 vehicles with online passes reached the State through Walayar, carrying 1,713 men, 458 women and 206 children. Many more vehicles continued to be waiting for clearance in the evening. Aryankavu A total of 126 Keralites returned to the State through Aryankavu check-post on Tuesday. Around 679 persons are expected through the check-post in the next couple of days. The district administration has arranged facilities for rest and awareness session at Arayankavu. Arrangements are in place for receiving 800 persons a day and the timing will be 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. All will have to go through five levels of screening at the border. Heath officials will be deciding the type of quarantine and a junior health inspector and a volunteer will be in charge of completing the procedures. While those coming in the A category will be sent to COVID-19 first-line treatment centres and those in B and C categories will be taken to Kollam District Hospital and Government Medical College, Paripally.

06 May 2020||ADILABAD,TELANGANA||The biggest exodus northward so far on NH44||The flow of migrant workers only got worse on Tuesday as hundreds of thirsty, famished and broke persons kept pouring in large groups on to the NH44 stretch in Adilabad looking for transportation to cross the inter-State border that Telangana shares with Maharashtra on the Penganga river bridge. As the government eased travel restrictions, workers had hitched rides on lorries or any other mode of transport and were being dropped off 20 to 25 km away from the border. The exodus had swelled on Monday evening itself. One of the labourers, Jeetu Satnami of Gotia village in Kawardha district of Chattisgarh, got ill apparently due to dehydration and had taken shelter at Pipparwada village. He had travelled atop a lorry in the hot sun almost all through the day without even a morsel of food or a glass of water, like all others from his group of 25 which included five children. Moved on seeing the condition of the migrant workers, the villagers of Pipparwada readied food for about 150 of them in the night. In the earlier phase of exodus, the workers were marching on the road and had come across several groups of kind-hearted people who were serving food and water. In the current phase which started three days back, the labourers are travelling by lorries which are not stopping at places where food and water is being served. Advice ignored Despite the advic from the Telangana State Human Rights Commission, no government effort was seen in offering the labourers water or food, leave alone offering transportation at least till the border. On the contrary, a couple of employees from the Revenue department visited the site where the workers were being fed on Monday night and inquired if Pipparwada villagers would also cook supper for those working on the border, about three km away. In the absence of public transport, the labourers were left with the option of travelling atop lorries, often putting their life in danger. Most of them also had the bad experience of being fleeced and cheated by lorry drivers. “The driver took Rs. 500 each from us promising to drop us at Nagpur from Medchal. But he dropped us off here (NH44 Adilabad bypass) saying Nagpur was close enough,” recalled Shailender Dhane, a mason from Lanji in Madhya Pradesh as he looked longingly towards a speeding four wheeler carrying a few others who apparently could afford the hire charges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/the-biggest-exodus-northward-so-far-on-nh44/article31514304.ece
06 May 2020||ADILABAD,TELANGANA||From Isnapur to Shahjahanpur on a hybrid motor-rickshaw||It is a different kind of hybrid vehicle that Taufeeq Khan, a migrant worker from Kath village in Shahjahanpur district in Uttar Pradesh is riding. It has the front half of a motorcycle attached to a remodelled carriage of an old fashioned cycle rickshaw capable of clocking a speed of even 50 km per hour on a smooth road which, the NH44 passing through Adilabad district is. The rear part of the motor-rickshaw has a thick mattress spread on it which serves as a bed in the night. But the rider seems to be in no mood to relax on his way home. Mr. Khan used to work in a manual cotton ginning unit making and selling mattresses and pillows with the recycled lint on his creatively remodelled vehicle at Isnapur in Sangareddy district. Bu then his world came crashing down with the closure of his work place on March 22 as the first lockdown started. His employer provided food and shelter until a few days back but eventually expressed his inability to continue doing so for the workers who were employed in the ginning mill for the last two years. “This had the seven of us heading home. The others either left on foot or were given a ride by truckers,” he recalled. “I could not have left this (motor rickshaw) behind as this is my only possession here,” he added. A long ride ahead Kath is about 1,600 km away from Isnapur and Mr. Khan hopes to reach home in another three days if nothing goes wrong. He had already travelled nearly 320 km during the last nine hours when The Hindu came across him near Seetagondi on Tuesday. Unlike other migrant labourers, he is not tech savvy. “I need to ask for directions once I reach Nagpur. Reaching the Maharashtra city will mean he has covered one third of the distance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/from-isnapur-to-shahjahanpur-on-a-hybrid-motor-rickshaw/article31514306.ece

The CCI has identified the cotton, an estimated 50,000 quintals of it, which could not be brought to the markets from villages owing to the sudden lockdown in March. The window for purchase ending Wednesday is expected to provide relief to farmers. “The bulk of purchases have already been made at the minimum support price of Rs. 5,550 per quintal (MSP) by the CCI before the lockdown and almost all farmers have received payments too,” pointed out Jainad Primary Agriculture Cooperative Society chairman B. Goverdhan Reddy whose representation to the district administration to allow the Corporation to procure the remaining cotton had started the limited period process on April 29. “We have purchased about 50 lakh quintals of cotton through the 25 purchase centres under Adilabad branch which is almost double the quantum of that is generally expected to arrive in the markets,” CCI General Manager Sanjay Kumar revealed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/farmers-happy-with-cci-mopping-up-operation/article31514318.ece
06 May 2020||ADILABAD,TELANGANA||Irate villagers ransack forest office||Angry villagers from Gandigopalpur in Kadem mandal of Nirmal district ransacked the office of the Udumpur Forest Range Officer on Tuesday accusing the forest staff of being responsible for the death of 60-year-old tribal shepherd Gade Narsaiah. The forest staffers had taken Narsaiah into custody on Monday accusing him of setting on fire a section of the forest in Gandigopalpur beat of Kawal Tiger Reserve core area. Nasaiah, who was released by the forest staff from the office of the Udumpur Forest Range Officer had developed health complications early on Tuesday morning. He died while undergoing treatment at Utnoor Government Hospital in Adilabad district. A press release issued by the Forest Department, based on its preliminary report on the incident, denied having any role in the death of Narsaiah. It said Narsaiah, who was seen setting the forest on fire was detained but was released on personal bond and handed over to the husband of sarpanch and upa sarpanch. The release said that the FRO came to know of the death, presumably a suicide incident. Later a mob of aggrieved persons descended upon the office and ransacked it and damaged furniture, files and a jeep. The Forest Department denied the allegation of manhandling of the deceased on Monday. “He was released in healthy and fit condition,” the release claimed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/irate-villagers-ransack-forest-office/article31514332.ece

The Charla police have supplied essential commodities to several Gutti Koya families inhabiting the interior hamlets in the Agency mandal, bordering the strife-torn Bijapur district of Chhattisgarh, during the lockdown period so far, police sources said. In an apparent move aimed at building rapport with Gutti Koyas, the local police have dispatched essential commodities to around 250 tribal families of six habitations dotting the dense forests spanning on either side of Telangana-Chhattisgarh border on Monday. A substantial quantity of essentials, including pulses, were dispatched to remote tribal habitations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/police-deliver-essentials-to-remote-gutti-koya-habitations/article31514335.ece
06 May 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Migrants throng Hitex, JRC for passes||Vasuma Das has been waiting with her children, two-year-old Subrasta and six-year-old Ansuman, for nearly two hours at Hitex in Madhapur so that her application to return to her home state of Odisha is processed. Vasuma is one of the few thousands from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Bihar who converged there in the hope to go back to home in trains which the Telangana government had announced. As one moves towards Madhapur, one finds migrant groups varying in number of workers. Some, with sweat drenched collars, are carrying heavy bags, others are carrying children. They are walking towards either Hitex or JRC Convention near Whisper Valley, another place where applications are processed. “My husband used to work as a cook at a hotel in Madhapur. But it is closed, so we will have to go back. My luck is such that I arrived here three months ago to join him, but a few days after I came, the lockdown was announced and I got stuck here,” she says, adding that there is a family support system back home and unless there is a semblance of normalcy, it is better to stay in Odisha. While Vasuma had to wait for about a couple of hours, Dheeraj, another migrant worker from Uttar Pradesh, says he has been standing near the gates for longer. “Sir, I have been here for nearly around four hours waiting for my turn. People are going in, but it is slow and it is hot. Can you please help me?” he says, as beads of sweat form on his brow. A handful, who stay close, said they arrived as early as 5 am. A small group arrived at the Jubilee Hills Metro Station where police were entering details of each worker. But since they were residents of an area within the Banjara Hills police station limits, they were told to go there. The absence of public transport made travelling difficult and they they had to go on foot. Speaking to The Hindu, Cyberabad Police Commissioner V C Sajjanar said that by the end of the day, around 40,000 applications of migrant workers were processed. “These include those at various centres including Hitex, JRC Conventions and also at function halls within the commissionerate limits,” he said. Meanwhile, requisitions for buses to transport migrant workers to railway stations began to pour in at the RTC office. A senior official said that these requisitions for buses from the tri-commissionerate were being constantly updated. “As of now, I can say that approximately 600 buses will be used,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/migrants-throng-hitex-jrc-for-passes/article31514314.ece
06 May 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||11 more COVID cases in Telangana||The State reported 11 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the number of virus affected persons to 1,096. No deaths were reported during the day keeping the number at 29. In all, 43 persons were discharged from different hospitals taking the total number to 628. The total number of active cases in different hospitals was 439. Announcing this after a meeting of the State Cabinet, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said the planned and strategic manner in which the government acted after the first case was reported ensured successful containment of the virus. He recalled how Karimnagar was declared as containment zone after 11 Indonesians who were tested positive spent several days there. The government alerted police, health and other departments and took steps which ensured that there was not a single death. “Telangana became role model for the country in declaring containment zones and taking adequate measures in advance,” he said adding that the the government quickly understood the intensity and density of the virus and successfully contained it so far. The State was far ahead of the national average in terms of several parameters like recovery rate. The death rate was much lower at 2.64 as compared to national average of 3.67 while the recovery rate was 57.3 against national average of 27.4. The State, he said, was successful in flattening the curve and it was now time to intensity efforts to bring it down to zero. Recalling his interaction with representatives of pharma companies earlier in the day, he said firms like Bharat Biotech, Biological Evans and Shanta Biotech assured him that the virus for the vaccine was likely to be ready by August/September. “I am hopeful that the State will be leading the country and the world in the discovery of vaccine,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/11-more-covid-cases-in-telangana/article31514323.ece
06 May 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Guest faculty allege non-payment of salaries||Employees of several sectors are directly and indirectly hit by the current lockdown imposed for containment of COVID-19 spread, with no exception even for those from the public sector. University faculty too has to make do with only 50 % of their emoluments during these testing times, but the hardest hit are the guest faculty, also termed as part-time faculty by some universities. Allegations are surfacing that the guest faculties of a few universities are being denied payments during the lockdown period, and those on payments per class basis are not being given classes in order to save on their salaries. Guest faculty members from the Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RGUKT) are complaining that they have been deprived of salaries for the lockdown period, while the regular and contract lecturers are paid. The university has two separate groups even among the guest faculty, one on consolidated monthly pay and another on payment per class. Both groups have not received any payment for the duration since March 15, alleged a lecturer. “The academic year ended on March 15, after which lockdown was imposed. The faculty on consolidated pay of Rs. 30,000 per month has not received even a penny till now. Besides, though the university is running online classes, all the classes are handed over to the contract lecturers, in order to avoid payment to the guest faculty,” alleged Ramesh (name changed), a faculty member. Though domain ids were created for the guest faculty too initially for the online classes, later they were disabled, he said. Part-time lecturers of the Kakatiya University allege that they have not been paid even for the classes they conducted. The Kakatiya University Part-Time Lecturers Association is approaching the High Court demanding justice. “We taught the fourth semester starting from December, and the second semester from January, up to March 14 when holidays were declared. Later, the university has taken a decision not to pay the part-time lecturers for the lockdown period,” D. Mahesh, president of the Association said.  Academic almanac Besides, the university published the academic almanac at the beginning of May, when the syllabus almost came to an end, in which they falsely claimed that classes had begun from January 30, Dr. Mahesh alleged. “Still, they asked us to take online classes in April, for which we were asked to submit screenshots and bills raised from the colleges as proof. During the lockdown, who will issue us bills?” he questions. When sought his version, Administrative Officer of the RGUKT Rajeshwar Rao said a decision was taken to pay the guest faculty during lockdown, but the issue of fixing pay for the faculty who taught on per-class basis is still caught in bureaucracy. Kakatiaya University authorities were not available for a comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/guest-faculty-allege-non-payment-of-salaries/article31514297.ece
06 May 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Entomology wing gears up for vector control operations||GHMC Entomology wing has begun its vector control operations in the city in view of the upcoming monsoons and the possible proliferation of mosquitoes. The activities will be intensified in the first week of May, officials informed. The Entomology wing is already fully engrossed in COVID-19 control operations, as it is entrusted with the job of spraying disinfectant in containment zones, at the locations of hospitals and quarantine facilities, RTC buses, and other spaces of public gathering. Added to it are the anti-larval operations which include removal of water hyacinth growth from lakes, larvicidal spray in lakes by drones, door-to-door survey for control of dengue and other vector-borne diseases. Anti-larval operations will be taken up near all nalas, and indoor residual spraying is being done in all hotspot areas of malaria spread, Chief Entomologist A. Rambabu informed. Fogging activity too will be intensified in areas surrounding the Musi River, and other areas of high breeding sources. Besides, for the first time ever, machines to estimate the prevalence and density of the mosquitoes will be installed in all six zones, he said. The machines will attract mosquitoes, to provide sample for the analysis of mosquito species in each area, in order to take up the vector control operations. The machines are being installed at Peddacheruvu, HMT Nagar Park, Nacharam in LB Nagar Zone, Wahed Nagar in Malakpet, HUDA Park, Langar Houz in Khairatabad, Krishnakant Park, Yousufguda in Serilingampally, Maisammacheruvu, Moosapet in Kukatpally zone, and Brahmanwadi, Begumpet in Secunderabad. Meetings will be conducted with all medical practitioners with regard to the protocol of sample collection and treatment of fevers such as dengue and chikungunya. The government was caught off guard during monsoons last year. Vector control operations which were to be taken up during summer months, were neglected in the name of elections and the related work, due to which there was an explosion in the number of aedes aegypti mosquito species, which led to huge number of dengue and chikungunya cases. If the same predicament is repeated this year, the healthcare and corporation staff already under the COVID-19 pressure would be woefully short of resources to fight both the outbreaks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/entomology-wing-gears-up-for-vector-control-operations/article31514299.ece
06 May 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||State urged to expand testing||More than a hundred civil society organisations and members have addressed an open letter to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, demanding that measures be taken to de-link the spread of COVID-19 from Markaz Nizamuddin attendees, and to increase testing for the disease. Despite repeated warnings from World Health Organisation and ICMR, the Telangana government has focused only on the implementation of strict lockdown, the letter pointed out. Very small number of COVID-19 tests have been done by Telangana State despite ICMR’s suggestion for expansion of the testing beyond contact tracing and those returning from abroad. Government has not paid heed to health experts’ advice to test all frontline healthcare workers. Testing has been stopped even in hotspots such as Suryapet, the letter said citing news reports, adding that no rural or urban health centres have been prepared to treat coronavirus patients or suspects. Instead, the government has repeatedly blamed the Markaz returnees, leading people to believe that the virus spread solely from them, it alleged. The signatories included organisations such as National Alliance of People’s Movements, Help Hyderabad, Women and Transgender Organisations JAC, Hyderabad Muslim Women Forum, apart from several writers, activists, journalists, and academics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-urged-to-expand-testing/article31514300.ece
06 May 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Big crowds at police stations||Hundreds of migrant workers from different parts of the country on Tuesday began registering to travel back to their native places. Large crowds were witnessed at many police stations in the south zone where police officials made arrangements to help the workers with registration on an app custom-made for the purpose. As a large number of people turned up at the Mailardevpally police station, officials repurposed two function halls to process the number of workers. Workers hailing from Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Rajasthan, North East States, Haryana, Punjab, HP, Jammu & Kashmir were sent to Taj Function Hall while the papers of workers from Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat were processed at the Grant Function Hall. “I have not been asked for any money. They checked my Aadhaar card, noted down my phone number, clicked a photograph and handed over a slip,” said Pappu, who works in a restaurant and has registered to travel to Keonjhar in Odisha. If the ordeal appeared to end for some, it was in a balance for others. “We were caught near Balanagar on the way to Medchal and brought here. They are saying we will be sent in trains. We are waiting,” said Nanda Kishore, an AC mechanic from Brindavan Colony who wants to go home to Seoni in Madhya Pradesh. “There are 15 of us. We are struggling to get food and water here. It will be good if we can go earlier,” said Mr. Kishore squatting on the ground with his friends under a tree just outside the police station building. Police officials processing the registration kept the migrant workers in the loop about how the system will work. “We are collecting your details and accordingly, trains will be arranged. We will arrange buses from here to the railway station based on the information we get. You will get messages on your cellphone. You should not travel anywhere on your own,” said a police official to workers registering at the Farooqnagar bus depot. Falaknuma police station used a bus depot while Kachiguda police officials had to use three sites to process the throngs of workers planning to go back home. “We wanted to ensure social distancing. It would not be possible in one location so we are doing at the Kachiguda bus stand, Nimboliadda and Chappal Bazar,” informed a police official. However, details of the trains being provided and timings remained hush-hush. “We don’t know when the trains will depart. Even they don’t know. We are providing security,” said a police official at the Kachiguda Railway Station where squares have been drawn on the flooring for passengers to observe social distancing norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/big-crowds-at-police-stations/article31514307.ece
06 May 2020||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Furnish details of BPL families getting help: HC||Telangana High Court on Tuesday directed State government to furnish a detailed report as to how many below poverty line (BPL) families are being given groceries freely by it in the lockdown period. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy sought this information having taken up a letter written by a social activist S.Q. Masood as a PIL petition. The activist raised different issues like thousands of BPL families being left out without any help from the government in the lockdown as it had cancelled their white ration cards. The government rules made it mandatory for people to present their respective white ration cards to avail the free groceries and other assistance from the government. Those without any cards and people whose cards were cancelled have been left to their fate, the petitioner said. “Is it essential that white ration cards be presented to avail 12 kilos of rice per person and other groceries being distributed by government freely,” the CJ asked while hearing the petition. There could be some poor families belonging to other States who had come here for livelihood or work.  ‘Own people’ Now that they were living in the State, the government should treat them as its own people and should not go back in extending any help to them, the bench observed. “Why are the officials insisting on ration cards,” the bench sought to know. Advocate General B.S. Prasad, responding to the queries from the bench, said PIL pleas with similar subjects and issues were filed earlier were pending. Officials of departments concerned were already asked to secure information on the points raised. He sought time for presenting details on the matter. Directing the Registry to tag all PIL pleas of similar issues together, the bench posted them to Friday for next hearing. The petitioner also requested the HC to direct the government not to use biometric devices for delivery of goods under welfare schemes to check spread of coronavirus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/furnish-details-of-bpl-families-getting-help-hc/article31514325.ece

Ata-ur-Rahman (30) and his wife Nargis Khatoon (19) arrived with siblings and cousins at the Jubilee Hills Metro Station where police were enrolling migrant workers. When it was Nargis’ turn, she was turned away as Aadhaar card is mandatory. “I work as a kamdani worker at a boutique in Jubilee Hills. In Hyderabad, I live near Gayatri Hills. All of us have an Aadhaar card except my wife. I said we have her Class X certificate but they are not accepting this. I have my mother here and other family members,” Ata said. Nargis said that while Ata’s sibling, and cousins have Aadhaar cards, she is the only one in the family who does not. “What can I do if I do not have an Aadhaar card at this time? They are not accepting my Class X certificate. Is there no other way?” she said. The app which police use to digitally register and process migrants’ applications has 16 fields.

06 May 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Procure rain-drenched paddy at MSP, demands Uttam||The Telangana Congress staged a day-long satyagraha deeksha at the Gandhi Bhavan to highlight the government’s shortcomings in handling the COVID-19 and the delay in procurement of agriculture produce apart from the way welfare of the migrant workers was compromised with. Led by TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy the deeksha saw all the senior leaders participating, including Malkajgiri MP A. Revanth Reddy, TPCC working president Ponnam Prabhakar, MLA Jagga Reddy, ex-CLP leader K. Jana Reddy, ex-PCC president V. Hanumantha Rao, TPCC COVID-19 task force committee chairman Marri Shashidhar Reddy, Hyderabad City Congress president M. Anjan Kumar Yadav among others. Similar deekshas were held in all district headquarters. Later, speaking to reporters, Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy slammed both the Centre and State governments for neglecting the plight of migrant workers and demanded that the State government take corrective measures in procuring the agriculture produce from farmers. So far, he said only 25 lakh tonnes of paddy has been procured. Harvested paddy was getting wet due to unseasonal rains due to lack of availability of gunny bags and tarpaulin and farmers were facing huge losses due to the negligence. He demanded that State government procure entire wet paddy at the Minimum Support Price to protect the farmers from heavy losses. Migrants’ train fare He said that as directed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the PCC would take care of the travel cost of migrant labour in Telangana State and it was highly unfortunate that donations of hundreds of crores collected in the PM CARES Fund and CMRF were not put to use for free travel, food and other facilities for the migrant workers. He said it was highly regrettable that the State government has no data, not even rough estimation, on number of migrant workers in Telangana. “When the government is not even aware of their numbers, what help it could provide to them?” he asked. Mr. Reddy demanded the State government to convince the migrant workers not to leave Telangana as there would be huge vacuum, especially in the construction industry and this would badly impact the development process. However, if the migrant workers are firm on returning to their native State, then the State government should arrange special trains and Congress party would bear the travel cost for the needy ones. Mr. Reddy also cautioned the government against reopening the liquor shops and instead focus on reaching out to the poor families with monetary help of Rs. 5,000. Further, he demanded supply of quality rice to the poor at ration shops. He also urged the government to help the sweet lime farmers by purchasing their produce. The TPCC chief advised CM to focus on governance and administration than exploring means to target the opposition parties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/procure-rain-drenched-paddy-at-msp-demands-uttam/article31514329.ece

06 May 2020||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||CM attacks Congress, terms them ‘jokers’||Coming down heavily on the Congress party, the Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao charged them with misleading the farmers on procurement issues and advised them to select right issues to criticise the government or else they will lose respect. In response to the Congress party’s constant criticism on the procurement, he challenged them to prove if any other State in the country, including the Congress and BJP ruled States were purchasing agriculture produce at Minimum Support Price (MSP). “We are the only State to purchase every grain produced in the State,” he said. Using harsh words like ‘jokers’, KCR took objection the Congress leaders’ criticism on farmers issues and said in the Congress ruled Chattisgarh State MSP was not given for paddy despite their leader Rahul Gandhi assuring the same. “What face they have to criticise us,” he questioned. “Did they ever buy such huge farm produce when they were in power?” He also took potshots at the all party delegation meeting the Chief Secretary and asked what is the credibility of the parties that went with the Congress. How can their suggestions be taken seriously, he asked and said constructive criticism was not coming from the political parties and they can’t complain about being ignored. He also raised the Congress party delegation’s meet with the Governor Tamilisai Soundarajan and accused the Congress that it wanted more deaths in the State for its political advantage. Intensifying his attack on the Congress, the CM said the party ran away from the Assembly when he wanted to make a video presentation on Kaleshwaram project and the irrigation facilities. Instead of facing the truth they walked away from the Assembly and how can their views be construed as serious and suggestions constructive, he asked. ‘Wrong policies’ Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao charged that the Central government is following wrong policies as far as economy and fiscal strategy is concerned. Charging migrant labourers for train journey by Railways is not correct, he said adding that he was surprised that the Central government is not responding to requests of the State to defer FRBM loans: “We will wait for some time hoping to know if they have any better solution,” he told reporters. Mr Rao said he would strongly oppose amendments to the Electricity Act being planned by the Centre.

06 May 2020||V. Geetanath,TELANGANA||SCR runs two migrant specials||South Central Railway (SCR), before the break of dawn, ran two more migrant special trains, one from Telangana and another from Andhra Pradesh, carrying over 2,000 passengers towards Bihar and Maharashtra, respectively, early on Tuesday. Both the trains started almost simultaneously at about 3.30 a.m. — from Rayanapadu station near Vijayawada (AP) with about 1,200 passengers towards Chandrapur in Maharashtra and another train started from Ghatkesar station on the outskirts of Hyderabad carrying up to 1,240 passengers towards Khagaria in Bihar. Both were non-stop trains with halts only for railway personnel to change shifts on the way and senior railway officials informed that the Maharashtra-bound train had already reached its destination having covered 900 km while the train towards Bihar has to traverse more than 2,000 km and could be reaching late in the night or early hours. The governments of AP and TS have picked up the ticket costs for the travel, identified the passengers, thermal screened them and brought them to the departing stations in buses under police escort. “Government officials including police brought them to our stations in buses. They were also provided with food and drinking water. We will take care of their food needs during the journey,” they said, pleading anonymity. In fact, top SCR officials maintained total silence about the trains movement hours after they had departed even as Government officials were tweeting videos and photos! “We do not want people to unnecessarily converge at our stations expecting trains. These are services contracted for the States and paid by them,” maintained senior railway officials. Railway security personnel at the stations ensured that just about 50 persons are accommodated in each sleeper class coach to maintain social distance. Apparently, it costs railways about Rs. 15 lakh to run such non-AC trains and collecting the ‘nominal’ sleeper class fare with Rs. 50 extra will fetch upto Rs. 13 lakh depending on the distance these special trains are travelling. SCR had earlier run the country’s first migrant special from Lingampally station in the capital suburbs towards Hatia in Jharkhand on May Day transporting about 1,225 passengers. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has also requested General Manager Gajanan Mallya to run up to 40 special trains daily to transport labour towards Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and so on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/scr-runs-two-migrant-specials/article31514288.ece

06 May 2020||NEW DELHI,||Doctor harassed by his Dwarka housing society||A 36-year-old doctor who was on COVID-19 duty in March has alleged that he was harassed by his housing society in Dwarka for “being around COVID-19 patients”. He further said that the members stopped his domestic help from entering the premises. Mani Shankar Madhav and his wife, who is also a doctor, live in Dwarka North. Dr. Madhav, who is also the Chief Medical Officer at Pandit Madan Malviya Hospital, said that he was on COVID-19 duty in Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital from March 16 to March 31 and was quarantined thereafter. While working as the CMO in the private hospital, he said that three of his colleagues were tested positive, but he was tested negative. “For over a month, I am being ill-treated because I have stayed around COVID-19 patients. They do not enter the lift that I am in. Around 20 days ago, I was asked not to touch the main gate of the apartment. People changed their direction wherever I went,” he added. In his complaint to the police, he wrote: “They are treating me like I am a ‘COVID-19 carrier’ and anyone working or coming in contact with me can get infected. They blamed me for using the lift and advised me to kept my domestic help in my flat.” Dr. Madhav said that the housing society’s secretary is not allowing his domestic help to enter the premises. “We need our domestic help to cook meals as both my wife and I work, but the secretary refused. I even showed him the government order that allows domestic helps to resume work but he did not let me,” the doctor added. After his interaction with the secretary, the doctor approached the police “but they did not register an FIR or receive the complaint”. “I went to the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) where they directed me to meet another officer who said that had all this happened to me on duty, they would have registered the FIR but cannot do so in this situation because it is in my residence,” the doctor said. DCP (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said: “A complaint by Dr. Madhav has been received and it has been forwarded to the concerned authority. When a complaint for action is generated from the concerned authority, we will take legal action.” Dr. Madhav said that he plans to leave the society after the lockdown ends due to the ill-treatment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/doctor-harassed-by-his-dwarka-housing-society/article31514249.ece

The hike in diesel prices, DGTO president Rajender Kapoor argued, would affect the supply chain of basic commodities in addition to having a detrimental effect on the business of transporters which was already suffering due to the lockdown. “This will affect the State revenue and benefit neighbouring States.

Additionally, five out of 20 schools visited by the DRAA to monitor the distribution of ration, were also found to be shut, according to the report. “In eight schools we found that even those without e-coupons had turned up to avail ration. There was no facilitation or help desk in any of the schools to assist such persons in applying for an e-coupon and they were turned away without ration. In one school in Malviya Nagar, we found the school guard had taken up the task of helping people apply for e-coupons,” the report said. The DRAA also said that notices displaying the entitlement on e-coupons could not be located in most of the schools. Further the report said that 26 of the 40 shops which were open were found to be distributing grain to ration cardholders. “The other shops claimed that they were awaiting the arrival of the additional kits to start distribution of ration,” the DRAA said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/many-ration-shops-closed-say-food-rights-activists/article31514258.ece

Ganjam was a green zone till the start of the return of workers. Since May 3, three persons have tested positive in the district and all of them have links to Surat. Till a few days ago, over 2 lakh persons from outside Odisha had registered to return to the district. Ganjam Superintendent of Police Brijesh Kumar Ray said on Tuesday that around 17,000 persons were under quarantine in the Ganjam police district. Realising the gravity of the situation, the State government deputed five Deputy Secretary-rank Odisha Administrative Service officers to assist the local administration. The district administration and police have warned of strict action against anyone breaking quarantine rules or in the case of unruly scenes. On Tuesday, three persons were injured in a clash between two groups in a quarantine centre in the Jagannathprasad block of Ganjam district. The police has lodged a case. The police has also registered cases against 12 persons in relation to workers leaving two quarantine centres on May 3. All those who left have been tracked down and brought back to the quarantine centres. More arriving An assessment at quarantine centres in 18 panchayats in Ganjam district by the Youth for Social Development has hinted that they are mostly unprepared with respect to the number of migrants expected to return. The total number of beds in 120 quarantine centres was 6,950, which would not be enough for the 10,914 migrants from these areas who had registered till April 28.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/return-of-migrant-workers-increases-fears-of-contagion/article31514242.ece

Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta on Tuesday said concerns had been expressed on this count during several calls received on the newly launched tele-counselling facility from anxious police corona warriors and their families. Coping with COVID-19 “At present, there are over 48,000 police personnel engaged in curfew enforcement and relief measures across the State, and the facility was launched on April 20 to equip police officers and their families with additional information and skills to cope with the psychological aspects of the COVID-19 duties, including a high degree of risk of contracting infection,” he said. Mr. Gupta said several calls were received regarding issues of health and safety of women police personnel who were either lactating mothers or mothers of children under the age of five years, who needed the mother’s constant presence. “Separation from young children was causing hardship, worry and anxiety, especially in cases where the husband and wife were both members of the police force,” said the DGP, adding that in response to these concerns, it was decided not to deploy such women on front-line duty. Similar apprehensions were expressed with respect to personnel suffering from various medical issues, especially respiratory distress, which could aggravate their risk factors, he said. Directions issued Mr. Gupta said directions have been issued to ensure that police officers with pre-existing medical issues, and women police personnel with children below 5 years of age, are not posted on front-line duties in view of their peculiar and specific circumstances.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/relief-for-police-personnel-with-medical-conditions-in-punjab/article31514238.ece
06 May 2020||Ghaziabad,||Former MLA moves HC over refusal to permit azan||Former Aligarh MLA Zameerullah Khan has approached the Allahabad High Court over Hathras District Magistrate Praveen Kumar Lakxar’s refusal to allow azan, the Muslim call to ritual prayer, in local mosques. “The District Magistrate is misusing his powers. Some Hathras residents approached me for support. When we didn’t get any response from higher officials of the Aligarh zone, we approached the Allahabad High Court and our appeal has been admitted. It has been merged with the PIL of Ghazipur MP Afzal Ansari as the DM of Ghazipur had also passed a similar oral order,” he said. On Tuesday, the Bench of Justice Shashi Kant Gupta and Justice Ajit Kumar heard the arguments through videoconferencing and reserved judgment. Local social worker and former municipal councillor Raees Abbasi told The Hindu that he, along with locals, met the DM many times and told him that azan would not lead to any violation of lockdown but he refused to listen. “Azan is given by the muezzin and it doesn’t take more than 90 seconds. We told him that nobody would rush to the mosque after azan,” he said. He asked if there was an order from Lucknow, how was azan still being allowed in neighbouring districts of Aligarh, Mathura and Agra. “Azan helps the faithful during Ramzan as they get to know the sehri and iftar time [meals before daybreak and after sunset],” he added. Mr. Laxhar declined to comment on the case saying it was sub judice, but pointed out that azan was not being allowed in Ghazipur and Farrukhabad as well. “I don’t buy the argument that if neighbouring districts were allowing it, we should allow. On March 26, it was mutually agreed upon that no religious activity would take place in temples and mosques,” he claimed. When asked whether he was confusing between azan and namaz and if he had an order from the State government, he refused to comment and insisted on waiting for the High Court order.

Officials said they have not yet been able to crack the AFS “mystery”. The disease first detected in Kenya in 1921 had never been reported in India before. Data provided by the State’s Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department said 2,904 pigs died till 5 pm of Tuesday. The deaths were reported from 310 villages across six eastern Assam districts. On Monday, Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal asked the Veterinary and Forest departments to work with the National Pig Research Centre of Indian Council of Agricultural Research for saving the State’s pig population. According to a 2019 census, the State has 21 lakh domestic pigs and more than 7 lakh farmers are involved in rearing them for the pork business worth at least Rs. 8,000 crore annually in the northeast. “The Chief Minister asked doctors and other functionaries to ensure cleanliness and total sanitisation of the pig habitable areas and use disinfectants,” a statement from the Chief Minister’s Office said.  ‘No vaccine’ Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Minister Atul Bora said combating AFS was proving to be a challenge since no vaccine or medicine has been discovered so far. “The AFS mortality rate is almost 100%. The focus is on preventing the disease from spreading and we have worked out some plans in consultation with officials, veterinary experts and pig farmers,” he said. He added that the government was weighing options other than culling, as advised by the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/assam-swine-fever-death-toll-rises/article31514231.ece

06 May 2020||Geneva,||Trump’s lab claim remains speculative: WHO||The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that Washington had provided no evidence to support “speculative” claims by the U.S. President, Donald Trump, that the new coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab. “We have not received any data or specific evidence from the U.S. government relating to the purported origin of the virus — so from our perspective, this remains speculative,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual briefing. Scientists believe the killer virus jumped from animals to humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat. Top U.S. epidemiologist Anthony Fauci echoed the WHO’s statement in an interview published on Monday by National Geographic . “If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what’s out there now, (the scientific evidence) is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated,” Mr. Fauci told the magazine. “Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that (this virus) evolved in nature and then jumped species,” he said. U.S. President Trump, increasingly critical of China’s management of the outbreak, claims to have proof it started in a Wuhan laboratory. “Enormous evidence” And U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday said “enormous evidence” backed up that claim, although the U.S. intelligence community last week said it would continue to study whether the outbreak stemmed from infected animal contact, or a lab accident. China has vehemently denied suggestions the lab was the source. “Like any evidence-based organisation, we would be very willing to receive any information that purports to the origin of the virus,” WHO’s Mr. Ryan said. “If that data and evidence is available, then it will be for the U.S. government to decide whether and when it can be shared, but it is difficult for the WHO to operate in an information vacuum in that regard,” he added. WHO expert Maria Van Kerkhove stressed during Monday’s briefing that there were some 15,000 full genome sequences of the novel coronavirus available, and “from all of the evidence that we have seen... this virus is of natural origin.” The global toll topped a quarter of a million on Tuesday, with the U.S. government predicting a further surge in fatalities as an international vaccine drive garnered $8 billion in pledges. Since the disease first surfaced in China late last year the number of confirmed cases has reached almost 3.6 million while fatalities have topped 2,51,000. Europe remains the hardest-hit continent with around 1,45,000 deaths while the U.S. has recorded close to 68,700, the biggest single-country toll. The bleak figures were compounded on Monday by an internal government estimate that forecast the COVID-19 infection rate in the U.S. could surge eight-fold to 2,00,000 a day by June 1, and the daily death toll could rise to 3,000.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trumps-lab-claim-remains-speculative-who/article31513951.ece
06 May 2020||May 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Amid high inflation, Iran to get a new currency||For many years, Iran’s government debated changing the national currency, the rial, by basically slashing four zeros off its face value — an acknowledgement of how American sanctions and economic mismanagement have contributed to inflation in the country. On Monday, the Iranian Parliament essentially took that step, authorising the replacement of the rial with another basic unit of currency called the toman. Each toman will be worth 10,000 rials under the new system. The COVID-19 pandemic, which turned Iran into a regional epicentre of the disease, appears to have played a decisive role, contributing to a further devaluation of the rial since February. Since 2018, when the Trump administration repudiated the nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions on Iran, the value of Iran’s currency has fallen by roughly 60%. “Eliminating the four zeros is a necessary action to simplify financial transactions,” an Iran government spokesman, Ali Rabiei, said in a Twitter posting. The Guardian Council, a body of conservative clerics that supervises Parliament, is expected to ratify the law, and then the Central Bank will have two years to implement the change — removing rials from circulation and issuing tomans instead. The change is the outcome of a draft Bill presented in early 2019 by the Governor of Iran’s central bank, Abdolnasser Hemati. He noted that the currency has been devalued 3,500 times since 1971 and that Iran had no choice but to “save the face” of its national currency, according to Iranian official media reports. Earlier attempts by President Hassan Rouhani’s government to change the currency as far back as 2016 had remained in limbo. Two views Supporters of the change said slashing the extra zeros would vastly simplify financial calculations in Iran by eliminating the need for Iranian shoppers to carry loads of rials to make purchases, which they must do now because of inflation. On Monday, the rial’s exchange rate was 1,56,000 to the dollar. But opponents argued that the plan was an added expense at a time when the government was already facing a budget deficit of between 30-50% for this coming fiscal year. The effect of the currency change, the critics said, amounted to just cosmetic window dressing. Fereydoun Khavand, an Iranian economist in Paris, said governments typically arrived at changing the national currency as the last stage of an economic overhaul like European countries had done after the Second World War or Turkey in recent years. Iran has done the opposite, Mr. Khavand said, partly because of the crippling effect of U.S. sanctions, which have severely limited the country’s ability to sell oil or to conduct international financial transactions. Under those circumstances, he said other basic economic changes the Iranian government may want to undertake are difficult. “You typically fix the economy first and then change the currency,” said Mr. Khavand. “The government is in a financial bind with no prospect of financial aid coming from outside or from inside so they are trying this,” he added.Nytimes||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/amid-high-inflation-iran-to-get-a-new-currency/article31513945.ece

A test version of a cargo return capsule also separated from the rocket, Xinhua added. The spaceship will one day transport astronauts to a space station that China plans to complete by 2022 — and eventually to the Moon. It will have capacity for a crew of six. Return on Friday The spaceship and capsule are slated to return to a landing site by Friday after completing their test flights, Ji Qiming of the China Manned Space Agency told a press conference. Leader of the command headquarters for the flight mission Zhang Xueyu said the launch had “strengthened confidence and determination” for the next stages of China’s space programme. The United States is so far the only country to have successfully sent humans to the Moon. But Beijing has made huge strides in its effort to catch up, sending astronauts into space, satellites into orbit and a rover to the far side of the Moon. The successful maiden flight of the 54-metre Long March 5B — which has a take-off mass of about 849 tonnes — should reassure China, following failures of the 7A model in March and 3B model in April. “The new spaceship will give China an advantage in the area of human spaceflight over Japan and Europe,” said Chen Lan, an independent analyst at GoTaikonauts.com. Assembly of the Tiangong space station is expected to begin this year and finish in 2022.  China plans to send an astronaut to the Moon in about a decade and then build a base there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-launches-new-rocket-spacecraft/article31513943.ece
06 May 2020||Caracas,||Venezuela detains 2 Americans||Two Americans were detained in Venezuela on Monday on suspicion of plotting to topple President Nicolas Maduro’s government, which has accused U.S.-backed Opposition leader Juan Guaido of bankrolling the scheme. The arrests came a day after the government said it foiled an “invasion” from the sea, killing eight assailants and capturing two others. Mr. Maduro appeared on state television to show the passports of Luke Denman, 34, and Airan Berry, 41, and told the Venezuelan military high command that the pair were members of the U.S. security forces. Attorney General Tarek William Saab earlier told reporters that “hired mercenaries” had signed a $212 million dollar contract with Mr. Guaido using funds “stolen” from state company PDVSA. The U.S. — one of more than 50 countries backing Mr. Guaido as Venezuela’s acting President as he challenges Mr. Maduro for power — has slapped sanctions on PDVSA and allowed Mr. Guaido to use funds from frozen accounts belonging to the firm'’ Houston-based subsidiary Citgo. ‘Guaido to blame’ Mr. Saab said Mr. Guaido had signed a contract with former U.S. special forces soldier Jordan Goudreau, linked in several press reports last week to an allegedly bungled attempt to topple Maduro. Mr. Goudreau, an Iraq and Afghanistan veteran, is accused of training a mercenary force to invade Venezuela that disbanded after Colombian authorities seized a weapons shipment meant for the group. Mr. Saab also shared on social media a video of Mr. Goudreau, who now runs a private security firm called Silvercorp USA, in which the former soldier claims an operation against Mr. Maduro’s regime is ongoing. Mr. Guaido’s press team released a statement on Monday denying the accusations and insisting it had no agreements with private security firms. On Sunday, Venezuela claimed a group traveling on speedboats and embarking from Colombia tried to land before dawn in the northern coastal State of La Guaira but were intercepted by the military and special police units.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/venezuela-detains-2-americans/article31513952.ece

06 May 2020||May 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Pathways to a more resilient economy||When complex systems come to catastrophes, i.e. critical points of instability, they re-emerge in distinctly new forms, according to the science of complex systems. The COVID-19 global pandemic is a catastrophe, both for human lives and for economies. Economists cannot predict in what form the economy will emerge from it. Machines do not have the capacity for emergence. Once built, their capabilities inevitably reduce with increasing entropy. On the other hand, living systems evolve and acquire new capabilities over time. Fritjof Capra and Pier Luigi Luisi point out in The Systems View of Life: A Unifying Vision that among all living species, humans have a special ability. Only humans consciously develop new concepts, new scientific ideas, and new language in their search for new visions. Institutions of governance are human inventions for directing human endeavours and for providing stability. Thomas S. Kuhn explained in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions why new ideas are invariably resisted by prevalent power structures in societies. The scientific establishment determines which ideas are worthy of admission. The King’s advisers do not want outsiders to dilute their influence in the court. The Establishment resists change. Therefore, fundamental reforms of ideas and institutions in human societies are always difficult, until a crisis. Challenging principles The COVID-19 catastrophe has challenged the tenets of economics that have dominated public policy for the past 50 years. Here are seven radical ideas emerging as pathways to build a more resilient economy and a more just society.  i) “De-Growth”. The obsession with GDP as the supreme goal of progress has been challenged often, but its challengers were dismissed as a loony fringe. Now, Nobel laureates in economics (Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen, Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and others) are calling upon their profession to rethink the fundamentals of economics, especially the purpose of GDP. A five-point ‘de-growth’ manifesto by 170 Dutch academics has gone viral amidst the heightened Internet buzz during the lockdown. Goals for human progress must be reset. What should we aspire for? And how will we measure if we are getting there?  ii) Boundaries between countries are good. Boundary-lessness is a mantra for hyper-globalisers. Boundaries, they say, impede flows of trade, finance, and people. Therefore, removing boundaries is good for global growth. However, since countries are at different stages of economic development, and have different compositions of resources, they must follow different paths to progress. According to systems’ theory, sub-systems within complex systems must have boundaries around them, albeit appropriately permeable ones, so that the sub-systems can maintain their own integrity and evolve. This is the explanation from systems science for the breakdown of the World Trade Organization, in which all countries were expected to open their borders, which caused harm to countries at different stages of development. Now COVID-19 has given another reason to maintain sufficient boundaries.  iii) Government is good. Ronald Reagan’s dictum, “Government is not the solution... Government is the problem”, has been up-ended by COVID-19. Even capitalist corporations who wanted governments out of the way to make it easy for them to do business are lining up for government bailouts.  iv) The “market” is not the best solution. Money is a convenient currency for managing markets and for conducting transactions. Whenever goods and services are left to markets, the dice is loaded against those who do not have money to obtain what they need. Moreover, by a process of “cumulative causation”, those who have money and power can acquire even more in markets. The “marketization” of economies has contributed to the increasing inequalities in wealth over the last 50 years, which Thomas Piketty and others have documented.  Justice and dignity v) “Citizen” welfare, not “consumer” welfare, must be the objective of progress. In economies, human beings are consumers and producers. In societies, they are citizens. Citizens have a broader set of needs than consumers. Citizens’ needs cannot be fulfilled merely by enabling them to consume more goods and services. They value justice, dignity, and societal harmony too. Economists’ evaluations of the benefits of free trade, and competition policy too, which are based on consumer welfare alone, fail to account for negative impacts on what citizens value.  vi) Competition must be restrained: Collaboration is essential for progress. Faith in “Darwinian competition”, with the survival of only the fittest, underlies many pathologies of modern societies and economies. From school onwards, children are taught to compete. Companies must improve their competitive abilities. Nations too. Blind faith in competition misses the reality that human capabilities have advanced more than other species’ have, by evolving institutions for collective action. Further progress, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals for example, will require collaboration among scientists in different disciplines, and among diverse stakeholders, and collaboration among sovereign countries. Improvement in abilities to share and govern common resources have become essential for human survival in the 21st century. vii) Intellectual property belongs to the public. The earth’s resources must be conserved. We are living in an era of knowledge. Just as those who owned more land used to have more power before, now those who own knowledge have more power and wealth than the rest. Intellectual property monopolies are producing enormous wealth for their owners, though many were developed on the back of huge public investments. Moreover, powerful technologies can be used for benign or malign purposes. It is imperative to evolve new institutions for public ownership of technologies and for the regulation of their use. Purpose of enterprises The paradigm shift necessary after the crisis will not be easy. There will be resistance to shifts in social, economic, and political power towards those who have less from those who have more within the present paradigm. The financial crisis of 2008 was a crisis of liquidity in the system. Recovery was achieved by putting more fuel into the system. The system then moved on; in basically the same shape it was before. COVID-19 has revealed structural weaknesses in the global economy. Putting fuel in the tank will not be sufficient. The vehicle must be redesigned too. While global attention understandably is focused on relief and recovery, this is the time to design for resilience. The economic system cannot be redesigned by domain experts devising solutions within their silos. Such as, trade experts recommending new trade policies, intellectual property experts recommending reforms of intellectual property rights, and industry experts recommending industry policies. All the pieces must fit together. Most of all, they must fit into the new paradigm, which will be very different to the one in which the experts had developed their domain knowledge. Innovations are required at many levels to create a more resilient and just world. Innovation is essential in the overall design of the economy. Innovations will be required in business models too, not just for business survival but also to move businesses out of the 20th century paradigm that “the business of business must be only business”. Changes will also be necessary in our life patterns, our work and consumption habits, and in our personal priorities. The redesign of economies, of businesses, and our lives, must begin with questions about purpose. What is the purpose of economic growth? What is the purpose of businesses and other institutions? What is the purpose of our lives? What needs, and whose needs, do institutions, and each of us, fulfil by our existence?

06 May 2020||May 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Boost wages to stimulate India’s growth||Impoverishment among English workers during the early years of the Industrial Revolution had prompted Leicester framework knitters to frame this resolution in 1817: “… if liberal Wages were given to the Mechanics in general throughout the Country, the Home Consumption of our Manufactures would be immediately more than doubled, and consequently every hand would soon find full employment” (cited in E. P. Thompson’s The Making of the English Working Class, 1963). One of the moving images from today’s India is of migrant workers suddenly feeling desolate in their places of work and desperate to return to their villages, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak. The helplessness felt by the workers as seen from those images calls for nothing short of a radical rethink. We need to plan for an economic growth driven by rising — and not stagnant — wages, and a development model that is dispersed far and wide across the country, and not centred in a few big cities. Patchy data Out of India’s total workforce of 471.5 million, only 12.3% are regular workers receiving some form of social security, while the rest are mostly casual workers or petty producers surviving under various degrees of informality (figures for 2018). A vast majority of migrant workers belong to the category of informal casual workers. Available data on the size of the migrant workforce in India are rather patchy. According to the 2011 Census, there were 54.3 million persons (workers as well as non-workers) in the country who migrated from one State to the other. The ‘heartland’ States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh accounted for 48.9% of these inter-State migrants, much higher than their combined share in India’s population (of 36.8%). Workers migrate from villages to urban centres as the growth of rural incomes has not kept pace with the rising numbers and aspirations of the young in the countryside. Those engaged in agriculture and allied activities as a share of the combined workforce in U.P., Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh fell to 49.1% in 2018 from 64.1% in 2005. This meant that, between 2005 and 2018, 19.3 million persons left agricultural work in these four States alone and sought job opportunities elsewhere. Workers’ shift out of agricultural occupations as well as out of their rural bases is set to accelerate, unless new economic opportunities are created in the countryside. A majority of the workers who leave villages find themselves in the bottom rung of the urban economy, earning a precarious living as drivers, factory workers, security guards and domestic helpers. Their livelihoods are directly or indirectly linked to economic activities that cater to the demand from the relatively affluent in India and abroad (such as from industries producing sophisticated IT products). Widening the demand base Even as they work long hours often under exploitative conditions, informal workers manage to earn and consume only very little. According to the official consumption-expenditure surveys (for 2011-12), the richest 5% accounted for as much as 64.4% of the value of overall consumption of durable goods (such as of furniture or refrigerators) in urban India. The share of the poorest 50% was only 13.4%. The COVID-19 pandemic is set to cause long-term disruptions to the existing structure of demand dominated by the consumption of a privileged few. Economic activities have now been halted for weeks on end, and no end seems to be in sight for the downward slide in export demand, which began with the U.S.-China trade tensions. Businesses in India and elsewhere are concerned that even after the lifting of the lockdown, they will have to operate at a fraction of their installed capacities due to the sagging demand conditions. The crisis in the economy can be overcome only by widening the sources of demand, by raising the consumption of and investment for the poor. Consider, for instance, the setting up of industries linked to food processing or affordable housing in rural areas. The multiplier effects of such investment will be huge. Food processing can help boost farmer incomes, reduce food spoilage, create rural employment and, above all, improve the availability of nutritious food to the needy. Broadening the demand base requires policies that differ fundamentally from conventional economic ideas. The mainstream argument has been that firms should try to reduce costs by squeezing wages. But cutting wages will shrink markets further and deepen the crisis during a depression. Instead, firms should assist in raising workers’ wages and incomes, and thereby, in enlarging the size of the markets. Even with higher wages, profit rates will not dip because the larger demand allows firms to utilise their capacities better. Increase government spending For rejuvenation of demand, it is critical that governments increase spending on the economy, in areas such as infrastructure and innovation. Government spending can boost the “animal spirits” of the private investors, as had been suggested by John Maynard Keynes amidst the great depression of the 1930s. The ideas of Keynes and his followers had helped to fuel an unprecedented economic boom in the U.S. and European countries for almost three decades after the end of the Second World War in 1945. A striking feature of this ‘golden age of capitalism’ was that the real wages kept rising, providing the much-needed succour to the working classes, who had long suffered due the war and the inequalities of the depression years. Battered by an oppressive economic system and now by an unpredictable virus, India’s working classes deserve long-lasting relief and comfort. What is needed is a massive expansion in government spending, which will uplift workers’ skills as well as their incomes and purchasing power. This will include investments in healthcare, education, roads, rural infrastructure, agricultural research, public transport, and so on — perhaps similar in scale and ambition to the post-war reconstruction efforts in western nations following the Second World War. A grave challenge to future growth are the ageing demographic structures in most parts of the globe. In such a context, the rising numbers of the young in India, especially in its northern and eastern States, offer a potentially new source of demand that could sustain the economy over the next few decades. Lifting the wages and the spirits of the wearied Indian worker could just be the dose required to bring cheer to the Indian and the global economies.

06 May 2020||May 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Getting over pandemic stage fright||This year, on World Health Day, April 7, a patient asymptomatic for COVID-19 was admitted with chest pain in a hospital in Maharashtra. Diagnosed with coronary artery disease, he was treated surgically. Five days later he developed COVID-19 pneumonia and eventually succumbed. Did he come infected or did he get infected in the hospital? Either way, evidence is clear for community transmission. The hospital was closed for containment of further transmission. Similar events have recurred across several parts of the country. At the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, many doctors, nurses and other staff became infected with SARS-CoV-2 and had to be quarantined, depleting a range of health-care professionals. On April 8, a government hospital in Jahangirpuri, Delhi, was closed after 14 doctors and nurses were found positive for the novel coronavirus infection. Recent reports indicate that one in 15 SARS- CoV-2 infected individuals in the national capital is a health-care worker. What about individual medical practitioners? On April 9, a 62-year-old physician in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, to whom many slum-dwellers came for care, died of COVID-19, despite treatment. The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) told the media that his contact history was unknown — most likely from a patient. Did the doctor lower his guard, as the official version was “no community transmission in India”? The next day, an Ayurvedic physician, aged 65, died of COVID-19 in Indore. Again, the CMO confessed that contact history was unknown: perhaps from some patient. On April 14, a popular 76-year-old “family doctor” died of COVID-19 in Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh. After retiring as Medical Superintendent of Kurnool Medical College, he ran a private hospital. On March 25, he closed the hospital, complying with the lockdown. He died; his wife and children tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The doctor’s contact history could not be traced; most probably from a patient. A 55-year-old neurosurgeon died in Chennai on April 19, with severe COVID-19. Once again the contact remains unknown — one of his patients is a good guess. Without proclamation of community transmission, respiratory precautions were perhaps deemed unnecessary by these doctors. In all these situations, a correct understanding of the nature of the epidemic and acknowledging community transmission would have alerted the medical profession and avoided a loss of lives. Epidemiologically important What is community transmission? One infected person in the community, unaware that he is infected, infects others in the community. If A was infected by a known contact B, in epidemiology we say B infected A. When contact is unknown we say ‘someone in the community’ infected A; hence the term “community transmission”. When did community transmission begin in India? On March 18, Tamil Nadu reported the second infection in the State, an example of community transmission. A 20-year-old man travelled by train from Delhi and had no contact with any known infected person. In Chennai, he developed symptoms and tested positive on March 18. So community transmission had started in India by, or before, mid-March 2020. Every pandemic emerges from a country of origin — the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic originated in Mexico and COVID-19, in China. For every other country, the initial infection would be “imported” from another country. Importation means that the traveller got infected in a foreign country but developed symptoms and got diagnosed in the host country. If secondary transmission occurs from the imported infection, it is qualified as contact of imported case. If the importation-contact further infects someone in the host country, such infection by in-country transmission is called “local”, “indigenous” or “autochthonous” infection. This is epidemiologically important information. It indicates the start of in-country epidemic, in other words, when the imported infection becomes indigenous. As the epidemic advances, community transmission is natural and inevitable. If the intention is to intercept chains of transmission, then there should be acknowledgement of indigenous (community) transmission. Necessary step A country denies community transmission at its own peril. In times of epidemics, leaders may be tempted to deny the problem: but, prudence is the better part of valour. Once community transmission of COVID-19 came to light on March 18, warning all medical professionals, coupled with strong recommendations for strict implementation of appropriate protective gear by all health professionals in all levels of health care, was the correct public health procedure. The lives of many health-care professionals need not and should not have been lost on account of semantic mis-interpretation of epidemiology. Admitting community transmission does not lower the honour of mother India in the eyes of foreigners; on the contrary it boosts the sagging morale of health-care professionals, prevents avoidable loss of manpower in the face of the epidemic, and preserves the integrity of the entire health-care system. Protecting the lives of health-care professionals by acknowledging community transmission and strict implementation of appropriate personal protective equipment will ensure that there is no attrition of the pool of health-care professionals needed to deal with the epidemic. Such a courageous step, taken with openness, only enhances national prestige. Dr. T. Jacob John is Retired Professor of Virology, Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore. Dr. M.S.

06 May 2020||May 06 2020 00:00 IST,||The case for a gradual exit||COVID-19 has caused the world to slow down and, in many countries, completely shut down in a way not known in recent history. The impetus for the shutdown was driven in large part by a document from the Imperial College, London, which modelled options to handle the pandemic in high-income countries, specifically the U.K. and the U.S., which it called mitigation and suppression. Mitigation refers to methods to reduce the numbers infected and protect the most vulnerable. Measures advised are home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspect cases, and physical distancing of those at most risk of severe disease. The measures described under suppression are more or less what have come to be called lockdowns but do not include complete shutdown of work. The aim of suppression is to prevent the infection from spreading to others. The authors said, in order to be effective, lockdowns needed to be in place for 12 to 18 months which is the time estimated for an effective vaccine to be available. Waiting for herd immunity The International Labour Organization reports that nearly 50% of the world’s labour force is in immediate danger of losing their livelihood. The Secretary-General of the UN, Antonio Guterres, says women are especially suffering the deadly impact of lockdowns. At a conservative estimate, for over 50% of the world’s population, a two-year lockdown would mean the end of their world. Due to conflicting statements from the scientific community and governments, there is widespread fear that lifting the lockdown would mean disaster. Proponents of the concept of herd immunity have been criticised for being irresponsible. Herd immunity to a particular infection is a situation when so many in the population have immune antibodies that, although the pathogen is still in circulation, it can rarely find a susceptible host, and so illness from that pathogen is uncommon and cannot spread. For SARS-CoV-2, estimates are that 60%-70% of the population needs to have antibodies for the herd effect to occur. Critics point out that with the current estimate of 1% of the infected dying, waiting for herd immunity will still result in a lot of deaths. This argument ignores four factors: first, the number of deaths can be brought below 1% if we protect the most vulnerable, which is easier than locking down the entire population. Second, as statistics show, lockdowns also result in a very large number of deaths. Third, the pandemic will end much sooner than two years if herd immunity occurs. Fourth, we do not know the actual number infected up to now, as no country has reliable data. Therefore, a gradual exit, using mitigation measures, will save the greatest number of lives. Critics also state that it is not certain if infection with this virus leads to immunity. This is based on the fact that a small number of people who tested positive were quarantined and allowed to leave quarantine after testing negative, only to test positive again later. There are other explanations for this phenomenon which are more robust than the ‘no immunity’ hypothesis. First, no test is absolutely fool-proof and false positives and false negatives, though infrequent, can occur with the RT-PCR test too. Second, it is possible, though unlikely, that for a small section of the population, the antibody response may be transient. Nearly all human infections produce a natural antibody response, which protects from reinfection. Some of these responses wane with time and require another challenge to establish a level high enough to be protective. In general, the antibody response to infection is more robust than the response to a vaccine. Vaccines are preferred because the much milder infections that they induce have a far lower mortality and morbidity than natural infection. There are very few infections, like the bacterial Haemophilus influenzae B, where the vaccine is engineered to produce a protective antibody response that the natural infection does not. The best evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is able to induce protective antibody production in humans comes from the observation that most people get rid of the virus without the help of any medicines. The most effective response We are faced with two alternatives, both of which will lead to loss of lives. An effective complete lockdown requires physical distancing at a level not possible in India without tremendous resources from the government. It has to be continued till a vaccine is available. If the lockdown is continued in the way it is now being done, it will decimate the poor. Using force to isolate the poor is not acceptable in a democracy. Mitigation measures, taking the people into confidence, and facing the pandemic by deploying available resources in the best possible way is the most ethical and effective response.

06 May 2020||May 06 2020 00:00 IST,||It’s time for a virtual judiciary||During the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19, it has become clear that many activities can simply be done online. Over the last decade, Indians have embraced technology in a greater way than ever before. We all have apps on our phones — Amazon, Flipkart, Swiggy, Uber, Ola, Zomato, etc. — that help us procure various goods and services. Today, in these exceptional circumstances, ‘work from home’ is a concept whose time has come like never before. Many offices are gearing up for the new normal of staying at home and working, as restrictions are expected to continue for an indefinite period. This brings us to the question, how can we use technology to ensure speedy disposal of cases? Many hurdles The pendency of cases in various courts in India is staggering. The Economic Survey of 2019-2020 dedicates a chapter to pendency of tax cases and revenue cases. The Survey mistakenly argues for more court infrastructure and judges to solve the problem. On the contrary, the existing infrastructure is grossly under-utilised. There are tribunals such as the Income Tax Tribunal that function only half-day most of the time. To make matters worse, most courts are closed for Christmas and summer vacations. Judges are not accountable for efficiency and performance. Thousands of Indians cannot afford to go to court as legal costs are high and legal procedures are complicated. It is a fact that most tax matters do not necessitate personal hearings. Tax cases reach tribunals and higher courts after lower authorities record all the facts. The High Courts and the Supreme Court deal with issues or interpretation of the law. The bane of the court system is that lawyers on both sides need to be physically present in court. Cases are often adjourned due to various reasons. It is in this context that we make the case for a virtual judiciary. In such a scenario, we can submit all the papers via mail. The judge can decide the case based on all the available information. Wherever the judge requires clarifications, he or she can seek the same through email. Typically, the judge, after considering all the material available, can pass a draft order and send it to both sides for any comments which they may want to provide. Thereafter, the judge can, after considering the comments, pass the final order. This will enhance the quality of the judgment and also eliminate obvious errors. An efficient judiciary The use of the court hall to decide such matters is superfluous. Not only will a virtual judiciary result in substantial savings in costs but will also lead to speedy disposal of cases. The productivity of lawyers will increase substantially as visits to courts and long waiting hours will be more an exception than a rule. If this practice is extended to other civil cases, efficiency will double, even treble, in judicial functioning. The fact that the jurisdiction of a court is defined by geography makes no sense in matters such as taxation and company law. The change to remote, non-personal electronic court hearings will change this. All judges should be empowered to handle any case, wherever it originates. This will result in multiple advantages — the principal one being better utilisation of manpower and infrastructure by equitably distributing the work. Also, malpractices will be limited as there will no longer be familiarity between lawyers and judges in a city. While India grapples with a crisis on the health and economic front, we need to think out of the box. We need a change in mindset regarding the way we work.

06 May 2020||May 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Dangerous drift||The deaths last Saturday of four soldiers and a police officer in an encounter with terrorists near Handwara town in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kupwara district, call attention to, among other things, a difficult summer ahead. It is unusual and disproportionate for just a couple of terrorists to take down five highly skilled and motivated soldiers — a Commanding Officer of a battalion in the rank of a colonel, a major, two other ranks and a special operations group policeman in the rank of a sub inspector — in a firefight. The details on offer are sketchy, yet provide compelling evidence of an operation that went horribly wrong. On Saturday afternoon, receiving intelligence that terrorists were present in a house in Changimulla village, Colonel Ashutosh Sharma of 21 Rashtriya Rifles, Major Anuj Sood, Naik Rajesh Kumar, Lance Naik Dinesh Singh and J&K Police Sub Inspector Shakeel Qazi, and possibly others reached the site which had a building and a cowshed adjoining it, and an intense firefight commenced. All the enemy fire came from the cowshed, not the building. Then there was a lull for more than an hour during which the team apparently decided to approach the house and use the vantage of the upper floor to fire at the terrorists in the cowshed. They entered the house and there was a fresh firefight but no communication from the Colonel and his team. Then it was noticed that their communication instrument was being used by the terrorists. That is when realisation came all was not well, and firing ensued all over again. This time when it was over, there were seven bodies. The way this operation ended will have ramifications, on both morale and operating procedures, on future operations of this kind that go on all the time in this shadowy theatre of proxy war. It is certainly a coincidence that has not gone unnoticed that though the encounter ended tragically, news or details of it did not percolate, till well after Sunday’s fly past and show of solidarity. It should be evident by now to most that changing the nomenclature and status of J&K has not addressed any of the underlying causes of unrest and angst. Neither has it deterred Pakistan from its steadfast goals. Since the beginning of the year, in 127 days, as many as 55 terrorists have been killed in the region, roughly one encounter every two days. In the unhealthy vacuum that New Delhi has created since August 5 last year, such encounters have done nothing other than aid the impulse of the disaffected to embrace arms. As the dangerous drift in J&K continues, New Delhi must realise it has reached the point of diminishing returns and should look for ways to arrest this trend.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/dangerous-drift/article31513922.ece
06 May 2020||May 06 2020 00:00 IST,||The mark of zero||With containment strategies in place even before the first case of novel coronavirus was detected on January 30, Kerala appears to have finally hammered the curve flat. On May 1, for the first time, the State reported zero new cases, and again on two consecutive days — May 3 and May 4. Zero fresh cases on three days in May appear to be more than a blip. If in April there were early signs of Kerala gaining an upper hand over the virus, its control became clear from the fourth week of April. Since April 22, except on four days, the number of new cases reported has remained either the same or fewer than the number of recoveries. The small number of cases reported so far — 499 — demonstrates how excellent its containment efforts have been. What is more remarkable is that 462 of those infected have fully recovered, including an elderly couple, aged 93 and 88 years, and there have been just three deaths — a case fatality rate of 0.6% against the national average of 3.3%. The containment success can be traced back to how Kerala did not wait for directions from the Centre but instead led from the front. When the number of cases increased to 12 on March 10, a day before WHO declared the coronavirus a pandemic, Kerala shut down all educational institutions and entertainment centres, banned large gatherings and appealed to people to avoid visiting religious places. If it realised the merits of containing virus transmission by quickly tracing all the contacts during the 2018 Nipah outbreak, it repeated that to perfection this time. Little wonder that on May 2, the ICMR lauded the State for the “unparalleled” containment and testing strategies and referred to it as the “Kerala model”. But under no circumstances can the State lower its guard as the outbreak can resurge by exploiting the weakest link, as was seen in the sharp spike in Singapore, in dormitories. Kerala has very good health-care infrastructure in place, down to the primary health-care centres. But what sets it apart from the other States is the manner in which it followed textbook epidemiology protocols to the tee, and beyond, and well before the ICMR advocated them, as well as the entire health-care infrastructure working in tandem despite being decentralised. Political leadership, and the close and complete involvement of the government at all levels with the bureaucracy and local community have been a huge advantage. The very different health-seeking behaviour and high literacy too have played a pivotal role in the war against the virus. While active involvement of all the stakeholders who complement each other especially during the crisis has worked in Kerala’s favour, these are not measures put in place to fight coronavirus but what has been a legacy of the State. It is a success born out of decades-old social revolution and development. This is also the reason why other States, even if they emulate the measures adopted by Kerala to fight the virus, may not be able to achieve the same level of success.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-mark-of-zero/article31513923.ece
06 May 2020||May 06 2020 00:00 IST,||4 students die in anti-war protests||The Vietnam war, which had virtually ceased to be a contentious domestic issue since President Nixon initiated his disengagement plan, has once again become the cause of major political unrest in the United States in the wake of his decision to send U.S. troops into Cambodia. The truce that had more or less been in effect between war protesters and the Government since the anti-war moratorium of last November has now been shattered by countrywide protests against Mr. Nixon’s new Indo-China policy. The seat of unrest is once again the universities and the campuses, and yesterday (May 4) alone, students in a dozen colleges around the country staged demonstrations, at least one of which ended in violence and tragedy. At Kent State University in Ohio, during a confrontation between students and national guardsmen, four students, two of them girls, were killed by gunfire. This incident — the first involving so many fatalities — sent a shock wave through the country. From California to Rhode Island and from Pennsylvania to Arizona there have been less ugly incidents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/4-students-die-in-anti-war-protests/article31513931.ece
06 May 2020||MUMBAI,||Banking stocks wilt under selling spree||Equity benchmarks fell for the second straight session on Tuesday as banking stocks came under heavy selling pressure after S&P Global Ratings flagged off fresh concerns related to stress and uncertainties in the Indian banking sector. The 30-share Sensex, that traded in the green for most part of the trading session, dipped in the red in the last hour of the session, ending the day at 31,453.51, down 261.84 points, or 0.83%. State Bank of India was the worst performer among the Sensex pack, shedding 4.64%. Financial sector heavyweights such as Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance and HDFC were among the top losers in the benchmark. The broader Nifty ended the day at 9,205.60, down 87.90 points, or 0.95%. The Nifty Bank and the Nifty PSU Bank lost more than the benchmarks, shedding 2.39% and 3.28%, respectively. In a statement, S&P Global Ratings said that Axis Bank’s results for the financial year 2019-20 “underscore high levels of stress and uncertainty across the Indian banking system. In our opinion, systemic pressures for Indian banks could rise owing to the recently announced extension of the nationwide lockdown to check the COVID-19 spread,” stated the release. The negative sentiments were not limited to the banking sector as the overall market took a beating. On the BSE, 1,561 stocks lost ground as against only 838 gainers. Incidentally, the drop in the Indian market on Tuesday came amid a positive trend in most of the Asian markets. The benchmarks of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, China, Philippines and Singapore all gained ground. “Our markets are struggling at higher levels and today, despite global peers suggesting some strength, we completely shrugged them off towards the latter part of the session,” said Sameet Chavan, chief analyst, technical and derivatives, Angel Broking. “The major culprit in this late sell off was the financial stocks. Some of the marquee banking names along with NBFC stocks, started falling ferociously and this development weighed down heavily on our market,” he added. Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) continued their selling spree on Tuesday as net sellers at almost Rs. 1,060 crore. Domestic institutional investors net sold shares worth Rs. 995 crore. Meanwhile, the rupee recovered 10 paisa to close at 75.63 against the dollar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/banking-stocks-wilt-under-selling-spree/article31513914.ece
06 May 2020||Mumbai,||Axis’ earnings reflect banking stress: S&P||Axis Bank’s January-March earnings in which it reported an almost Rs. 1,400 crore loss on higher provisioning reflects stress and uncertainty of the Indian banking system, rating major S&P said. Axis had identified more than 10% of its customers (25% of its loan book by value) as at April 25, 2020, who had availed a payment moratorium offered by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The bank’s additional bad-loan provisioning of Rs. 7,700 crore, including Rs. 3,000 crore related to the COVID-19 pandemic, led the lender to report a loss. The rating major said Axis’ credit costs for the quarter were higher but some of them was precautionary. “Prudent provisioning will certainly help the bank take care of the future credit costs. The significant number of the bank’s borrowers opting for moratorium could be partly due to some of the stronger borrowers also opting to conserve liquidity in these tough times,” S&P said. “The negative outlook on Axis reflects our view that the economic risks for the bank, and the Indian economy at large, remain high. We expect the bank to maintain its strong market position and adequate capitalisation over the next 18 months,” it said, adding large unanticipated asset quality shocks could result in a downgrade of the bank which could happen if the bank’s stressed assets rise significantly beyond the system average or economic risks in India rise sufficiently for a downward revision of S&P’s Banking Industry Country Risk Assessment on the country. It said India’s fiscal position had been weak for a long time. “This, along with the country’s high general government debt, constrains our sovereign credit rating on India,” it said. S&P expects the Indian economy to achieve a ‘powerful’ recovery in the fiscal year ending March 2022, assuming general containment of the global pandemic and a significant improvement in global economic conditions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/axis-earnings-reflect-banking-stress-sp/article31513916.ece
06 May 2020||Kolkata,||Stay on reappointment of Birla Group director quashed||A Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court has quashed restrictions imposed by a Single Bench in August 2019 on publication of results of various resolutions put to vote at the Annual General Meetings (AGMs) of three Birla Group companies. The resolutions of three companies — Birla Cable, Vindhya Telelinks and Birla Corporation Limited — included reappointment of director, payment of dividend to shareholders and resolution for payment of profit-based remuneration to the non-executive chairman, a release from the group said. The August 2019 Single Bench order imposed a stay on publication of the results on voting of the AGM resolution of the companies. In the case of Birla Corporation Limited, the resolutions included reappointment of director, payment of dividend to shareholders, and resolution for payment of profit-based remuneration to the non-executive chairman. ‘Violated natural justice’ The Birla Group companies appealed before the Division Bench in November last year, arguing that the orders were in violation of natural justice and fair play, violating provisions of the Companies Act. In Monday’s judgment, Justice Sambuddha Chakrabarti and Justice Arindam Mukherjee of the Division Bench set aside the orders passed by the Single Bench. The Division Bench observed that the August 2019 order was not sustainable in view of the fact that the orders or directions were passed interfering with the holding of AGM by the companies, which are separate juristic entities, without first deciding the issue of jurisdiction. The results of voting at the AGMs of Vindhya Telelinks and Birla Cable, which could be published earlier, show that Harsh Vardhan Lodha, chairman, was reappointed as director of the two companies with more than 99% of votes cast in his favour. Mr. Lodha has also been a Director of Birla Corporation Limited since 1996, the release noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/stay-on-reappointment-of-birla-group-director-quashed/article31513917.ece
06 May 2020||MUMBAI,||BHEL invites foreign firms to use idle units||State-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) has called for Expression of Interest (EOI) from foreign companies who wish to use its factories currently lying idle, for manufacturing from India. The economic disruption across the world due to COVID-19 has highlighted the dangers of manufacturing activities being concentrated in a single location and the need for diversification of supply chains and manufacturing. BHEL’s move, which comes at a time when many global companies are looking to exit China, may help them to invest in India - one of the fastest growing economies, said analysts. “In order to further promote ‘Make in India’ and support international companies for setting up manufacturing in India, BHEL has floated an Expression of Interest (EOI) inviting global companies to partner with it and leverage its facilities and capabilities for setting up a manufacturing base in the country,” BHEL said in a statement. “The partnership can shorten the time to set up manufacturing facility for the incoming partner, while also helping BHEL utilise its idle factories and employees. With power sector demand still struggling, this is a significant diversification move. India has so far lagged in grabbing a share of the global supply chain shift from China to other emerging markets. One of the key reasons for this underperformance is a lack of readymade land bank, delay in approvals and fear of dealing with Indian bureaucracy,” Amar Kedia of Emkay Global said. BHEL, a Maharatna CPSE under the Department of Heavy Industries, has 16 state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities spread across the country with substantial land bank as well as extensive built up industrial, commercial and residential spaces. BHEL’s manpower strength of about 34,000 includes 9,000 engineers with qualifications and experience in cutting edge technologies. BHEL also has ongoing technology partnerships with some of the major global manufacturing and engineering companies as well as relationships with leading national laboratories and institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/bhel-invites-foreign-firms-to-use-idle-units/article31513907.ece

For the new Creta alone, which was launched just days before the lockdown, we have received close to 20,000 bookings. Many buyers are looking at immediate delivery... We have enough stocks at the dealership for now... BS VI stock is available,” Tarun Garg, director (sales, service and marketing) at Hyundai Motor India told The Hindu . “Zero sales (in April) does not mean zero demand. In April, we were not allowed to open and customers could not come to us. We firmly believe that they want to buy and will come out once lockdown is over,” he said. He, however, added the company did understand that because of the state of the economy, general anxiety and consumer sentiment, the demand may take some time to pick up. “... it is difficult to put a time and number to it. “We need to see how the next few weeks turn out in terms of COVID-19 (pandemic),” said Mr. Garg.

06 May 2020||NEW DELHI,||IOA to prepare a white paper||Moving forward in its attempts to find a detailed roadmap for the resumption of sporting activities in the country, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has sought inputs from all the NSFs to create a white paper with practical suggestions. The IOA president Narinder Batra on Tuesday sent out a detailed presentation seeking inputs for a blueprint from medical, athlete, social, competitive and economic perspectives. “Instead of waiting for government directions, the sports community can come together to evolve some norms for resumption of all sport and establish sports administrators as aware, caring, thinking and responsible,” he wrote. Concerns to be addressed Batra also highlighted some of the major concerns federations would have to consider before resuming activities — sharing of training gear by athletes, managing social distancing in athletic events, ensuring safety in events like badminton or tennis that use common equipments in competition and high-intensity sports like hockey and squash that see indirect body contact. Seeking to make the effort a time-bound exercise, NSFs and State Olympic Associations (SOA) from priority sports have been asked to submit their respective white papers on resumption of sports activities by May 20 while the rest have to submit their inputs by May 31. Comprehensive report A comprehensive report collating all the papers would be released in June. The stakeholders for the white paper would include everyone connected with sports in the country — athletes, coaches and other support personnel, match officials, government authorities, sponsors, media and fans. Strategy Some of the pertinent questions for the stakeholders would include the right time and strategy to resume training — at all levels including school and college sports — changes in sports on resumption vis-a-vis personal hygiene, social distancing and self-protection and norms for public participation in sports. Those who have to submit their inputs by May 20 include NSFs for archery, athletics, badminton, boxing, cycling, equestrian, golf, hockey, fencing, judo, shooting, rowing, swimming, table tennis, tennis, weightlifting, wrestling and yachting. Among SOAs, Assam, Delhi, Haryana, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are among the 16 States who have to submit by May 20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ioa-to-prepare-a-white-paper/article31514064.ece
06 May 2020||May 06 2020 00:00 IST,||Geniuses are those who hit targets others cannot even see||Last week Erapalli Prasanna sent me a black-and-white picture of the Fabulous Four, the great spinners of his time, with a note saying, “Genius in the middle.” It set me thinking about both the person — it was Salim Durrani in the middle — and the concept. Durrani played key roles in three significant Indian victories. At home in 1961-62, he claimed ten wickets in the final Test and had eighteen in the last two as India won their first series against England. Ten years later he dismissed Garry Sobers and Clive Lloyd in quick succession in Trinidad, to pave the way for India’s maiden win against the West Indies. Durrani’s predicament The world class left arm spinner who came close to equalling the record for the fastest 50 in Tests was a crowd favourite as much for his six-hitting (on request!) as for his easy-going nature and film star good looks. Yet he played only 29 of the 65 Tests India played during his career of 13 years; he was dubbed the “wayward genius” by the media and struggled to erase the former description while trying to live up to the latter. I saw him as a young boy in Bengaluru where he masterminded Central Zone’s triumph in the Duleep Trophy. So certain were the authorities that West would beat Central in the semifinal that they prepared for a West v South final. But Durrani helped beat both West (seven for 111 and 83) and South (nine for 87 and 83 not out). And he did it with a smile. It was magical. “Genius” is, admittedly, an overused word in sport, sneaking into profiles of beloved sportsmen as a shorthand for highly skilled or statistically significant performers. Strangely, or perhaps not, few women athletes have been identified as geniuses, although logic and common sense dictate that many would fit into the category. In a celebrated essay, the late David Foster Wallace wrote of aspects of Roger Federer’s tennis when for the viewer, “the jaw drops and eyes protrude and sounds are made that bring spouses in from other rooms to see if you’re O.K.” The physical reaction taken care of, Foster then gets into the metaphysical: “Federer is one of those rare, preternatural athletes who appear to be exempt, at least in part, from certain physical laws,” he wrote. Abstract definition Yes, but what is genius in sport? The abstract definition is incomplete if not downright confusing, while the concrete is limiting, and likely to either exclude most or include everybody. Your genius is thus different from my genius which is altogether different from his or hers. We find what we think are synonyms for the word : talented, masterful, brilliant, consummate, natural. No single word would suffice, there are more. It is this ambiguity that allows geniuses to crop up everywhere and extend the definition of the term to include favourite players and merely successful ones. In the early years of the 19th century, the ‘philosopher of pessimism’ Schopenhauer provided a description that has not been improved upon: “Talent is like the marksman who hits a target that others cannot reach,” he wrote, “genius is like the marksman who hits a target others cannot even see.” We are still some way from a well-rounded description. Perhaps we need to look at some geniuses to find what’s common to them. In cricket, Sobers apart, there aren’t too many in my list: Shane Warne, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, Brian Lara, and from among those we haven’t watched in action, Trumper and Ranji. Others might take more wickets, score more runs or have better averages, but the players above seem to be hitting targets others cannot even see. They are blessed with originality, whip out creative solutions under pressure and usually appear to be performing at a level above the other 21 players in the game. They seem to have greater options too, either bowling or batting, options that don’t even arise in the minds of the rest. In sport (and maybe in other fields too), you can be a genius for one performance. Or one series or one stroke or one delivery. The true genius has his moments closer together. Lack of ‘consistency’ What the term “genius” does not include seems to be consistency, the ability to bore the spectators or an evenness in performance over a period (although the names mentioned finished with impressive career figures). When geniuses struggle on the field, they look like they have somehow forgotten the abracadabra. “I don’t know about his being wayward,” Sunil Gavaskar once wrote about Durrani, “but he is certainly a genius. A genius whom the authorities have never bothered to understand.” Perhaps that is the occupational hazard of being a genius – you tend to be misunderstood because by definition, you cannot be understood!||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/geniuses-are-those-who-hit-targets-others-cannot-even-see/article31514058.ece

06 May 2020||New Delhi,||Razor-sharp Sania stumps Purav||Purav Raja made Sania Mirza go through five strokes, real racquet in hand, during the popular ‘Chai with Raja’ Instagram show. The 33-year-old Sania sportingly obliged and showed, with her razor-sharp responses to a variety of questions, that she could win any contest, with or without a racquet. Sania, who has known Purav since the age of eight, showed a lot of warmth and camaraderie to make it an enjoyable show for the thousands of tennis enthusiasts who had tuned in. Joking that she was honoured to be the first lady on the show, Sania said she might have felt offended that Mahesh Bhupathi was the first guest on the show, but then she saw how ‘’under prepared’’ he was! “You know me too well. So, I am nervous,” said the six-time Grand Slam champion before opening up for a lively chat. Sania pointed out that Jelena Jankovic also had not won a Grand Slam singles title despite being World No. 1, as Purav’s notes had only Dinara Safina’s name. She did get both names. She recalled five players who had trained with her in December and named the IPL captains of the Hyderabad team with ease. She stumped Purav by recalling the names of seven Davis Cup team captains — Leander Paes, S.P. Misra, Vijay Amritraj, Anand Amritraj, Mahesh Bhupathi, Rohit Rajpal and Jaidip Mukerjea. She was candid in saying that a lot of people would get that right. On another note, Sania said Bollywood was close to her heart. She said that many would be able to connect with the inspiring journeys of people who became superstars. Farah her favourite She named Farah Khan as her favourite and added Riteish Deshmukh and Salman Khan to the list. When asked who was more competitive, Paes or Bhupathi, Sania said that both were incredible competitors and it was impossible for her to pick one over the other, as she had won with both. Naming Steffi Graf as her favourite player, Sania said being World No. 1 in doubles was more satisfying than being 27 in singles because “if you are No. 1 in the world in anything, it is special”.

06 May 2020||HYDERABAD,||Gardener and plumber have turned saviours for the HCA||A gardener and a plumber are turning out to be saviours for the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) as far as maintenance of the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium here is concerned! Due to the lockdown, the regular groundstaff is unable to perform its daily duties. But M.L. Venkatapathi Raju and plumber Prabhakar, with the help of security personnel at the stadium, are ensuring that the venue, boasting of one of the best outfields in the country, keeps its reputation intact. Ground maintenance is never easy in scorching heat, especially given the fact that both Raju and Prabhakar are not specialists. The former, having worked both at the HCA Gymkhana Academy and the Uppal Stadium nets under HCA curator Y.L. Chandrasekhar, has some knowledge about the maintenance part. “We took this up as a challenge and feel happy that we could do a decent job while responding to the request of the HCA officials,” Raju told The Hindu on Tuesday. Watering the ground After gardening work at the stadium, Raju moves on to the stadium’s main ground along with Prabhakar to water the entire playing area with the help of a sprinkler system. “Based on the inputs from curators Y.L. Chandrasekhar and D. Mukesh Kumar, we are ensuring the pitches, too, are in good shape,” Raju said. With HCA secretary R. Vijayanand coordinating with the dedicated staff, one thing that is certain is that whenever action begins, the Uppal Stadium will be in perfect condition and fit to host any match. “There were some technical issues with the borewell and sprinkler. Luckily, we got them repaired even during the lockdown and are pleased with our job,” said the gardener-plumber combine. The HCA top-brass, too, should be delighted and why not?||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/gardener-and-plumber-have-turned-saviours-for-the-hca/article31514279.ece
06 May 2020||Kochi,||Time for major reforms in volleyball||Despite having had greats like ‘Pappan’ T.D. Joseph and Jimmy George, India has never played volleyball at the Olympics. Even medals in Asian Games are rare, the last being the bronze in 1986 in Seoul and before that a silver in 1962 in Jakarta. For a sport which desperately needed support from all over, the faction feud in the Volleyball Federation of India in the last few years made life difficult for the players. Ranking slips Ranked 34th in the world six years ago, India has now slipped to 78. And with the VFI's battles now fought in courts, players are not sure about anything. The VFI appears to have even messed up the ProVolleyball League (PVL), which made its debut last year and promised to change the sport in a big way. S. Gopinath, who played alongside Jimmy George in the 1974 Teheran Asian Games, felt that the situation could damage the sport badly if VFI’s problems are not sorted out immediately. Future is dark “Unless the government intervenes and takes some bold steps, the future is very dark. We had a split in the national federation in the seventies and the team could not go for the 1970 Bangkok Asian Games,” said the former international. “In 1974, it was the Indian Olympic Association which selected and sent the team for the Asian Games, not the federation. The situation appears to be the same now. “We had a boom in the early 80s and 90s but our interest was only to participate in events like the Asiad and Asian championships. We didn’t aim beyond that, we didn’t prepare to qualify or play in the Olympics.” M. Ukkrapandian, India’s captain at last year’s Asian championship and the 2018 Asiad in Jakarta, felt PVL was a big step towards the goal of playing in the Olympics. Step towards Olympics “It brought about a massive change, the way we played and prepared, also the massive exposure on TV. That would have been a big step towards the Olympics,” said the star setter from Chennai. “Even American David Lee (2008 Olympic gold medallist), my PVL teammate, said Indians have the talent but we just need support to succeed. I hope the league comes back,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/time-for-major-reforms-in-volleyball/article31514339.ece
06 May 2020||NEW DELHI,||Paes takes a walk down nostalgia lane||Twenty-four years after winning an Olympic medal in Atlanta, Leander Paes is proud to have sustained his career in a demanding but equally rewarding sport like tennis. Paes fondly recalled his career being in the same era as that of chess genius Viswanathan Anand, cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar and football captain Bhaichung Bhutia.  The 46-year-old Paes, who has won 18 Grand Slam doubles and mixed doubles titles, took the opportunity to express his gratitude to his coaches, including T. Chandrasekaran, David O’Meara, Ted Murray, Zeeshan Ali, Akhtar Ali, Anwer Ali, Nandan Bal, Manoj Vaidya and Nar Singh, while addressing hundreds of coaches around the country on a webinar.  “Suresh and me go a long way with our passion for the game and ability to keep the fire burning,” Paes said about coach Sureshkumar Sonachalam, who was anchoring the workshop.  Paes also vividly recalled a conversation that he had in 1987 with Nar Singh, “sitting in Rohit Rajpal’s room”. Nar Singh too recalled it, saying, “When Leander came to play a tournament for the first time in Delhi, he was told to be in touch with me. “I told him his serve toss had to be tuned a bit. I asked him to practise it for 10 minutes and forgot about it. He went to the clay courts and was practising for 45 minutes. That was his commitment at such a young age.” Recalling minute details of his interactions with various coaches over the last 35 years, Paes also thanked his father, the 75-year-old Dr. Vece Paes, for his guidance and parental care. Train travel “When I was nine, my dad taught me to travel by train on my own for a tournament at the Bandra Gymkhana (Mumbai). He came with me the first day and gave me Rs. 100 every day afterwards, to be on my own. Every day I kept winning. “On Sunday, it was the Aga Khan hockey tournament final, and he was playing. He came with me for tennis in the morning, when I beat Sandeep Kirtane, who was technically sound. The court was fast, but I took the ball early and did not let the ball bounce,” recalled Paes about his first success. Paes remembered how his father would encourage him to play video games to improve his hand-eye coordination by wielding the joystick.

But the boys were excellent in 1985, with Sunny (Sunil Gavaskar) leading from the front.” When asked what he fondly remembers the most from the tournament, Shastri replied: “Stuffing Pakistan in the final is my favourite memory.” He believed that after Pakistan, New Zealand was the toughest competitor in the championship. “New Zealand were a fantastic team. They might not have the superstars but they are always a team known for punching much above their weight. “We had to play our A-game in the semifinals to beat them.”  The boys were excellent in 1985, with Sunny (Gavaskar) leading from the front||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/indias-wcc-side-could-have-given-kohlis-team-a-run-for-their-money/article31514074.ece

Raghu, on Tuesday. “It is difficult to keep them mentally focused and motivated. We do supervise their training. Moreover, it is very hard for them to train.

The restructured format of the Nationals means there would be separate championships for States, institutions and academies across age-groups. While the deadline to express interest to host the 11th edition in 2021 is May 11, the deadline for inter-department and academy Nationals is June 5. The window to host the senior competitions has been set for January 1 to April 30 and February 15 to April 30 for the junior and sub-junior categories.

06 May 2020||New Delhi,||HC declines interim stay on airing Netflix show||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday declined any interim stay on airing of Vir Das’s ‘Hasmukh’ on Netflix, noting that any such order would interfere with the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under the Constitution. Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva observed that the show was a “dark satirical comedy attempting to expose the ills of various professions” and one of the satirical techniques of criticising a particular subject or character “was to exaggerate it beyond normal bounds so that it becomes ridiculous and its faults can be seen”. The court was hearing a plea which alleged that the webseries was maligning the image and reputation of lawyers. ‘Satirical picture’ “The very essence of democracy is that a creative artist is given the liberty to project the picture of the society in a manner he perceives. One of the prime forms of exposing the ills of the society is by portraying a satirical picture of the same,” the court said. “Stand-up comedians perform that very purpose. In their portrayal they use satire and exaggerate the ills to an extent that it becomes a ridicule. In the humorous portrayal of the ills of the society the stand-up comedians use satire,” it said. Netflix argued that the series’ theme makes it clear that the intention was not to defame or malign any particular profession, but the idea was to “spin a dark satirical comedy about evil in various walks of life and its impact on society”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-life/hc-declines-interim-stay-on-airing-netflix-show/article31514055.ece

While 29 of them were brought back, the police said they are trying to trace the remaining ones and have registered a case. DCP (West) Deepak Purohit said that on Monday, 56 migrant workers were shifted from a government school-cum-shelter home in Punjabi Bagh to a newly converted shelter home in Tilak Nagar.

06 May 2020||GURUGRAM,||‘Allow domestic workers back in houses or ramp up relief provisions’||Questioning the rationale behind the district administration’s recent guidelines leaving the decision of domestic workers with the residents’ welfare associations, Gharelu Kamgar Union (GKU) — a domestic workers’ union — on Tuesday demanded the local authorities to either ramp up their lockdown relief provisions or ensure that they are allowed to return to work. GKU convener Maya John, in a press statement, said shortly after the COVID-19 triggered lockdown was partially relaxed on May 4, the woes of the nearly two lakh domestic workers in Gurugram saw no end but a troubling escalation. ‘Basic right to life’ “It has been the experience of GKU that the relief measures of the authorities have been piecemeal and truncated at most, leading to a situation wherein domestic workers have not only been robbed of their livelihood during the lockdown but also their basic right to life and liberty,” read the statement, adding that there had been an undeniable failure of the authorities to provide an uninterrupted and adequate supply of rations as well as nutritious cooked food to Gurugram’s labouring poor. “Both the governmental authorities and their associated NGOs/social welfare workers have proved incapable of providing day-to-day succor during the lockdown, leading to the current distress of domestic workers,” said Ms. John. Consequently, the authorities have conveniently concealed their failures by allowing resumption of work, leaving of course, the final decision to the numerous RWAs, she added. ‘A safe measure or not’ “A lot of ambiguity about the re-employment of domestic workers continues to prevail. While there are various individual employers and a large number of domestic workers who wish to have the work resumed, the larger collective authority of the RWAs is skeptical about whether the measure is a safe one to take or not,” read the statement. In a situation of deadlock like this, GKU strongly pressed the Haryana Government and Gurugram administration to either ramp up their lockdown relief provisions so that domestic workers were not compelled to return to work immediately, or, to ensure that they were allowed to resume work, the statement read. The union demanded that the Gurugram administration called for an immediate review of the situation unfolding on the ground, including a status report of the food distribution network in all wards of Gurugram and not allow the deadlock to prevail any further with respect to RWAs. It also demanded that the Haryana Government and Gurugram district administration discussed a concrete wage and rent relief package for domestic workers for April and May.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/allow-domestic-workers-back-in-houses-or-ramp-up-relief-provisions/article31514219.ece
06 May 2020||GURUGRAM,||Police dig up dirt tracks in Jhajjar to stop cross-border movement||Many roads and rough tracks through fields along the Haryana-Delhi border have been dug by the Jhajjar Police and the locals to prevent the unauthorised cross-border movement of people to the district from the national Capital. Jhajjar along with three more Haryana districts has sealed its border with Delhi in view of the several COVID-19 cases traced back to the Capital. Shri Bhagwan, husband of Issar Heri sarpanch, said the trails through the fields and the roads leading from their village to Delhi were dug by the police. “I got a call from the Station House Officer a few days back informing me that he had directions from the higher-ups to dig up the roads. The police brought an excavator and dug up the roads,” said Mr. Bhagwan. Sidipur sarpanch Jai Kishan said the roads were dug up in the presence of the police to prevent the cross-border movement but they shared cordial relations with the people in Delhi villages. Mr. Kishan said the residents in the several Jhajjar villages bordering Delhi worked in Delhi Police, municipal corporations of Delhi and other departments and returned to their homes every evening posing a danger to them. “It is a contagious disease and spreads really fast. A single COVID-19 positive can put the entire village into high risk,” said the Sarpanch. Some 30 rough tracks in around a dozen Jhajjar villages along the border were frequented by the people coming from Delhi. Superintendent of Police, Jhajjar, Ashok Kumar, said rough tracks through the fields were dug by the police, but not the tar roads. “The tar roads have been dug by the local villagers. The locals themselves have been going from house-to-house requesting the Delhi employees in the villages to not to return homes. The number of COVID-19 cases has gone up in Jhajjar and many of them are traced to Delhi,” said Mr. Kumar. COVID-19 cases in Jhajjar As per the latest statistics, Jhajjar has 64 positive cases and results for 296 samples are awaited.  The tar roads have been dug by the local villagers. The locals themselves have been going from house-to-house requesting the Delhi employees in the villages to not to return homes.
