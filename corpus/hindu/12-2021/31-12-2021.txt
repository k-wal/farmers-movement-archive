31 December 2021||CHENNAI,||Heavy rain batters Chennai||Thousands of motorists and commuters were stranded for several hours on arterial roads in Chennai on Thursday evening as waterlogging caused by sudden and incessant heavy rain led to a gridlock. The city last witnessed such a situation in November 2015. Aerial visuals showed buses, cars, autorickshaws and scooters caught in a bumper-to-bumper jam along Anna Salai, Broadway, NSC Bose Road, Nelson Manickam Road, Koyambedu, Mylapore, Vadapalani, Porur and other areas. Some of those who left their offices returned to their point of origin, having covered less than a kilometre in an hour. Metro Rail stations witnessed unprecedented crowds as people desperately tried to reach home. Three electrocuted A 13-year-old boy in Mylapore, an elderly woman at Otteri and a woman at Pulianthope were electrocuted. After returning from Tiruchi, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin visited the Flood Control Room in the Ripon Building, the headquarters of the Greater Chennai Corporation, around 11.45 p.m. and reviewed the situation. On a cloudy day, it started with a drizzle. An intense spell set in by 3 p.m. and left several areas, including T. Nagar, Mylapore, Teynampet and Nungambakkam, reeling under water. These are the rainfall figures (in mm) till 10.30 p.m.: MRC Nagar (214.5), ACS Medical College (161.5), Meenambakkam (143), Satyabama University (61.5), Anna University (150) and YMCA Nandanam (181.5). The city will receive rain till January 3, the India Meteorological Department said. While the sky will be cloudy, there may be thunderstorm, with light to moderate rain, in some areas. Though rain was forecast, no one expected so much, say weather bloggers. Deputy Director-General of Meteorology S. Balachandran said, “The interaction of the easterly winds at the lower level and the westerly winds at the upper level has brought rain to the city. We had given a forecast of rain. The rain will continue till January 3.” Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, said the unexpected fast movement of the easterly trough over the Chennai coast gave the city the heavy rain. “This is a highly localised event, and it is very difficult to predict such short spells of this intensity.” Expressing surprise over the quantum of rain, weather blogger Pradeep John said, “We can call this a cloudburst. The rain rate was amazing. We received close to 10 cm in an hour,” he said. Another weather blogger K. Srikanth said, “There have been such episodes in the past too. In November, we saw the city receiving 20 cm. Similarly, a few years ago, Taramani got 10 cm. At least we had a few weather models in November that did predict such heavy spells, but this time no one saw it coming,” he said. The India Meteorological Department predicted thunderstorm with heavy rain for Friday at isolated places in Cuddalore, Villupuram and Mayiladuthurai districts, Puducherry and Karaikal, and thunderstorm with moderate rain at many places in the the rest of Tamil Nadu’s coastal districts and a few places in the interior districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sudden-downpour-batters-chennai/article38075533.ece
31 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Decision on vaccine for ‘precaution’ dose soon||The “precaution” dose to be given to healthcare workers, frontline workers and those over 60 with co-morbidities may not necessarily be a repeat dose, senior Union Health Ministry officials said on Thursday. “A decision will be taken this week. The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) as well as other bodies are assessing the available data on the safety and efficacy of all the vaccines globally and there are meetings every day. Before January 10, we will have a set of clear-cut guidelines on what the recommended vaccine would be,” Balram Bhargava, Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said at a press briefing. The debate on third doses comes amid a spike in infections in India with the number of daily cases crossing 10,000 and several States suggesting that it is due to the Omicron variant. Registrations from Jan. 1 Registrations for the third dose and also Covaxin for those in the 15-17 age group is set to commence on January 1, according to guidelines issued by the Health Ministry this week. The key factors under consideration are the intended recipients and the supply of the vaccine, Dr. Bhargava said. The vaccine expansion programme plans to give the “precaution dose” 39 weeks (nine months) after the second dose. India has approved, under emergency use authorisation, Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik V, Corbevax and Covavax.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-to-decide-on-vaccine-for-precaution-dose-this-week/article38075449.ece
31 December 2021||Vijayawada,||Talks on PRC fail as govt. employees remain firm against 14.29% fitment||The employees’ associations have come down heavily on the State government saying that it was insulting the employees under the pretext of talks. The talks with the associations regarding PRC on Thursday apparently failed with the employees taking a firm stand that they would not accept 14.29% fitment. Andhra Pradesh Government Employees’ Association (APGEA) president K. Suryanarayana, however, criticised the AP JAC and the Amaravati JAC for their decision to suspend the agitation when the talks were going on. The APGEA would launch “chaitanya yatras” in all districts to create awareness among the employees from January, he said. The APJAC and the Amaravati JAC asserted that they would discuss the matter with Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and not with officials any more. They said there was no progress after the employees met the Finance Department officials in the recent past. The employees attended the meeting only after an assurance that there would be progress in the talks. The associations would discuss the matter with Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy directly. The struggle committee meeting scheduled for January 3 would announce an action plan, the associations asserted. APNGOs Association president Bandi Srinivasa Rao said the State’s finances were explained to them. Employees and teachers’ bills were pending for many months. Employees’ GPF, medical bills were kept pending. There was an immense pressure on employees’ associations leaders in this regard. There were talks regarding 71 demands put forth by the associations. “We will not consider the report given by the officials. Announcing a new PRC every five years is a tradition and it must be followed. The employees expected that the government would announce the PRC as a new year gift but all hopes were dashed,” they said. Revenue Employees’ Association president Mr. Venkateswarlu sought to know why the government was recruiting village and ward secretariat posts if 100% revenues were spent on government employees alone. The government struck at 14.29% fitment. There was no truth in the statistics reeled out by the government. The government was not speaking on Rs. 2,000 crore employees’ bills. The employees would not accept 14.29% fitment, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/talks-with-employees-associations-on-prc-fail/article38075456.ece
31 December 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||Respite to owners of cinemas that were sealed||Providing a respite to the owners of 83 cinema theatres in nine districts in the State that were sealed for functioning in violation of rules, Minister for Information and Public Relations and Cinematography Perni Venkataramaiah (Nani) on Thursday gave his nod for reopening the theatres. The Minister, however, directed the owners to equip the theatres with the required facilities and safety gadgets within one month. Telugu actor, director and producer R. Narayana Murthy met the Minister along with a group of cinema owners of Krishna district, at Machilipatnam on Thursday to represent their case. The Minister responded favourably to their plea and agreed to allow them to reopen the theatres, but asked them to obtain all the licences within a month. He said they would have to forward their applications to the Joint Collectors in their respective districts. Later, speaking to the reporters, Mr. Venkataramaiah said that he had directed the theatre owners who had met him in September to get all the necessary licences to run their businesses. “But they did not heed my advice. The surprise visits by the officials revealed that they have been running the theatres in violation of the rule book. They have not renewed their licences. They neither have B-forms nor the NOC issued by the Fire Department,” said the Minister, adding; “Tomorrow, if some untoward incident happens, the government will be the target to be blamed.” Narayana Murthy against benefit shows Mr. Narayana Murthy said he was always opposed to the practice of increasing the rates of tickets for big-budget films. “That is nothing but authorised black marketing. I have always been against benefit shows,” he added. He said the government was trying to bring cinema within the reach of the common man, which was a good thing. “The film industry and the theatre should live on,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/respite-to-owners-of-83-theatres-in-ap/article38075412.ece
31 December 2021||CHENNAI,||Infections expected to shoot up, says Health Secretary||The number of COVID-19 cases is expected to increase in Chennai and neighbouring districts, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said, urging people to adhere to safety norms. He said the Union government had written to the State government about the need for precautions in Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur on the basis of the data shared by the State. “The number of cases is expected to increase. Residents are requested to wear masks. Those who buy food from hotels are requested to stand a few feet apart from others,” he told reporters after holding a meeting on the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus. Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi held a meeting with Commissioner of Police Shankar Jiwal, in the presence of Dr. Radhakrishnan. “Contact-tracing has improved. We have traced 4,300 contacts for a single person in GH, thanks to the Corporation and the police. Chennai has 10,000 oxygen beds ready,” said Dr. Radhakrishnan. At the end of the meeting, the Corporation, the police and the Revenue Department constituted zonal enforcement teams to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “As many as 50 lakh people have been fined Rs. 105 crore for not following COVID-appropriate behaviour. But people are unwilling to follow the norms. So the zonal enforcement teams will collect fine from those who do not follow COVID-appropriate behaviour,” said Dr. Radhakrishnan. The teams will monitor violation of social distancing norm in crowded areas ahead of New Year. Three teams have been constituted for each of the 15 zones. “We have to educate people on COVID-appropriate behaviour. The zonal enforcement teams will check mask compliance, social distancing compliance, sanitiser and thermal scanner compliance in commercial establishments. On Friday, teams will work in two shifts during the day. At night, another shift will span from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. The teams will visit hotels, restaurants and other public spaces,” Mr. Jiwal said. Mr. Bedi said it was decided to monitor crowding at marriage halls and public gatherings. “Over five lakh residents have not received the first dose of the vaccine in Chennai. Eight lakh have not received the second dose after the stipulated time. Vaccination is expected to prevent deterioration of the condition of those who test positive. Residents are requested to get vaccinated at the mega camps to be held on Sunday,” he said. Functions should be organised only after information to the Corporation. “We will issue a circular to collect fine from marriage halls for violation of COVID-19 prevention norms,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/infections-expected-to-shoot-up/article38075583.ece
31 December 2021||Bengaluru,||State’s Technical Advisory Committee asks BBMP to gear up for third wave||Concerned over a steady rise in the number of coronavirus cases in Bengaluru in the last 10 days, the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) has recommended a comprehensive action plan for Bengaluru. The TAC, which held its 144th meeting on Wednesday after 400 cases were reported in Bengaluru, noted that the situation is worrisome as there is a spurt in the cases in Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Bengaluru. “From the previous experience of the two waves in Karnataka, the case the surge in Bengaluru/ Karnataka was preceded by the surge in Mumbai/ Maharashtra,” the TAC report pointed out. Sources in the TAC told The Hindu that the BBMP has been asked to gear up for an imminent third wave that is expected by January-February. “We are expecting that Omicron may take over Delta and dominate the third wave. In this context, we have recommended that the BBMP should keep hospitals ready (with respect to facilities, supplies and trained manpower) and set up /reactivate COVID Care Centres (CCCs). This is mainly because Omicron infections are known to be milder and a majority of infected people may not need hospital beds,” a TAC member said. According to the TAC’s report, well-equipped CCCs when readied in time will decongest hospitals. “This will avoid a second-wave like situation when there was an influx of mild and moderately infected patients in hospitals thereby depriving critical patients of hospital beds,” sources said. “Some may prefer CCCs and many may need to be shifted to CCCs for lack of facilities at home. As Omicron is highly contagious, home isolation should be the last option and can be permitted only for those who have facilities and “caregivers” as assessed by the triaging team. All home isolated patients should be strictly tele-monitored,” sources said quoting the TAC report. “We have recommended that walk-ins should not be allowed in hospitals and all patients should be mandatorily triaged by the BBMP. International travellers, who test positive at the airport, should be shifted to the designated Omicron facility at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital and identified private hospitals of their choice,” sources said. K.V. Trilok Chandra, BBMP Special Commissioner (Health) said the BBMP was planning to set up one CCC in every assembly constituency. “We already have a system of physical triaging and tele-triaging in place and have stepped up surveillance measures. We also have mobile triaging teams in every ward,” he said. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force said the rise in numbers is a clear indication that the third wave is beginning in the State. “Aggressive contact tracing, maintaining the current testing levels of one lakh and above and strict enforcement of COVID preventive measures and protocols in all residential schools, hostels, apartments, malls and other places of crowding should be done,” he asserted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/states-technical-advisory-committee-asks-bbmp-to-gear-up-for-third-wave/article38075925.ece
31 December 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||State reports 130 COVID-19 cases, one death||The State reported one more death due to COVID-19 and 130 infections in the 24 hours ending Thursday morning. The lone death was reported from Nellore district. The cumulative toll increased to 14,493  and the cumulative infection tally increased to 20,76,979.

31 December 2021||HYDERABAD,||‘Indications of beginning of COVID-19 third wave’||In line with the surge in COVID-19 cases at the national level, there has been a marginal increase in cases in the State too in the last couple of days and the next two to four weeks are crucial for the public to stay safe. The State government expects spike in cases five times or more but it is fully geared to meet the challenge, said Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao. He told a media conference that the current spell was the beginning of the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic, which could see high levels of hospitalisation of people. The two to four weeks when COVID-19 could take deep roots will also hopefully mark the end of the pandemic with minimal damage. Dr. Rao said the government machinery was fully prepared to face any extent of caseload as it had put in place a huge manpower, 60,000 beds and oxygen production capacity of 370 tonnes. The government also had 30 lakh doses of vaccine which will also take care of jabs to teenagers in 15 to 18 age group from January 3. While sounding caution that the new variant Omicron was spreading six times faster than earlier ones, Dr. Rao said the present stage of cases was an early warning for impending danger but there was no cause for concern as 99 % of patients did not have symptoms. Not even a single person out of 62 cases detected till Wednesday had symptoms of Omicron, which were typically flu and COVID-19. The concern was only with cases that had symptoms, Dr. Rao said adding that there were also no changes required in diagnostic tools and treatment methods to tackle Omicron. He ruled out strict measures like night curfew or restricting movement of people because they did not serve any purpose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/indications-of-beginning-of-covid-19-third-wave-says-dph/article38075771.ece
31 December 2021||Nagapattinam,||DPCs will not procure paddy from other districts, says Nagapattinam Collector||As the harvest season begins, the Nagapattinam administration has put in place measures to prevent middlemen from transporting paddy from neighbouring districts to the Direct Purchase Centres (DPCs). The district administration has acted upon information that harvested paddy of samba/ thaladi had been surreptitiously stocked in Sikkal and Thirumarugal areas. Collector A. Arun Thamburaj has constituted teams consisting of officials of Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation, Village Administrative Officers and Assistant Agricultural Officers to carry out inspections and to make sure that paddy loads from outside Nagapattinam are not brought to the local DPCs with fake documentation. “Those indulging in such activity will be subjected to criminal action. The public who are hand in glove with the purported middlemen will also have to face legal consequences”, the Collector has warned. Information about such illegal activity could be passed on to the authorities over phone: 9442225003, he said. In the wake of the district administration's directive, officials of the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation had conducted checks at the storage points of the DPCs. Ruling out illegal stocking of paddy at the DPCs, a senior official of the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation, however, acknowledged that there were manpower constraints in determining stocking of paddy brought from other districts in private godowns in interior villages. Officials of Agriculture Department said the practice of middlemen to bring in paddy from specific locations in other districts where the DPCs were located far-away has indeed been a grey area unattended for long. Farmers who find DPCs inaccessible find a reason to sell their produce to the middlemen for 20 to 30 percent less than the extent of procurement value at the DPCs. As the middlemen in most cases were small-time farmers themselves, the officials were facing difficulty in handling the issue. The middlemen it was said gain access of the records of agricultural fields maintained by the Village Administrative Officers in order to link the record of paddy stock brought from other districts with the fallow swathes in the purview of the DPCs. According to Ramalingam, a progressive farmer, the issue could be addressed effectively if the records maintained by the VAOs were verified precisely vis-a-vis the stocks of paddy procurement at the DPCs, on a constant basis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dpcs-will-not-procure-paddy-from-other-districts-collector/article38075699.ece
31 December 2021||CHENNAI,||Sale, supply of liquor banned on New Year’s eve in U.T.||Observing that only some go in search of spirituality while many go after spirits on New Year Day, the Madras High Court has banned the sale and supply of alcohol in Puducherry from 10 p.m. on December 31, 2021 till 1 a.m. on January 1, 2022. The court made it clear that the ban should be implemented in all independent bars, bars attached to hotels and restaurants and all other places where alcohol is intended to be supplied to “customers or public”. Interim orders Justices S. Vaidyanathan and D. Bharatha Chakravarthy passed the interim orders on a couple of public interest litigation petitions. While one of the petitioners, G.A. Jagannathan of Karikalampakkam, had insisted on imposing a total ban on New Year celebrations in the Union Territory due to the threat posed by the Omicron variant of COVID-19, the other petitioner, S. Sridhar of Easwarankovil Street, had urged the court to restrict the celebrations. Virus threat Taking note of the threat posed by the novel coronavirus and its mutations, the judges ordered that people who had not taken two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine should not be allowed to participate in the New Year celebrations in public places in Puducherry after 7 p.m. on December 31. Participants should carry their Aadhaar card and proof of having been vaccinated with two doses, and furnish them when asked to do so by the police and other officials. The court also directed government officials to ensure the availability of breath analysers in sufficient numbers to catch those who drive under the influence of alcohol. Immediate check-up “If found drunk, immediate medical check-up shall be done to take the violators to task,” they said. The government was also ordered to ensure that celebrities do not participate in the New Year celebrations in public places (except hotels) after 10 p.m. “Celebrities must understand that the health of citizens is more important than the celebrations. At a later point of time, the celebrations should not end up in mourning. Normally, the above conditions would not have been imposed, more particularly in a spirited place like Puducherry. But taking note of the present situation, this court has imposed the aforesaid conditions as we are of the view that prevention is better than cure,” the Bench said. 50% occupancy Authoring the order, Justice Vaidyanathan said, “Every New Year is one step towards the graveyard,” since it is an indication of people ageing. He said the court-imposed conditions for the celebrations would be in addition to those imposed by the government, and that it was mandatory for participants to wear masks, maintain physical distance and so on. The organisers should ensure that there is only 50% occupancy.  Those who have not taken two doses of vaccine should not be allowed to participate in the celebrations in public places after 7 p.m. on December 31||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sale-supply-of-liquor-banned-on-new-years-eve-in-ut/article38075670.ece

31 December 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Odisha radio-tags rescued Indian pangolin||The Odisha Forest and Environment Department has completed its first-ever radio-tagging of the Indian pangolin in an attempt to standardise the rehabilitation protocol for the animal in the State. The forest department said a male pangolin, which was rescued by the Paralakhemundi Forest Division last month, was radio-tagged and released in the Nandankanan Wildlife Sanctuary after treatment. The department said the animal would be tracked using a Yagi antenna and receiver. “To standardise the rehabilitation protocol for such rescued animals, a radio-tagged Indian pangolin was released into the wild in Nandankanan Wildlife Sanctuary following soft release protocols and provision for post-release monitoring,” the department said. Month-long quarantine The animal was screened for parasites and diseases during a month-long quarantine at the Nandankanan Zoological Park (NZP), which is the only conservation breeding centre for Indian pangolins in the world. The centre was established in 2009 to standardise the protocol for housing and husbandry of the endangered species. The centre has so far bred 10 animals in captivity, the department said. “The pangolin was found suitable for release in the wild. It gained 780 grams during quarantine and now weighs 14.740 kg. It is exhibiting normal behaviour. It is fitted with a VHF [very high frequency] radio transmitter, weighing 0.5% of its body weight, procured from advanced telemetry systems specialised in radio telemetry instruments,” an NZP official said. After Madhya Pradesh, Odisha is the second State in the country to release a radio-tagged Indian pangolin into the wild. NZP authorities said the exercise was expected to reveal valuable information on the ecology, dispersal pattern, home range and survival of the reclusive animal. “Most of what is known of the ecology and behaviour of the species has come out of research carried out at the centre,” the forest department said. Pangolins are the most illegally traded mammals in the world and the Indian pangolin is the largest among eight pangolin species. The nocturnal animal lives in burrows and feed on ants and termites. In Odisha, seizures of pangolins and their scales have been made over the past few years. However, information is limited on their rehabilitation protocol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/odisha-radio-tags-rescued-indian-pangolin/article38075626.ece
31 December 2021||HONG KONG,||China issues names for 15 places in Arunachal||China’s Ministry of Civil Affairs said on Thursday it had issued “standardised” names for 15 places in the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh, to be used henceforth on official Chinese maps, part of broader recent moves by Beijing to step up its territorial claims. India’s Ministry of External Affairs said the move by Beijing “does not alter” the fact that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India. “This is not the first time China has attempted such a renaming of places in the State of Arunachal Pradesh. China had also sought to assign such names in April 2017,” spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said. “Arunachal Pradesh has always been, and will always be an integral part of India. Assigning invented names to places in Arunachal Pradesh does not alter this fact.” Arunachal Pradesh is shown on Chinese maps as “Zangnan” or “South Tibet”, and in 2017, Beijing issued six official names for places there, which was at the time seen as a retaliatory move after the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, visited the State. Concerns over law The 15 new “standardised” names, along with their exact coordinates and a map, were released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, days ahead of a new border law coming into force. India in October expressed concern over the new law, which takes effect on January 1, 2022, saying that “China’s unilateral decision to bring out a legislation which can have implications on our existing bilateral arrangements on border management… is of concern to us”. The law was proposed in March, a year into the Line of Actual Control (LAC) crisis, and was seen as an attempt to legitimise the Chinese military’s trans- gressions in Eastern Ladakh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/china-issues-official-names-for-15-places-in-arunachal/article38075452.ece

31 December 2021||LUCKNOW,||Parties against putting off U.P. election: CEC||All political parties in Uttar Pradesh were in favour of conducting the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Assembly election on schedule following COVID-19 protocol, Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra said on Thursday. However, guidelines on how big election rallies would be managed or whether digital communication would have to be increased, would be issued after the election schedule was announced, he said. Mr. Chandra was speaking at a press conference after review meetings with representatives of various political parties and top officials in Uttar Pradesh. “All parties told us elections should be held on time following COVID-19 protocol,” said Mr. Chandra, adding that some suggested restricting the number and size of rallies. Despite HC appeal Amid rising cases of COVID-19, the Allahabad High Court had recently appealed to the ECI as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately ban rallies and public meetings of political parties and consider postponing the Assembly election, stressing that it was more important to save lives. Mr. Chandra said the ECI would take cognisance of the court’s appeal but said directive guidelines would be issued once election was announced. He added that the COVID-19 situation was “dynamic”. The ECI officials discussed the management of election rallies with top health and administrative officials. “This point (cutting down rallies) will be definitely considered: how the big rallies are to be managed or whether digital communication may have to be increased,” Mr. Chandra said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/parties-against-putting-off-up-election-says-cec/article38075451.ece

A Ministry notification on Thursday said “the Central government is of the opinion that the area comprising the whole of the State of Nagaland is in such a disturbed and dangerous condition that the use of armed forces in aid of the civil power is necessary.” In exercise of the powers conferred under Section 4 of the Act, “the Central government hereby declares that whole of the State of Nagaland to be ‘disturbed area’ for a period of six months with effect from 30th December, 2021, for the purpose of the said Act”, it stated. The last extension was made on June 30. Unbridled powers The Act, which has been in force in the northeast since 1958, gives unbridled powers to the armed forces and the Central Armed Police Forces deployed in “disturbed areas” to kill anyone acting in contravention of law, arrest and search any premises without a warrant and protection from prosecution and legal suits without the Central government’s sanction. Both the Central and State governments have concurrent powers to issue a notification under Section 3 of the Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/afspa-extended-for-another-six-months-in-nagaland/article38075459.ece

31 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Previous government delayed projects: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday laid the foundation stone for 23 projects estimated at Rs. 17,500 crore in Uttarakhand, and termed the past delay in the Lakhwar multi-purpose project “nothing short of a crime”. The project was first thought of in 1976, but it was on Thursday that the foundation stone for it was laid. Delay in implementing schemes was a trademark of those who were in government earlier, he said. “The Lakhwar project, which has started here in Uttarakhand today, has the same history… Today after 46 years, our government has laid the foundation stone for its work. This delay is nothing short of a crime,” he said. At a time when Assembly election in the State is likely to be announced soon, Mr. Modi said that the governments in Delhi and Dehradun today were not driven by desire for power, but a spirit of service. Mr. Modi laid the foundation stone for the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Rishikesh satellite centre at Udham Singh Nagar. Citing ongoing works such as the Char Dham project and new rail routes, he noted that this would be the decade of Uttarakhand. Earlier, people migrated from the region due to lack of development. The problems faced in the past were now being converted into facilities, he said. Among the projects launched were Rs. 8,700-crore worth road works, which would improve connectivity in the remote and border areas as well as the movement of pilgrims of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, a government statement said. ‘Defence needs ignored’ “The Prime Minister lamented the fact that despite being a border State, many defence-related needs were ignored. He said soldiers had to wait for connectivity, essential armour, ammunition and arms and even for giving befitting reply to invaders and terrorist,” it said, citing his speech in Hindi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/previous-government-delayed-projects-modi/article38075119.ece
31 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||India reports over 10,000 cases a day again||India reported 13,154 COVID-19 cases on Thursday, with 961 of them confirmed to be of the Omicron variant. At a weekly briefing here, Union Health Ministry officials expressed concern over the “sudden rise” in cases in several cities. Officials singled out six States — Maharashtra, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Karnataka and Gujarat — as of particular concern given the rise in test positivity and the number of weekly cases. Kerala and Maharashtra, however, continue to be responsible for nearly half the cases. The officials, however, refrained from describing the spurt in cases as the “third wave” with NITI Aayog Member V.K. Paul saying that India was mirroring the global spurt being led by the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Spain. “The present R-value [reproduction value] in India is 1.22 which means cases are increasing and not shrinking. Deaths are stable in India as of now which is reassuring. It could be part of the global rise in cases pushed by Omicron, we believe,” he said at the briefing. The uptick in Maharashtra’s cases continued with the State reporting 5,368 infections on Thursday as its active case tally jumped to 18,217. Twenty-two deaths pushed the cumulative tally to 1,41,518. The number of Omicron infections shot up. With 198 fresh cases of the new variant, the Omicron tally stood at 450. Kerala recorded 2,423 fresh cases even as the government called for more caution and heightened surveillance against the Omicron variant. Highlighting the threat posed by Omicron, Kerala Health Minister Veena George said the large geriatric population and those with co-morbidities could lead to a spike in hospitalisations and deaths. “Though vaccination is an important element in the fight against Omicron, the number of breakthrough infections and re-infections poses a risk. In this context, it is important to observe COVID-19 protocols strictly.” In the capital, 1,313 new COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 24 hours, the highest in seven months, as per a bulletin released by the Delhi government. This is a 42.2% increase from 923 fresh cases reported on Wednesday. The test positivity rate (TPR) also increased to 1.73% on Thursday. There was no COVID-related deaths in the last 24 hours. Delhi’s Health Minister said there was “community spread” of the Omicron variant as nearly half the samples analysed were of the variant. Andhra Pradesh reported one more death due to COVID-19 and 130 infections in the 24 hours ending Thursday morning. The test positivity rate of the 33,188 samples was 0.39% and that of the total 3.129 crore samples tested so far was 6.64%. Karnataka reported more than 500 cases on a second consecutive day. The number of new cases shot up from 566 on Wednesday to 707 on Thursday, taking the total to 30,06,505. Bengaluru Urban contributed nearly 80% of the day’s caseload with 565 cases. On Wednesday, Bengaluru Urban had reported 400 cases.  (With inputs   from bureaus)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-reports-over-10000-cases-a-day-again/article38075388.ece
31 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Prime Minister puts off UAE visit||Following a sudden spike in Omicron cases, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has put off his visit to Abu Dhabi and Dubai next week, when India and the UAE were expected to announce a limited free trade agreement. Mr. Modi was due to visit Abu Dhabi for official meetings and then travel to the Dubai Expo to tour the India pavilion on January 6. Diplomatic sources said the visit had now been postponed to a later date, but not cancelled. The highlight of the Mr. Modi’s UAE visit was to have been the signing of a partial FTA after formal talks were launched in September between Commerce and Industries Minister Piyush Goyal and UAE Minister for Foreign Trade Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi. An industry source said a limited or “early harvest agreement” — not including investments and services — had been finalised as per the plan, by December-end. “As of now only goods from both sides are to be covered in the India-UAE early harvest agreement,” the sources said. Trade representatives on both sides would continue to work on concluding a larger Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) that would include more investment protection measures as well as special facilities for Indian labour and expatriates by March 2022, the source added. Trading partners The UAE is India’s third largest trading partner after the United States and China. If the CEPA is signed, it would mark the first Indian FTA in the region, after India and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) abandoned FTA talks in 2008, and the first of five trade deals that the Modi government is negotiating at present with Australia, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Canada, and Israel. Civil aviation officials have been working separately on an updated Bilateral Air Services Agreement that would allow more flights from more airports between India and the UAE, but have failed to conclude talks thus far. Apart from bilateral talks with UAE’s Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also due to discuss the quadrilateral economic cooperation with the UAE, U.S. and Israel as well as coordination at the United Nations Security Council, where the UAE will begin its non-permanent term on January 1.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/prime-minister-puts-off-uae-visit/article38075106.ece
31 December 2021||Ghaziabad,||SP practises appeasement: Shah||Alleging that the Samajwadi Party had a soft corner for minorities, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday said that during the rule of SP president Akhilesh Yadav, it was the Nizam (administration) of a few Muslim leaders in Uttar Pradesh, but the present BJP government had delivered vikas (development) and the Ram temple. Mr. Shah has so far addressed 10 rallies during the Jan Vishvas Yatra . Addressing rallies in Moradabad and Aligarh, constituencies that have a significant Muslim population and leadership, Mr. Shah said Mr. Yadav’s administration stood for Nizam, an acronym he coined with the names of the leaders Naseemuddin (Siddiqui), Imran Masood, Azam Khan, and Mukhtar Ansari. Out of the four, only Mr. Khan is a frontline SP leader from the neighbouring Rampur district. Mr. Siddiqui has been with the Bahujan Samaj Party before shifting to the Congress. Mr. Masood is a prominent Congress leader in west Uttar Pradesh and Mr. Ansari has been with the BSP for a long time. In Aligarh, he changed Naseemuddin to Naseeruddin. He might have been referring to Naseer Ahmad Khan, the SP MLA from the Chamraua constituency in Rampur. In Moradabad, Mr. Shah reminded the audience of Mr. Khan, a founding member of the SP, who is lodged in the Sitapur jail because of alleged irregularities in the university established by him in his Rampur constituency. “Akhilesh babu still goes to meet him. Do you think Azam Khan will remain in jail, if SP comes to power,” Mr. Shah asked, in this typical question-answer style of interacting with the crowd. Without taking his name, Mr. Shah referred to SP patriarch Mulayam Singh’s oft-repeated statement made at a rally in Moradabad in 2014 where he said, “boys will be boys, they make mistakes ... will you hang them for rape?” “Will our daughters and mothers remain safe under such a government,” Mr. Shah asked, and congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi for bringing in the anti-triple talaq law to protect Muslim women. Mr. Shah slightly broad-based his attack in the brass city, and added behen (Priyanka Gandhi Vadra) to bua (Mayawati) and babua (Mr. Yadav) as well. “Even if bua, babua and behan combine their forces, they could not take on the might of the BJP worker,” he said. In Aligarh, he described the SP as the part of 3Ps: Parviar (nepotism), Pakshpat (appeasement) and Palayan (exodus), while the BJP is about 3Vs: Vikas (development), vyapar (business), and virasat (heritage). He continued to link the SP with the alleged illegal recoveries made by agencies at a Kanpur businessman’s house. “The SP has made Uttar Pradesh a lab of loot,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sp-practises-appeasement-shah/article38075116.ece
31 December 2021||Srinagar,||3 more JeM militants killed in Kashmir||Three more Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) militants were killed on Thursday, taking the number of dead terrorists in the twin overnight anti-militancy operations in south Kashmir to six, the police said. One soldier was also killed. Among the slain militants were those behind the recent deadly attack on a police bus in the Zewan area that left three policemen dead and 11 injured on December 14, the police added. “During the past 24 hours, two operations were carried out in twin districts of south Kashmir, resulting in the elimination of six terrorists of the JeM, including two Pakistani terrorists. December has seen the killing of 28 militants, including five Pakistanis,” Inspector-General of Police Vijay Kumar said. Four security personnel were injured in the gunfights, in which one soldier, Sepoy Jasbir Singh, died in hospital. Two M-4 rifles and four AK-47 rifles were recovered from the encounter sites at Anantnag’s Nowgam-Dooru area and Kulgam’s Mirhama, the police said. The slain militants were identified as Sultan — alias Rayees, alias Mavia — from Pakistan, Nisar Ahmad Khanday from Dudwangan-Kapran, Altaf Ahmad Shah from Nathipora Dooru, Shahid — alias Shahzaid — from Pakistan, Mohammad Shafi Dar from Tral and Uzair Ahmad from Mirhama. “Altaf and Sultan, along with another terrorist, Suhail Rather, were involved in the Zewan attack on December 14. The killing of the most wanted terrorists is a big success,” Mr. Kumar said. General Officer Commanding (GoC), 15 Corps, Lieutenant General D.P. Pandey said local militant recruitment had come down this year. “About 130 locals joined militancy compared to 180 last year,” he observed. More foreign militants were also getting killed of late as they were coming out of their hideouts because “local militants were refusing to attack forces”. Around 172 militants were killed in 185 gunfights in Kashmir this year. Mr. Kumar told The Hindu that the success of the police and other forces could be gauged from the fact that the number of militants has fallen below 200, with just around 86 local militants active by the year end. “It’s for the first time in 30 years,” Mr. Kumar said. He stated, “Of 128 locals who joined militants this year, 73 were killed, 17 were arrested and only 39 are active.” The major worry for the police, which has now emerged as the main counter-insurgency force after the Centre had ended J&K’s special constitutional position in 2019, is the militants’ focus on local policemen. According to the official data, 20 of the 28 security personnel (71%) killed in militant attacks in the Valley were policemen.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/3-more-jem-militants-killed-in-kashmir/article38075438.ece

31 December 2021||Kolkata,||Cannot put curbs on Ganga Sagar Mela, says Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said the State government could not stop or impose restrictions on the Ganga Sagar Mela. Lakhs of pilgrims assemble on the Sagar Island in the State’s South 24 Parganas district on the occasion of Makar Sankranti to take a dip where the Ganga meets the sea. “This is not a government festival. It is a public event. People come from different parts of the country. How will I stop people who will be coming from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar?” Ms. Banerjee said. She was speaking to journalists after visiting the Sagar Island over the past three days. She held an administrative meeting and took stock of the preparations of the gathering scheduled in the second week of January. “Why are you interested in only Ganga Sagar Mela, ask Kumbh Mela,” she told journalists when asked about the State government’s plans for the event. The remarks come at a time when the Union government has said West Bengal and others were emerging as States of concern for the outbreak of COVID-19. South 24 Parganas Magistrate P. Ulaganathan said the administration has plans to have COVID-19 testing facilities at all the entry points of Sagar Island during the festival. He said about 20 lakh people will participate in the mela. The Chief Minister said COVID-19 infections are on the rise and assured that the State Government is seriously reviewing the situation. She, however, said the pandemic-related restrictions cannot be imposed across the State because of the adverse effects on the economy and livelihood of the people. Flights to be suspended Ms. Banerjee said the spike in the cases related to the Omicron variant is because of foreign returnees and urged the Centre to impose some restrictions. “Most Omicron cases are being detected among people coming on flights from the U.K. The Centre must decide on imposing restrictions on flights from countries where the cases are high.” Later in the day, Home Secretary B.P. Gopalika wrote a letter to Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Rajiv Bansal informing the State Government’s decision to suspend until further orders all direct flights from the U.K. to Kolkata with effect from January 3. “Further with effect from January 3, all passengers coming from other non-at-risk countries by international flights in West Bengal will have to mandatorily undergo a test on arrival at their cost,” the letter said. The number of COVID-19 infections has doubled within 24 hours. The Health Department said 2,128 infections and 12 deaths were recorded on Thursday. The number of new infections on Wednesday was 1,089 and 12 people died of it. The positivity rate was 2.84% on Wednesday, which jumped to 5.47% on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cannot-put-curbs-on-ganga-sagar-mela-says-mamata/article38075393.ece
31 December 2021||Srinagar,||Active militancy is down: J&K police||As the J&K police claim an upper hand over militants in Kashmir this year, there are worrying trends challenging the security apparatus including drone attacks, cross-Line of Control (LoC) kinetic operations, targeted killings and stepped up attacks on local policemen. Inspector General of Police (IGP) Vijay Kumar told The Hindu that the success of the police and other forces could be gauged from the fact that the number of militants has fallen below 200, with just around 86 local militants active by the year end. “It’s for the first time in 30 years,” Mr. Kumar said. On the spike in local recruitments, Mr. Kumar said, “Of 128 locals who joined militants this year, 73 were killed, 17 were arrested and only 39 are active.” However, official data suggest that from single-digit local militancy in 2011, it has remained consistently in double digits since 2014, showing an upward trend after the 2019 decisions made by the Centre regarding J&K, with the declining presence of foreign militants. Marked shift The major worry for the police, which has now emerged as the main counter-insurgency force after the Centre had ended J&K’s special constitutional position in 2019, is a marked shift in the militants’ focus towards local policemen. According to the official data, 20 of the 28 security personnel (71%) killed in militant attacks in the Valley were policemen. “Capital Srinagar has seen growing targeted attacks on the lower rung policemen, including traffic cops,” a senior official said. The once militancy-free zones of Srinagar and Ganderbal are back on the militancy map. Official data suggest seven youth joined militancy in Srinagar — four of whom were killed — and two from Ganderbal. Shopian witnessed the highest number of encounters this year. “Around 30 militants [17%] killed this year were neutralised within a month of joining the militant ranks. Top 22 commanders, including Abbas Sheikh of The Resistance Front, were killed this year,” Mr. Kumar said. Official data suggest that local recruits continue to be around 75% out of around 168 active militants. The year saw two rare attacks in the Jammu region, a drone-driven explosion on a technical airport of the IAF on June 27. Later, two major cross-LoC kinetic operations took place where militants after inflicting casualties on the forces near the LoC, returned to their launching pads in PoK.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/active-militancy-is-down-jk-police/article38075104.ece
31 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Disruption of Christmas event unfortunate, says Haryana CM||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday termed as “unfortunate” the recent disruption of Christmas celebrations at a private school in Pataudi by a group raising pro-Hindu slogans. “It should not have happened” and there was “no reason to support such incidents”, he said. On the sustained campaign by Hindu groups to prevent namaaz in some public spots in Gurugram, he stuck to his public stand that “making namaaz a show of strength is not appropriate” and that community members should sit with the administration and sort out the issue. Mr. Khattar was interacting with members of the Indian Women’s Press Corp in New Delhi and answering questions on attacks on Christmas celebrations in Haryana. “It is an unfortunate incident. It should not have happened. There is no reason to support such incidents. It is not right to interrupt any function. They [Hindu groups] should either object before or after the function. If there are any apprehensions, they can be resolved. People of all groups should sit and talk, there are peace committees as well,” he stated. Designated spots On the namaaz issue, he observed: “I cannot say if the incidents in Gurugram were avoidable or not. People from both sides should sit with the administration. Making namaz a show of strength is not appropriate. Even if people have to pray in the open, it should be a designated spot. For people of every group, there is a process to get permission to hold their functions in open. People of both groups should sit together and decide what should be done.” Mr. Khattar also differentiated between “those who initiated farmers protests” against the three controversial agriculture laws and those who supported the stir. “Those who initiated the protests and those who supported it are two different things. Those who initiated the protests call themselves ‘kisan neta’, but they have political ambitions. [Gurnam Singh] Chaduni has fought elections, this time also he advocated that farmers fight polls. Political awareness is there in everyone, political aspirations are a different thing,” he remarked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/disruption-of-christmas-event-unfortunate-says-haryana-cm/article38075109.ece
31 December 2021||LUCKNOW,||Cash seized from Piyush Jain not treated as turnover: DGGI||The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) on Thursday described as “purely speculative” reports which suggested it had decided to treat the Rs. 197.47 crore in cash seized from Uttar Pradesh businessman Piyush Jain as the turnover of the manufacturing unit and it had agreed with the deposition of Mr. Jain and finalised his tax liabilities as Rs. 52 crore. The DGGI said the cash seized from the residential and factory premises had been kept as case property in the safe custody of the SBI pending investigation. Tax officials seized the cash, 23 kg of gold with foreign markings and unaccounted-for perfumery raw material worth Rs. 6 crore from the business and residential premises of Mr. Jain. The DGGI said reports had appeared in certain sections of the media that it had decided to treat the cash recovered as the turnover of the manufacturing unit and proposed to proceed accordingly, and that some media reports even stated that after admitting his liability, Mr. Jain had, with its approval, deposited a total sum of Rs. 52 crore as tax liability. “These reports are purely speculative, without any basis and seek to undermine the integrity of the investigations which are being carried out in a most professional manner based on specific intelligence against the party,” the DGGI said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dggi-dismisses-reports-on-piyush-jains-tax-liablities/article38075124.ece
31 December 2021||COLOMBO,||Basil Rajapaksa coming for ‘Vibrant Gujarat’ summit on Jan. 10||Sri Lanka’s Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa would lead a delegation to the ‘Vibrant Gujarat’ summit to be held from January 10 to 12, official sources said. He is likely to hold talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during this visit, his second to India in about a month. The Minister, the youngest brother of Sri Lanka’s ruling clan and an influential politician, would travel to India a day after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi concludes his two-day visit to the island nation, signalling Colombo’s intensive engagement with both New Delhi and Beijing at a time when it faces one of its worst economic meltdowns in history. Mr. Basil Rajapaksa was in New Delhi from November 30 to December 2. Despite officials indicating that he was scheduled to call on Mr. Modi, the meeting did not take place, reportedly due to scheduling issues – something that Sri Lankan media highlighted prominently in their coverage of the high-profile visit. He, however, held talks with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. They drew up a “four pillar” initiative as part of which India agreed to extend emergency Lines of Credit for import of food, medicines and fuel, and a currency swap to help the island nation tide over its relentless dollar crisis. American credit rating agency Fitch on December 17 downgraded Sri Lanka to ‘CC’ rating, the lowest before default. Mahinda’s request A month since Mr. Basil’s last visit seeking assistance from New Delhi, Colombo awaits news. In fact, New Delhi is yet to move on Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa’s request for a debt freeze, made personally to Mr. Modi almost two years ago, as well as President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s request for a “special” $1.1 billion currency swap made in May 2020. Going by diplomatic signals, the operative part of the recent bilateral initiative of the “four pillars” appears centred on bilateral energy pacts, especially the “early modernisation” of the Second World War-era oil tanks in the eastern Trincomalee district, a long-stalled project coveted by India for decades. Joint development Sri Lanka’s Energy Minister recently told The Hindu that the agreement to jointly develop the Trincomalee oil tank farm with India would be inked in a month’s time, and that a special purpose vehicle had been set up for the purpose. It is unclear if Mr. Basil Rajapaksa’s likely meeting with Mr. Modi will be held in Gujarat on the sidelines of the summit, or if he would fly to New Delhi for talks. Colombo-based sources indicated that the meeting with Mr. Modi would be firmed up based on developments in the next week. Sri Lanka had been identified as one of the “partner countries” for the ‘Vibrant Gujarat’ summit, where participants would explore investment and networking opportunities, and strategic partnerships, an official statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/basil-rajapaksa-coming-for-vibrant-gujarat-summit-on-jan-10/article38075391.ece
31 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Banks must pay back customers their money on demand, says SC||Banks have a “super-added obligation” to pay back customers their money on demand with the agreed rate of interest, the Supreme Court had observed in a recent judgment. A Bench of Chief Justice N.V. Ramana, Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli noted that the relationship of a bank with its customer was not of trust but that of debtor-creditor. “The banker is one who receives money to be drawn out again when the owner has occasion for it... The customer is the lender and the bank is the borrower, the latter being under a super added obligation of honouring the customer’s cheques up to the amount of the money received and still in the banker’s hands,” Justice Kant, who authored the verdict, noted. The court was pronouncing judgment in an appeal by a former bank manager, who was convicted for offences relating to criminal breach of trust, cheating and falsification of accounts. The Andhra Pradesh High Court had earlier rejected his appeal. Contractual obligation “The money that a customer deposits in a bank is not held by the latter on trust for him. It becomes a part of the banker’s funds who is under a contractual obligation to pay the sum deposited by a customer to him on demand with the agreed rate of interest. Such a relationship between the customer and the bank is one of a creditor and a debtor,” the court said. It said “but until it was called upon to pay it, the bank is entitled to utilise the money in any manner for earning profit”. The former bank employee was investigated by the CBI and a Special Court in Hyderabad and found him guilty under various provisions of law and the Prevention of Corruption Act in 2002. He had been sentenced to five years of rigorous imprisonment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/banks-must-pay-back-customers-their-money-on-demand-says-sc/article38075635.ece
31 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sailor airlifted from INS Kesari for treatment||An Indian Navy sailor deployed onboard INS Kesari in Mozambique was airlifted by a P-8I maritime patrol aircraft after he needed urgent medical attention, the Navy said on Thursday. As part of Mission Sagar, INS Kesari was deployed to Maputo, Mozambique, for delivering food aid, two FICs and self-defence equipment. “During the deployment, one sailor developed a medical emergency and was required to be evacuated to India for medical intervention,” the Navy said in a statement. The P-8I aircraft, on routine deployment to the southern Indian Ocean, was diverted for his evacuation. In a separate operation off Kavaratti on Tuesday, a naval Fast Interceptor Craft (FIC) rescued local people from drowning close to the harbour mouth. At 12.45 p.m. on Tuesday, the FIC of Sagar Prahari Bal Lakshadweep, on routine surveillance, observed three locals in the water close to the Kavaratti harbour near the Western Jetty. “One of the them, Rashid, was successfully picked up and given first aid as per standard operating procedures. The others were thereafter recovered by a police patrol boat,” the Navy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sailor-airlifted-from-ins-kesari-for-treatment/article38075112.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Decision on vaccine for ‘precaution’ dose soon||The definitive study so far on booster doses is the COV-BOOST study, led by the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom that tested seven different vaccines as a booster dose in groups of those who had received either two doses of the Oxford vaccine (Covishield) or the Pfizer vaccine. The third dose was administered at least 70-84 days after the second shot. The second shots were either of Novavax (same as Covavax), Valneva (an inactivated whole virion similar to Covaxin), Janssen, Moderna, Curevac or repeat doses of either Pfizer or Oxford vaccine. The overall conclusion of the study was that while all combinations boosted antibody levels, the increase was highest for Moderna as a third dose. The inactivated vaccine induced the least spikes. Were the mRNA vaccines to be excluded, as India doesn’t have them yet, Novovax induced a much greater spike in antibodies after the mRNA vaccines. Antibody levels alone weren’t the sole metric of comparison as the trial also noted instances of adverse reaction or post-immunisation side effects. Covaxin has not been tested anywhere as a booster except during an accidental mix-up during a vaccination drive earlier this year when some recipients got a second dose of Covaxin instead of Covishield. An analysis suggested that this was safe and in fact boosted their antibody levels higher than two doses of the same vaccine. The Christian Medical College, Vellore is in the middle of a trial to evaluate Covaxin and Covishield as third doses. There is also no trial that has evaluated Corbevax as a booster dose. Dr. Bhargava said at the briefing that the available evidence from international studies and India so far suggested that immunity from disease from following vaccination or an infection lasted for about nine months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/decision-on-vaccine-for-precaution-dose-soon/article38075100.ece

The staff deployed at the voting booths would also have to be fully vaccinated while the size of polling booths would be reduced from one per 1,500 persons to one per 1,250. This means there would be over 11,000 new voting booths taking the total to over 1.74 lakh, said the CEC. While a final voter list was yet to be published, as of Thursday, there were over 15 crore voters in U.P. including 53 lakh new voters, while the number of voters in the 18-19 age group had increased from 0.51% to 1.32%, he said. Mr. Chandra expressed concern over the fall in voting percentage in U.P. from the 61% in 2017 Assembly election to 59% in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. He said that an awareness campaign would be held to improve the numbers of people casting their votes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/parties-against-putting-off-up-election-says-cec/article38075101.ece
31 December 2021||Srinagar,||Father of Hyderpora victim moves court||The father of Muhammad Amir Magray, one of the three persons killed in the Hyderpora encounter, on Thursday approached the Jammu and Kashmir High Court and sought his son’s body for final rites. He disputed the police claim that Amir was associated with the militants. “The petitioner and his wife request the court to come to the rescue of their son’s fundamental right to have decent burial as per religious rules. If not done, they will never recover from the pain. They have not even given a chance to see his face last time. They wish to bury their son close to their house so that in the future he gets to visit his grave for prayers,” said the plea. The petition by Amir’s father Muhammad Latief Magray, 58, comes two days after the Special Investigation Team (SIT) accused Amir of being a “militant associate”. The victim’s father, in the petition, said his entire family was associated with the Indian Army and other security agencies and was “instrumental in elimination of militants in Gool, Sangaldan, Ramban”. Support from NC, PDP Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Ministers Farooq Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti on Thursday questioned the veracity of the Special Investigation Team’s report on the Hyderpora encounter. “The police report is false. Police have done it to save themselves,” National Conference president Dr. Abdullah said. Peoples Democratic Party president Ms. Mufti, in a tweet, said, “The administration’s aversion and discomfort with truth coming to the fore is well known.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/father-of-hyderpora-victim-moves-court/article38075102.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||China issues names for 15 places in Arunachal||Arunachal Pradesh is shown on Chinese maps as “Zangnan” or “South Tibet”, and in 2017, Beijing issued six official names for places there, which was at the time seen as a retaliatory move after the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, visited the State. Indian concern The 15 new “standardised” names, along with their exact coordinates and a map, were released on Thursday by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, days ahead of a new border law coming into force. India in October expressed concern over the new law, which takes effect on January 1, 2022, saying that “China’s unilateral decision to bring out a legislation which can have implications on our existing bilateral arrangements on border management… is of concern to us”. The law was proposed in March, a year into the Line of Actual Control (LAC) crisis, and was seen as an attempt to legitimise the Chinese military’s trans-gressions in Eastern Ladakh. It calls for various Chinese civilian and military agencies to take steps to “safeguard” Chinese territory, and has coincided with stepped-up plans by China to bolster its control along disputed areas, including by constructing “frontier” villages and civilian settlements. Using standardised maps across different levels of government is part of the broader effort. The 15 places named on Thursday included eight residential areas, four mountains, two rivers and one mountain pass, the Communist Party-run Global Times reported. The paper quoted Zhang Yongpan, an expert on border issues at the influential Chinese Academy of Social Sciences as saying that “since the Zangnan area has been illegally occupied by India, the Indian government has also established some illegal names in the area.”  The eight towns on the list were Sengkezong and Daglungzong in Cona county of Shannan prefecture, Mani’gang, Duding and Migpain in Medog county of Nyingchi, Goling, Damba in Zayu county of Nyingchi, and Mejag in Lhunze county of Shannan; the mountains were Wamo Ri, Deu Ri, Lhunzhub Ri and Kumingxingze Feng; the two rivers were Xenyogmo He and Dulain He, and the mountain pass on the list was Se La.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/china-issues-names-for-15-places-in-arunachal/article38075107.ece
31 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. tells NIA to probe Sikhs for Justice member||The Union government on Thursday directed the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to launch a probe against Germany-based Jaswinder Singh Multani of Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), his associates from other banned outfits like the Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) and the Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) and others, accusing them of attempting to revive terrorism in Punjab. On Monday, following an alert from the Indian agencies, the German Police had detained Multani for his suspected role in the Ludhiana court complex explosion last week. He has been accused of coordinating with other Pakistan-based pro-Khalistani elements and also conspiring to carry out terror attacks in Mumbai and other parts of the country. After registering the case, the NIA plans to send a team to Germany as part of the probe. The Indian agencies may also attempt to get Multani’s custody. Based on the findings so far, the government has instructed the NIA to investigate Multani and his alleged associates. They include Jagdish Singh Bhura of KZF, his deputy Gurmeet Singh, who is also associated with SFJ; Ranjeet Singh Pakhoke of KTF (Germany); Sukhdev Singh Heran and Hardeep Singh Nijjar of Babbar Khalsa International; and Paramjit Singh Pamma and Ranjeet Singh Neeta, both KTF members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-tells-nia-to-probe-sikhs-for-justice-member/article38075441.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||AFSPA extended by six months in Nagaland||The Act, which has been in force in the northeast since 1958, gives unbridled powers to the armed forces and the Central Armed Police Forces deployed in “disturbed areas” to kill anyone acting in contravention of law, arrest and search any premises without a warrant and protection from prosecution and legal suits without the Central government’s sanction. Both the Central and State governments have concurrent powers to issue a notification under Section 3 of the Act. The Manipur government on December 8 issued a notification to extend the Act, excluding the municipal areas of Imphal, for another year. The order said “the Governor of Manipur is of the opinion that due to violent activities of various extremist/insurgent groups, the entire State of Manipur is in such a disturbed condition that the use of Armed Forces in aid of civil power is necessary.” Right from the 1980s, the notification extending the AFSPA has been issued by the State government. In the last 40 years, the Centre has not issued any notification under the Act for Manipur. Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio on December 26 announced that the MHA had constituted a committee to look into the withdrawal of the Act. Protests are on since December 4, when 13 civilians were killed in a botched operation by the Army in Mon district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/afspa-extended-by-six-months-in-nagaland/article38075114.ece

The Congress general secretary, communications, Randeep Surjewala, in a tweet, accused the Centre of pushing “a hitherto peaceful Northeast into an abyss of lawlessness, insurgency and chaos”. Since December 4, when 13 civilians were killed in a botched operation by the Army near Oting in Mon district, the protests against the AFSPA have sharpened in the northeast. “The utter lack of understanding of the ethos of its people, its diversity, its concerns and attempt to annihilate democracy to usurp power has led us to the current state,” he tweeted. The MHA instituted a committee headed by Vivek Joshi and it has been given six months to submit a report. The party termed the latest extension baffling and called for a united agitation to seek repeal of the Act. “Despite condemnation and protests against arbitrary and indiscriminate abuses #AFSPA has again been extended in #Nagaland. Time for raising a united voice for repeal,” Congress MP from Assam Pradyut Bordoloi tweeted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-slams-afspa-extension-in-nagaland/article38075122.ece

Mr. Cheema said the FIR against Mr. Majithia was registered several days ago. “Why has the Congress failed to arrest Bikram Majithia. Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi and Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu are going to the town on the FIR. They should clarify whether their action in the drug mafia case was limited to just an FIR and a few statements? Or will it go beyond with some concrete action?” he asked. Mr. Cheema said the FIR was just a political ploy by the Congress government for their own political gains by fooling the people about their intentions regarding the mafia. “The Congress and the BJP at the Centre are patronising these big drug lords. The Congress is advertising the FIR as if they have won the whole war against drugs though they have not been able to arrest Mr. Majithia yet and drugs rackets are still working non-stop,” he said. The Punjab and Haryana High Court adjourned the hearing of Mr. Majithia’s anticipatory bail petition to January 5.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/punjab-deliberately-not-arresting-majithia-aap/article38075111.ece

After their family members protested on Tuesday, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of Saharanpur Dr. Sanjeev Manglik constituted a five-member inquiry committee to look into the matter. Some of the patients have been referred to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) hospital in Chandigarh and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi. Shagun Bansal, a shopkeeper from Jiwala village of Saharanpur, said his mother was operated upon on December 2 at the Seth Baldev Das district hospital. A few days after the operation, swelling and pus developed in her eyes, he stated. “When we approached Dr. S. Lal, who conducted the operation, he tried to give us some money and asked us not to raise the issue,” he stated in his complaint to the CMO. The CMO said around 30 patients have suffered different levels of complications after the operation on December 2 and that he had constituted a panel to look into the reasons. “The complications came to light during the follow-up. The committee will find out whether the problem emerged because of poor quality of lens, medicines or there was an issue with the sanitisation of the operation theatre,” he said. Refuting allegations of bribing the patients, Dr. Manglik said Dr. Lal was a senior and a well-regarded eye surgeon in the medical fraternity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/27-lose-vision-in-up-after-botched-cataract-surgery/article38075113.ece
31 December 2021||LUCKNOW,||PM misusing govt. events in U.P.: Congress||The Congress has written to the Election Commission of India asking it not to allow Prime Minister Narendra Modi to use government events, where projects are inaugurated, as a platform for launching political attacks on opponents in Uttar Pradesh. Government machinery was being misused in Mr. Modi’s rallies and inauguration events in the State in the build-up to the election, the Congress said. The events had become “more of a platform for BJP campaign” than for launch of projects, the party’s letter to CEC Sushil Chandra said. The Congress also demanded that the EC bring an end to the poll rallies being conducted by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and his deputies on government expense. These leaders were misusing government machinery and delivering “unconstitutional and divisive speeches” at these rallies, it said. The party also demanded that big rallies be banned owing to COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-misusing-govt-events-in-up-congress/article38075120.ece

Speaking at a dharma sansad in Raipur on Sunday, the Akola-based ‘godman’ reportedly said the “the aim of Islam is to capture the nation through politics and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi destroyed the country... salutations to Nathuram Godse who killed him”. He also reportedly exhorted people to elect a “staunch Hindu leader” to protect Hinduism.

31 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Let men get married at 18: plea to govt.||Instead of raising the age of marriage for women from 18 to 21 to bring it on a par with that of men, the government should lower the marriage age of men to 18, demands a petition from over 150 organisations, activists, writers and academics. The Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021 seeks to raise the age of marriage for women to 21 in order to make it equal to men so that they are not in a “disadvantageous position” in regard to higher education, vocational instruction, skill sets and so on. It also aims to improve maternal mortality rate, infant mortality rate and nutritional levels. The petition says that its recommendation to lower the age of marriage for men to 18 is based on the Law Commission report of 2008 on reforming family law that recommended a uniform age of marriage for boys and girls at 18 and not 21. The commission noted, “the difference in age for husband and wife has no basis in law as spouses entering into a marriage are by all means equals and their partnership must also be that of equals”. The plea is signed by organisations such as the All India Democratic Women’s Association, All India Progressive Women’s Association, and National Federation of Indian Women. They say increasing the age of marriage will only criminalise young adults.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/let-men-get-married-at-18-plea-to-govt/article38075389.ece
31 December 2021||Kolkata,||24 V-Cs named without my nod: Dhankar||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Thursday said that the State government had appointed Vice-Chancellors to 24 universities without his approval. “V-Cs of 24 universities appointed @MamataOfficial in disregard of law. These are ex facie in defiance of specific orders or without approval by Chancellor, the appointing authority,” Mr. Dhankhar said. “These appointments carry no legal sanction and would be forced to take action unless soon recalled,” he added. State govt. proposal Governor is the Chancellor of all State universities and appointment of Vice-Chancellor is usually made by the Governor on the recommendations of the State government. The development comes days after State’s Education Minister Bratya Basu said that the State government is considering a proposal to make Chief Minister Chancellor of all State universities. Recently, the Governor had called a meeting of Vice- Chancellors of private universities but none of them turned up at Raj Bhavan. War of words In another development, a ward of words erupted between Mr. Dhankhar and Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy.

The Arvind Kejriwal-led party has taken this decision to stem defections as it feels that the coastal State is ‘notorious’ for politicians jumping to other parties, an AAP leader said. The AAP has decided to contest all 40 seats in Goa Assembly polls, scheduled to be held in February 2022. “Goa, despite being a tiny State is notorious for political defections,” AAP leader Amit Palekar said. “In order to resolve the problem, the AAP candidates will sign a legal affidavit, promising that they will not quit the party to join another one,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/aap-to-make-goa-candidates-sign-affidavits-to-avoid-defections/article38075634.ece

31 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N. police track drug peddlers for 800 km to nab them||A special team of the Narcotics Intelligence Bureau of the Tamil Nadu police on Wednesday apprehended suspecteddrug peddlersafter keeping close track of them for over 800 km from Visakhapatnam to Vellore. The team followed the suspects from Tiruppur who took different modes of transport to smuggle 26 kg of ganja into Tamil Nadu from Andhra Pradesh. They first took a train to Tirupati and then boarded a bus to Tiruppur via Chittoor. Additional Director-General of Police, NIB-CID, Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal said the police team was tracking the suspects, Veerannan and others, on the basis of specific intelligence. After following them by train till Vellore, police intercepted Veerannan and his wife Punitha. The latter was in possession of 26 kg of ganja. “The duo was accompanied by their two children. On questioning, Veerannan said that he took the children along to avoid any suspicion,” Mr. Aggarwal said. The team also secured Kadhir, who was in possession of 8 kg ganja. “The suspects were taking the ganja consignments to Tiruppur for further distribution there,” he said. Intensive search The intensive operation againstNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substanceswas launched on the directions of DGP C. Sylendra Babu on December 6. The NIB special team, under the direct supervision of Superintendent of Police Rohit Nathan Rajagopal, comprised DSPs C. Murali and R. T. Ramachandran, among others, police said.

31 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Compensate us for land given to PSUs in case of privatisation’||In case of privatisation of Central public sector undertakings for which the State had given land, the Union government should compensate the State with the land cost at the current rates or with an equivalent equity stake in the new entity, Tamil Nadu said on Thursday. Speaking at a meeting of the State Finance Ministers, chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, ahead of the Union Budget in Delhi, Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan said the Tamil Nadu government had given land for free or at concessional rates for many Central public sector undertakings and projects. “During the privatisation of such organisations, the State should justly be compensated for the land either through payment of the land cost at the current market value or through an equivalent equity stake in the new entity. Further, to incentivise the States to show more interest in Union government projects, I request that a policy be formulated and announced in the Budget,” he said. Mr. Rajan underlined that the increased levy of cesses and surcharges, which are not part of the divisible pool, had adversely affected the transfer of resources to the States. The cesses and surcharges, as a proportion of the Union government’s Gross Tax Revenue, had almost tripled from 6.26% in 2010-11 to 19.9% in 2020-21. In effect, the States are deprived of a share in approximately 20% of the revenue collected by the Union. “As a consequence of this realignment, the ratio of grants-in-aid to share in the Central taxes has increased from 62.67% in FY 2010-11 to 130.7% in FY 2020-21 for Tamil Nadu. While the share in taxes is a legitimate right and provides the State with the autonomy to cater to local needs and aspirations, the grants-in-aid are discretionary and tied funds. This greatly impinges on the federal structure enshrined in the Constitution,” he contended. He reiterated Tamil Nadu’s previous demand that the Union government merge the cesses and the surcharges into the basic rates of tax. In the last five years, there has been a wide gap between the revenues realised and the revenues guaranteed, and the States’ revenues were yet to recover. “I urge the Union government to extend the period of compensation by at least two years beyond June 2022 and also request the immediate release of the pending compensation of Rs. 16,725 crores.” Noting that the share of revenue collected from indirect taxes in the Union government’s Gross Tax Revenue had increased sharply in the recent past and surpassed the collections from direct taxes in 2020-21, he said, “This is highly inequitable, as indirect taxes are regressive, and disproportionately affect the poor. I request the Union government to maintain a ratio of 60:40 between direct taxes and indirect taxes.” He highlighted that Rs. 17,000 crore in dues were pending from the Union government to Tamil Nadu. A sum of Rs. 2,029.22 crore in performance grants for the period from 2017-18 to 2019-20 and the basic grant of Rs. 548.76 crore for 2019-20 under the14th Finance Commission were also pending.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/compensate-us-for-land-given-to-psus-in-case-of-privatisation/article38075594.ece
31 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Fresh cases rise to 890 in T.N.; Chennai records 397 infections||Fresh COVID-19 cases shot up to 890 in Tamil Nadu on Thursday. For the second day in a row, Chennai’s daily cases jumped by 100 as 397 people tested positive for the infection, while cases crossed 100 in Chengalpattu district. Among those who tested positive were five international travellers — two from the US and one each from the UK, UAE and Singapore — and five from other States, including two from West Bengal and one each from Maharashtra and Karnataka. The fresh cases took the State’s tally to 27,46,890. Chengalpattu recorded 103 cases, while there were 73 cases in Coimbatore. A total of 35 people tested positive for the infection in Tiruvallur, 28 in Tiruppur, 27 in Erode and 26 in Salem. Tenkasi had no fresh case, while 23 districts logged fewer than 10 cases each. Seven deaths The State recorded seven more deaths, taking the toll to 36,765. There were two deaths in Coimbatore and one each in Ariyalur, Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Tirunelveli. Another 608 patients were discharged, taking the recoveries to 27,03,196. A total of 1,69,676 persons, including 93,218 persons aged 18 to 44 years and 46,282 persons aged 45 to 59 years, were vaccinated. This took the overall coverage of government vaccination centres so far to 8,09,97,899. The coverage of private vaccination centres so far stood at 28,22,152, according to the daily report issued by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fresh-cases-rise-to-890-in-tn/article38075586.ece
31 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Venkatesan raises concerns over ‘mission mode’ recruitment||Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan has raised concerns over the Ministry of Education’s instructions to all Central Educational Institutions (CEIs) to fill all faculty vacancies in reserved categories in a “mission mode” by pointing out that the measure had been half-hearted. In a letter submitted to Union Minister of Education Dharmendra Pradhan, he said the Ministry had not taken concrete measures to resolve issues related to implementation of reservation in a majority of the CEIs, including the IITs, IIMs and the NITs, as they followed a flexible cadre structure. Following concerns from various quarters on the poor representation of people from Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and Other Backward Class communities in the CEIs, the Ministry issued instructions in August to all institutions asking them to fill the vacancies, especially in SC/ST/OBC and Economically Weaker Section categories, in a mission mode between September 2021 and September 2022. In flexible cadre structure, the faculty strength in an institution was fixed as a whole without cadre-wise split on the number of Assistant Professors, Associate Professors and Professors. A number of CEIs had approached the Ministry, seeking clarification on the implementation of Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Teachers’ Cadre) Act of 2019. Rosters In the reply to a question raised by Mr. Venkatesan recently in the Lok Sabha, the Ministry said that no CEI had expressed inability to prepare reservation rosters for the vacancies which, he said, was essential to fill them. However, he said, the replies received separately through the Right to Information Act from six CEIs, which included four IITs and two NITs, showed that they were unable to prepare the rosters. In reply to the same question, he said the Ministry also failed to provide community-wise vacancies available in the CEIs and instead only said 13,701 posts were lying vacant. Moreover, Mr. Venkatesan furnished a list of 130 job advertisements issued by the CEIs recently, of which only less than 20 had advertised the total number of vacancies and community-wise number of vacancies available. He urged the Ministry to ensure that all the CEIs uploaded cadre-wise and community-wise vacancies available on their websites. “If the aim of the ongoing mission mode recruitment is really to ensure adequate representation of the SC/ST/OBC categories according to the CEI Act-2019, then special recruitment should compulsorily be conducted on the basis of reservation roster of each cadre of teaching posts,” he said in his letter to the Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/venkatesan-raises-concerns-over-mission-mode-recruitment/article38075916.ece
31 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Sudden downpour brings life to halt in city||After a month of sunshine and flood-free roads, Chennai witnessed unprecedented rains on Thursday paralysing the city more than any other rainy day of the northeast monsoon. The sudden downpour that hit the city from 3 p.m. left central parts such as T. Nagar, Mylapore, Nungambakkam, and Teynampet flooded. In some places, the water entered the ground floor of houses. Rainwater entered some corridors in the northern part of the Secretariat building at Fort St. George. Over 100 streets in the city were water-logged and four subways closed, said Minister for Revenue and Disaster Management K.K.S.S.R. Ramachandran. Work was on to clear the floodwater on at least 106 streets and subways, Mr. Ramachandran told reporters. The entire machinery of the Greater Chennai Corporation was at flood-mitigation work, he said. The tanks and reservoirs around Chennai were being monitored, he said. Rainfall was particularly high in M.R.C. Nagar, Nandanam, Vadapalani and nearby areas, the Minister said. Buses delayed With the arterial roads flooded, there was gridlock across the city. MTC buses were delayed as they were caught in traffic jams, office-goers had to wait for several hours to return home. Metro trains, MRTS and suburban services hauled people safely. At a Metro station in Anna Salai, 300 to 400 people were waiting in a queue to board the train at 8 p.m. and trains were running packed. The Metro train services were extended till midnight in view of the rush. Cab fares surged more than four times the normal fare in the evening. A ride from T. Nagar to Koyambedu showed Rs. 1,300 on the app and many residents had to cancel their trips owing to the traffic congestion and sky high fares. Three electrocuted Three electrocutions were reported in the city. A 13-year-old boy, Lakshmanan, was electrocuted outside his house in Myalpore. An elderly woman, Tamilarasi, too was electrocuted at Otteri when she was on the road. Another woman, Meena, was electrocuted at Pulianthope. Several trees were felled by strong winds that accompanied the rains at times. At Rajarathinam Stadium, the tents were ripped off by the gutsy winds. There were power cuts in many northern parts of the city. Water released With more rain predicted in Chennai and its three neighbouring districts, it was decided to release more water from the reservoirs. With both Chembarambakkam and Red Hills reservoirs receiving an inflow of 3,000 cusecs, it was decided to increase the discharge to 1,000 cusecs and 1,500 cusecs respectively from the two reservoirs. Poondi reservoir received inflow of 3,000 cusecs and as it was filled up, about 1,000 cusecs was released, the officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sudden-downpour-brings-life-to-halt-in-city/article38075571.ece
31 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A good beginning raises more expectations||Emerging from the shadows of his illustrious father M. Karunanidhi, who came to represent the DMK for nearly five decades in the post-Annadurai era, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin took over the reins of the Tamil Nadu government in May, inheriting a huge debt burden and an intense second wave of COVID-19, with promises to keep. The “Dravidian stock” leader also made heads turn with his choice of words to describe the Centre as the “Union government” (‘ Ondriya Arasu ’). Contrary to apprehensions about whether the DMK government would be able to fulfil its populist electoral promises, it introduced free travel for women and transpersons on select bus routes and reduced the petrol price by Rs. 3 a litre, keeping its promise in part. The government presented an exclusive agriculture budget, installed a real-time monitoring dashboard in the Chief Minister’s office, took steps to implement the ‘Chief Minister in Your Constituency’ scheme, besides posting young officers as Collectors and announcing more municipal corporations. While the names of several government departments were rechristened, several boards and committees, hitherto defunct, were activated and more of them constituted. Many policies to guide the government have been released, or are being drafted. The constitution of the Chief Minister’s Economic Advisory Committee, including a Nobel laureate and a former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, was a novel step to help the State devise plans to emerge from the pandemic-induced economic situation. In fact, the DMK government also implemented what the C. Rangarajan Committee suggested to the previous AIADMK government — Tamil Nadu Urban Employment Scheme. The flooding of several areas in Chennai during November-December was a matter of concern though the government had its boots on the ground. The handling of the rescue operations in the aftermath of the IAF helicopter crash in Coonoor that killed Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and 13 others came in for praise from the defence forces. While the honeymoon period for the government has been extended, thanks to the internal differences in the AIADMK, which is yet to take on the rulers effectively, the real test for Mr. Stalin would be to prove himself in the long run. The DMK has to fulfil its other promises. Keeping corruption under check, evaluating Ministers, some of whose performance in and out of the Assembly has been lacklustre, and handling the demand for inducting his son Udhayanidhi in the Cabinet would be some of the tasks before him in 2022. The long-pending issue of release of seven life convicts in the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case also needs to be handled.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-good-beginning-raises-more-expectations/article38075582.ece
31 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Flooded Chennai roads cause gridlock||Vehicular traffic was severely affected on many arterial roads in the city from 5 p.m. as these were flooded due to heavy rains. Bumper-to-bumper traffic was witnessed on the roads. Office-goers and other motorists had a harrowing experience. On Anna Salai, there was a long line of vehicles from Periyar statue near Simpson up to Kathipara Grade separator. Similar scenes were witnessed on EVR Salai, GST Road and 100 Feet Road from Ashok Nagar. People waiting at bus stops were drenched in pounding rain. Many could not hail autorickshaws as the drivers demanded exorbitant fares. Ramalaxmi, a resident of Ennore, said” “I had to wait for hours for a bus to go to Ennore. The buses were coming late and the auto drivers were demanding more money. Another difficulty was that the shelter was leaky. My friends and I were drenched in rain.” Sivabalan, a resident of Porur, was stranded at T.Nagar. He said: “It took three hours for me to reach home from office. I was really scared when my vehicle stopped and had to push it for some distance in the stagnant water.” At several places, public volunteered to regulate the traffic. Many motorists were stranded on the roads as their vehicles got stuck in the flood waters. The police closed the Gengu Reddy subway, Duraiswamy subway and RBI subway. The traffic was moving at a snail’s pace due to waterlogging of Raja Mannar Salar in K.K. Nagar, Sivaswami Salai in Mylapore; EVR Salai-Gandhi Irwin to Nair Point in Egmore, Jawahar Nagar 20 feet Salai in Sembium, Red Hills Road in Kolathur Vinayagapuram, Periyar Salai-100 Feet Road, Nungambakkam Lakeview Salai, Katchery Road in Santhome, Rajaratinam Stadium in Egmore, 70 feet road in Ashok Nagar, Kodungaiyur Housing Board and on roads near Periamet police station. Later in the night, suburban areas were hit by traffic jams. “There was waterlogging in subways and roads. Water is being pumped out. Motorists are requested to choose the road wisely and drive carefully,” the traffic police said in an appeal to the public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/many-roads-flooded-causing-gridlock-across-city/article38075566.ece
31 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Facing the second wave of COVID-19||The year 2021 was nothing less than a challenging one for Tamil Nadu’s health sector. The surge in COVID-19 cases from the end of March wreaked havoc on the State as it ran out of hospital beds and grappled with acute shortage of medical oxygen to save patients. Though daily infections had gradually dipped at the start of the year, the relief was short-lived as the Delta variant drove an exponential rise in daily cases, resulting in the second wave of COVID-19 infections. Cases surged rapidly, reaching the highest daily load of 36,184 on May 21. Chennai, which turned into a COVID-19 hotspot, saw its daily cases rise to 7,564 on May 12, days after a new government was sworn in. Hospitals, particularly government institutions, were flooded with patients, while ambulances carrying patients lined up outside the institutions as beds, especially oxygen-supported and ICU beds, and medical oxygen became scarce. The severity in infections led to a rise in fatalities. Tamil Nadu recorded the most number of deaths — 493 — on May 30. The peak positivity was 20.78%, according to official data. A complete lockdown came into force on May 10 that gave the much-needed breather for hospitals and their workforce as well as time to scale up infrastructure. Increasing the oxygen capacity and beds were among the main challenges for the government. In the next few weeks, several measures were initiated to increase oxygen supply, storage and production, while the number of beds, especially oxygen-supported ones, were ramped up simultaneously. The State’s oxygen storage capacity had increased from 220 tonnes in May to 1,300 tonnes now, while the total number of beds has crossed 1 lakh. It took almost six months for the daily infections to drop below 1,000. On November 1, the daily cases dropped to 990. After COVID-19 vaccination was rolled out on January 16, the initial hesitancy led to poor uptake of the vaccine, resulting in wastage of doses. There were also issues in vaccine supplies that were rectified during the latter half of the year. To fasten the pace of vaccination, the Health Department launched mega camps every week, and took up door-to-door vaccination measures. It has achieved 85% coverage in the administration of the first dose. Nearly 58% of the population have been fully vaccinated as of date. The year also saw the launch of ambitious healthcare projects. Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam , a scheme that aims to take healthcare to the doorstep of the people, through screening for non-communicable diseases, delivery of drugs and palliative care, was rolled out in August. Earlier this month, another initiative, Innuyir Kaapoom-Nammai Kaakum 48 , was launched with a network of 609 hospitals to provide emergency care for accident victims, with the government stepping in to fund the treatment for the first 48 hours. The State has set up its own whole genome sequencing laboratory at the State Public Health Laboratory to enable the identification of new variants of COVID-19. With the emergence of a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, Omicron, the health sector is once again gearing up for a surge in cases.  Tamil Nadu has set up its own whole genome sequencing laboratory at the State Public Health Laboratory to enable the identification of new variants of SARS-CoV-2||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/facing-the-second-wave-of-covid-19/article38075574.ece
31 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Another tough year for Tamil Nadu’s finances||Tamil Nadu’s finances were under stress yet again in 2021. While the revenue collection showed improvement, expenditure remained on the higher side. The DMK government, which assumed office in May, released a White Paper on State’s finances which showed that the fiscal position was in dire straits because of structural flaws in governance. The revised budget for 2021-22 presented in August has estimated Tamil Nadu’s fiscal deficit at Rs. 92,529.43 crore, excluding Rs. 8,095 crore to be received as back to back loan from the Centre towards GST compensation. Fiscal deficit is the difference between total revenue and expenditure. Excluding the GST compensation for 2020-21 and 2021-22, the State’s outstanding debt is projected to be Rs. 5.77 lakh crore as on March 31, 2022. The revenue deficit for 2021-22 is projected at Rs. 58,692.68 crore, much higher than Rs. 41,417.30 crore projected in the interim budget presented by the outgoing AIADMK government. Revenue deficit is the difference between the government’s revenue receipts and revenue expenditure and reflects that the government’s earnings were not adequate to meet its day-to-day operational expenses such as salaries and interest payments. CAG figures According to unaudited provisional figures from the Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG), the State’s total receipts (including the State’s Own Tax Revenue and the share of Central Taxes, among others, and excluding borrowings) was Rs. 85,452.77 crore in April-September 2021, up 26.2% from Rs. 67,707.63 crore in the comparable period last year. The State’s Own Tax Revenue (SOTR), which accounts for 70% of the total revenue, increased by 36.35% to Rs. 50,324.31 crore in the first half of 2021-22 from Rs. 36,907.46 crore in the first half of 2020-21. Stamps and registration fees, State GST, taxes on sales and trade (including the tax on petroleum products and sales tax on liquor), land revenue and excise duties are the components of SOTR. According to the Reserve Bank of India, tax collections had exhibited a strong growth across States and reached the pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2021-22. Despite recovery in revenue, expenditure continued to be at elevated levels. The figure rose to about Rs. 1.07 lakh crore in the first half of 2021-22 from Rs. 98,913.22 crore. Tamil Nadu had incurred an additional expenditure of Rs. 17,618.8 crore on account of COVID-19 relief this year. Recently, the State government announced an increase in dearness allowance for the State government staff, teachers and pensioners which would cost it an additional expenditure of Rs. 8,724 crore a year. The State is expected to spend 66% of its revenue receipts on payment of salaries, interest and pension in 2021-22, which is higher than average of all states at about 55%. Till October 2021, the State’s fiscal deficit stands at Rs. 28,108.69 crore and revenue deficit is at Rs. 10,126 crore for 2021-22. Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan has said the State government would reduce its revenue deficit during 2021-22 and has pitched for data-centric governance approach for better targeting of subsidies and measures to plug revenue leaks. The White Paper has hinted about structural reforms to fix the flaws in the finances. The State Budget to be presented next year would be keenly watched for reform measures and how the DMK government fulfils its poll promises, key among them is providing Rs. 1,000 a month for women home-makers. Any severe impact from Omicron variant would add to the financial stress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/another-tough-year-for-tamil-nadus-finances/article38075576.ece
31 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A slow return to offline learning||While cancellation of board examinations marked the end of the academic year 2020-21 following the surge in COVID-19 cases, educational institutions in Tamil Nadu slowly reopened their campuses for physical classes in phases starting in September. The transition from online classes to offline education was smooth for the most part, with teachers and students adapting to COVID-19 safety protocols. Despite the transition, the School Education Department announced offline revision tests for Classes X and XII. The final exams for these classes is scheduled for May 2022, instead of March, and the revision tests will be conducted in January-end and March. The year saw some incidents of indecorous behaviour by teachers with girl students during online classes. The deaths by suicide of a few schoolgirls rocked the State, and the government vigorously promoted its helpline 14417 to prevent more deaths. The government offered 7.5% reservation for students of government schools in engineering college admissions as well. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin’s announcement to waive the tuition and boarding fee for government school students admitted through single-window counselling was a game-changer. The State also launched the llam Thedi Kalvi Scheme  to bring school education to students’ doorstep to update skills after school hours. As many as 10 arts and science colleges were opened during the year. The government’s decision to declare all college students having arrears as having “passed” without an examination was caught in a legal row. The All India Council for Technical Education and the University Grants Commission were insistent that students write their exams to graduate. The new DMK Government averred that offline exams in the conventional pattern would be held. Backed by the Justice A.K. Rajan Committee Report, the government adopted the Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill, 2021, to dispense with “NEET-based admissions” and instead admit students on the basis of their Plus Two scores. However, the Bill is stuck at the Raj Bhavan and will test how the DMK fulfils its electoral promise of abolishing NEET. Delayed counselling Tamil Nadu added 11 medical colleges, with approximately 1,500 government seats, but a series of cases in the Supreme Court lead to the postponement of counselling, including for postgraduate programmes, to next year. The delay also affected the admission process for the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University. Anna University and some affiliated top-rung colleges will vacate many seats when the counselling for medical admission begins. To address the situation, the Higher Education Department announced a second round of counselling for the first time. But the uncertainty surrounding medical admission has hampered the plans.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-slow-return-to-offline-learning/article38075578.ece
31 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Feminist writer Ambai wins Sahitya Akademi award||Tamil feminist writer Ambai, whose writings challenge the stereotyping of women, has won this year’s Sahitya Akademi award. She has been honoured for her short story collection Sivappu Kazhutthudan Oru Patchaiparavai . Ambai is the fourth woman writer from Tamil Nadu to get the award. Another Tamil writer Mu. Murugesh bagged the Bala Sahitya Puraskar for his collection of short stories Ammavukku Magal Sonna Ulagin Mudhal Kadhai . “Though it is a recognition of my writings, I feel embarrassed. I have won the award that eluded writers such as Sundara Ramasamy and Venkat Swaminathan. A lot of friends have played a role in getting me the award,” Ambai, whose original name is C.S. Lakshmi, told The Hindu . Born in Coimbatore in 1944, Ambai obtained a post-graduate degree in history from Madras Christian College and a Ph.D from Jawaharlal Nehru University. She lives in Mumbai and writes for newspapers, including The Hindu , and magazines like Economic and Political Weekly . Though her first short story collection Sirakukal Muriyum was published in 1976 and the eponymous story of the collection was written in 1967, she made her mark as a writer even in her teens. Many of her stories were published in Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan as star stories. Writer K.N. Senthil said Ambai was one among the many Tamil writers who confined themselves to short stories and never forayed into novels. “Even though she has written articles, short stories are her art form.” Her other story collections Veetin Moolaiyil Oru Samayalarai , Kaatil Oru Maan , Vattrum Eriyin Meenkal , Oru Karuppu Silanthiyudan Oor Iravu and Andheri Membalathil Oru Santhippu are published by Kalachuvadu. “Ambai’s arrival is important in the realm of Tamil fiction and narrative in the last 50 years. Her careful and sober writings gathered pace only in the 2000s. They represented the voice that is denied a space. She brought to the boardroom those who languished behind the screens and doors, in the kitchen. She demolished what men portrayed as the world of women,” said Mr. Senthil, who had written in detail about Ambai’s work. He pointed out that the short stories Amma Oru Kolai Seithal and Sirakukal Muriyum continued to retain the aura even 50 years after they were written. Another story is Thanimai Ennum Iruttu . “The loneliness the protagonist felt before marriage continues even after the marriage. As her husband fails to understand her aspirations and longings, she creates a world in the imagination,” Mr. Senthil said of the character. Ambai, the founder-trustee and director of SPARROW (Sound and Picture Archives for Research on Women), asserted, “My characters think not only out of the box but also question the prevailing systems.” “What is to be a good woman is something defined and pre-planned. Drawing a ‘kolam’, cooking and keeping the husband in good humour defines an ideal woman, and this is questioned by my characters.” In an interview to The Hindu , she disagreed with the idea that literature could lead to social change. “Literature can touch upon issues that a particular author feels strongly about. I don’t think it can lead directly to any change. I think writers, like many others, are not creatures who can retain their righteous anger all the time,” she had said. While receiving the Toronto-based Tamil Literary Garden’s lifetime achievement award, she said: “Literature’s seminal concern does not lie in its depiction of ‘truth’. Rather, its interests lie in the relationship that we have with what we perceive as truth. That the nature of this ‘truth’ is constantly altering in our life is the real truth.” Poet Sukirtha Rani said it was Ambai who defined feminism, feminist politics and the concept of language on women’s body for writers like her. “She was able to express her ideas of feminism almost half-a-century ago when the circumstances were hostile, and her ideas are still relevant. I feel as if I have won the award.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/feminist-writer-ambai-wins-sahitya-akademi-award/article38075591.ece
31 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Severe flooding at 143 locations||As many as 143 locations in the city were flooded in the heavy rain on Thursday. According to data compiled by the Greater Chennai Corporation, the civic body received 532 complaints of water stagnation till 8 p.m. Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said 145 pumps were operated to drain water. Many complaints were received from residents of Thirumalai Pillai Road, Habibullah Road, Arcot Road, Paper Mills Road, Rajamannar Salai, Kalakshetra Main Road, LB Road, Five Furlong Road and East Coast Road. The Corporation has increased the number of call agents to 30 at the helpline 1913. Arrangements have been made in the Ripon Building to respond to social media posts from residents. T. Nagar MLA J. Karunanidhi said a large number of complaints of flooding was received from West Mambalam, Parangusapuram, Ashok Nagar, Rangarajapuram and Vadapalani. “Usman Road and Bazulla Road have water stagnation.” In many areas, sewage mixed with stormwater, making it difficult for pedestrians to cross the flooded roads. For instance, EVK Sampath Road was flooded, and a huge amount of sewage overflowed. Egmore MLA I. Parantaman said officials were yet to find out the reason for the sewage overflow on some stretches at Egmore. “Traffic congestion has been severe in most of the roads in the constituency.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/severe-flooding-at-143-locations/article38075572.ece
31 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Ecological conservation takes centre stage||A government advertisement showed Chief Minister M.K. Stalin carrying a ‘manjappai’, the go-to yellow cloth bag of choice for Tamils before modernity seeped into their lives and along came the plastic bags. “There is nothing to be ashamed about in carrying a manjappai,” he said, inaugurating the campaign to promote cloth bags. It symbolised the down-to-earth approach the DMK government has taken in the sectors of environment and forests, with climate change added as a forethought, in its first year in office. IAS Officer Supriya Sahu was hand-picked by Mr. Stalin, like many of his top officials, as the Secretary of Environment and Forests and given free reign to ensure that fragile ecosystems in Tamil Nadu are not damaged further. It began with the revamping of the Forest Department on multiple levels, especially at the top, much to the relief of activists. “For the first time in two decades, I am planning to visit Panagal Maligai (the headquarters of the Forest Department) as honest and straightforward officers have been posted,” said a renowned wildlife filmmaker. Action was not far behind, and conflicts on the field showcased the scientific temper and real intent of the new Government. A year of firsts Rivaldo, a wild elephant, was put in a kraal unnecessarily. After detailed planning and scientific assessment, the wild elephant was let back into the forest. It was the first time the State’s Forest Department had taken up rewilding an elephant successfully. While there were doubters, the foresters monitored Rivaldo constantly to ensure that the rewilding was complete, and it did not fall into the drudgery of captivity. Soon after, the tiger T-23 surfaced in the Mudumalai forests. After it killed four persons and ate parts of one of its victims, there were demands for its killing. However, the Forest Department, led personally by Shekhar Kumar Niraj, Chief Wildlife Warden, toiled in the deciduous jungles for 21 days to successfully tranquillise and capture the tiger alive. They relocated the animal to the Mysore Zoo to ensure its survival. Capturing a problematic tiger alive in the Nilgiris landscape was yet another first for the Forest Department. The Government also decided that India’s first Dugong Conservation Reserve will be built in Tamil Nadu. The dugong, a marine animal, is listed as vulnerable in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. And by December, the Chief Wildlife Warden withdrew “forever” an order by his predecessor to alter the boundaries of the Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary, the country’s oldest bird sanctuary, where community conservation has been in vogue for a couple of centuries. Soon after, Kazhuveli was declared the State’s 16th bird sanctuary to ensure the habitats of the migratory birds along the East Coast are well preserved. On the environmental pollution front, a move that has come as a significant relief for industrial units has been doing away with a rule requiring industries to approach the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to renew the consent to operate every year. Hereafter, clearance will be issued in one go and will have longer validity. Of course, the industries must still strictly adhere to pollution control regulations. In September, the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption conducted raids on the properties of TNPCB chairman A.V. Venkatachalam, who ended his life in December. According to sources, the Chief Minister himself has told the top brass that environment was more important than hazardous development. Though a step in the right direction, the eco-friendly initiatives must be effectively sustained over a long term to make any substantial impact.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ecological-conservation-takes-centre-stage/article38075580.ece

31 December 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Major water leak near Collectorate plugged||Coimbatore Corporation on Thursday plugged a leak in a water pipeline near the Collectorate here. Sources said that while executing the 24x7 drinking water supply improvement work near the Collectorate on Wednesday night, the workers noticed sewage flowing into the trench they had dug. On suspicion that it was not just sewage but sewage mixed with drinking water, the workers traced the leak to the water pipeline at the Old Post Office Road-Avinashi Road Junction. The sources said the engineers supervising the work tested the water for chlorine content and after the result turned positive confirmed that the sewage that flowed into the trench had drinking water. They then traced the water pipeline to identify the leak near the Junction, the sources said and added that the leak was from an old five-inch cast iron pipeline. Though the pipeline was in disuse for long, a recent work at the junction – underground drainage or optical fibre cable work - had damaged the dummy that was used to plug an opening in the cast iron pipeline, the sources said. From the damage the water flowed into the sewage, the sources added. The disused old cast iron pipeline carried water from the Corporation tank near V.O.C. Park. By Thursday 11 a.m., the workers had plugged the leak to resume the 24x7 drinking water pipeline work, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/major-water-leak-near-collectorate-plugged/article38075606.ece

R.M. Ramesh Kumar, a resident of Puliakulam who runs a private civil construction firm in Coimbatore, told The Hindu on Thursday that the construction works for the temple at Deepalapatti village panchayat, near Udumalpet, were completed in 2019. The busts of his father N.R. Marimuthu and his mother Bakkiyam were sculpted at Thirumuruganpoondi and were installed in the temple, he said. “I lost my father when I was 10 years old and my mother passed away when I was 20,” he said. Marimuthu died in 1991, after which his mother raised her six children including himself and his five elder sisters till 2001 when she died, he recalled. “Although one might have several ishta deivam (favourite deities), a kula deivam (family deity) is important. Hence, I decided to have my parents as my kula deivams, ” Mr. Ramesh Kumar said when asked the reason behind the construction of this temple. A priest has been appointed to conduct rituals at the temple every day, he said. No events were organised in the temple due to the COVID-19 pandemic for around two years since 2020, he said. Festival Following the relaxations in the restrictions, a temple festival was organised on December 19, complete with performances of karagattam and other rural art forms and concluded with annadhanam , Mr. Ramesh Kumar said.

The police said Jothiammal, 58, a conservancy worker at Ward 80 for over three decades, was collecting segregated waste from households near R.G. Street in separate bins. Vinod Jain, 46, allegedly dumped mixed waste into a segregated waste bin. A heated argument ensued between the two as she asked him to segregate the waste.

31 December 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Fund sanctioned for setting up turmeric research centre||The State government has accorded administrative approval and sanctioned Rs. 2 crore fund for establishing a research centre for turmeric at Bhavanisagar in the district. The Registrar, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, in his letter to the State government said that though the country is one of the largest producers of turmeric in the world, import of turmeric continues for want of varieties with high curcumin content. The quality of the turmeric rhizomes and various post-harvesting processes affect the final quality of turmeric products that is used in Indian culinary and also in preparation of medicinal oils, ointments and cosmetics. Hence, to improve the quality and quantity in our own varieties and local varieties which are well suited to eco-climatic conditions in Erode, there is a need for setting up a research station, he added. During the Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department budget 2021-22, Minister for Agriculture M.R.K. Panneerselvam said that turmeric is cultivated in 20,000 hectares in the State producing 96,000 tonnes. Hence, the Minister announced the establishment of a new research centre for turmeric at Bhavanisagar on 100-acre land. The centre would focus on collection and maintenance of turmeric germplasm and development of improved varieties of turmeric for industries purpose, strengthen research on crop improvement, management and crop protection, post-harvest and value addition in turmeric, supply quality planting materials of turmeric varieties, conduct demonstration plots for adaptive research trials in the farmers’ fields and impart hands-on training to the farmers on improved technologies in turmeric. Major thrust areas on research are, evolving high yielding varieties with high curcumin content, evolving varieties resistant to rhizome rot and foliar diseases and research on improved scientific management practices. The centre would have one professor of Horticulture, two assistant professors (Horticulture) and one assistant professor (Agricultural Entomology) and one assistant professor (Plant Pathology) who would be deployed from TNAU. The centre would come up on the Agricultural Research Station premises at a renovated building with all amenities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fund-sanctioned-for-setting-up-turmeric-research-centre/article38075718.ece

The well is located along the busy road stretch that is used by hundreds of vehicles every day to reach Erode, Sivagiri and Muthur. There are two road bends near the well where an accident in November claimed the lives of five persons travelling in an omni van. Two speed-breakers were installed and barricades placed by the police to ensure vehicles move at minimum speed on the stretch. However, in the absence of street lights or illumination, vehicle users face inconvenience during night hours in crossing the stretch. The height of the well’s safety wall is less than two feet and needs to be increased at least to five feet, said V. Anandan, a motorist from Sivagiri. He said that the well poses a threat to road users as the water storage capacity is maximum throughout the year. Motorists wanted road railings to be erected at the bends so that in case of mishap, major tragedy could be averted. Also, flickering lights should be installed in the middle of the road. They said that the Highways Department should take steps to ensure that the road is safe for motorists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/open-farm-well-along-road-poses-threat-to-motorists-in-erode/article38075732.ece

31 December 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Sanitary workers demand regularisation of service||Workers’ unions and associations affiliated to the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi staged a protest at Anna Maaligai, the Madurai Corporation headquartews, on Thursday. M. Balasubramanian, general secretary of CITU, M. Amsaraj, general secretary of Tamil Nadu Conservancy Workers’ Association, and S. Boominathan, district coordinator of conservancy workers’ association affiliated to the VCK, addressed the protesters. They said that the Corporation should discontinue daily wage system and regularise the services of contract workers as per a High Court directive. At a time when the governments were striving to keep the cities clean and green through various initiatives and campaigns, it was imperative that the civi body had an adequate strength of sanitary workers. Besides regularising the services of contract workers, the Corporation must give them fair wages in accordance with labour laws. During the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the high risk involved, the conservancy workers cleared mounds of hospital waste and other garbage. In recognition of the importance of their nature of work, the State government included them in the list of frontline workers and announced payment of Rs. 15,000 as COVID-19 incentive. However, the money had not reached all the beneficiaries. The Corporation must ensure that everybody received the incentive. Jobs must be given to legal heirs of workers who died in harness on compassionate grounds so that their families were not left in the lurch. Full salary - either for 30 days or 31 days - must be credited to the conservancy workers’ bank accounts. Two sets of uniform material with stitching fee for each, tricycles and other equipment must be given to the workers. Similarly, contract system should be dropped and service regularisation effected in the engineering section also. Pongal bonus must be given to workers in the engineering section. The conservancy workers should be allotted houses in flats constructed by Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board (erstwhile Slum Clearance Board).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sanitary-workers-demand-regularisation-of-service/article38075920.ece

31 December 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Roll back GST hike for textile sector’||The union government must roll back the increase in Goods and Services Tax rates for textiles, garments and footwear, said Madurai-based Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants Association. In a press release, the association said that in the 45th GST Council meeting, it was recommended to increase the GST on textiles and garments from 5% to 12% with effect from January, much to the consternation of the textile merchants. The textile industry is yet to recover from the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. In case the proposal was accepted by the government and the GST was increased, it would create a negative impact on the textile industry. It could lead to the closure of factories, outlets and shops. It would have a cascading effect on all the activities, including those carried out by the grass-root level producers. Increasing the GST from 5% to 12% would indirectly prompt the small and medium scale players to pass the burden on to the consumers. It is the small and medium scale producers who provide employment to millions of people. The high GST for the textile sector would indirectly affect other sectors such as hotels, travel and packaging. The union and State governments must increase the threshold limit of GST to more than Rs. 2 crore turnover per annum and allow inter-State transportation of goods for small non-GST enterprises. This would definitely encourage the textile industry, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/roll-back-goods-and-services-tax-hike-textile-sector/article38075704.ece

31 December 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Lawspet residents upset over lack of proper traffic management on ECR||Residents of Lawspet are finding it difficult to cross the East Coast Road (ECR) at Kokku Park, Latha Steel junction, Maduvapet and Sivaji Statue in the absence of proper traffic management. The automatic traffic signals installed at Kokku Park and Sivaji Statue are erratic in functioning. There are no electronic signals at Latha Steel and Madupet junctions. Compounding the problem of vehicle users from Lawspet is the absence of police personnel to man these junctions, even during peak hours. “It is an everyday struggle for us to cross these junctions. Forget about the defunct traffic lights because it is the same case in many other places, but the non-deployment of traffic police to regulate movement of vehicles is the most worrisome issue,” said Abhirami, a resident of Pilliar Koil Street, Lawspet Main Road. ‘Arduous task’ Chaos prevails during peak hours at Kokku Park and Maduvapet as several residents take these routes to reach the junction. “Everyone will be in a hurry during morning hours. Crossing the junction will be an arduous task. Sometimes we have to wait for several minutes to cross,” she said. “We have never seen police personnel in these two junctions. In the last two days, traffic was hectic and crossing these junctions was challenging. At least during peak hours, police could be deployed for regulating movement of vehicles,” a government employee residing at Lawspet said. Accidents have become common at Maduvapet and Latha Steel junction due to speeding vehicles. There are at least two major educational institutions on either side of the ECR. “Dropping children during morning hours has become a risky affair. Also, we have to take lunch for the children,” said Abhirami. President of Avvayi Nagar Association P. B Seshadri said the association planned to submit a detailed memorandum to the government on the difficulties faced by the Lawspet residents. “We will be submitting the memorandum after New Year. The police should either provide automatic signals at these places or deploy adequate personnel for traffic regulation,” he added. According to a traffic police official, lack of manpower was the reason for not deploying personnel. “Once the recruitment process for constables is completed, we will have enough strength for traffic duty deployment. We are also taking steps to repair the malfunctioned automatic signals at the earliest,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lawspet-residents-upset-over-lack-of-proper-traffic-management-on-ecr/article38075967.ece
31 December 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Former MP Ramadass urges Lieutenant Governor not to delay local body elections||Former Member of Parliament M. Ramadass has urged the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry Tamilisai Soundararajan not to “play into the hands of vested interests” that seek to further delay the local body elections and to instruct the Law Department to find ways and means of conducting the polls without further delay. In a letter to the Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Ramadass said these elections, which would truly revolutionise governance, have been kept in the back-burner for 53 long years, from 1968 to 2021, except the period of 2006-2011. It is hard not to see the Government Order (G.O.) constituting a single-member Commission as "one more tactical but unintelligent ploy of the political bosses of Puducherry to dilly-dally on the local body elections in Puducherry,” he said. "It is quite unfortunate that your good self as Lieutenant Governor has been trapped into the irrational and undemocratic trampling of constitutional provisions in Puducherry,” Mr. Ramadass said. He also felt that filing of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition in the Madras High Court was neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition to withdraw the well conceived G.O. of 2019. The two arguments in the PILs state that the wards for Scheduled Tribes (STs) are wrongly earmarked and in a few wards, reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) has not been done correctly. The terms of reference of this Commission leads one to feel that it is unnecessary, especially when there is a dedicated State Level Backward Classes Commission that is armed with all the data on Backwardness of people. According to the Constitution of India, the State Government should consult this Commission in all matters of backwardness, even at the local body levels. ‘Data already available’ According to the former MP, the declared objective of the Lieutenant Governor’s order was to facilitate the new Commission to collect data on population of OBCs, ward wise, in 10 municipalities, 10 Commune Panchayats and 812 Village Panchayats, and to provide reservation in wards to OBCs in proportion to their population. However, the superfluousness of the single-member Commission would become evident after a cursory look at the earlier G.O.s of 2019, especially the one dated March 7, 2019, which amply showed that the data that is proposed to be collected by this Commission is already available with the government, he contended. As per these orders, the existing reservation for BCs was 39/116 seats in Municipalities (33.6%), 37/108 seats in commune panchayats (34.3%) and 272/812 seats in village panchayats (33.5%). In the big picture, 348 of the total 1036 seats (33.6%) were reserved for BCs. The reservation of seats to OBCs has also been decided by the same government only after ascertaining their respective population in rural and urban areas. In fact, the Puducherry Government was one among the first few States/UTs in the country which came forward to provide reservation to OBCs in local body elections, Mr. Ramadass said. Mr. Ramadass wondered why the 2019 G.O. should be rescinded when nobody had raised an objection or gone to courts and a Commission was constituted. Rescinding its own G.O. without any Cabinet consultation has undermined the sanctity of the government itself and instilled an impression that there will be no reservation for OBCs in the local body elections, provoking another petition in the High Court, he said. Besides, the terms of reference is also silent on reservation of wards to STs, Most Backward Classes (MBCs), Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) and Economically weaker sections (EWSs) leaving room in future for anyone to petition the court, he said. Mr. Ramadass wanted the Lieutenant Governor to be firm and stop the affront to the Constitution by the ruling political class, as these "champions of Statehood demanding more powers unto themselves, cannot deny powers to the lower layer of democracy and keep it under suspended animation.”  Rescinding its own G.O. without any Cabinet consultation has undermined the sanctity of the government itself and instilled an impression that there will be no reservation for OBCs in the local body elections||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/former-mp-ramadass-urges-lieutenant-governor-not-to-delay-local-body-elections/article38075969.ece

31 December 2021||RAMANATHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Fishermen call off stir, to go to sea on Jan. 3||In a major development, fishermen associations from Rameswaram and other pockets of the coastal district have decided to call off the stir with immediate effect and venture into the sea from January 3, 2022. The associations stayed off the sea in protest since December 19 after the Sri Lankan Navy arrested 68 fishermen and seized their vessels on a charge of poaching into their territory. They had planned to resort to rail blockade on January 1, 2022, at Thangachimadam. Under these circumstances, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, in a proactive move, wrote to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar stressing the immediate need to intervene with his counterpart in Sri Lanka and bring about a permanent solution. As a follow-up, Fisheries Minister Anita Radhakrishnan held talks with the fishermen association leaders and promised to lead a delegation to New Delhi for a meeting with the Union Minister. The fishermen leaders also met DMK MP Kanimozhi. Ramanathapuram Collector Shankar Lal Kumawat, SP E. Karthik, and other officials also held talks with association office-bearers. After the senior officials in the district said that the State government had taken measures to resolve the issue, they decided to call off their agitation, Jesu Raja, a fishermen leader, said. “We will go for work from January 3, 2022,” Mr. Raja told The Hindu . The fishermen leaders were informed that they would in all probability get an appointment with the Union Minister before January 10, 2022.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rameswaram-fishermen-call-off-stir/article38075603.ece

31 December 2021||TENKASI,TAMIL NADU||Safe Tenkasi Initiative: 650 cameras installed in 35 days||In a major step forward, the police department in Tenkasi district has installed 650 CCTV cameras in the last 35 days and it has appealed to the public to participate in installation of more surveillance gadgets in residential and public areas. Coined ‘Safe Tenkasi Initiative’ by Superintendent of Police Krishnaraj, police say they propose to cover the entire district in a phased manner. The district, which has a floating population including from neighbouring Kerala, is expanding manifold. Under such circumstances, police have more challenges to prevent crimes and ensure maintenance of law and order.With the CCTV cameras coming in handy to custodians of law, they plan to widen the ‘third eye’ to more locations in the coming days. By installing cameras in and around bus stand, bus stops, important shrines, business areas and near ATMs, the crimes can be swiftly detected. The police control room will use the technology and rope in the general public to be a part of the prevention programme. As a first step, the SP has identified one policeman in each station in the district to coordinate with the public. Interested public and organisations in the respective jurisdiction may contact the police station concerned or dial 93856-78039 for more information. Pamphlets about the features of installing CCTV cameras on intersections of major village roads in the district have also been identified. The traffic wing police say that apart from tracking cases such as hit and run, they can also identify vehicles parked in ‘No Parking’ zone, which will enable in decongesting traffic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/650-cctv-cameras-installed-in-tenkasi-in-35-days/article38075711.ece

31 December 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||CM announces revised remuneration for paddy procurement centre workers||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Thursday announced a new remuneration structure for the employees of the direct paddy procurement centres run by the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation. At a function organised here to inaugurate development projects and distribute welfare assistance, he said the wage for the loadmen had been hiked to Rs. 10 per bag from the existing Rs. 3.25. They were also entitled to travelling allowance. Record clerks and watchmen would receive Rs. 5,288 and Rs. 5,218 a month respectively, in addition to Rs. 3,499 in dearness allowance, he said. Recalling how the DMK government of M. Karunanidhi had safeguarded the State’s right to Cauvery water, Mr. Stalin said it was Karunanidhi who had installed the statue of Raja Raja Cholan near the Big Temple after the Union Government denied permission for putting it up in the temple complex. School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi said efforts were being made to achieve 100% literacy in Thanjavur district. Steps were being taken to run a mobile library of the Saraswathi Mahal Library. Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation AITUC Workers’ Union State general secretary C. Chandrakumar said the loadmen had thus far got Rs. 2.05 per bag in handling charges and Rs. 1.24 in loading charges. But the union had been demanding Rs. 10 in handling charges. The new remuneration might not cause cheers among the record clerks and the watchmen since they had been demanding a basic wage of Rs. 15,000 a month, he said.

31 December 2021||THENI,TAMIL NADU||Theni land scam: DGP directs CB-CID to conduct probe||Director General of Police C. Sylendra Babu has directed the CB-CID police to conduct investigation into the alleged land scam case registered by Theni District Crime Branch (DCB) police. In a release, the State police chief said the DCB police in Theni registered three cases against serving officials in revenue, land survey and other departments on December 23. Based on a complaint from Sub-Collector (Periyakulam) C.A. Rishabh, the case was registered under IPC Sections 409, 465, 466, 477 A, 468, 471, 472, 109 read with 13 (2), 13 (1) (c), 13 (1) (d) and the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. As the names of the accused figured in the FIR included a serving RDO, Tahsildars, a Land Surveyor, Deputy Tahsildars and other private persons, the CB-CID would conduct the probe, he said. The preliminary probe revealed that the revenue officials had allegedly connived with private persons, including an AIADMK functionary identified as Anna Prakash, and issued pattas in their names in Ganguvarpatti, Vadaveeranaickenpatti, Thamaraikulam and other places. The lands to the extent of over 180 acres belonged to the government. The DCB probe also indicated that the private persons had benefited, including receipt of patta, through a chain of orders issued, and the CB-CID police had been entrusted with the task of investigating the case with immediate effect.

31 December 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||We have ensured all-round development, says CM||Chief Minister M. K. Stalin on Thursday said that though the State was facing a tough financial situation, his government had ensured all-round development and implemented many social welfare schemes. Speaking at a function after laying the foundation stone for the new integrated bus terminus at Panchapur and inaugurating the renovated Chathiram Bus Stand in the city, Mr. Stalin said that as soon as the DMK government assumed office it faced the challenge of the rapid spread of COVID-19. However, his government worked day and night and brought the situation under control. The State thereafter faced another challenge in the form of abnormal rain and flooding. It was also managed well with the support of Ministers, elected representatives and officials, thus gaining the confidence of the people, he said. Recollecting the seven broad promises given to the people in the DMK’s State conference in Tiruchi days prior to the State Assembly election, Mr. Stalin said that his government had been functioning with the aim of improving the overall growth of farmers and ensuring robust industrial development. Listing the schemes being implemented during the last seven months of the DMK regime, Mr. Stalin said that the DMK in its manifesto promised a separate budget for agriculture and kept its word. Referring to the special drive to receive petitions from the public in different parts of the State, the Chief Minister said that more than 78,000 petitions had been received from the people in Tiruchi district. Of them, action had been taken on 45,000 petitions. He would ensure proper action on remaining each and every petition from Tiruchi. “I want the government schemes to reach the targetted people. I want to see people attaining self-sufficiency in all aspects,” Mr. Stalin said. The Chief Minister also gave away various welfare assistance to beneficiaries. K. N. Nehru, Minister for Municipal Administration, who presided over the function said that the integrated bus terminus was a long-felt demand of the people of Tiruchi. Minister for School Education Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, Members of Parliament S. Thirunavukarasar and S. Jothimani, and Rajya Sabha MP Tiruchi N. Siva, MLAs Abdul Samad and Inigo Irudhayaraj spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/we-have-ensured-all-round-development-says-cm/article38075673.ece
31 December 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Rockfort lights up a picturesque Tiruchi skyline||The illumination of the Rockfort - an iconic landmark of Tiruchi was inaugurated by Chief Minister M. K. Stalin on Thursday. The project, undertaken as part of heritage tourism development involves the illumination of the hillock and a light-and-sound show at the Teppakulam Rockfort Thayumanaswamy Temple. The Tiruchi Corporation has set up nearly 180 LED lights to illuminate the 273-ft tall Rockfort. Corporation officials said that LED lights were fitted on the existing poles around the hillock. The illumination was done at an estimated cost of Rs. 11.3 crore under a design, build, operate and transfer (DBOT) basis for a five-year period under the Smart Cities Mission. Operation and maintenance of the show for three years are included in the estimate. The illumination of the Rockfort will enable people even from far-off places to enjoy a picturesque view of the landmark, officials of the civic body said. Meanwhile, work to set up a light and sound show in the Teppakulam is yet to be completed. Customised equipment, including an LED screen, was installed above the water level on buoyant material. The work costs Rs. 8.8 crore and seeks to showcase the history of Tiruchi. Pre-recorded videos about the historical importance of the Rockfort, the various rulers who ruled the land, and other places of historical importance in Tiruchi, would be screened at fixed timings. Underground pipelines were also being laid for a fountain show along with colourful lights and music.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rockfort-lights-up-a-picturesque-tiruchi-skyline/article38075676.ece
31 December 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Bidding farewell to 2021 on a subdued note||A muted sense of celebration prevails over the city as people prepare to bid farewell to 2021. Traditionally a time for large (and ticketed) late-night parties, the year seems to be ending on a more reflective and introverted note. Part of this is due to many hotels in the city cancelling large gatherings due to the pandemic. But part of it may also be a change in public tastes, say those in the hospitality and event management sector. “The restrictions on international flights and reduced tourism had already affected the city’s hotels. We were expecting to bounce back with the year-end festive season, but the new variant (Omicron) has forced us to put off events,” S. Ramesh, operations manager, Hotel Grand Gardenia, told The Hindu . “We have to wait and see how the Government responds, in order for us to move ahead.” The downtime had also given many hotels an opportunity to upgrade their facilities, he added. “There is a demand for high quality hotels in Tiruchi, because it is a hub for regional tourism. We hope more luxury properties will enter the city in the near future,” Mr. Ramesh said. The decline in social gatherings has helped to create a market for parties with a more personal touch. Event management companies have stepped in to curate events for limited groups of people. “The volume of home-based functions among families has increased during the pandemic. Corporate clients have also cut down their budget for these occasions,” said Sudhakar Mahadevan, managing partner, Kreativ India, an advertising agency whose event management wing handles birthday and wedding parties. He added that event organisers now tend to outsource elements like catering and waitstaff because it is more economical than maintaining an in-house team of employees. Customers also are looking for a simpler and more eco-friendly celebration. “But we would prefer to see this as a transitory change; things will rebound eventually,” he said. For JustnFlair, that specialises in surprise celebrations for personal occasions, being unique is important. “People from the age of 18 to 35 years approach us for ideas that are not being done elsewhere. A traditional gathering in a hall or hotel is formal – we inject some fun and unexpected happiness into our events,” said planner Mohamed Naveeth. However, some people remain determined to see the year out with a bang. “The pandemic and fears of Omicron have certainly diluted the mood, but people are still hoping to have a good time on New Year’s Eve,” said R. Natarajan, Food and Beverages manager, Ramyas Hotels. “Since we adopted pandemic operating procedures early on, we are hosting our annual festive season buffets and a New Year gala dinner at our restaurants with special menus and musical entertainment for families,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bidding-farewell-to-2021-on-a-subdued-note/article38075677.ece
31 December 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Fear of GST on power charges grips units||Though industries in MSME sector have gradually resumed operations, the fear of power charges soaring up further on account of impending GST (Goods and Service Tax) levy has gripped several units struggling to survive the pandemic impact. Most of the fabrication industries are yet to breathe free due to the lockdown impact of COVID 19, which was aggravated by the decision of Tangedco to levy charges even for the three-month lockdown period last year from March to May. The industry associations have questioned the rationale behind the levy of power charges for the duration of lockdown which was imposed by the State Government. There has been no outcome, though. "We have been making repeated representations to the Tangedco to waive the billing for the three month and the penalty, but to no avail," S. Gopalakrishnan, Secretary of Tiruchi District Tiny and Small Scale Industries' Association said. The MSME units have also been affected by the Tangedco's billing under the old system for industries that used to have welding transformers. Despite replacement of the equipment with latest-type of motors started with ignition key that consume lesser power, the Tangedco continues to carry out billing under the old method that entails payment of surcharge, Mr. Gopalakrishnan said. Almost all industries have dispensed with the use of old type of welding transformers, the Secretary of Tiruchi District Tiny and Small Scale Industries' Association said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fear-of-gst-on-power-charges-grips-units/article38075695.ece
31 December 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Memories of a multi-faceted man||Historical vignettes seem to pop out from every corner of the ‘Thevar Vilas’ in Woraiyur’s Vandikarar Street. Once the family seat of Congressman, freedom fighter, Tiruchi Municipality chairman and sports enthusiast P. Rathnavelu Thevar (1888-1948), also known as P.R. Thevar, the stately home’s most precious furnishings are perhaps the stories and artefacts associated with him. “This house was built over 130 years ago. My great grandfather Palaniappan Thevar was a businessman and my grandfather was his only son. As Palaniappan’s brothers were childless, my grandfather was the sole heir of the family’s fortune,” said T. Rathnavelu Thevar, 73, who resides here now. Visitors to Mr. Rathnavelu’s living quarters on the first floor can see the walls adorned with photographs of the senior Thevar with leading figures of the Indian Independence movement, and cricket memorabilia, among other mementos. “Public service and cricket were my grandfather’s twin passions. He turned down job and business offers from prominent people, and preferred to spend his life and money in public service and promoting sports,” Mr. Rathnavelu told The Hindu . As the founder of the Trichinopoly United Cricket Club (TUCC) in 1914, Thevar brought the game out of its exclusive British confines, making the city a hub of mofussil cricket in pre-independence India. He spent his own funds to popularise the game through the annual ‘Indians versus Europeans’ matches. The TUCC is still functional, albeit without a ground, and the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association conducts the P R Thevar Trophy under-16 inter-district tournament. The glory days of Thevar’s twin careers can be seen in the papers and photographs that Mr. Rathnavelu picks out from assorted cupboards and boxes. “We never really got to preserve these documents properly,” said Mr. Rathnavelu apologetically, as after much persuasion by his wife, he showed an autographed picture of Lala Amarnath and Don Bradman. “He was a gutsy man. Though he was very thin, he had an unbending nature. He studied in SPG School, Tiruchi, and then in Madras Christian College up to Intermediate,” he said. Thevar dropped out before completing his exams under pressure from his uncle to get married. “ Thatha would read books [mostly on cricket] voraciously late into the night, and mark the date when he finished them,” said Mr. Rathnavelu. “Sadly only one or two of the cupboards that used to house his book collection have survived.” Thevar Vilas, which in its original plan had 10 rooms, has also hosted many leaders such as Pandit Jawharlal Nehru, who stayed here when he visited Tiruchi in 1936. Leading political figures of the day, including Sathiamoorthy, R.K. Shangmugam Chetty, Rajaji, Pasumpom Muthuramalinga Thevar and K. Kamaraj, were also closely associated with Thevar. Pictures on the walls show Nehru having lunch at the mansion, seated in typical southern Indian fashion with Sathiamoorthy on his left. He served as Chairman of the Tiruchi Municipality for a record five terms from 1924-46 and as a member of the Legislative Council for many years. He built the imposing Municipal Public Hall in Palakkarai (now known as Thevar Hall) in 1925 to promote arts and culture in the region. Thevar was afflicted by meningitis in 1948 while in Sri Lanka from which he never recovered. Flown back to Madras in an unconscious state, he breathed his last at the General Hospital there. He was cremated before a huge gathering in Tiruchi on June 10, 1948. As he put away the mementoes, Mr. Rathnavelu said, “My grandfather has been forgotten in public memory.

A publication counter, cafeteria, a reverse osmosis water treatment unit, a toilet complex and a camp office were inaugurated at the temple. The facilities have been established at a cost of Rs. 2.01 crore. Separate toilets for men and women have been built as part of the project, meeting a felt need. The ASI’s and other publications would be available at the publication counter. An approach pathway and lawn have also been developed in between the buildings, which have been designed in line with the heritage ambience of the temple. Built by King Rajendra Chola-I, the Gangaikondacholisvarar Temple is a major tourist attraction in this region. Following the conquest of the Gangetic plains in 1023 CE, Rajendra–I built the city of Gangaikondacholapauram, a Siva temple and a lake Chola Gangam in commemoration of his victory. The gigantic stone temple, which is a repository of beautiful sculptures, is now a UNESCO World Heritage Monument and is maintained by ASI. The facilities at the temple were inaugurated by T.

31 December 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Handloom products expo weaves tradition with market demand||True aficionados of handmade silk and cotton saris, linen, rugs and garments will always opt for handloom products despite their higher price, said representatives of weaving cooperatives attending a special exhibition-cum-sale in the city. Organised by the Union Ministry of Textiles and Department of Handlooms, the fortnight-long event was inaugurated by Collector S. Sivarasu at the IMA Hall on Wednesday in the presence of Assistant Director of Handlooms and Textiles T. Ravikumar and other officials. Weaver societies from Erode, Kanchipuram, Namakkal, Karur and Salem districts are among those participating in the exhibition, which is offering a 30% discount ahead of the New Year and Pongal festival season. The longevity and tradition associated with handloom weaving in Tamil Nadu has ensured a customer base, even though they are costlier than conventional powerloom products, stall handlers told The Hindu . “People who appreciate the effort and time spent on creating handloom silk saris seek us out for their significant purchases,” said Indira, of Arignar Anna Silk Co-op Society, a Kanchipuram-based brand with 1,234 weavers as members. It has branches in several cities in Tamil Nadu, including Tiruchi. “Even though synthetic replicas are available in the market, they may not last as long as a pure silk handloom sari,” Ms. Indira said.  At the Karur-based Velliyanai Handloom Weavers Cooperative Production and Sale Society stall, manager K. Raja said bed linen continued to be a best-seller due to steady patronage from Co-optex orders. “We are around 317 weavers, of whom 54 are working. Powerlooms don’t really need weavers, just machine operators. They can produce in 10 days, what we take a month to make. Handloom weaving can be sustained for the future only if young people join this traditional profession,” he said. Some weavers were apprehensive about the upcoming increase in GST from the current 5% to 12% in the new year. “We were managing to make ends meet in the present circumstances, despite the slowdown caused by the pandemic, but a higher GST may hit many of us,” said S. Mani, manager of T.H.42, Ernapuram Primary Handloom Weavers’ Cooperative from Chinnaunjakkadu, Salem district, that specialises in cloth jamukkalams .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/handloom-products-expo-weaves-tradition-with-market-demand/article38075697.ece

31 December 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Tiruppur South police station adjudged the best in Tamil Nadu||The State government has ranked Tiruppur South police station as the first among the three best performing police station in the State for 2020. According to a communication from the Office of the Director General of Police dated December 28, three police stations have been identified as the “Top 3 Best Police Stations in the State” with Tiruvannamalai Taluk police station under Tiruvannamalai District Police coming second and E-3 Anna Nagar police station under Madurai City Police ranking third. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin would present the Chief Minister’s Trophy to the respective station house officers during the Republic Day Celebrations in Chennai on January 26, the communication said. S. Aravind, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) of Tiruppur City Police, told The Hindu on Thursday that police stations were adjudged based on several parameters such as number of cases registered in total for the given period, total number of cases registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, preventive arrests made and execution of security bonds. The Tiruppur South police station fared well in all these, he said. “They handled the anti-CAA (Citizenship (Amendment) Act) protests well in particular,” he said, adding that the police personnel also handled the various demonstrations held at the District Collectorate on Palladam Road to maintain law and order in 2020. Commissioner of Police V. Vanitha, who visited the police station after taking charge in June, had recommended the application for the Chief Minister’s Trophy. A. Prakash was the Inspector of Tiruppur South police station during the given period and the present inspector P. Pitchaiah, under the supervision of Assistant Commissioner of Police (South Range) B. Varatharajan, brought several cases registered in 2020 to its “logical conclusion,” Mr. Aravind said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruppur-south-police-station-adjudged-the-best-in-tamil-nadu/article38075612.ece

31 December 2021||TIRUVANNAMALAI,TAMIL NADU||Probe into misappropriation of funds under MGNREGA scheme||The officials of the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) in Tiruvannamalai are probing into alleged misappropriation of funds under the Centrally-sponsored MGNREGA scheme to the tune of Rs. 31.21 lakh by government officials and elected representatives near Vandavasi. DVAC officials said that based on a complaint by Prabhakaran, a resident of Nambedu village in Vandavasi taluk, they have been examining the details of the work done from 2012 to 2020, salaries paid and beneficiaries under the scheme in Nambedu village. Officials have confirmed that Rs. 31,21,207 has been misappropriated from the government funds under the scheme by panchayat clerks and elected representatives in the village during the said years. “We got permission to collect relevant records, examine witnesses and proceed with the investigation process. Based on evidence, we will also bring in neighbouring villages under the probe,” Investigating Officer G. Mathiazhagan, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), DVAC (Tiruvannamalai Region), told The Hindu . The DVAC has filed a case against 11 persons, including former Nambedu village panchayat secretaries Sundaramoorthy, Raja Sekar, Narayanamoorthy, Prema and the incumbent panchayat secretary Santosh and former panchayat president Rosa Mani, current Chairman Asha, beneficiaries such as Saraswathi, Senthil, Deivanai and Ammu. The officials said that the suspects have misappropriated funds in various ways — fake identity cards were made in the name of 17 residents who had migrated from the village misappropriating Rs. 8.73 lakh and swindling another Rs. 11.72 lakh by enrolling 28 fake names. Further, as against the existing norms of providing employment for only one person in a family under the scheme, the suspects had enrolled seven couples with separate bank accounts swindling Rs. 3.25 lakh. Likewise, Rs. 3.91 lakh was misappropriated by handing over the identity cards of six beneficiaries to their relatives and claiming that they had worked for 200 days in violation of rules. The DVAC also found that former panchayat presidents Prabhakaran and Rajammal had misappropriated funds of Rs. 54,860 by claiming that they too worked under the scheme. The team also found that Rs. 2.95 lakh has been misappropriated for illegally issuing work identity cards to family members and working for 200 days in violation of the rules, the DVAC officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/probe-into-misappropriation-of-funds-under-mgnrega-scheme/article38075973.ece
31 December 2021||TIRUVANNAMALAI,TAMIL NADU||Tiruvannamalai Taluk station ranked second in T.N.||The Tiruvannamalai Taluk police station has been ranked the second best police station in the State for 2020 under the ‘Tamil Nadu Chief Minister’s Trophy for the best police station. This is the second successive year that one of the police stations in the district has been selected for the prestigious award. Tiruvannamalai town police station had bagged the award in 2019. The award was instituted in 2018 to encourage stations to be people-friendly and undertake environment-related measures in the police station. The Superintendent of Police (SP), Tiruvannamalai, A. Pavan Kumar Reddy, and Inspector of the Station, R. Hemamalini, will receive the trophy and certificates from Chief Minister M.K. Stalin during the Republic Day ceremony on January 26. "It is a proud moment for all police personnel in the district. The award will also encourage other police stations to achieve goals set for best police stations," D.V. Kiran Shruthi, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Tiruvannamalai, told The Hindu . 18 assessment areas Bifurcated from the British era town police station in 1973, the Tiruvannamalai Taluk station has been chosen for the award after it was assessed on 18 criteria, including computerisation of files and cases, crime detection, arrests in cases under POCSO Act, prevention of sale of prohibited items such as lottery tickets and drugs, conviction in cases, road safety, speedy disposal of cases, proper maintenance of records, cleanliness and friendliness towards citizens. Interestingly, the evaluation for the award, which was done in the rank of IGP, also includes negative marks if an official at the station had faced suspension or any disciplinary action. Located on the foothills of Annamalai Hills, the Taluk police station is the largest station in the district covering 9 km under its limits. Cleanliness of the station and quick issuing of charge sheets were key highlights, among others that helped the station bag the award. During the pandemic, especially in 2020, the station officer earmarked specific timing for each complainant to address their grievances every day. Such measures had not only saved time and ensured safety but also resolved the issue faster. Inspector B. Chandrasekaran and Sub-Inspector R. Sivasankar were noteworthy in bringing such changes in addressing the complainant's grievances. At present, Tiruvannamalai has 54 police stations, including 39 Law and Order stations with around 1,200 police personnel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruvannamalai-taluk-station-ranked-second-in-tn/article38075962.ece

31 December 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||Traffic changes on NH to decongest Green Circle||The Traffic Police in Vellore are gearing up to execute new traffic changes on the Bengaluru Highway (NH 48) with all vehicles including government buses from Chennai heading towards Katpadi on the highway having to proceed straight rather than taking the Green Circle route below the highway from January 1. The move aims at decongesting the Green Circle, a roundabout below the highway, that sees on an average 80-100 vehicles per minute, in the district. The Green Circle junction serves as a major intersection for vehicles proceeding towards Chennai, Tirupattur, Chittoor via Katpadi and to the heart of the Fort City, off the national highway. Traffic snarls are a common sight at the junction during peak hours as vehicles take a long time to cross the roundabout. “Sign boards and reflectors highlighting new traffic changes will be erected on the highway to alert motorists from Chennai. Practical difficulties will be sorted out once the new traffic changes come into effect from January 1,” Albert John, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Vellore, told The Hindu . As per new changes, vehicles coming from Chennai have to proceed straight on the highway taking the service lane near a petrol pump. Motorists have to take a 'U' turn below the road over bridge (ROB) on the service lane to reach Katpadi. On the other hand, vehicles from Chennai that have to go to Vellore's Old Town including the Fort complex can use the existing traffic arrangement where they take the service lane near the Green Circle to reach the Fort area. At present, all vehicles from Chennai are allowed to take the service lane near the Green Circle to reach Vellore's Old Town and Katpadi resulting in traffic chaos at the Circle. On an average, it takes 30 minutes to cross the roundabout from the service lane during rush hour. Another measure to decongest the Green Circle is to reduce its size as it will help to widen the carriage space around Green Circle up to 12 metres. This was decided by Vellore Collector P. Kumaravel Pandian, and S. Rajesh Kannan, SP (Vellore), when they inspected the spot on December 13 as part of efforts to ease traffic snarls. Subsequently, illegal parking and encroachments, mainly roadside eateries, were removed. Bus bays for vehicles from Chennai, were also craeted near the Green Circle to ensure safety of commuters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/traffic-changes-on-nh-to-decongest-green-circle/article38075971.ece

This is the case with farmers who attend the monthly grievances redress meetings held for them. But the problems faced by the the differently abled are definitely more complex. Considering their plight, the Virudhunagar district administration has come up with the plan of holding monthly grievance redress meetings exclusively for them. The first meeting will be held on January 7. “I feel we are not able to give enough attention to the grievances of differently abled persons when they come to the petition hall on Mondays as it is crowded,” Collector J. Meghanath Reddy told The Hindu on Thursday. The government has various schemes to help them, but often their voices are missed in the crowd. “I got the inspiration from a differently abled girl, who came for an interview. I learnt about her daily ordeals and now we have come up with special toilets to cater to their specific needs,” Mr. Meghanath said. Officials themselves can learn more about the problems faced by the differently abled when their grievances are heard with more patience and, hence, the new initiative, the Collector said. “Even if a hearing aid or a wheelchair is given, it will make a huge impact on their lives,” he added. Officials from the Department of Social Welfare, Department of Differently Abled Welfare and Department of Health will be present at the meeting planned at the new conference hall on the ground floor at the Collectorate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/special-grievance-redress-meet-for-differently-abled/article38075707.ece

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Sudden downpour batters Chennai||The sky will be cloudy, there may be thunderstorm, with light to moderate rain, in some areas. Though rain was forecast, no one expected so much, say weather bloggers. Deputy Director-General of Meteorology S. Balachandran said, “The interaction of the easterly winds at the lower level and the westerly winds at the upper level has brought rain to the city. We had given a forecast of rain. The rain will continue till January 3.” Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, said the unexpected fast movement of the easterly trough over the Chennai coast gave the city the heavy rain. This is a highly localised event, and it is very difficult to predict such short spells of this intensity.” Expressing surprise over the quantum of rain, weather blogger Pradeep John said, “We can call this a cloudburst. The rain rate was amazing. We received close to 10 cm in an hour,” he said. Another weather blogger K. Srikanth said, “There have been such episodes in the past too. In November, we saw the city receiving 20 cm. Similarly, a few years ago, Taramani got 10 cm. At least we had a few weather models in November that did predict such heavy spells, but this time no one saw it coming,” he said. IMD’s prediction The India Meteorological Department predicted thunderstorm with heavy rain for Friday at isolated places in Cuddalore, Villupuram and Mayiladuthurai districts, Puducherry and Karaikal, and thunderstorm with moderate rain at many places in the the rest of Tamil Nadu’s coastal districts and a few places in the interior districts. The city received more rain this entire year than what it got in 2015, and this is the third wettest year after 2005 and 1996, weather bloggers say. Mr. Pradeep John wrote on Twitter that while the city received 209 cm in 2015, it crossed this figure on Thursday. Mr. Srikanth said that 2021 was quite a different year, compared with 2005, 1996 or 2015. “This year, there were a few episodes of sharp intense short spells which made a huge difference, unlike the previous years. We have to know that the city had an excess rainfall in the first half and the last half,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sudden-downpour-batters-chennai/article38075562.ece

31 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Pandemic pushed up online purchase||Getting out as a family for shopping, dining or watching a movie, especially during festive seasons and weekends, has been the core of Bengaluru’s behaviour. All such set customer behaviour and buying patterns have drastically changed after the pandemic disrupted everything that hitherto seemed ‘normal’. In its stead we have a whole new paradigm around how we shop, pay bills, consume entertainment or access healthcare. Citing a study done by his firm, Harish Bijoor, CEO, Harish Bijoor Consults, said the pandemic fast-tracked digital buys like never ever before. As a result, 77% of Bengalureans shop online today which was around 20% in pre-pandemic days, he claimed. “The depth of involvement with e-buying deepened dramatically over the last two years. Those who were just e-browsers became active e-buyers in this period. Also, trust norms in e-buys have deepened giving customers more confidence to shop online,” Mr. Bijoor commented. E-buys, which were hitherto restricted to electronics, mobiles and garments now covered every vertical right up to essentials including vegetables, fruits and dairy. Consumers also saw e-buying as an effective way to implement social distancing and follow other safety measures such as not stepping out unnecessarily, observed Vaitheeswaran Kothandaraman, a city resident and a pioneer in Indian e-commerce. Firms, like his own Again Drinks, a beverage company, are getting strategising differently to suit this changed pattern. Social distancing Panchumarthi Lakshmi Bheemesh, a mechanical engineer-turned-entrepreneur in the city, concurred that it was essentially the need for social distancing that changed the buying behaviour of people. “My family is now fully adjusted to digitalisation for shopping, banking, calling in food and for various other things,'' added Mr. Bheemesh. Anjan Jayasimha, a content creator at a city firm, noted that digital platforms are also offering comfortable price points that offline can’t often match up to it. On the other hand, there is also a constant fear of getting infected by the virus or of losing jobs. “So, both health and financial aspects have to be protected,” he said. He noted that people are reluctant to buy new stuff or experiment with new things like they used to in the past. A significant section of people now buy only what they consider “urgent”. For many families, this change has led to a huge cut in buying of even up to 50%, according to Annie Minerva, a writer and film director. It has also changed what we spend on. Many are investing in health monitor equipment or shifting to organic foods, fruits and vegetables to boost immunity, says city-based communications professional Vinay Muniswamy. “Earlier, during every Amazon and Flipkart sales, I was very keen on upgrading my tech gadgets. However, the pandemic has made me rethink my spending and buying habits. I restrict most of my buying to essentials and health products today,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pandemic-pushed-up-online-purchase/article38075508.ece
31 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Online classes to stop post vaccination||A few Central board schools, who are still relying on online classes to teach students, have decided to suspend remote learning once their students are vaccinated. The schools are planning a vaccination drive in the first week of January for students of classes X, XI and XII. While most schools started offline classes in a phased manner since August 23, many schools did not make the shift as they were worried that their schools could become COVID-19 clusters as children were not vaccinated. Mansoor Ali Khan, member, Board of Management, Delhi Public Group of Schools, said they would try to complete both doses of vaccination for students above 15 years by February. “All these days, we were reluctant to stop our online classes despite having offline classes as well as we were worried about our students’ health. But after the students are vaccinated, we will stop online classes and will channelise all our teaching resources to offline classes,” he said. He added that offline classes would be more effective in bridging the learning gap among students. Parents’ consent D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka said that after students are vaccinated, parents need to ensure that they give consent to students attending classes. “In a few schools, parents are still reluctant and do not want to send their children for offline classes with the increase in number of Omicron cases. But once students are vaccinated, parents need to cooperate and ensure that their children attend offline classes,” he said. An official of the Department of Primary and Secondary Education said that schools are supposed to conduct both offline and online classes at the moment. “However, once students are vaccinated, we will review the need to conduct both types of classes,” the official added. Parents too feel that they would be reassured to send their children to school after they are jabbed. Surekha R., the parent of a class ten student said, “A few parents are not convinced of vaccinating their children. But we will urge the management to ensure that they start offline classes and that bridge courses are conducted so that students pick up their lost skills,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/online-classes-to-stop-post-vaccination/article38075516.ece

31 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||D. S. Nagabhushan bags Kendra Sahitya Akademi award for Gandhi Kathana||Literary critic D.S. Nagabhushan has been awarded the Kendra Sahitya Akademi award for 2021 for his work Gandhi Kathana , biography of Mahatma Gandhi. While Basu Bevinagidad has won the Bal Sahitya Puraskar for his children’s novel Odi Hoda Huduga , H. Lakshmi Narayan Swamy has been awarded the Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puraskar for his poetry Togala Cheelada Karna . The awards were announced on Thursday.  Gandhi Kathana has already seen over 20 editions and has been one of the successful books in recent years. “I started writing the book to introduce Gandhi to children, but failed. But I took up writing a biography, as I felt Gandhi is what we need for the times. As a socialist, I also have a different perspective to see Gandhi. The success of the book and the award has shown Gandhi is alive and kicking, we only need to find him,” he told The Hindu. Mr. Nagabhushan also edits and brings out a literary magazine Hosa Manushya . Mr. Lakshmi Narayan Swamy hails from Bengaluru and teaches Kannada at the PG centre, Ramanagaram, of Bangalore University. His Togala Cheelada Karna tries to reinterpret Mahabharata for the contemporary age through the character of Karna. “I have been trying to experiment with poetry, writing khanda kavya and mahakavya. The award comes as a great encouragement for me to experiment more,” he said. “There has been a lot of work done in poetry for children, but not much in prose. I have been trying to write novels for children in the social realism style, and with no elements of fantasy. The award comes as a recognition of that,” Mr. Basu Bevinagidad said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/d-s-nagabhushan-bags-kendra-sahitya-akademi-award/article38075502.ece
31 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Dairy Science College promotes earn-while-you-learn concept||While educational institutions boast of placements, Bengaluru-based Dairy Science College has gone a step further to ensure that its final-year B.Tech students start earning while they are learning. The college, which is Karnataka’s oldest dairy sciences institute, has made its final-year students take up production as well as sale of milk-based value-added products by using its technologies as part of training under the Rural Entrepreneurship Awareness Development Yojana (READY) of the Centre. What comes in handy is modern technologies developed by the college for hygienic and scientific production products like organic ghee, greek yogurt, lassi, paneer, kulfi, shrikhand, and cold-pressed coconut oil. Production and sale process are carried out by students as their own enterprise under their brand ‘Utkrushta’ to ensure that they pick up entrepreneurship skills. “We started the earn-while-learn programme under the New Education Policy in November. By December 6, they had earned a profit of over Rs. 1.25 lakh with the help of seed money of Rs. 25,000 given by the college,” said Dr. Mahesh Kumar G., their mentor and co-ordinator of READY. “The top-seller has been organic ghee, which is priced at Rs. 250 a kg. The students managed to sell about 1,000 kg in less than a month, and demand for the product is rapidly increasing,” he says. Dr. Mahesh, who is also Head of Dairy Engineering Division, noted that the idea of making students take up production and sale of these products is not just to get them to earn some money, but to train them as thorough entrepreneurs so that they could set up their own businesses as soon as they step out of college. The production process is very systematic, as it is divided into seven separate tasks ranging from procurement of raw materials, quality assurance, cleaning as well as sanitisation of plants and machinery, to marketing and sales. Each group will have to take turns to do all the tasks so that they get experience in all the aspects, including packaging, he explains. Dr. Mahesh said students’ enterprise is also a means to demonstrate the college’s technologies that can help dairy farmers increase their income. The college also planning to take up training of rural entrepreneurs on utilisation of these technologies. Prof. A. Sachindra Babu, Dean of Dairy Sciences, said farmers can adopt the technologies developed by the college by forming an FPO (Farmers’ Producers’ Organisation) so that they could take up production and marketing of products in a collective manner. Pointing out that it is dairying that has provided succour to small and marginal farmers in times of agrarian crisis, he stresses the need for strengthening the sector by making it more remunerative through diversification. Incubation in technology  The college has launched incubation facility to hand-hold budding entrepreneurs in dairy industry to take up mechanised and scientific production of value-added milk-based products, including ghee. Dr. Mahesh said those under incubation would be provided training right from production to packaging, brand building and marketing. Similarly, those with any concept and proposal regarding dairy technologies could also contact the college for technical help.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dairy-science-college-promotes-earn-while-you-learn-concept/article38075536.ece
31 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Govt. to rank districts based on performance of ZPs||Urging the chief executive officers of zilla panchayats to be in constant touch with people, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday said the State Government will introduce a ranking system of districts based on the performance of ZPs and their CEOs. “It is important for the ZPs to perform well if the Government has to become pro-people. You can create your own ways of working in the districts. The Government will fully support those decisions of officials that help the poor,” Mr. Bommai said at a conference of zilla panchayat CEOs here. Officials have to take a clear stand and vacillating is like plague. Delay in decision making will affect people,” he added. Urging the CEOs to keep lower officials under proper check, Mr. Bommai asked them to review the performance of project implementation periodically. He also said that the CEOs should control the engineering division well, and the Government will not hesitate to take action if the engineers commit mistakes. Major development works in rural areas, including Jal Jeevan mission, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojane, and national rural employment guarantee scheme were reviewed. “Projects related to alleviation of poverty of those living below poverty line, vaccination, COVID-19 management, status of SC/ST hostels and government schools were discussed and instructions issued,” Mr. Bommai told reporters after the meeting. “For the first time, the meeting with ZP CEOs that was normally held with Deputy Commissioners has been held separately. We wanted to discuss development and administrative issues separately, and want to bring comprehensive changes in rural development and panchayat raj. The meeting with DCs will be held on Friday.” The Chief Minister said the timing of the meetings was important since it would enable the Government to work towards the financial year target while receiving inputs from the ground to prepare new programmes. “We have asked ZPs to replicate good practises implemented in some districts and CEOs have been asked to travel in the district.” Meanwhile, a note from Water Resources Minister Govind Karjol’s office said the Minister also cited an instance at Halagali village in Mudhol taluk of Bagalkot where consumption of water decreased after installation of meters that also led to an income of Rs. 10 lakh to the panchayat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-to-rank-districts-based-on-performance-of-zps/article38075544.ece
31 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Students told to bring COVID-19 negative certificates after break||School and college managements have asked students to produce negative RT-PCR certificates when they return to offline classes after their Christmas break. While some managements have made this an advisory, others have made this mandatory with the rise in the number of Omicron cases in the State. School management members said this was also because many students and their families have travelled and gone to different parts of the country for vacation. Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of management, Delhi Public Group of Schools, said they have issued an advisory that all students could bring negative RT-PCR certificates keeping the interest of all students in mind. “While we have started offline classes for classes IX to XII, we will start class VI upwards from January 3,” he said. Another private PU college management member said they were forced to do this after many COVID-19 clusters were detected in the State. “We want to take all precautionary measures when students are on the school campus. Most parents have agreed to this and said that they will ensure that their children get a test two days before school reopens,” he said. Susheela S., the parent of a class VIII student, said, “Initially we were reluctant and did not want our child to undergo a COVID test. But later, we thought that in the larger interest of the community, it would be best if we get our son tested.” However, many schools who had not given students a vacation as they were lagging behind in their academics. Sumanth Narayan, founder of Shanthinikethana School, said that they had decided not to give holidays because they did not want the children to travel and also felt that academics could be disrupted later in 2022 because of a possible third wave and Omicron cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/students-told-to-bring-covid-19-negative-certificates-after-break/article38075518.ece
31 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||New Year’s Eve bash: Many people prefer house parties||As yet another pandemic-hit year comes to an end, on the throes of threats of a third wave of COVID-19 infections, Bengalureans are preparing to celebrate New Year’s Eve in the new way they have learnt to from the previous year – amidst fear and restrictions. With the night curfew in place, house parties, or quick trips to farm houses and resorts on the outskirts of the city or neighbouring districts and States have become the way to usher in the new year. A final year PG student, Harshita, said there was no use heading to popular destinations in the city due to the night curfew, which would require them to go there and return early. “The only option is a home party,” she said. ‘Costly, but better’ With hotels, pubs and restaurants advancing their closing time to suit the night curfew, professional DJs who usually work in different pubs and clubs, have been booked for private parties as there is no restriction on them. Karthik Subbiah, an engineer, said earlier, they had plans to celebrate the new year in the city, but after the night curfew and other restrictions kicked in, they decided to shift their celebrations to Puducherry. “In this season, it may be costly, but it is a better option,” he said. Ranjit. K, owner of R.K. Travels, said they have got more bookings for day tours this time, though charges are higher due to the measures they need to take for their cabs to maintain hygiene. Resorts in the city are also recording higher bookings. The spokesperson of a resort in Whitefield said they had reduced the number of bookings to 50%, but they were fully booked for New Year’s Eve. Puja Gowda, a private firm employee, said she would usually head out of the city, but amidst the increasing number of cases, they are heading for a one-night stay on the outskirts of Bengaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-years-eve-bash-many-people-prefer-house-parties/article38075510.ece

31 December 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||Health risks plague municipal workers in Hassan||A series of deaths of municipal workers within a short span of time has left the community in Hassan in grief. Within one week, two municipal workers, both below 40 years, died of health complications. In the last two months, four people have died due to similar reasons. Puttaraju, 35, working for Alur Town Panchayat, died on December 24 after a prolonged illness. He is survived by wife Kavita and three daughters. His parents Anjaneya, Rajamma, and brother Sathish Kumar - all municipal workers - died due to health issues in the past. None of them continued in service till the age of retirement. Ramachandra, 34, died on December 21 in Hassan. He was diabetic and had other health problems. For several months, his wife Jyothi swept the streets of the city on his behalf as he could not work. Untimely deaths are not new to this family. Ramachandra had got his job on compensatory grounds after his mother Manjula died at the age of 50 because of ill health. And, Manjula got the job following her husband’s death. Ramachandra’s brother Raghavendra, who was also working as a municipal worker on contract basis, died of health issues three years ago. “I am alone now. I don’t know what to do,” said Jyothi in tears. The couple has no children. Jyothi has to now apply for a compensatory job, but is not sure of getting it as two members of the family got jobs on similar grounds. Mutturaj, 45, also a municipal worker, died on November 12 due to health issues. He is survived by three children. His wife Manjula, also a municipal worker, died when she was about 35 years. Another worker Nagaraj died two months ago. “We hardly complete our service and enjoy retired life. You will find portraits of young men garlanded in almost every house in our locality,” said Lokesh, president of Hassan City Municipal Workers’ Association. Like many workers, Lokesh got the job on compensatory grounds after his father died, before reaching retirement age. “We handle dirt every day to keep the city clean. Almost 90% of the workers die before retirement. Yet, the municipal bodies hardly take care of us. The money meant for our check-up is hardly spent,” he alleged. The officers visit the family of the dead and express condolences. “They garland the dead and leave the place. If the deceased person is a permanent employee, his family gets monetary benefits. But, families of contract workers are driven to the streets,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/health-risks-plague-municipal-workers-in-hassan/article38075539.ece

31 December 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||AIMSS calls upon govt. to provide opportunities to women||Emphasising the need for guaranteeing education, employment, healthcare, and social security to women, State president of All-India Mahila Samskruthika Sanghatane (AIMSS) Aparna B.R. has said that this would guarantee opportunities which would facilitate the growth of women. Delivering the keynote address at the third district convention of AIMSS in Dharwad on Thursday, she said that women had already proved their mettle in various sectors by utilising whatever opportunities were provided to them. It was the Government’s responsibility to guarantee education, job, health and social security to the women so that they could come to the mainstream, she said. Mr. Aparna said that successive governments which often spoke about women empowerment, had failed to deliver them justice by providing requisite opportunities. “Apart from fighting against the social maladies, customs and age-old practices, women also had to fight for survival amid the established setups of capitalists,” she said. Emphasising the need for women to unite to fight for their rights and equal opportunities, she said it was the sole solution to get justice. District secretary of Socialist Unity Centre of India, Communist (SUCI-C), Ramanjanappa Aldalli said that while the Government was focussing on religious conversions and talking about increasing age of marriage for women, little importance was being given to addressing the problems like malnutrition, hunger, price rise, unemployment, harassment, domestic violence against women, and others. Mr. Ramanjanappa said that by increasing the age of marriage through law, social reforms couldnot be initiated as in the male dominated society, women were yet to get equal opportunities and majority were being snatched away by men. The governments would make people indulge in discussion over emotional and religious issues in order to prevent the public from asking questions from the Government, he said. Concurring with Ms. Aparna, he said women to need to wake up and launch united fight against the injustice. “Then only the Government will start noticing the real issues. And they will act only when we mount pressure on them”, he said. State vice-president of AIMSS Manjula M.N. spoke on the problems being faced by women and next course of action. A new district committee comprising 40 members was formed on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/aimss-urges-govt-to-give-opportunities-to-women/article38075520.ece
31 December 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Plan for new Janata Bazaar will be revised: Shettar||Jagadish Shettar, former Chief Minister and MLA, has said that in another week a revised plan will be chalked out for the new Janata Bazaar (market) being taken up under the Smart City scheme in Hubballi. Chairing a meeting of Hubballi Dharwad Smart City Limited (HDSCL), Hubballi Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) officials, and stakeholders, including the merchants, here on Thursday, Mr. Shettar said that the plan would be revised to suit the needs of the merchants and the consumers. Mr. Shettar’s assurance came after merchants pointed out that in the plan for the bazaar, the sizes of the grocery shops had been reduced from 192 sqft to just 80 sqft and that it would cause inconvenience to them. In Block No. 4 of Old Janata Bazaar, which has been demolished now, there were 20 grocery shops of 192 sqft, the merchants had pointed out. Responding to their plea, he said that the merchants had cooperated with the Government in facilitating construction of the new building and they should be provided with adequate space equivalent to what space they were provided earlier. Moreover grocery shops should be on the ground floor, which would be convenient even for the consumers, he said. Mr. Shettar directed the officials to prepare the revised plan of the market in consultation with the merchants and provide requisite space even for street vendors at the new market. Responding to the demands and suggestions of the shopkeepers, Managing Director of HDSCL Shakeel Ahmed said that all those shopkeepers and vendors who operated at the old market would be given adequate space in the new bazaar. “There is a suggestion to construct a ramp to the first floor, which will be incorporated in the revised plan,” he said. Before holding the review meeting, Mr. Shettar accompanied by officials visited the work site of the sante maidan (weekly market ground) at Bengeri. The project taken up under under Smart City scheme is almost complete. Mr. Shettar told presspersons that the hi-tech market had been constructed at a total cost of Rs. 6.7 crore and would be dedicated soon. The new market would reduce the traffic congestion caused during weekly bazaar at Bengeri on Saturdays, he said.

31 December 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||SC judge: Legal awareness prevents people from suffering injustice||Awareness of law prevents docket exclusion which is the outcome of peoples’ reluctance to approach either the police or the courts and suffer injustice, said Supreme Court judge S. Abdul Nazeer here on Thursday. Speaking at the district legal awareness programme, Mr. Nazeer said docket exclusion and docket explosion, which results due to pendency of cases, are the two prime issues of concern for the judiciary. For the 135 crore population of the country, there are less number of courts and hence litigants are not getting timely justice. Docket exclusion where people bear with injustice was not for the society. The Supreme Court judge said Legal services authority is addressing docket explosion and docket exclusion. While holding lok adalats to settle disputes, the authority has been holding events to make people aware of laws. Karnataka High Court Judge B. Veerappa said the State Legal Services Authority has conducted 1,335 legal awareness programmes this year that covered 29,736 villages. As much as 3.37 lakh cases were settled in Lok Adalats held in different courts and this had saved sizable amount of litigation expenses for the State Government. While calling upon anganwadi and ASHA workers to involve in legal awareness activities, Mr. Veerappa asked educational institutions, including Alvas Group of Institutions, to open legal service clinics in their premises. So far 139 institutions have opened legal service clinics, he added. High Court Registrar General T.G. Shivashankare Gowda said State and District Legal Services Authorities are making efforts to reach out to common man through legal awareness programmes High Court Judge K. Somashekar, Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra, Principal District and Sessions Judge B.

31 December 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Waste dumping sites to become ‘useful’ areas||The Mysuru City Corporation has come up with a novel plan of turning garbage dumping sites across the city into ‘functional’ areas with the primary aim of stopping indiscriminate dumping of solid wastes that marred the city’s beauty and hygiene standards. So far, the MCC has identified over 70 garbage dumping sites across 65 wards here which will emerge as useful areas for the local population besides sending out a strong message to the community on the issue. Each ward has around 7 to 8 such sites and the MCC has proposed to spend about Rs. 2.5 crore on the project with each ward getting a grant of about Rs. 30 lakh. MCC Commissioner Lakshmikanth Reddy told The Hindu that the project has two objectives – one is to permanently stop dumping and another is to make use of the dumping space using recycled materials like recycled building and plastic wastes. It could be either for laying pavement tiles, installation of benches using recycled materials and so on to help the place look clean and hygienic. This also prevents further dumping of waste at the same place. To set an example, the MCC made use of the building debris dumped on the ring road to construct a compound wall for one of its zero waste management sites. “Besides saving costs for us, it helped us to show that construction waste can be reused, reducing waste of materials. Meanwhile, the proposal of setting up a construction and demolition waste recycling plant will be placed for the MCC council meeting for final approval on January 6. The MCC has proposed to take up the project on a PPP model and a plot measuring 7 acres has been set aside off Outer Ring Road close to Mysore-Nanjangud Highway. Mr. Reddy said the MCC is still working on the mode of its operation and the council is expected to take a call on the role of MCC in the project. “We are yet to finalise whether the public has to dump the waste at the plant or whether the job has to be carried out by the MCC. Whoever operates the plant will charge on the basis of tonnage. Whoever quotes the lowest price per tonne of debris would get priority. However, the modalities are still being worked out.” Delay The project is getting delayed for various reasons. The MCC council had given its approval for establishing the construction and demolition waste recycling plant in the city exactly a year ago. The council had agreed to give the contract for a period of five years. The MCC had identified the agency for implementing the works, but the council members objected to it on the grounds that tenders were not invited for other agencies to bid for the works. The members also sought clarity on the revenue sharing model.  The plant was proposed on a PPP model with no financial implications for the Corporation. The MCC had proposed the plant for handling at least 100 tonnes per day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dumping-sites-to-useful-areas/article38075522.ece
31 December 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||S.R. Mahesh’s brother considering plan to join Cong.||Former Minister and JD(S) leader S.R. Mahesh’s brother S.R. Nandeesh has revealed that he has resigned from the JD(S) and is considering options to join the Congress party. Mr. Nandeesh, who served as a member of Zilla Panchayat from Mirle constituency in K.R. Nagar taluk, said he had submitted his resignation more than three months ago. Though he has received an invitation from the Congress, he said he is yet to formally join the party. Mr. Nandeesh accused his elder brother and JD(S) MLA representing K.R. Nagar Assembly constituency of sidelining him to promote his own son in politics. Mr. Nandeesh claimed that his brother resented his participation in public events alongside him and he had taken it in his stride, thinking that his brother was wary of drawing public criticism for promoting family members in politics. But, after Mr. Mahesh issued a statement recently that he will be deputing his son Jayant to attend private functions on his behalf whenever he is busy, Mr. Nandeesh said it became clear that his brother was clearing the path for his son’s anointment as successor in politics. Though Mr. Mahesh has claimed that his son does not have political ambitions, Mr. Nandeesh said he foresees his brother’s son entering active politics despite the claims to the contrary by his brother. Mr. Nandeesh claimed that he had stood by his brother in politics and expressed ‘hurt’ over the failure of his brother to reciprocate his gestures and support. Mr. Nandeesh also revealed that an MLA from the Congress in Mysuru region had invited him to join the party and had assured him that the party would offer him a chance to contest from any Zilla Panchayat constituency of his choice in the next elections. “I have quit JD (S) and I am still considering whether I should join the Congress”, he said before adding that talks with the Congress leaders were continuing. Mr. Nandeesh said he was in politics for the last 25 to 30 years and vowed to continue in politics notwithstanding the efforts of his brother to sideline him. But, ruled out the possibility of returning to JD(S).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sr-maheshs-brother-planning-to-join-cong/article38075523.ece
31 December 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Farmers seek CBI probe into ghee adulteration racket||Farmers belonging to Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene on Thursday demanded a CBI inquiry into the Nandini ghee adulteration racket that was busted here recently. They also opposed the curbs imposed on the sale of raw milk through the milk cooperatives in villages. The protest led by Badagalapura Nagendra presented a memorandum at the office of Deputy Commissioner in this reagard to unravel the truth behind the racket and bring all guilty to book. The racket could have a wider network as the milk producers feel the adulteration may not be confined to Mysuru. They urged the State government to seek a CBI probe so that such cases do not recur in the milk unions. The farmers also took exception to the restrictions imposed on the sale of raw milk by the milk producers in villages through the milk cooperatives locally. The ban will have an impact on the milk producers, they argued. Four persons have been arrested so far in the adulteratopn case. A total of 10 tonnes of ghee, including adulterants like vegetable cooking oil, flavouring and coloring agents, besides original Nandini brand ghee was recovered from the godown in Hosahundi, which was raided on December 16 by activists of a human rights organisation before the police took up the case and the officials of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) seized the materials and sent them to the laboratory.

31 December 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Concern over dumping of waste on ORR||The issue of indiscriminate dumping of construction and solid waste along the Outer Ring Road came up for a discussion at the meeting chaired by Pratap Simha, MP, here on Wednesday for reviewing the progress of works in the city. Some of the ORR stretches come under the newly-formed local bodies – town panchayat and the city municipal councils. Bogadi, Srirampura and Rammanahalli were elevated to Town Panchayats while Hootagalli was elevated to city municipal council comprising the areas that are already part of the city. Especially towards the Hinkal flyover, heaps of trash were found dumped along the Ring Road, posing a serious health hazard. The waste dumped has not been cleared since months. Meat waste too is dumped along the isolated stretches of the road. As a one-time cleaning drive that lasted for several days, the entire ORR stretch was freed from debris and solid waste. However, the public started dumping waste yet again undeterred over the warnings of filing cases against doing so on the ORR stretch. Until the newly-formed local bodies get funds and powers, the areas that are neither part of the MCC nor the MUDA, and also those which are very much part of MUDA will continue to face this problem with no proper waste disposal system in those areas. The issue needs immediate attention as the city will lose its reputation as a clean city considering the way debris and other waste is being handled on the outskirts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/concern-over-dumping-of-waste-on-orr/article38075946.ece

Chandrashekar on Thursday expressed concern over the silence maintained by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah over the statements. Speaking to reporters in Mysuru, Prof Chandrashekar said the call for genocide was a “dangerous trend, which would shake the foundations of the country” and maintained that the silence of the Prime Minister and Home Minister was “anti-constitutional”. He also wondered if their silence was “tactical and intentional”. Contending that the statements made at the “Dharma Sansad” were not only “most objectionable”, but also “seditious”, he feared that such calls may have a cascading effect and put the country in the throes of lawlessness. Though a FIR had been registered under IPC by the local police, he wondered why the case was not registered under UAPA Act. However, a letter has been written to the Chief Justice of India by about 80 advocates, who had shared their concern over the silence of the executive to the hate speeches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bkc-expresses-concern-over-hate-speeches/article38075947.ece

As Omicron is highly contagious, home isolation should be the last option and can be permitted only for those who have facilities and “caregivers” as assessed by the triaging team. All home isolated patients should be strictly tele-monitored,” sources said quoting the TAC report. “We have recommended that walk-ins should not be allowed in hospitals and all patients should be mandatorily triaged by the BBMP. International travellers, who test positive at the airport, should be shifted to the designated Omicron facility at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital and identified private hospitals of their choice,” sources said. K.V. Trilok Chandra, BBMP Special Commissioner (Health) said BBMP was planning to set up one CCC in every assembly constituency. “We have a system of physical triaging and tele-triaging in place and have stepped up surveillance measures. We also have mobile triaging teams in every ward,” he said. C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force said the rise in numbers is a clear indication that the third wave is beginning in the State. “Aggressive contact tracing, maintaining the current testing levels of one lakh and above and strict enforcement of COVID preventive measures and protocols in all residential schools, hostels, apartments, malls and other places of crowding should be done,” he asserted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tac-asks-bbmp-to-gear-up-for-third-wave/article38075514.ece
31 December 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||For paddy farmers in State, it has been a year to forget||Vipin Babu, a young paddy farmer from Champakulam in Kuttanad, has just completed sowing for the puncha (first crop) season. He was more than a month behind schedule in sowing seeds and now faces the risk of summer rain affecting the harvest in April-May. The delay, he says, is the continuation of problems faced in the recently concluded second (additional) crop season. “I should have opted against growing paddy in the puncha season after suffering huge losses in the second crop season. The harvest of the second crop was delayed by around a month due to heavy downpours and floods that lashed the region in October-November. Though the crop was harvested by November-end, the yield was poor. The delay further affected the preparation of fields for the puncha season. Still, I took the risk and decided to cultivate paddy to recoup some of the losses. This is the only job I know,” says Mr. Babu. Multiple impediments The year 2021 has not been kind to paddy farmers in Kuttanad, Upper Kuttanad and other rice-growing regions of the State. From the farming calendar going for a toss due to a change in rainfall patterns, floods, soaring fertiliser prices to seeds failing to germinate, farmers say they would like to forget the past 12 months. According to the Agriculture department, paddy cultivation in 42,464 hectares and paddy nursery in 4,518.84 hectares were destroyed largely due to natural calamities in the State in 2021. The loss was estimated at Rs. 60 crore. Among the districts, Alappuzha suffered the worst, with paddy crop in 13,744 hectares destroyed during the period. It was followed by Thrissur where crops in 9,202 hectares was destroyed. Ecosystem services P. Indiradevi, professor and director of research (retired), Kerala Agricultural University, says paddy land should not be viewed as a mere production system as it delivers several ecosystem services such as groundwater recharge, flood control and so on. “Climate change will continue to wreak havoc and impact agriculture. Farmers may not continue farming suffering losses. The important thing is to provide proper compensation to farmers based on realistic estimation of damage. If farmers are compensated, they won’t abandon rice cultivation, and fields will remain intact,” says Ms. Indiradevi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/for-paddy-farmers-in-state-its-been-a-year-to-forget/article38075886.ece

However, it was his personal preference whether to attend the meeting or not, he said. Mr. Jayachandran said it was only media speculation that he was expelled from the party. If he moved out on his own will, the party cannot help it. The CPI(M) has various forums and he could submit his complaints there. He raised his complaints only through the media. The party would not deliberately expel anyone, Mr. Jayachandran said. The CPI(M) Idukki district committee had recommended action against Mr. Rajendran, including suspension from the party. A two-member panel had found serious lapses on the part of Mr. Rajendran during the election campaigns of party candidate in the Devikulam constituency. However, Mr. Rajendran said he had decided to stop all relations with the CPI(M). The party had insulted and expelled him, he said on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/rajendran-not-expelled-says-cpim/article38075896.ece
31 December 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Master plan soon for Karapuzha tourism project: Minister||A master plan will be drafted for the comprehensive development of the Karapuzha, an emerging tourism destination in Wayanad district, Water Resources Minister Roshy Augustine has said. Speaking to mediapersons here on Wednesday after attending a review meeting to assess the progress of various projects of the Water Resources department in the district, Mr. Augustine said that the government was planning to develop irrigation tourism projects at dam sites under the department and the Karapuzha dam had been identified as the most suitable destination for the purpose. “Beautification works on the space between the existing park at the destination and the dam will be completed soon”, Mr. Agustine said, adding that funds for the purpose would be met from the Wayanad package, plan fund of the department, and other sources. The remaining renovation works of the spillway and the dam should be more attractive to tap the tourism potential of the destination, the Minister said. The total length of the irrigation canals under the project is 129 km and renovation works of the 25-km stretch of the irrigation canals have been completed. The renovation works of the 22-km of the irrigation canal were under way, Mr. Augustine said. Steps would be expedited to acquire land in the catchment area for increasing the water storage capacity of the reservoir and extend the distributary irrigation canals, for which the works of the Water Resources and Revenue departments would be coordinated at the district level, Mr. Augustine said. A sum of Rs. 6 crore had been earmarked in the State budget for the purpose, Mr. Augustine said. The Minister directed the senior officials to avoid unnecessary delays in executing projects. If a contractor failed to launch work on time, the tender proceedings should be cancelled and steps adopted to complete the works on time, Mr. Augustine said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/master-plan-soon-for-karapuzha-tourism-project-minister/article38075822.ece
31 December 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Tender areca nut prices touch all-time high||The price of tender areca nut has reached an all-time high, due to a sharp decline in production caused by various diseases affecting areca nut palms. The spot price of the tender areca nut touched a record Rs. 183 a kg at the Meenangadi market in Wayanad on Wednesday, as against Rs. 133 a kg during the corresponding period last year. The scanty arrival of the commodity owing to a sharp decline in yield and the huge demand for the produce in the market, especially in Karnataka, was the major reason for the sudden spurt in the price of the crop, market sources said. If the gap between demand and supply widened in the coming months, the price may increase further, sources said. The areca nut harvest usually begins by the first week of November and continues till February end. Areca nut palms have been infected with various diseases such as fruit rot disease or “mahali” , bud rot, and yellow leaf disease owing to the heavy rain that lashed the district this year. So, the areca nut production in the district has dropped sharply, farming sources said. The production had declined by 70% this season, sources said. The majority of farmers have axed their palms owing to the dearth of remedies to control the diseases, especially yellow leaf disease and bud rot disease. \However, the news of the price rise has not brought cheer to the farmers in the district owing to the drastic decline in production. Many of the farmers have suffered heavy losses this year due to the diseases affecting the crop and the palm, K.Sadananadan, an areca nut grower at Kottathara, said. “We are not expecting many benefits from the increase in prices. More than 80% of the crop in my 5-acre plantation was damaged. Though the price has escalated, farmers in the district will not benefit much,” he said. The tender areca nut is the raw material for making red areca nut which is the major ingredient of paan masalas. The farmers in the district prefer to harvest the areca nut in its tender stage, instead of in its ripened stage as in other parts of the State, mainly to keep the quality of their produce.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tender-areca-nut-prices-touch-all-time-high/article38075817.ece

Vasavan has said that the Central government and global financial giants are making a concerted effort to destroy the cooperative movement in Kerala. He was speaking after inaugurating the Kerala Cooperative Development Welfare Fund Board File Settlement Adalat and Risk Fund Disbursement online at Kerala Bank Kannur Regional Hall on Wednesday. “The Central government is making a concerted effort to destroy the cooperative sector, the lifeblood of Kerala, by pointing out some isolated irregularities. It is using the Reserve Bank of India and global financial giants. The RBI issues notices that have nothing to do with reality,” he said. During the pandemic period, cooperatives lent Rs. 92 crore to buy equipment for online education. The co-operative movement in Kerala is gearing up to build free flat complexes in every district for the poor. The sector has carried out many such relief activities.

31 December 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Tourism sector concerned as foreign tourists skip Kerala||Contrary to expectation from the tourism fraternity, there has been next to nil arrival of foreign tourists to Kerala during the current peak tourist season, despite the skies opening up and airports like the Cochin International Airport recording a daily footfall of around 25,000 passengers, as compared to the pre-pandemic figure of 30,000 passengers. Nowhere is it more glaring than at Fort Kochi – hitherto considered a hub of foreign guests. The teeming crowds at the beach and heritage streets on comprised mostly of domestic tourists and people from within Kochi. Very few international guests arrived this season, despite the reopening of medical visa issual. This has been attributed largely to the insistence that everyone who arrives from countries where restrictions are in vogue ought to remain under quarantine for seven days. In this situation, it appears tourism players would have to wait till September 2022 when the next season begins, to host foreign guests, said Sajeev Kurup, president of Ayurveda Promotion Society. In the meantime, Russian tourists are chartering flights to visit Goa but not Kerala – despite most properties offering substantial discounts, reportedly since the Goa Government has not put much curbs on foreign guests. Among the domestic tourists who were on a visit to Kerala was Reshmi Saigal from Bengaluru and her family, who planned it coinciding with her husband’s birthday. “I was expecting this crowd in Fort Kochi and Munnar, since people across the country are fed up of being confined to their houses,” she said. Referring to small groups of foreigners being sighted in the city hub and other areas, tourism sources said most of them could be staff of foreign missions in India and others who are staff of projects being done by foreign firms in the country. A few come seeking ayurveda treatment. No chartered flights Sources in Cochin International Airport Limited said there has been no chartered flight so far bringing tourists, despite the air-bubble agreement with different countries. It is hoped that more flights from February 2022 will bring in tourists, they said. The secretary of Ernakulam DTPC, Shyam Krishnan, said foreign tourist arrivals was next to nil, while domestic tourists comprised NRIs and mostly people from the Malabar region at locales in Fort Kochi, Munnar, Thekkady, Alappuzha, Kovalam, and Kannur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tourism-sector-concerned-as-foreign-tourists-skip-kerala/article38075841.ece

31 December 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Shipyard to hand over first Water Metro ferry today||The first of the 23 Water Metro’s ferries slated to operate through the water bodies in the Greater Kochi area will be delivered by the Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL) to the Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) on Friday, after repeated overshooting of deadlines and over 10 months after the inauguration of Water Metro's Vyttila-Kakkanad route. The ferry will be deployed on the Vyttila-Kakkanad route for a month-long trial. Another four ferries that are in advanced stages of construction will join the first ferry in conducting trial runs that last up to 20 minutes on the corridor, following which their commercial operation is expected latest by April, it is learnt. The 50-seater battery-powered electric ferries, each costing over Rs. 7.30 crore, can accommodate a total of up to 100 passengers at a time. Five boats that are under construction will be handed over to the KMRL in a couple of months, says a release issued by the metro agency. The Water Metro ferries that would come with state-of-the-art technology, would have many firsts. It is first time in the world a centrally-controlled integrated water transport system with a large fleet would be battery-powered. The ferries use lithium titanate oxide batteries — which are considered the latest and safest in battery technology, and are capable of fast charging. They can be charged in 10 to 15 minutes’ time, while passengers are alighting/boarding. The super chargers will be installed in floating-pontoon jetties at select locations. The ferries come with generator backup, which will take over the operation automatically, in the event of any failure of the battery system. Faster travel The aluminium hull of the catamaran ferries have a high degree of safety and stability. Together with the use of floating jetties, it makes the ferries friendly to the disabled and elderly. The hull is designed for 10-knots speed (18 kmph), which are considerably faster than conventional ferries in operation in Kerala. This makes the ferries consume very less energy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/first-metro-ferry-to-be-handed-over-after-delay-of-10-months/article38075844.ece
31 December 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Kalamassery municipal chief, Oppn. on collision course||Kalamassery municipal chairperson Seema Kannan and the Opposition Left Democratic Front (LDF) councillors seem to be on a collision course with both sides continuing to trade charges and neither willing to relent. For the second day running, tension erupted in the chairperson’s cabin as the LDF councillors laid siege to it for two hours and Ms. Kannan asked the Kalamassery Station House Officer to arrest them. Nineteen protesting councillors were arrested and removed from her cabin. Later in the day, she petitioned the District Police Chief (Kochi City), accusing LDF councillors of trying to physically harm her and stop her from discharging her constitutional duties. The situation seems far from defused with the LDF, steadfast on twin demands, planning to stage a protest in front of the municipal office on January 3. “We have asked for copies of the minutes of all council meetings held in the last one year. We are yet to get all the copies. We also want the agenda, which was unilaterally passed by the chairperson without any discussion, to be taken up afresh in the next council meeting. Protests will continue till our demands are met,” said K.K. Sasi, the LDF councillor of the Medical College division. ‘No reconsidering’ Ms. Kannan, however, said the agenda, for which she had the majority and the mandate, was passed in compliance with the rule book. “There is no question of reconsidering an already passed agenda. The copies of minutes have also been delivered at the homes of the Opposition councillors after they declined to accept them personally,” she said. She challenged the Opposition to prove the corruption charges against her, including those related to the tendering of an earth mover, by taking them to the Vigilance. She accused the LDF of disrupting the waste movement in the municipality by opposing the deployment of 10 autorickshaws purchased for waste collection. “They have been blocking the deployment of vehicles for three months, thus trying to whip up public sentiments against the committee. We are no longer going to pay heed to them and the autorickshaws will be immediately deployed,” said Ms. Kannan, who accused the LDF of targeting her owing to her Scheduled Caste background.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kalamassery-municipal-chief-oppn-on-collision-course/article38075855.ece
31 December 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Youth Congress workers take out march to Kitex premises||Hundreds of Youth Congress activists marched to the Kitex Garments company premises on Thursday evening to protest against what the group alleged was “goondaism” by the Kitex management. “We will not allow any form of violence being backed by the company workers,” said Shafi Parambil, State president of the Youth Congress. He alleged that the company management was trying to give its own interpretation of the incidents on Christimas night, in which a police jeep was burnt, another damaged and several police personnel, trying to break up a fight between two groups of Kitex Garments workers, were injured. The workers were fighting over what was reported as disturbances due to the Christmas carol singing on Saturday night. The incident in which a group of workers tried to burn police personnel to death was shocking and could not be tolerated, said Mr. Parambil after the protest march. He said the Youth Congress was not against any industrial units or enterprises in the State. But, the management should make sure that law and order was maintained, he added. V.P. Sajeendran, former MLA from Kunnathunadu, was among those who participated in the march. A group of human rights activists led by P. Chandrashekhar of People’s Union for Civil Liberties and comprising lawyers P.K. Ibrahim and K.V. Bhadra Kumari, and Rajagopal Vakathanam, Suja Bharati and P.G.

The court made the observation on Thursday while disposing of an appeal against a compensation awarded by the MACT, Ernakulam. Appeal contention It was contended that the amount received under the mediclaim policy was not liable to be deducted since the amount was paid under a contractual liability. It was submitted that the liability of the insurer of the offending vehicle to pay compensation was statutory, whereas the liability to pay a sum to the insured victim on payment of a premium paid from his own earnings was a contractual liability. The court observed that treating motor accident claim as a “statutory liability” and mediclaim as a “contractual liability” was not justified. There could be no such categorisation. The compensation in a motor accident was one based on negligent driving, giving rise to a tortious liability.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-mediclaim-policy-relief-can-be-deducted-from-accident-claim/article38075897.ece
31 December 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Finding of woman’s charred body: sister taken into custody||The woman whose charred body was found at her house near North Paravur on Tuesday might have been murdered by her younger sister, who reportedly has mental health issues, as per the initial inference of the police. The discovery of the body in a room destroyed by fire at Peruvaram on Tuesday afternoon was shrouded in mystery following the disappearance of the victim’s 22-year-old sister, who was reportedly the only other person in the house when the incident took place as their parents were away attending a function. The woman was taken into custody on Thursday evening. Official sources said she confessed to killing her sister during the initial interrogation. However, her arrest and other formalities were expected only on Friday, they said. The post-mortem report had attributed the cause of death to burns, leaving the police to find out how the fire broke out. The North Paravur police registered a case of unnatural death even as they kept the hunt on for the missing woman. The younger sister reportedly had mental health issues and had gone missing twice in the past. Hence, the parents used to tie her up when they were away from home. The police found CCTV footage of her walking along a road not far away from the house. But, how she untied herself from the house remains unclear. A patrolling squad of women police officers had spotted her at Menaka Junction well past midnight on Wednesday. “She claimed that she was from Lakshadweep though we found something amiss about her entire demeanour. So, we got her COVID test done and left her at a shelter home at Kakkand run by Theruvoram Murukan,” said a police officer who was part of the squad. Mr. Murukan said an officer with the Lakshadweep police met her on Thursday morning. “We felt that something was not right. Her hands had burn marks. Then we got a call from the North Paravur police in the evening asking about her,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/finding-of-womans-charred-body-sister-taken-into-custody/article38075848.ece

As part of a revival package, the interest for loans up to Rs. 10 crore will be completely written off, and entrepreneurs who have taken loans up to Rs. 2 crore from various banks can close them by paying 50% of the principal. Those who have taken loans to the tune of Rs. 2 crore to Rs. 10 crore are required to repay 60% of the principal. According to State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) officials, about Rs. 500 crore will have to be written off as part of the settlement formula, said a note issued by the office of the Industries Minister. Accounts declared as non-performing assets till March 31, 2020 can avail itself of the exemption. Repayment proposal Banks will be provided time till February 28, 2022 to submit the repayment proposal based on the formula. Ten percent of the amount should be paid as the first instalment within this time. The processors can repay the loan within one year after the proposal is approved. Apart from processors, the government has extended the scheme to include traders as well. The government had initiated steps for the preparation of a package to revive the crisis-hit private sector in 2019. As part of this, a meeting chaired Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was convened on March 2, 2020. Interest-free loans and provision to restructure their loans were also announced to support the private processors in the last two Budgets. The government later appointed a three-member committee comprising the SLBC convener, government representative and the representative of the processors to formulate the one-time settlement plan. “After the second Left Democratic Front government assumed office, the committee met six times in the presence of Industries Minister P. Rajeeve and once in the presence of Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal on the instructions of the Chief Minister. The final agreement was reached after various efforts to strike a deal on the formulas put forward by the banks and the processors.

31 December 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||DGCA report crucial in resuming big aircraft operation at airport||The report of a team attached to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) will be crucial for the resumption of the operation of wide-bodied aircraft at the Calicut International Airport. The team led by S. Durairaj, Deputy Director (Operations) of the Aerodrome Standards Directorate in the Southern Region of the DGCA, had conducted an assessment of the facilities, including safety measures, at the airport. Though the officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said the visit of the DGCA team was a routine one, its report will be decisive to resume the operation of wide-bodied aircraft at the airport. The operation of big aircraft was suspended after the Air India Express flight crash at the airport on August 7, 2020. However, the aircraft, which was involved in the accident, was classified under Code C (medium or short range). The accident killed 21 people including the pilots. Last year, the DGCA team had carried out a similar inspection . However, the decision to restore the operation of wide-bodied aircraft was put on hold as the Ministry of Civil Aviation waited for the report of a five-member team of Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) which probed the Air India Express crash. The AAIB submitted its report in September, pointing out that AAI was permitted to recommence wide-bodied aircraft operations at Calicut airport after the installation of transmissometer for Runway Visual Range (RVR) system. However, at the time of the accident, the RVR instrument had not been installed at the airport. The RVR can significantly enhance accuracy of visibility reporting, leading to better situational awareness of pilots during low visibility, it said. At the same time, the AAIB report said the AAI had managed to fulfil International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and DGCA certification requirements at the airport for certain critical areas like Runway End Safety Area (RESA) runway lights and approach lights. Although not directly related to the accident cause, the AAIB report said the availability of runway centreline lights would have certainly enhanced the spatial orientation of the pilots. Previously, the DGCA had banned the operation of wide-bodied aircraft in the wake of the Court of Inquiry report on the Air India Express Boeing 737 crash in Mangaluru in May 2010. It was in July last year Saudia (Saudi Arabian airlines) resumed the operation of Haj flights. Then three airlines – Air India, Saudia (Saudi Arabian Airlines) and Emirates — had secured permission to operate wide-bodied aircraft.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dgca-report-crucial-in-resuming-big-aircraft-operation-at-airport/article38075824.ece

The main concern is the increasing number of migrants, including elderly women, engaged in begging in the area, making various schemes introduced by the district administration for street dwellers’ welfare and rehabilitation futile. The majority of them are now concentrated at the beaches of Kozhikode. Home guards and the police are seemingly disinterested to stop and guide them to seek rehabilitation support. Since the lifting of COVID-19 regulations, their presence has been found steadily increasing around prominent tourism spots. “From where they come or go is a mystery for all. They seek alms to buy food, which is totally unbelievable in a city like Kozhikode where a number of free food supply projects are available for the needy,” says Vinitha Vijayan, a Kudumbashree worker in the city. Officials heading rehabilitation projects in the city point out that the number of local people engaged in begging is very low as many of them have already been rehabilitated following the outbreak of the pandemic. According to them, a section in society who are unaware of the rehabilitation schemes for such persons still give them money, which encourages alms-seekers. There are also attempts on the part of a few to evoke the sympathy of people by showing their deformities. Though some of the well-informed people discourage them, there are many who instantly fall prey to such trickeries. Details to be collected Meanwhile, police sources said the details of such persons would be collected again with the support of volunteers as part of the measures to permanently end begging. They also hinted that the suspected flow of migrants to the area would be monitored to check whether they were part of any organised groups.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/alms-seekers-back-in-business-despite-ban/article38075828.ece

Addressing a news conference here, P.A. Mohamad Riyas, Minister for Public Works and Tourism, said the Tourism Department had conceived the project to promote tourism through traditional cuisines of the State. This was a New Year gift from the Department of Tourism for the people of Kozhikode, he said. He said that the project would be implemented in collaboration with the Kozhikode Corporation. It was intended to provide traditional cuisines in each area and serve them to tourists from 7 p.m. to midnight. The food streets would be go live from May.  A meeting of traders, workers, hotel and restaurant association officials and tourism department officials would be convened soon to discuss matters relating to the implementation of the project. Mr. Riyas said that the project would be organised in collaboration with Kudumbashree and other agencies in the hotel sector in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/valiyangadi-to-be-a-night-food-street/article38075829.ece
31 December 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||Misuse of official stickers for drug trafficking on the rise||Enforcement squads of police and Excise departments have come across a series of incidents where drug traffickers and smugglers misuse stickers of advocates, doctors, and media professionals to evade vehicle checking. Forged stickers are reportedly being used to mislead officials during checking and take undue advantage through false claims. It has been found that fake identity cards too are in the possession of fraudsters, and they use them to get priority treatment. Excise sources said their squads had been verifying the authenticity of such stickers with the organisations concerned during suspicious circumstances. “Since it has been identified as a new trickery, we check vehicles without giving priority treatment to anyone based on their professions,” they added. In a recent incident, a man and a woman were caught at Kunnamangalam for allegedly smuggling 18 kg of ganja in a car bearing a forged advocate’s sticker. Similar incidents were tracked by the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) and police enforcement squads in other districts. A police officer said forged stickers were being used by fraudsters as a cover to mislead the authorities. “There is now a system in place in every organisation to issue authentic stickers to eligible persons. However, there are a few who manage to secure the forged versions of such stickers and use them to hoodwink all,” he added. An Excise officer said the misuse of vehicles carrying official stickers by offenders too was common. “There are relatives or friends who misuse such vehicles for personal use. We have also come across incidents where sold vehicles bearing such stickers were used for illegal activities,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/misuse-of-official-stickers-for-drug-trafficking-on-the-rise/article38075834.ece

The squads also visited some such facilities in the rural areas of Kozhikode to check the celebration plans and the number of guests being given accommodation on the New Year eve. “All the Station House Officers have been asked to keep vigil in their area to prevent crowded celebrations after 10 p.m. till January 2. In the wake of the Omicron threat, the message has already been circulated widely through social media for better reach,” said a senior police officer from the Kozhikode Rural police district. He made it clear that the combined squads of police and excise departments would be on duty to enforce the latest directives from the government for checking the pandemic threat. Meanwhile, some of the tourism facility operators in the district have come up with strong protests over the latest regulations which, according to them would drag the whole industry into crisis again at the peak season. They also alleged that the unexpected cancellation of bookings by tourists was a shocker for many who had a lot of plans to explore the seasonal opportunities. A homestay entrepreneur from Balussery said he was forced to accept booking from only families in the wake of the latest instructions from the State Government. “Like me, many homestay owners are in a situation to turn down the booking requests from youngsters’ groups in the wake of the heightened regulations,” he revealed. The Kerala Tour Promoters’ Association leaders said many of their previously planned trips were cancelled following the latest ban on night travel. According to them, the latest instructions from the government had spoiled the business of many small scale investors in the sector. “We have been going through a severe financial crisis since the outbreak of the pandemic. The latest regulations at this peak season will again test our patience,” said K. Purushothaman, district secretary of the association. He claimed that the government was heedless of the suggestions put forth by the association for the welfare of the investors in the sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-excise-squads-to-prevent-crowded-parties-on-new-years-eve/article38075832.ece

Mr. Sudheeran, while addressing a session on ‘Derailing development and environment’ organised in memory of late journalist P.

31 December 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Project to map plants in Parambikulam||The Parambikulam Tiger Conservation Foundation will join hands with the Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) to prepare a detailed mapping of the rare and endangered plants endemic to the Parambikulam Tiger Reserve. The mapping survey would begin soon, said Parambikulam Tiger Reserve deputy director Vysak Sasikumar. He said it was time to update the inventory of the rare plant species that brought glory to the reserve. KFRI’s senior silviculturist P. Sujanapal will lead the mapping. According to Dr. Sujanapal, examining the status and conserving some rare and endangered plants of Parambikulam was vital. “We will mark the rare, threatened and endemic species of plants, and will closely examine their population depletion,” said Dr. Sujanapal. The Parambikulam Tiger Reserve, with a core area of 390.89 sq km and a buffer zone of 252.77 sq km, has many rare species of plants which cannot be seen anywhere else in the world. Of the hundreds of species of angiosperms (flowering plants) found in Parambikulam, some are extremely rare. Rare angiosperm  Haplothismia exannulata , an angiosperm that looks like a fungus, remains the finest example. “This genus is not found anywhere else in the world. You can see it only during the months of September, October and November. This ephemeral plant will remain underground through the other months of the year,” said Dr. Sujanapal.  Haplothismia exannulata is found only in some pockets of Parambikulam. “If we lose this plant because of our carelessness, then it will vanish from the face of the earth forever,” he said. Rediscovered  Colubrina travancorica , a climber thought to have been extinct since it was recorded over a century ago, was also found at Parambikulam. Scientists have recorded more than 1,400 species of angiosperms in the reserve. They include nearly six dozen species of wild orchids. “One particular orchid is extremely rare,” said Dr. Sujanapal. Parambikulam supports a high density of South India’s wild gaur population. Nilgiri tahr, the only South Indian wild goat, is found in the high altitude terrains of the Parambikulam reserve.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/project-to-map-plants-in-parambikulam/article38075819.ece
31 December 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||A story of crisis in Palakkad||The past year proved to be one of the worst for thousands of paddy farmers in the district. From continual and untimely rain to severe shortage of fertilizers, paddy farmers have faced the worst crisis in recent memory. Their hope now lies on the second crop, whose planting has been done. The delayed monsoon rain that battered the district in September and October scuttled the hopes of the farmers when harvest-ready paddy was submerged. “The paddy remained under water for days, inflicting a heavy blow to more than 80% of the farmers,” said leading farmer Muthalamthodu Mani. The soaked paddy could not be harvested for weeks, nearly halving the yield. The loss made the farmers incapable of repaying the loans they availed themselves of. “We are not crying over the heavy loss we suffered in the first crop. Our hope is on the second crop,” said Mundur-based farmer M.S. Vinunath. He said the fertilizer shortage was looming heavy now. Fertilizer price rise Apart from lack of availability, the rise in the prices of Factamfos, potash and urea too has increased the hardship of the farmers. The price of potash has nearly doubled to Rs. 1,700 a 50-kg bag. Similarly, Factamfos price too has increased to Rs. 1,100 a 50-kg bag. “We have been making queries with various agencies to get the fertilizer. If we cannot apply it now, the yield will be severely affected,” said Mr. Vinunath and Mr. Mani. When 50 kg of potash is needed for an acre of paddy, the quantity of urea needed for an acre is 60 kg. Supplyco’s procurement of paddy in Palakkad district fell considerably this year. The Supplyco procured 1.29 lakh tonnes of paddy from 55,391 farmers. As many as 62,865 farmers had registered with Supplyco, but many could not supply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/crisis-in-palakkad/article38075895.ece

As per official estimates, the return of packed crowds, especially in the final leg of the Mandalam season, has sent the income soaring to Rs. 78.92 crore till December 24 . The board expects the overall income to go over Rs. 80 crore, ten times the figure clocked during the same period last year, considering the revenue generated in the final two days of the 41-day season. Of the total income received so far, the sale of Appam and Aravana accounted for Rs. 34.52 crore while the revenue from collection boxes stood around Rs. 29 crore. The latest figures, however, stood well below the Rs. 156 crore reported during the pre-pandemic season. The overall income from the massively scaled-down Sabarimala pilgrimage last year was Rs. 21 crore, with the total footfall remaining less than one lakh. The restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 had a drastic impact on the revenue sources with the TDB suffering a loss of over Rs. 600 crore. Master plan TDB president K.Ananthagopan said that about 10.35 lakh pilgrims had undertaken the pilgrimage so far this season, with the daily number of visitors reaching as high as 43,000. “The tally is expected to go up further when the temple reopens for the Makaravilakku season,” he said. Meanwhile, the TDB is slated to hold a meeting in Thiruvananthapuram on January 5 to deliberate on the Sabarimala master plan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/improved-pilgrim-footfall-boosts-tdb-kitty/article38075884.ece

The animal, however, was found dead in the morning. An autopsy was conducted at Konni and the carcass was shifted for cremation within the Kummannur forest station limits. The post-mortem examination attributed the animal’s death to injuries to its lungs.

Mr. Khan had expressed his desire to divest himself of the Chancellor’s post in protest against what he termed “political cronyism” in university appointments. Higher Education Minister R. Bindu’s contentious letter to Mr. Khan seeking service extension for Kannur University Vice Chancellor Gopinath Ravindran beyond the retirement age seemed to be the tipping point. Dr. Bindu had also demanded that the Chancellor disband the search committee for a new Vice Chancellor and allegedly cited a “questionable” opinion to bolster the government’s demand. Her stance had drawn criticism from Communist Party of India State secretary Kanam Rajendran. The Governor had also seemed miffed that the government had given “silent sanction” to the Vice Chancellor of the Kalamandalam University to move the High Court against him. Matters came to a head recently when Mr. Khan refused to accept a High Court notice regarding the Kannur Vice Chancellor’s service extension. Mr. Khan reiterated his stance that he would no more discharge his duties as Chancellor and forwarded the notice to the government. Congress stance Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan termed Mr. Khan’s stance unlawful. The Assembly had vested the Governor with the powers of the Chancellor by an act of law. Unless the Assembly amended the law, the incumbent was constitutionally bound to discharge the duties of the Chancellor. Khan unresponsive He said Mr. Khan had turned a deaf ear to the Opposition entreaties to stop the government from populating varsity senates and syndicates with Communist Party of India (Marxist) satraps and fellow travellers instead of academically oriented and qualified individuals. Raj Bhavan had not released documents regarding the issue despite several RTI requests from Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala. The reluctance had prevented Mr. Chennithala from moving the Lok Ayukta against Dr. Bindu. Mr. Khan had affixed his signature on unlawful demand made by Dr. Bindu to extend the Kannur Vice Chancellor’s tenure beyond the retirement age. CPI(M) view CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan appeared to echo a similar sentiment. He told a news channel that Mr. Khan was Chancellor as per an act of the Assembly. He needed to discharge the duties of the Chancellor unless the Assembly deemed otherwise. Governor’s stance Mr. Khan repeated his earlier stance that he felt extremely uncomfortable after signing Dr. Bindu’s letter. He said the Opposition had wrongly claimed that he had acquiesced to the government’s demand. Mr. Khan had made his displeasure clear in a letter to Mr. Vijayan. The Governor appeared to suggest that the government could promulgate an Ordinance removing him as Vice Chancellor, and he would sign it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/udf-ldf-on-the-same-page/article38075903.ece

Inaugurating the 89th Sivagiri pilgrimage at the Sivagiri Madhom in Varkala, Mr. Vijayan said the accent was on research and development. The administration would reskill the youth to meet the demands of the global labour market. Mr. Vijayan said the creation of background infrastructure was imperative for the State’s development. The government was committed to ensuring uninterrupted power, modern transport infrastructure, and broadband Internet connectivity. The Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board would spearhead the State’s developmental aspirations. The administration would also improve the State’s tourism infrastructure. The future lay in electric vehicles, he said. Mr. Vijayan slammed the bid to bracket social reformer Sree Narayana Guru with a particular set of people. He said such attempts denied the renaissance humanist in the seer and negated his message of universal love and peace. The Guru himself had dissuaded the effort to portray him as the symbol of any one particular group. Renaissance movement Sree Narayana Guru was a seer and social reformer at the same time. His teachings had triggered the renaissance movement in Kerala. However, some quarters denied the Guru’s progressive teachings. Such revanchist forces aspired to pull back Kerala into the medieval ages. They wanted to exacerbate religious and caste divisions to reap political dividends. The Guru’s message of equality and fraternity assumed more significance in the present context. Mr. Vijayan lamented that many were still immune to the Guru’s message. The social reformer had insisted that humankind served itself better via education and improvement of living conditions. The path to such an egalitarian future lay through the understanding that humans were born equal. They had equal rights. The Guru had put religion secondary to human upliftment and emancipation. He had famously said that humans should improve, irrespective of their faith. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader Kanimozhi, MP, Sree Narayana Dharma Sangham Trust (SNDST) president Swamy Sachidananda, V. Joy and K. Babu, MLAs, former Finance Minister T.M.

Inaugurating the golden jubilee conference of Brahma Vidyalayam at Sivagiri, near Varkala, on Thursday, Mr. Khan stressed the social reformer’s ideal to ensure equal status and education for woman both in their families and within societies. “He had called for a social environment which would enable women enjoy genuine freedom and equality of opportunity. Guru maintained that the success of the family depended on its women. He also stood for marriage reforms and advised simple marriages to avoid unnecessary extravagances. Guru’s words in this regard are relevant even today,” he said, while expressing happiness that the movement against dowry gained strength in the State by deriving inspiration from Guru’s teachings. View on religions He lauded the Sree Narayana Dharma Sangham Trust for propagating the teachings of Guru who had envisioned that the soul of all religions is one and it was only their approaches that were different. The Governor said the Brahma Vidyalayam had been working towards spreading spiritual knowledge by offering seven-year-long course on Indian philosophy, Vedanta, Tatwa Shastra etc. The institution had received the service of some eminent intellectuals in Vedantic and philosophical studies such as M.H. Sastrikal, Balarama Panicker, and R.V. Potti. Considering the evolving pedagogical approaches, Mr. Khan urged the administrators to open up more avenues for education on Guru’s philosophy through short-term and online courses.

31 December 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Kerala seeks State-specific package in Union Budget||Kerala has sought a State-specific package in Union Budget 2022-23 for giving a fillip to sectors including agriculture, agro-processing industries and MSMEs which have taken a beating during the COVID-19 pandemic. The State has also urged the Centre to increase the GST compensation period by five more years. Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal presented the State's demand at a pre-budget meeting of State Finance Ministers chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in New Delhi on Thursday. Mr. Balagopal urged the Centre to support the State with an additional grant to effectively tackle the hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic had severely affected employment, consumption and GST revenue in Kerala, Mr. Balagopal said. Revenue collection from GST had been poor during the pandemic, which justified an extension of the compensation period, according to the State. Kerala also called for a special assistance package in the Union Budget for supporting the countercyclical measures adopted by State governments as part of the efforts to stimulate economic recovery. SilverLine Mr. Balagopal urged the Centre to support the 529.45-km SilverLine semi-high-speed rail project linking Thiruvananthapuram and Kasaragod. He requested the Centre to extend support to the project by expediting the requisite approvals. Further, the State has sought a specific rehabilitation package in the Union Budget for Keralites employed abroad who were forced by the pandemic to return home. Citing the hardships caused by COVID-19, Kerala has asked the Centre to increase the pension amount provided by the Centre. At present, only 6.8 lakh beneficiaries in the State are covered under the GoI&NSAP programme with monthly pensions ranging from Rs. 200 to Rs. 500, it noted. The State had also reiterated its demand that the Centre reduce or remove the cess and surcharge on petrol and diesel.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kerala-seeks-better-deal-in-union-budget/article38075836.ece

Minister for Agriculture P. Prasad on Thursday inaugurated a two-day workshop ‘Carbon-neutral agriculture in Kerala’ organised by the department for generating suggestions which would help in drafting the master plan. The department also plans to organise a meeting of farming experts in the State in January, Mr. Prasad said. “Andhra Pradesh has set a model with natural farming. We also have various models which will prove useful,” Mr. Prasad said on the sidelines of the workshop. Inaugurating the workshop, he underscored the need to revamp the farm sector for reducing carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality by giving due importance to soil health and climate. Unscientific farming practices are contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, he said. Prasant Kumar Swain, Additional Secretary, (Agriculture), Government of India, said the country’s farm sector should adapt to the carbon-neutral approach and treat it like a ‘mantra.’ 15% of emissions In India, the sector accounts for 15% of total emissions. “Though it may not be very high compared to the global average, we need to look at it if we are to make the sector emission-free.” Mr. Swain stressed the need to balance livelihood aspects of agriculture and the challenge of reducing the emissions due to agriculture. T. Vijay Kumar, executive vice chairman, Rythu Sadhikara Samstha, and ex-officio special Chief Secretary to Andhra Pradesh government (natural farming), called for a holistic approach. Current land management practices are leading to a steady loss of soil organic matter. He termed agricultural practices that cause carbon emission ‘destructive.’ Natural farming, he said, is based on the concept that all nutrients required by plants are available in adequate quantities in the soil, air, and water.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/agri-carbon-neutral-master-plan-on-the-anvil/article38075883.ece

Artistic director and performer of Rangachetana K.V. Ganesh has used the scope of invisible theatre in the play. The main property of the play was the rice collected from people as alms. The experience of the man forms the focal theme. “ Ariyennunnor (those who count the grains) is about people who never come in any records. They are counting the days that will bring them food for survival. They never get an answer for their waiting,” says Mr. Ganesh.

31 December 2021||BENGALURU,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cong. scores big in Karnataka civic polls||Continuing its impressive performance in the recent elections to the Upper House, the principal Opposition Congress put up yet another robust show in the elections held to 58 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) by winning 501 seats out of 1,184 seats. While the BJP won 433 seats, the JD(S) managed victory only in 45 seats. A total of 195 Independents also won in the elections held early this week. The AAP and Janata Party have won one each, while AIMIM and SDPI won two and six, respectively. In terms of capturing the local bodies through majority, the Congress secured majority in 20 ULBs while the BJP won 15 and the JD(S) has just won one ULB at Bidadi. The rest of the ULBs have thrown mixed results with no party being able to get majority. In three ULBs, the support of JD(S) is crucial for either the BJP or the Congress to secure majority. The Congress’ victory continues after it wrested the Hangal Assembly constituency from the BJP in the byelections and won 11 seats in the bitterly contested elections from local authorities constituencies to the Legislative Council. Interestingly, in M.K. Hubballi Town Panchayat in Kittur taluk, all 14 seats have been taken by Independents. Similarly, in Naganuru Town Panchayat in Moodalagi taluk, all 17 seats have been won by Independents. In Boregaon town panchayat in Nipppani taluk, Independents secured all 17 seats. Expressing happiness over the party’s performance, Leader of tthe Opposition Siddaramaiah said it is clear that the people’s mandate is in favour of the Congress. “The BJP was arrogant to think that it can win by spending money. It is not sufficient to spend money in elections, people-centric work has to be implemented,” he told reporters. He also pointed out that even in the Legislative Council elections, though the Congress and the BJP won 11 seats each, the Congress secured 48% votes as against 41% by the BJP. “This result shows that the mandate is against the BJP and people want the Congress to return to power. Though I do not say that this result is an indicator of the general elections, it shows the leaning of people who are upset with the misrule of the BJP Government.” Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, whose party could win only in Bidadi Town Municipality, said people have answered critics by electing JD(S) members in Vijayapura, Raichur, and Sira among others. “In several places, other parties cannot rule without our support. We did not spend, but our party workers have fought this election.” Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai claimed that the party had performed well when overall results were considered. “We have performed better than the last time though we should have performed better.” He said that in several places, the BJP could not record success since the minority population was high. “Even in such constituencies, we have done well. In my constituency, since minorities constitute 65%, success has been limited.” “In some city municipal councils, the Congress has won where minorities are high in numbers. There is no need to feel good about it,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cong-scores-big-in-karnataka-civic-polls/article38075403.ece

Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai held talks with leaders of these outfits on Thursday to convince them to withdraw the bandh call. Only protest Speaking after the meeting with the Chief Minister, Vatal Nagaraj, president, Kannada Okkoota, who had given the bandh call, announced that there would not be a bandh, but only a protest demanding that the State Government ban the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES). A visibly unhappy Mr. Nagaraj said never in his life had he come under “such pressure” over a bandh for the cause of Kannada. ‘Examining ban on MES’ “The Kannada flag was burnt and the MES vandalism crossed all limits and that is why the bandh call was given. But certain sectors, including the film industry and various businesses, acted as if we were doing a crime. Even other Kannada organisations put pressure on me to withdraw the bandh call,” he said, adding that the Chief Minister had assured them to legally examine imposing a ban on MES. Mr. Bommai, who was Mr. Nagaraj as he made the announcement, said the Government and Kannada organisations were on the same page on the issue and thanked the outfits for heeding his appeal. From the day Mr. Nagaraj gave a call for Karnataka bandh there were discordant notes and they kept growing. Many sectors and trade associations announced that they would extend “moral support” and not participate in the bandh as they had been battered by the pandemic and were reeling under losses. With the night curfew in place, businesses are already upset that they are losing out on the New Year Eve season and said they were not in a position to close down businesses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kannada-outfits-withdraw-bandh-call-after-talks-with-cm/article38075401.ece

Anantapur district, where the rainfall is very low, stands as an example with farmers cultivating three crops,” said Mr. Sinha. “Water requirement will reduce if farmers take to natural farming. This apart, the nutritional values of the produce will help them get a better price if they properly grade the harvest,” he observed.

31 December 2021||PALAKKAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jumbo tantrum shakes policemen||Policemen on duty at the Parambikulam Tiger Reserve police station faced an unusual threat on Wednesday night when a female elephant and her calf raided the premises. The two elephants entered the compound around 10.30 p.m. and started buffeting the doors. They then stood in front of the iron grill fixed at the station’s portico and butted it repeatedly, damaging it. After half an hour of the charge, the elephants withdrew. Unusual rage While the presence of elephants, alone and in herds, is common across the reserve, forest officers say elephants rarely charge at the people in the reserve. The reasons for the mother elephant’s rage and the circumstances surrounding the incident have raised questions among the officers. A video shot by one of the police personnel inside the besieged station has since gone viral on social media. “Rarely do we report a man-elephant confrontation in the Parambikulam Tiger Reserve. Any trauma we cause to wild animals, especially the elephant, will reflect in their behaviour,” said Saby Varghese, Wildlife Technical Assistant in Palakkad. A media team from Palakkad had come across several elephants at Parambikulam during a visit last week, but none of them showed any hostile behaviour. “Elephants in Parambikulam ignore people in general. That’s why we always advise the tourists not to cause them even the slightest anguish. Any trauma caused to them may remain in their mind and reflect in their behaviour later,” said Murugesan, a forest guide.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jumbo-tantrum-shakes-policemen/article38075407.ece

Claiming that no initiative was taken to arrive at a consensus in the controversy, he said it was up to the government to find a way out of the stalemate. Mr. Khan said he was willing to transfer his powers as Chancellor to the Pro Chancellor (Higher Education Minister) since “she is very keen on exercising power and claimed her position is not an ornamental one”. He added he was not interested in being just a “symbolic head” of universities and would never become party to attempts to lower their standards. He also termed “immoral” the reappointment process of the Kannur University Vice Chancellor, for which the government relied on the University Act for reappointing an incumbent Vice Chancellor and the University Grants Commission guidelines to satisfy the age criterion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-governor-remains-firm-on-abdicating-chancellorship/article38075411.ece

Meanwhile, the TTD’s Public Relations wing clarified that the tie-up was meant to ensure hassle-free delivery of its New Year products to the devotees across the globe.  ‘No compulsion’ “There is no compulsion to buy from Amazon, as we are selling the same in our TTD Kalyana Mandapams across the country.

As many as 804 bodily offences were reported this year, as against 769 during 2020. A total of 499 crimes against women were reported this year as against 471 last year. The district witnessed 35 murders, three murder for gain cases and 28 kidnappings this year as against 30 murders, one murder for gain and 19 kidnapping during 2020. Rape cases declined marginally with 60 reported this year as against 64 last year. They include 29 registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Domestic violence increased with 195 reported cases this year as against 149 cases in 2020. Accident cases declined to 793 this year from 826 last year. Fatalities, however, increased this year with 392 deaths and 661 persons injured this year, as against 333 deaths and 724 persons injured in road accidents in 2020. Speaking to reporters at a yearender press conference here on Thursday, Superintendent of Police B. Krishna Rao said that enabling greater access to women to reach out to the police through various avenues like Spandana, Disha App, Mahila Police and online portals was the reason for the marginal increase in registration of crimes against women. “This should be seen in a positive light as more women are coming forward to lodge complaints,” Mr. Krishna Rao opined. He said that in all grave offences involving crimes against women, the accused were charge-sheeted within 60 days. In two cases from Atchutapuram, the accused were charge-sheeted within seven days, he added. The SP said that during the first week of December, five persons were killed in a clash between two families over allegations of witchcraft in Ananthagiri mandal. “Most of the deaths in accidents involved pedestrians and two-wheeler riders. These accidents mostly occurred either at night or in the early hours. We are taking steps to prevent such accidents and also keep a tab on overspeeding,” the SP said. Mr. Krishna Rao said that awareness camps in rural areas on cybercrime were yielding good results, and led to a decline with 34 cases being reported this year, as against 52 cases last year. He added that this year, 101 house burglaries were reported, which numbered 91 last year. This year, 150 property cases were detected in which 255 persons were arrested and property worth Rs. 1.07 crore was recovered. The SP added that the conviction rate has increased to 89 % this year from 85 % last year in the district. NDPS cases Altogether 566 cases were booked by the district police under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, in which over 82,000 kg ganja was seized this year. This is said to be the highest-ever destruction of ganja till date. Over 7,400 acres of ganja crops were razed as part of ‘Operation Parivartana’. Of them, ganja plantations in 400 acres was voluntarily destroyed by the tribals, the SP added.  The rise in cases should be seen in a positive light as more women are coming forward to lodge complaints thanks to various avenues like Disha App and Mahila Police B.

Presenting an overview of the extremist offences cases, the SP said that six Maoists were killed in three Exchanges of Fire (EOFs) this year, as against the death of one Maoist in three EOFs last year.

Similarly, 17 extremists surrendered before the police following development works initiated in the Agency. The surrendered Maoists were identified as Jalandhar Reddy alias Krishna of SZCM and Chikkudu Chinna Rao alias Sudheer (DCM). Their surrenders were a big jolt to the Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) movement, Mr. Krishna Rao said. Continuous outreach programmes in tribal areas like Yuvaho, Darshini, Prerana, Sankalpam, Jana Mytri meetings, Giri Karshaka Mitra and Cheruva have ushered in a positive outlook among the tribals towards governance, he said. “The Maoist party is at its lowest ebb as of now. Only four Dalams including Galikonda, Pedabayulu and Korukonda, are still active as per our information.

31 December 2021||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jagan likely to lay stone for Bhogapuram airport soon||Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is likely to lay the foundation stone for the construction of the international airport at Bhogapuram in Vizianagaram district in January 2022. With a clear indication to this effect from the Chief Minister’s Office, the district administration has accorded top priority to completion of the land acquisition process for the project that is expected to spur economic activity in the North Andhra region. The proposed airport on the Chennai-Kolkata national highway is at a distance of 40 km from Visakhapatnam, 20 km from Vizianagaram, and 50 km from Srikakulam. The government, which has been facing a lot of flak for prioritising welfare programmes at the cost of developmental works, is reportedly trying to disprove the charge by speeding up the project work. The GMR Group, which had developed the Shamshabad international airport in Hyderabad, had been selected for the project. The stone for the facility at Bhogapuram had been laid during the TDP term, but the construction activity was dogged in delays as land acquisition could not be completed. The GMR Group is reportedly pressing the government to speed up the process to prevent further escalation of the project cost. The project had initially been proposed in an extent of 5,311.88 acres. Later, the government decided to construct the airport in 2,631.63 acres. So far, only 2,542.16 acres could be acquired. The remaining 89.47 acres will have to be acquired in the villages of Ravada, Ravivalasa, Savaravilli, and Gudepuvalasa. The property owners had approached the court opposing land acquisition, and the officials were trying to convince them saying that the project would spur economic activity. District Collector A. Suryakumari told The Hindu that land acquisition had almost been completed, except in a few stretches. She said land was also being acquired for laying the approach road to the airport from the national highway.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jagan-likely-to-lay-stone-for-bhogapuram-airport-soon/article38075473.ece

Construction of retaining wall on both sides of the drain from Hussainsagar up to Musi River is estimated to cost Rs. 68.4 crore. It is one of the major works proposed under the Rs. 858 crore project. Addressing a meeting organised on this occasion, Mr.Rama Rao said residents of Nallakunta, Amberpet, Ashoknagar, and Musheerabad had to face severe flooding issues due to the overflowing nala during untimely heavy rains during October, 2020.Complete coverage by the wall would help find permanent solution for the flooding issue, he said, and credited the local legislators Muta Gopal and Kaleru Venkatesh for their suggestions. Construction has been divided into two packages along a length of nine kilometres, starting at Marriott Hotel and covering Kavadiguda, Gandhi Nagar, Ashok Nagar, Chikkadpally, Baghlingampally and Golnaka. In the first package, three works will be taken up with a cost of Rs. 33.15 crore, covering the stretch between Kavadiguda bridge and Himayatnagar bridge, via Gandhi Nagar bridge, and Ashoknagar bridge. In the second package costing Rs. 35.25 crore, five more bits will be covered, between Himayatnagar bridge and confluence with Musi river, covering Chikkadpally bridge, Baghlingampally bridge, Nallakunta bridge and Golnaka bridge. Construction of the wall would be completed before the onset of monsoons next year, the minister promised. Property acquisition has been restricted to 20 properties only instead of the required 400 properties keeping in view the socio-economic profile of the residents, he said. Under SNDP, a total 52 works are being taken up, 30 within GHMC with an estimated cost of Rs. 633 crore and 22 in the peripheral municipalities at an estimated cost of over Rs. 225 crore.

CREDAI has “sincerely advised” the prospective home-buyers to pick from “best TS-RERA approved projects” only as certain “unscrupulous” players have been trying to sell non-RERA registered properties, increasing the risk to gullible home buyers. Fellow members were urged to book their stalls before the last date.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/credai-property-show-from-february-11-13/article38075785.ece
31 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||A tough ride for TSRTC||It has been a rough ride this year for the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC). The COVID – 19 pandemic, rising costs of diesel, spare parts and maintenance expenses, cast a shadow on the transport juggernaut, which despite such hurdles, continues to cater to the travel requirements of lakhs of people in the State. The extent of losses was a staggering Rs. 2,600 crore, the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation informed the media in August. This was due to a crushing combination of factors which included the TSRTC’s fleet coming to a grinding halt during the COVID – 19 lockdown, a constant increase in fuel prices by around 27%, maintenance cost, and interest payments on loans. To ameliorate the situation, a loan of Rs. 1,000 crore was sanctioned. But this alone would not solve the problem. Officials of the transport juggernaut, including Managing Director V C Sajjanar, got into a huddle and began brainstorming on how the corporation’s dipping fortunes could be turned around. Discussions entailed a host of ideas and proposals, the most notable of which were monetising the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation ’s large land bank, and removing around 500 buses from the fleet. Eventually, in December, the Transport Minister, Mr Sajjanar and Chairman Bajireddy Goverdhan proposed a fare hike of 25 paise to 30 paise per kilometre. The hike is yet to take effect. TSRTC management stated that it was ticket prices which determined the revenues of the corporation The TSRTC has a fleet strength of approximately 9,500 buses. In what is reflective of occupancy, the kilometres operated per day fluctuated through the months of May to September this year. In May, the average volume of kilometres operated was 8 lakh, and rose to 30 lakh in September. In the same period, the daily average traffic earnings were Rs. 2.10 crore which increased to Rs. 9.31 crore. This was an improvement, but far from pre-pandemic revenues. An aging fleet remains a cause of concern. According to the TSRTC’s policy, buses which have completed 15 years in service or have crossed 13 lakh km are to be replaced. The Telangana State Road Transport Corporation has not bought any new buses for its fleet this year. There are scores of buses which are approaching the 15-year in-service or 13 lakh-km parameter. According to estimates, there are around 1,000 vehicles which are to be replaced. But all was not grim. Chief Justice of India N V Ramana intervened on behalf of P Vaishnavi, a class VIII student from Chidedu, who wrote to him about the lack of bus services. The corporation pressed into service buses for students of the village. Restoration of more services followed. Acting on 370 representations from passengers, including students, the TSRTC restored 359 services. The largest number of services which were restored were from Nalgonda Region and Greater Hyderabad Zone. The TSRTC stated that as many as 92 services were restored for students. Despite this, the overcrowding, due either to poor frequency or paucity of buses on certain routes, remains a problem which the TSRTC continues to grapple with. In what was one of the largest mass vaccination programmes, the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation fully vaccinated its staff of over 48,000. In another employee-friendly initiative, Managing Director V C Sajjanar ensured that action was taken in the case of passengers misbehaving with staff. He took steps to ensure those who defaced TSRTC properties were booked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/a-tough-ride-for-tsrtc/article38075797.ece
31 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||A year that will keep the memory of oustees alive||The State Government was successful and finally completed the 50 tmcft Mallannasagar reservoir in Siddipet district, native of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Finance Minister T. Harish Rao. This is the biggest balancing reservoir under Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme (KILS). Similarly, it has been making efforts to complete Gouravelli project and fill it with water. While Mallannasagar has replaced about 6,000 families it was about 1,200 under Gouravelli. Despite knowing pretty well that they have been fighting against the mighty force of the State, which has all resources at its disposal, the outees at both places waged a tireless war to get their rightful compensation. In regard to both these projects, still cases are pending with the High Court. The fight of oustees has also witnessed distress by farmers, in at least two cases leading to suicide. The distress related to losing their lands and being unable to buy new farm land at any other place in majority cases as land rates outside the project area have skyrocketed. In the first week of this month, on December 4, Bhukya Laksmi (35), an oustee of Somajitanda, a hamlet of Gudatipally, committed suicide by hanging at her house. Her husband had died three years ago and three children became orphans. There was no one to look after them. The incident that took place at Mallannasagar was too pathetic and heart-rending. On June 18, 2021, Tutukuri Malla Reddy (70), an oustee of Vemulaghat village in Toguta mandal under Mallannasgar committed suicide by self-immolation. The wood he used was from the demolished house he lived in the village. Though officials later claimed that his grandson was allotted house as he was a single person, the incident depicted heart-felt feeling of oustees. Even today, after water was released into Mallannasagar, some oustees have complaints that the total compensation is yet to be paid to them. “The experiences of oustees under both Kondapochamma and Mallannasagar were bitter. At one point, those who were fighting with the government were evicted. We feel we may also face the same fate,” said an oustee of of Gudatipally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/a-year-to-remember-for-oustees-plight/article38075805.ece

A total of 817 structures will get submerged under the project and a payment of Rs. 93.94 crore was already paid for 808 structures and for only nine structures the remaining amount has to be paid. Number of project-displaced families (PDF) in submergence stands at 1,104 with each family with a payment of Rs. 8 lakh each in the 1.41 tmcft project. This includes Rs. 6 lakh with towards 200 square yard house plot with all amenities, Rs. 2 lakh towards wage and transport. Only 177 families remained to be paid. Number of project-affected families (PAF) coming in submergence stands at 49 and all of them were paid Rs. 0.72 crore. “We are trying to address all the issues being raised by them. It will take time to get the GO as far as payment of compensation to the youth numbering more than 300 is concerned. Similarly, I have promised to allot double bed room houses under my quota for some,” Mr. Satish said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/we-are-meeting-demands-of-oustees/article38075799.ece

31 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||ITC unveils Sustainability Innovation Challenge||ITC Paperboards and Specialty Papers Division (PSPD) in collaboration with Invest India has launched ITC Sustainability Innovation Challenge for start-ups with innovative ideas on sustainable packaging and smart waste management solutions. Entries are being invited through the Startup India portal towards challenges laid out to find sustainable solutions to substitute single-use plastics and automate waste segregation process with smart technology-based solutions to improve efficiency and speed, ITC PSPD said. The selected start-ups will get incentives at various stages, including mentorship from experts, paid pilot opportunity and assistance in testing and certification at the ‘Development Stage’. This will be followed by support to enable market expansion and capacity building through funding opportunities in the ’Early Market Play Stage’. At the ‘Late Stage’, the start-ups will get procurement opportunities and could be evaluated, on a case to case basis, for funding and acquisition opportunities as well. The deadline to submit proof of concept is February 28. The Sustainability Innovation Challenge underlines ITC’s engagements with the start-up ecosystem, in collaboration with Invest India, to crowdsource out-of-the box ideas for phasing out single-use plastics by 2022, said Vadiraj Kulkarni, CEO of ITC PSPD. He said this citing how disposal of plastic and non-biodegradable waste continues to pose the biggest challenge on solid waste management front in the country. It is further aggravated due to inefficient segregation of post-consumer waste at the source which leads to a lot of waste ending up in landfills, which is highly polluting. “Innovative start-ups will be able to showcase Made-in-India solutions that propel India towards a circular economy,” said Deepak Bagla, MD and CEO of Invest India, which is a non-profit venture under the Centre’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/itc-paperboards-unveils-innovation-challenge/article38075807.ece
31 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Save chilli farmers from suicide: Revanth||Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president A. Revanth Reddy expressed serious concern over the rising suicides of chilly farmers and urged the government to bail out the farmers who incurred huge losses due to crop loss. In a letter to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, he said there was an alarming rise in farmers' suicides across Telangana in the past three to four months, and on average 5 to 10 farmers were taking their own lives every day due to accumulated debts. Most of the farmers were aged around 35. Mr. Reddy said that this year chilli was cultivated in 3,58,557 acres spread across Khammam, Mahabubabad, Kothagudem, Warangal Urban, Warangal Rural, Nalgonda and Suryapeta districts. The farmers invested about Rs. 1 lakh per acre and expected good returns. However, their crops were destroyed by Thrips Parvispinous, an invasive insect from Indonesia, which was first seen in 2015. Consequently, as against the expected yield of 25 to 30 quintals per acre, the yield was less than five quintals causing huge losses to the farmers. On average, he said that each chilli farmer had accumulated a debt of Rs. 5 lakh to 10 lakh. The situation of tenant farmers had become even worse. With no means left to recover the losses or to repay the debt, many farmers were resorting to suicide. Mr. Reddy said the Chief Minister had been asking paddy farmers to go for alternative crops. But so far he had done nothing to help the crisis-hit chilli farmers. What was the guarantee that farmers would get the required assistance from the government if they go for an alternate crop other than paddy? he asked. The TPCC chief urged the Chief Minister to send a team of ministers to affected districts to give confidence to chilli farmers or else the Congress would launch a movement to seek justice for mirchi farmers. “Farmers should be supplied with seeds and fertilizers free of cost for their next crop and Rs. 10 lakh compensation should be given to the families of farmers who have committed suicide,” he demanded. Mr. Reddy said over 40,000 farmers had committed suicide under the TRS rule since 2014 and majority of them had not even received compensation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/save-chilli-farmers-from-suicide-revanth/article38075802.ece

31 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Cyclist pedals on for a noble cause||For 34-year-old Narpat Singh Rajpurohit, it has been a different kind of journey on a bicycle - spreading the message on importance of conservation and saving water across the length and breadth of the country. It all began in Jammu in 2019 January and so far he traversed a distance of 25,000 km - 5000 km more to reach his goal and be back in his hometown Jaipur. Life has never been easy for this spirited cyclist on a mission which should only inspire many and importantly has already planted about 91,000 saplings on his journey which touched most of the States except West Bengal. “Fortunately, the reception has been warm and very good to the cause for which I undertook the long road. The only problem was language in some places, but somehow I have been able to manage that issue also,” says Narpat Singh with a big smile in a chat with The Hindu during his transit halt in the city before leaving on Friday afternoon. And in Hyderabad, he made it a point to interact with the Forest Department officials to keep them informed of his ‘mission’. “The whole idea of what is said to be the longest bicycle tour for such a cause, under the guidance of India Foundation, is to see that the future generation doesn’t suffer for want of greenery and shortage of water,” says Narpat Singh. Family mission The sweet shop owner is not overtly perturbed at being away from his family - wife, son and daughter. “They understand my concern and are a part of my mission too,” he said. “Yes, the pandemic only made it a bit more expensive and gruelling as it also meant taking a break of seven months off the road,” Narpat Singh said defying multiple stitches on his legs and 10 percent disability. “I am not expecting any returns personally. It is all about reminding the importance of protecting trees and saving water. I will be glad if my journey helps in a small way,” he signed off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cyclist-pedals-on-for-a-noble-cause/article38075780.ece

31 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||KTR writes to Nirmala||Telangana Industries and IT Minister K. T. Rama Rao has appealed to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman not to take the proposal of increase in Goods and Services Tax on textiles and handlooms forward at the GST Council meeting scheduled for Friday. The Union government’s proposal to increase the GST from 5% to 12% from January 1, 2022, would sound the death knell of the industry and lakhs of people would lose their jobs, he said in a letter to the Finance Minister. The textile and handlooms sector was already bearing the brunt of the COVID-19 impact and the Union government had not provided any relief to the sector. Considering the scenario, the Centre should extend additional advantages and incentives to the sector. The increase in GST would compound the problems for the sector that was grappling with high cost of raw materials, yarn, chemicals, packaging material and transportation. “Production cost will escalate by 15-20% and this will adversely impact the demand. Due to this, there is the danger of many textiles and apparel units closing down and 15 lakh people losing jobs,” Mr.Rao said. Small shops to be hit The Telangana State Federation of Textile Associations said the increase in inputs and production cost had already resulted in job loss and wage cut. The proposed increase in GST would trigger a drop in consumption, forcing small traders to shut shop. Federation president Prakash Ammanabolu said that during the pandemic many small shops had closed and the GST increase would worsen the situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ktr-writes-to-nirmala/article38075798.ece

Only up to 50 per cent of the 9.85 lakh consumers of the water board have completed the Aadhaar linking process, while several others encountered major hiccups in carrying it out. The billing will resume from January 1 in non-slum areas, while the scheme will continue to be in operation subject to the guidelines issued by the government from time to time. Besides, the arrears pending for 13 months period before December, 2020 will not be levied with interest or penalty, and may be billed separately from the future bills, the orders said. Water cess already paid by the consumers during the period of waiver may be adjusted in the future bills, orders from the Municipal Administration & Urban Development department said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/water-board-to-waive-bills-of-domestic-users/article38075794.ece

31 December 2021||RAJANNA-SIRCILLA,TELANGANA||4 Omicron cases detected in Rajanna-Sircilla district||In the wake of detection of four Omicron cases in the district so far, the administration stepped up efforts to ramp up COVID-19 vaccination drive and improve access to RT-PCR testing as part of preventive measures to keep coronavirus, including the Omicron variant, at bay in the New Year. The district with a significant chunk of emigrants abroad reported four Omicron cases, including three from Gudem village in Mustabad mandal, and one from a village in Yellareddypet mandal, in the last one week. Among them are a Gulf returnee, his mother and wife. All the four persons infected with the Omicron variant are still undergoing treatment at the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) in Hyderabad. This has prompted the authorities to pay additional focus on around 17 foreign returnees, who are under home isolation in various parts of the district. Foreign returnees All the foreign returnees have been advised to self-isolate themselves in their homes for the stipulated two weeks despite their negative COVID-19 test reports, sources in the Health Department said. Teams of health functionaries have been deputed to record the health status reports of the foreign returnees under home isolation daily, sources added. Residents of Gudem village have been observing lockdown voluntarily ever since the first Omicron case was detected in the village a week ago. According to sources, nearly 4.19 lakh persons of the district’s total eligible adult population of 4.22 lakh have received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. However, a significant number of a little over 38,000 vaccine beneficiaries have not received their second doses even after the expiry of the prescribed interval period, sources added. The long-awaited State-run RT-PCR test centre is yet to become operational in the district headquarters town of Sircilla, a major textile hub. RT-PCR centre There have been persistent demands from various quarters for setting up of a RT-PCR centre under the aegis of the Health Department in Sircilla town to avoid delay in testing and facilitate quick diagnosis of COVID-19. Sources said that the civil works on the proposed RT-PCR Centre in Sircilla have already been completed and the requisite machine and other equipment are yet to be installed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/four-omicron-cases-surface-in-rajanna-sircilla/article38075787.ece

The Chief Minister also questioned Mr. Modi’s silence over hate speeches in Haridwar and Raipur recently, asking why has he not condemned the acts. Commenting on the BJP’s election campaign in U.P., Mr. Gehlot said the Prime Minister and the Home Minister have “left all work and camping in U.P.”. “They first faced a debacle in West Bengal and I think that the more they will do (campaigning), the less will be chances of their win as people understand everything,” he said. Questioning the PM’s silence over hate speeches, Mr. Gehlot said, “the message of the Prime Minister matters. Why does the Prime Minister not appeal. He should have condemned what happened in dharma sansad (Haridwar) and in Raipur.” “On one hand, you are adopting Gandhi and on the other, you are saying nothing on the kind of words which have been used about Mahatma. These two things cannot go along,” he said addressing the media. Commenting on the arrest of Hindu religious leader Kalicharan Maharaj for allegedly praising Mahatma Gandhi's killer Nathuram Godse in Raipur, Mr. Gehlot said people dare to say such things when such kind of atmosphere exists in the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/pms-campaign-in-up-to-shrink-bjps-chances-of-winning-polls-says-gehlot/article38075867.ece

31 December 2021||Mumbai,||Mumbai on alert for possible terror strike||In the wake of intelligence inputs that Khalistani elements may carry out a terror attack in Mumbai on the eve of New Year, the city police have beefed up security at prominent railway stations and other public places, and also cancelled the weekly offs and holidays of its personnel so that its entire strength remains available for duty, officials said on Thursday. “Police had received an input that Khalistani elements may carry out a terror attack in Mumbai on the eve of New Year,” a police official said. Hence, in order to maintain law and order situation, police are on alert and will be keeping a strict vigil across the city on December 31. Considering the possibility of people gathering at prominent places like the Gateway of India and Marine Drive to ring in the New Year, a large number of personnel will be deployed in the city, he said.  Weekly offs cancelled “We have cancelled the weekly offs as well as holidays of the police personnel for 'bandobast' duty on Friday,” he added. In the wake of emergence of the new Omicron variant of COVID-19, the Mumbai Police have prohibited New Year celebrations and gatherings in any closed or open space, including hotels and restaurants. The orders were issued on Wednesday under Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) Section 144 by Deputy Commissioner of Police (operations) S Chaitanya. “Mumbai police have prohibited all the new year gatherings and parties in closed and open places, there is a possibility that people may gather in small groups of not more than four persons,” the official said. In addition to the city police, the Government Railway Police (GRP) have also stepped up security at prominent railway stations considering the threat and anti-sabotage measures have been taken, another official said. In a tweet, Quaiser Khalid, Commissioner GRP Mumbai said, “In view of the covid 19 situation we advise people to adhere to government directions on the issue.” “We @grpmumbai have deployed large manpower for checking, frisking & anti-sabotage measures at important Rly Stn.

31 December 2021||Mumbai,||Activist Sudha Bharadwaj seeks NIA court’s nod to shift to Thane||Activist Sudha Bharadwaj, who recently obtained bail in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, on Thursday sought permission from the special NIA court here to live in neighbouring Thane instead of Mumbai. Ms. Bharadwaj was released from prison earlier this month after the Bombay High Court granted her bail. The special court for National Investigation Agency (NIA), while passing the release order, had said that she shall not leave Mumbai without permission. Ms. Bharadwaj’s plea said she wanted to shift to a friend’s place in Thane, as finding accommodation in Mumbai was expensive. In response, the prosecution said she should submit an affidavit of the person with whom she wished to live and residence proof. The activist’s petition will be heard on January 5. Meanwhile, all the arrested accused in the case were produced before special judge D.E. Kothalikar on Thursday. Activist and scholar Anand Teltumbde submitted a default bail plea. He also applied for medicines and medical check-up. Gautam Navlakha made an application for ‘jail mulaquat’ (meeting) with his partner, which the court granted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/activist-sudha-bharadwaj-seeks-nia-courts-nod-to-shift-to-thane/article38075665.ece

This was decided at a meeting of the State COVID-19 task force, attended by Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Speaking to reporters after a two-hour-long meeting of the task force, Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the government is planning to vaccinate students by taking them to vaccination centres in batches instead of giving them jabs within schools. “Even the Centre has not said anything about needing parents’ permission before giving vaccine shots to students. What we are doing is for the better health of students,” said Mr. Tope. The Minister said no decision on a lockdown has been taken. “Everyone was unanimous over the fact that crowded places should be avoided,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/will-vaccinate-students-in-batches/article38075862.ece

The body of the 41-year-old was found on Monday evening by passersby. “Prima facie it looked like there was sexual assault also and we had added section 376 of the IPC along with 302 (murder),” said sub divisional police officer (SDPO) Nilesh Tambe, Mahad division. The police used sniffer dogs and started questioning family members. During interrogation, the accused confessed to the crime, police said. The victim is a distant aunt and both used to fight over trivial family matters. On the day of the crime, he had gone to talk to her about some issue which led to a fight. The victim had gone to collect wood which she was carrying on her head. “In a fit of rage, he pulled out a stick from the bunch and hit her on the head. We suspect she was dragged into the bushes and sexually assaulted after he collapsed,” the police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/nephew-held-for-murder-of-woman/article38075865.ece
31 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Not allowed to board, commuters vandalise buses||A group of people and a police officer sustained injuries when commuters blocked MB Road in south Delhi’s Sangam Vihar and damaged a few DTC buses on Thursday morning after not being allowed to board them due to the passenger limit under the new COVID-19 guidelines. Under the ‘yellow alert’ announced by the Delhi government, buses can run with 50% of seating capacity (around 17 passengers) at a time. This has caused major inconvenience to commuters going to work via public transport. Police said around 8.15 a.m. on Thursday, several calls regarding a road blockade by the public near Jamia Hamdard on MB Road were received. On reaching the spot, they found some bus commuters sitting on the road as bus drivers and marshalls were not allowing more than 17 passengers to board the vehicles. The police team tried to convince the agitated public to allow the traffic to move but in vain. After a while, the protesters started vandalising the buses and broke windowpanes of four-five vehicles, the police said. In order to bring the situation under control, the protesters were removed with the help of female police personnel, Additional DCP M. Harsha Vardhan said. The police denied any lathicharge, but said mild force was used. In the process, one officer was injured, Mr. Vardhan said. An FIR has been registered and six persons, including two women, have been arrested, said the police. One juvenile has also been detained in connection with the incident. Opposition attacks govt. Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri accused the AAP government of not making proper arrangements for commuters. “The question is, how the public will reach their workplace? People have become helpless and are being forced to protest on the streets,” the LoP said. Commissioner-cum-Secretary, Transport, Ashish Kundra said the government would assess the demand of buses among commuters over the coming days. “In light of the current situation, we will induct more buses from private operators in a phased manner to address the increase in demand for buses,” Mr. Kundra said. Videos of the buses being vandalised are being circulated on social media wherein a green and a red air-conditioned bus can be seen with broken windshields. A conductor of one of the buses said they have instructions to allow only 17 commuters at a time. When there are 20 people, including the driver, conductor and marshal on the bus, they don’t stop it. “If we stop and more people enter the bus, we will be fined Rs. 2,000,” he said.  Sharing her ordeal while waiting for public transport, Krishna, a house help who commutes from Sultanpuri to Rajouri Garden daily, said now she has to wait for at least three-four buses before she is able to board one. “I get late to work every day and the wait for the bus is tiresome. But I hope public transport doesn’t stop. We won’t be able to survive another lockdown,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/not-allowed-to-board-commuters-vandalise-buses/article38075643.ece
31 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Landmark court rulings during the pandemic||An uncommon order by Justice Prathiba M. Singh kick-started the year. In January, she directed the Health Ministry to explore “crowdfunding”. It was to help two children — suffering from the rare Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy — procure exorbitantly priced medicines. Justice Singh noted that the high cost of medicines should not be a reason to deny treatment to patients, especially children. Even though the doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) felt the children were unlikely to show improvement after treatment, Justice Singh said it was incumbent on society and authorities to ensure that the life of children is not compromised, even if improving their chances of survival or providing a better quality of life is slim. ‘Right to Health and Healthcare’ is a fundamental right recognised by the Supreme Court as part of the ‘Right to life’ under Article 21 of the Constitution, Justice Singh remarked. She also directed the Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, to have a timeline for finalising and notifying the Draft Health Policy for Rare Diseases, 2020. A section in the draft policy stated that in cases where the government cannot fully finance the treatment, donations can be sought for meeting the high expenses of treating rare diseases. On March 30 this year, the ‘National Policy for Rare Diseases, 2021’ was approved by the Centre. Arrest for tax evasion In the same month, a two-judge Bench upheld a controversial provision in the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act that gives power to the authorities to arrest any person if there is a “reason to believe” that he has committed tax evasion. However, Justice Manmohan and Justice Sanjeev Narula underlined that any person arrested under the CGST Act will have to be apprised of the grounds for arrest and be produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours. The Centre had pointed out that several bogus firms had fraudulently availed of IGST refunds and ITC credits that had caused substantial loss to the exchequer. Court order halted Justice C. Hari Shankar restrained a foreign court from pursuing its cause before the Indian judiciary. In a strongly worded judgment passed in May, he halted the enforcement of an order passed by the Wuhan Intermediate People’s Court in September 2020, disallowing U.S. firm InterDigital Technology Corporation, from pursuing a patent infringement case against Chinese tech giant Xiaomi Corporation. On the case filed here, Justice Shankar said, “The right of a citizen for legal redressal and to ventilate his legitimate rights, is hallowed, sacred, and fundamental in this country.” Proclaimed offender In one of his last judgments before retirement in June, Justice J.R. Midha ruled that any private person can arrest a ‘proclaimed offender’ and hand him over to the police without unnecessary delay. He laid down guidelines to be followed by the courts before declaring a person a ‘proclaimed offender’ and the follow-up action needed to be taken by the law enforcement agencies. He directed the Delhi Police and the Central Bureau of Investigation to create a special cell for tracking down ‘proclaimed offenders’ and attaching their movable or immovable properties for prosecution. According to Delhi Police records, there are 26,532 ‘proclaimed offenders’ as on September 31, 2019. Justice Midha said names, addresses and pictures of ‘proclaimed offenders’ be made public on different government websites (such as Delhi Police, National Crime Records Bureau, CBI ) and help be sought to trace them. Rent payment for poor In an unprecedented judgment, Justice Prathiba M. Singh directed Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to keep his promise, made in a press conference, that his government would pay the rent for those who are unable to pay it due to poverty in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic. “The promise/assurance/representation given by the CM clearly amounts to an enforceable promise, the implementation of which ought to be considered by the government,” Justice Singh ruled in July. He remarked that the Chief Minister cannot first make a “clear and unequivocal oral assurance” and then fall silent when it comes to implementation. During the mass exodus of migrant workers from the city following the nationwide lockdown in March 2020, Mr. Kejriwal had announced that if any tenant is unable to pay rent due to job loss, his government would pay the rent on their behalf. The Chief Minister had also assured the landlords that his government would reimburse them if the tenants failed to pay the rent. Another Bench of the High Court has stayed Justice Singh’s judgment following the Delhi government’s appeal against the order, claiming no indiscriminate and unconditional assurance for payment of rent was made by Mr. Kejriwal. Stray dogs feeding A slew of directions on the contentious issue of feeding stray dogs came in July from Justice Midha. He remarked that every stray or street dog had the right to food and citizens have the right to feed them. But in exercising this right, care and caution should be taken to ensure that it does not impinge upon the rights of others, he said. “Every dog is a territorial being, and therefore, have to be fed and tended to at places within their territory which are not frequented, or less frequented, and sparingly used by the general public,” Justice Midha added and directed Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) to form ‘Guard and Dog partnerships’ in consultation with the Delhi Police Dog Squad, so that the dogs could be trained to be guard dogs. The High Court also ruled that it should be “the duty and obligation of every RWA or municipal corporation to ensure that community dogs in all areas have access to food and water in the absence of their caregivers”. He also made it mandatory to feed the dogs only at areas designated by the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) in consultation with the RWAs or municipal corporation. Virtual registration In another landmark decision in September, Justice Rekha Palli ruled that marriages could be registered in the virtual presence of parties. “In a little over half a decade, since the Registration Order was notified, the universe has undergone a sea change but the Registering Authority, while exercising its power and jurisdiction under the Registration Order, is refusing to recognise the reality that with the technology is available today, web portals and videoconferencing have become the norm,” Justice Palli said. She said if videoconferencing was not accepted as the norm, then courts in the country would have come to a grinding halt and not been able to function when the citizens of the country needed access to justice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/landmark-court-rulings-during-the-pandemic/article38075652.ece
31 December 2021||New Delhi,||Over 3,200 beds to be set up for children requiring treatment||The Delhi government will create over 3,200 beds, including ICU beds, exclusively for children requiring COVID-19 treatment in the Capital. In all, 37,000 dedicated COVID beds, over 10,000 COVID ICU beds, 2,300 paediatric COVID beds and 900 COVID paediatric ICU beds are part of the government’s bid to ramp up medical infrastructure to confront any medical eventualities that may arise, sources said. A significant number of these beds will be created at 15 hospitals, six civic hospitals and COVID care centres set up by the Delhi government. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has, on more than one occasion since the virus cases began rising this month, said that the Delhi government had chalked out a plan to increase hospital infrastructure in the city. Hospitals under the Central government as well as private hospitals too will host these beds, the official added. Specialised COVID facilities at sports complexes and banquet halls will house 7,777 COVID beds and 1,200 COVID ICU beds. No paediatric beds will be crafted at these facilities. According to Health Department records, the occupancy of COVID beds and oxygen-supported COVID beds has grown gradually this month. The occupancy of dedicated COVID beds gradually increased at city hospitals over the last month with 111 of these occupied on December 1 and 280 till December 28.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/over-3200-beds-to-be-set-up-for-children-requiring-treatment/article38075646.ece
31 December 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi govt. orders 42 lakh antigen kits||The Delhi government has placed an order for 42 lakh rapid antigen test (RAT) kits, used to detect COVID-19, for increasing the number of tests per day, an official told The Hindu . The government received about two lakh kits by Wednesday, the official said. The government was running low on stock of these kits and about 6,000-7,000 tests using RAT were being done daily for nearly a month. This is now likely to increase to over 15,000, he added.  “The government had decided to do 70% of total tests using RT-PCR and rest 30% using RAT, but for almost a month, about 85% tests were being done using RT-PCR,” the official said. For instance, as per Wednesday’s bulletin, 10.4% of the tests were done using RAT kits.  With a spike in fresh COVID-19 cases in the city, the Centre has told the Delhi government to enhance the testing in a focused manner, while maintaining a ratio between RT-PCR and RAT. While RT-PCR gives more accurate results, RAT is quick as it returns results in 15-30 minutes, is cheap, and does not rely on laboratory and expensive equipment to carry out testing. But compared to RT-PCR, RAT has low sensitivity and is more prone to give false-negative results.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-govt-orders-42-lakh-antigen-kits/article38075657.ece
31 December 2021||New Delhi,||‘Civic hospital building a disaster in waiting’||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday alleged that the BJP was “ruthlessly” playing with the lives of people as treatment of patients was going on in North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run Rajan Babu Hospital despite the building being declared “dangerous”. “The hospital building is a disaster in waiting,” said AAP leader Atishi. Responding to the allegation, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said AAP was trying to malign the image of the hospital for “petty party politics”. “The truth is that the front portion of the building, which is actually a covered verandah, has depleted and [was] recently declared dangerous while three-fourth of the building, which houses hospital wards, is safe and habitable,” he said. In a video shot outside the building, Ms. Atishi showed a sign that read “warning, there is a dangerous building ahead. This way is closed”. She claimed that the board was put up by the municipal corporation and yet patients were being treated in the building. “By looking at this hospital today, one can see the BJP’s lust for money. They have abandoned the people of Delhi to die,” she said. Responding to the allegations, North nunicipal corporation’s Standing Committee Chairman Jogi Ram Jain said two blocks at the hospital were under repair and patients were not undergoing treatment there. He said that the signboards declaring the building as “unsafe” were misleading. “The buildings that were mentioned are block number 9, which is completely shut while block number 14 is partially shut. Previously, our engineering department had permitted repair work at these blocks. We are also awaiting a survey report of the hospital by a team from IIT Roorkee,.

In the revised SOPs, the police said immunity booster kits and COVID protection kits are being arranged for distribution as and when required. Liaison Officers are required to get in touch with local hospitals and reserve beds for police personnel, in case the need arises. Quarantine rooms are also being arranged for those staying outside Delhi, they said. The officer, who had gone to London to extradite alleged drug supplier Harvinder Singh, is the first case of ‘Omicron’ infection in the Delhi police. He was accompanied by two others who are also under home isolation, the police said. During their return to India, the police team and Singh underwent COVID-19 screening both at London’s Heathrow airport and the Delhi airport. They reached Delhi on December 24. Singh will be sent to police custody after completion of his quarantine period, police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/city-police-revise-sops-as-cases-rise/article38075658.ece
31 December 2021||New Delhi,||Omicron spreading in community, but mild symptoms: Delhi Minister||Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday said the Omicron variant of COVID-19 is now spreading in the community in Delhi, but most patients have mild symptoms. “Forty-six per cent of (COVID-19) infections are Omicron cases, as per genome sequencing. This includes people with and without travel history... It (Omicron variant) is slowly spreading in the community,” he said. Later in the day, the Delhi government revised the percentage of Omicron cases to 54, according to the latest report. “None of the hospitalised patients have required oxygen till now. However, the more serious problem is that the infection is spreading much faster than the Delta variant. Most of the patients are having very subtle symptoms of COVID-19 and they do not need to be hospitalised,” Mr. Jain said. The Minister urged citizens to wear masks and follow social distancing norms. The Delhi government has created four COVID Care Centres for international travellers who test positive at the airport and their contacts, according to an official order. Three of them are free and the fourth one is a hotel, which is a paid facility. Currently, Delhi has level 1 of the Graded Response Action Plan and the Minister said the decision on announcing level 2 alert will be taken by the DDMA. Doctors’ advice Senior doctors have cautioned that there is a need to remain watchful as a “community spread” of Omicron can strain hospitals. Dr. Piyush Jain, Medicine Department, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, said, “Data from some foreign countries show that the Omicron variant causes mild infection in most of the cases. But we do not have the data from India yet.” However, it can still put the elderly and those having comorbidities at serious risk. Dr. Jugal Kishore, head of Community Medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said people who are “immunocompromised, or have HIV or secondary infections need to take care of themselves and not step out... take regular medications and monitor their sleep cycle.” Sumit Ray, head of the Department of Critical Care Medicine at Holy Family Hospital, said the sheer number of Omicron cases can overwhelm hospitals.

Strict action will be taken against those violating the guidelines, they said. Those found indulging in drunk-driving or harassing females will be prosecuted, police said, adding they have put their force on toes with respect to anti-terror measures. The measures include ensuring strict following of night curfew and intense patrolling in areas such as Connaught Place, Chanakyapuri, Hauz Khas among other areas known for being party hubs.

31 December 2021||New Delhi,||HC refuses plea against book ‘demeaning Islam’||The Delhi High Court has refrained from entertaining a lawsuit filed by a man against an online self-published book titled Muhammad , which allegedly makes derogatory statements against Islam, the Holy Koran and Prophet Mohammed. The court noted that the litigant failed to show an infringement of his personal legal right. Justice Sanjeev Narula said that “in the absence of disclosure of infringement of any legal right, the plaintiff’s prayer seeking injunction and damages on account of being offended or aggrieved by the contents of a book – which allegedly is hurtful to his religious sentiments – would not give him any right to approach this court by way of the present suit”. Qamar Hasnain, in his plea, had sought to recall all copies of the book purportedly authored by Syed Waseem Rizvi and to destroy all copies. Mr. Hasnain, who claimed to be a religious scholar and a concerned follower of Islam, also sought a direction to remove all objectionable posts and comments related to the book from social media. He contended that the contents of the book were offensive, hateful and distressing to even a casual reader, let alone a follower of Islam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-refuses-plea-against-book-demeaning-islam/article38075664.ece

31 December 2021||Pune,||New Year celebrations banned in Mumbai, Section 144 extended||With COVID-19 cases rising at an alarming rate in Mumbai city, the police authorities have extended the imposition of Section 144 of the CrPC over the city till January 7 while banning New Year celebrations in both public and private spaces. The order, issued by DCP (operations) S. Chaitanya late on Wednesday, came into effect on Thursday. The new directive prohibits celebrations and gatherings in any closed or open space, including hotels and restaurants, bars and pubs and disallows booking for boats and banquet halls for parties on the night of December 31 in Mumbai. Hotels and above establishments, are, however, permitted to remain open till 12:30 a.m. for dine-in facilities with the caveat that they maintain 50% occupancy and ensure that the staff are vaccinated. Delivery by e-platforms like Swiggy and Zomato and direct food orders from restaurants will be allowed. The order states that violations shall be liable for punishment under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC and provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act. With the State government’s repeated appeals to ensure low-key celebrations, authorities have further urged the public to avoid crowding at popular places like the Marine Drive, Juhu Beach and the Gateway of India as well as parks and gardens. Home Minister Dilip Walse-Patil, speaking in Mumbai, warned that strict action would be taken against those violating COVID-19 norms. Asked about the large crowds gathering at the weddings of the kin of the politicos, Mr. Walse-Patil said: “What applies to ordinary citizens, is binding on politicians as well. I appeal to people to celebrate the New Year by staying at home.” Record jump in cases Mumbai had recorded a staggering 82% jump in cases on Wednesday reporting more than 2,500 cases as opposed to the 1,333 it reported on Tuesday, taking the active cases to over 14,000. The city reported the highest cases in Maharashtra and in the country. A day after NCP MP Supriya Sule and her family tested positive, more politicians including senior BJP leaders Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil and Harshavardhan Patil too did so.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/new-year-celebrations-banned-in-mumbai-section-144-extended/article38075872.ece
31 December 2021||Pune,||Court quashes MLA’s anticipatory bail, BJP cries foul||A local court in Sindhudurg district on Thursday quashed the anticipatory bail plea of Kankavli MLA and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Nitesh Rane, the son of Union Minister Narayan Rane — in an attempt to murder case. The court gave its decision after a marathon two-day hearing, amid a tense stand-off between Shiv Sena and the BJP supporters of the Rane family outside the courtroom. A week earlier, a Kankavli resident named Santosh Parab had filed a police complaint claiming he was assaulted by certain persons linked with the Kankavli MLA. Mr. Rane’s lawyer said they were likely to move the Bombay High Court at the earliest. Mr. Nitesh Rane has been incommunicado for over four days now and police teams have been formed to trace and arrest him. The court’s quashing of Nitesh’s bail plea was followed by riotous celebrations on part of Sena workers, who burst firecrackers and proclaimed that the stranglehold of the Rane family in Sindhudurg was now shaken. The incident is being viewed as yet another acrimonious chapter in the bitter, long-running personal feud between the Thackeray and the Rane families, and in a larger context, the power struggle between the Shiv Sena and the BJP in the Konkan region. Notice to Narayan Rane The Sindhudurg police on Wednesday had issued a notice to Narayan Rane, who is the Union Minister of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises , to present his MLA son Nitesh before the police in connection to allegedly ‘murder’ the complainant Parab. The senior Rane was also asked to be present himself at Kankavli police station (in Sindhudurg district) to record his statement in connection with the case, which the Union Minister did not do so. Following which, the police apparently pasted the notice at Mr. Rane’s residence. The Union Minister accused the ruling Shiv Sena of behaving with malice towards his son, remarking on Wednesday at a press conference that “he was not a fool to reveal Nitesh’s whereabouts" and that “no big crime” had taken place and nor was his son “a terrorist”. Devendra Fadnavis, the BJP’s Leader of Opposition, lashed out against the Maha Vikas Aghadi government for its ‘vendetta politics’ against Mr. Rane and Nitesh Rane, while asserting that the Sindhudurg police could not demand that a person over 65 years of age (Mr. Rane) present himself at police station.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/court-quashes-mlas-anticipatory-bail-bjp-cries-foul/article38075870.ece
31 December 2021||Samastipur (Bihar),||FIR registered against RJD’s Tej Pratap Yadav||An FIR has been registered against Rashtriya Janata Dal MLA Tej Pratap Yadav for allegedly not disclosing details of his property in the affidavit filed during the 2020 Assembly elections in Bihar, police said on Thursday. Rosera sub-divisional officer Brajesh Kumar lodged a complaint against YMr. adav, the elder son of party supremo Lalu Prasad, for suppressing details of his property in Gopalganj, a senior officer said. “The FIR was registered on Wednesday at Rosera Police Station under Section 125 (a) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 for hiding property details in the affidavit,” he said. The ruling Janata Dal (United) had in November 2020 filed a complaint with the chief electoral officer in Bihar, alleging that the RJD legislator from Hasanpur did not mention details of his assets in the affidavit.  CBDT probe The Election Commission of India had subsequently asked the Central Board of Direct Taxes to conduct a probe into the JD(U)’s allegations, an official said. The CBDT found a “manifold increase in value of Yadav'’ movable and immovable assets between 2015 and 2020”, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/fir-registered-against-rjds-tej-pratap-yadav/article38075864.ece

31 December 2021||HONG KONG/COLOMBO,||China Minister to visit Maldives, Sri Lanka||Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will begin the new year visiting five littoral countries in the Indian Ocean Region, including the Maldives and Sri Lanka, underlining China’s growing economic and security stakes in the neighbourhood. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Thursday Mr. Wang would on January 4 begin his five-nation trip in eastern Africa, visiting Eritrea and Kenya, before travelling to the island nation of Comoros, followed by the Maldives and Sri Lanka. “The upcoming visit to the three countries in Africa is keeping up the Chinese Foreign Ministers’ 32-year tradition of choosing Africa for their first overseas visit every year,” spokesperson Zhao Lijian said, adding that the visit to the Maldives and Sri Lanka “comes at the 50th anniversary of China-Maldives diplomatic relations, the 65th anniversary of China-Sri Lanka diplomatic relations, and the 70th anniversary of the Rubber-Rice Pact” between China and Sri Lanka. “China and the two countries are traditional friendly neighbours and important partners with close high-level exchange, deep practical cooperation, broad common interests, and the same or similar positions on many regional and international issues,” he said. “We will work together with the two countries to build on the momentum generated by commemorating the anniversaries of diplomatic relations to deepen traditional friendship, enhance political mutual trust, strengthen solidarity against COVID-19, upgrade practical cooperation, including under the Belt and Road Initiative framework, and increase coordination and cooperation in international and regional affairs.” Official sources in Colombo indicated that the visit would focus on ongoing projects and investments, while Colombo and Beijing try to iron out some differences. It would entail a possible MoU in the maritime sector, sources said. A senior official at the Beijing-based Sri Lankan Embassy told The Hindu that “it is a courtesy visit”. During the pandemic, China has provided substantial assistance to Sri Lanka by way of emergency loans, totalling over $1 billion, a currency swap for $1.5 billion, and vaccines with Sinopharm accounting for more than 80% of the vaccines administered in Sri Lanka. Beijing has maintained regular, high-level engagement with Colombo since the pandemic struck. In October 2020, a “high-powered” Chinese delegation” led by Polit Bureau member and top foreign policy official Yang Jiechi was in Colombo, while China’s Defence Minister General Wei Fenghe visited Sri Lanka in April this year. Points of difference Mr. Wang’s visit to Sri Lanka assumes particular significance, coming after rare bouts of tension between the partners who otherwise share very strong ties, evident in three recent points of difference. In February 2021, Sri Lanka cleared a Chinese energy project in three islands off Jaffna peninsula, not far from the Tamil Nadu coast, following an international bid. However, Colombo suspended it after India raised concern and offered an alternative grant for the same. Further, the Colombo-based Chinese Ambassador’s recent visit to Jaffna has drawn criticism from the Tamil leadership. In May, the passage of the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill, governing the China-backed Colombo Port City project worth $1.4 billion, triggered considerable resistance, with government critics describing the project as a “Chinese enclave” within the island nation. The most recent controversy involved Sri Lanka rejecting a shipment of organic fertilizer imported from China due to reported “contamination”. The Chinese side responded by blacklisting Sri Lanka’s state-owned People’s Bank, while the Chinese company has sought $8 million in compensation and sued Sri Lanka in a Singapore court over the deal. Colombo has maintained that this was a “commercial dispute” that did not impact diplomatic ties. It is, however, likely to figure on the agenda during the Minister’s trip. Mr. Wang’s visit to Maldives, meanwhile, coincides with a heightening “India out” campaign being mounted by the political Opposition, accusing President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih’s government of “allowing Indian military presence” in the island nation, a charge that the ruling administration has denied.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-minister-to-visit-maldives-sri-lanka/article38075096.ece

The call, which will take place as tensions continue between Russia and Ukraine, was requested by Mr. Putin, according to the Biden administration officials, and will focus on several dialogues the two countries are scheduled to participate next month. During Thursday’s interaction, “President Biden will make clear that there is a diplomatic path to de-escalating tensions in the region if President Putin is interested in taking it”, a senior administration official, who did not want to be named, told reporters on a Wednesday briefing call. The U.S. and Russia are scheduled to hold a bilateral Strategic Stability Dialogue on January 10 in Geneva. However, Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin will not personally participate in those discussions, the official said. A NATO-Russia Council meeting is scheduled for January 12, and talks between Moscow and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe on January 13. Russia has massed about 1,00,000 troops along the border with Ukraine, according to Ukraine and the West’s estimates. Mr. Biden would tell Mr. Putin that the U.S. and its allies were “prepared for diplomacy and for a diplomatic path forward, but we are also prepared to respond if Russia advances with a further invasion of Ukraine”, the official said. Ukraine had proposed short-term confidence-building measures with Russia, including a recommitment to a 2020 ceasefire, the official said. The U.S was also “prepared to discuss security and strategic matters” that have been the topic of private and public discussion recently. Russia had published on December 17 a draft security agreement, in which it had proposed that NATO should not accept Ukraine and former Soviet countries as members (a demand rejected by the West). It also suggested that NATO refrain from sending weapons and troops to countries that joined the alliance after May 1997.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/amid-ukraine-crisis-biden-putin-to-hold-another-call/article38075098.ece
31 December 2021||Tehran,||Iran announces new space launch amid nuclear talks||Iran announced on Thursday it has carried out a new space launch, in a move likely to irk Western powers amid tough talks on reviving a 2015 nuclear deal. Tehran successfully put its first military satellite into orbit in April 2020, drawing a sharp rebuke from Washington. Western governments worry that satellite launch systems incorporate technologies interchangeable with those used in ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead. ‘Civilian purposes’ Iran insists its space programme is for civilian and defence purposes only, and does not breach the nuclear deal or any other international agreement. UN Security Council Resolution 2231 of 2015, endorsing the nuclear deal, imposed no blanket ban on Iranian rocket or missile launches. Iran’s state broadcaster aired footage of a rocket rising from a desert launchpad, but gave no details of its location. “The Simorgh (Phoenix) satellite launcher carried three research cargoes into space,” said Defence Ministry spokesman Ahmad Hosseini. “The research goals foreseen for this launch have been achieved,” he added, quoted by state television. Earlier this month, the U.S. media reported that preparations for a launch were under way at Iran’s space centre in Semnan, 300 kilometres east of Tehran. Mr. Hosseini did not elaborate on the nature of the research, but he said the latest operation was a “preliminary launch” and that more would follow.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iran-announces-new-space-launch-amid-nuclear-talks/article38075090.ece

The order, tweeted on Thursday by group spokesman Mohammad Naeem, also urged Taliban authorities to discourage Afghans from leaving the country as they would not be respected abroad. “Don’t punish employees of the previous regime for their past crimes,” Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada was quoted as telling followers in Kandahar. The Taliban chief — who has not been filmed or photographed in public for years — said a general amnesty announced in August should be honoured. The Taliban are accused by the UN, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch of dozens of extrajudicial killings of members of the former security forces and administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taliban-chief-orders-fighters-not-to-punish-former-regime-members/article38075092.ece
31 December 2021||New York,||British socialite convicted in Epstein sex abuse case||British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted on Wednesday of luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by the late American financier Jeffrey Epstein. The verdict capped a month-long trial featuring sordid accounts of the sexual exploitation of girls as young as 14, told by four women who described being abused as teens in the 1990s and early 2000s at the millionaire Epstein’s palatial homes in Florida, New York and New Mexico. Jurors deliberated for five full days before finding Maxwell guilty of five of six counts. With the maximum prison terms for each charge ranging from five to 40 years in prison, Maxwell faces the likelihood of years behind bars — an outcome long sought by women who spent years fighting in civil courts to hold her accountable for her role in recruiting and grooming Epstein’s teenage victims and sometimes joining in the sexual abuse.  One of her victims, Annie Farmer, said she was grateful that the jury recognised Maxwell’s “pattern of predatory behaviour”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/british-socialite-convicted-in-epstein-sex-abuse-case/article38075094.ece

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Should vaccination be made mandatory?||It is going to be almost a year since vaccination against COVID-19 was rolled out in India for the adult population. In the midst of this massive drive, there have been numerous challenges including vaccine hesitancy and shortage in supplies. The latest issue is that some States have come up with their own strategies to ensure wider vaccination coverage — such as by making vaccination mandatory for entry into public places and workplaces — even though the Central Government has maintained that vaccination is voluntary. In a conversation moderated by Serena Josephine M. , K. Kolandaswamy and G.R. Ravindranath discuss whether vaccination should be made mandatory. Edited excerpts: What is your assessment of India’s overall vaccination performance so far? During the initial days, there was vaccine hesitancy and there were supply issues. Do you think we could have done better in terms of creating awareness among the people? K. Kolandaswamy:I think the COVID-19 vaccination programme is going on well. These are new vaccines, and perhaps for the first time, the whole population is getting vaccinated in such a short duration. The issues in vaccine supplies and logistics have been rectified now. The vaccination drive was done in a phased manner. We started with healthcare workers, frontline workers, then persons aged 60 years and above, then persons aged 45-plus with co-morbidities, and finally, persons above 18 years. There is reasonable vaccination coverage across the country. I think more than 142 crore doses have been administered in India, of which 8.2 crore doses have been administered in Tamil Nadu. But the last mile reach has become a challenge, particularly among the 50-plus population who have either received the first dose but are reluctant to get their second dose or have not received even their first dose yet. It is important to reach out to people who are still reluctant to get vaccinated. I feel we need to intensify efforts to educate people and take other approaches to reach out to them. We can enforce legal measures as well. G.R. Ravindranath:Not only awareness, but also factors such as availability, accessibility and acceptability are important. We had problems with all these factors in the initial stages. There was vaccine hesitancy initially. Compared to some developed countries, India’s vaccination coverage is poor. Many countries are moving towards booster doses, but we have not completed vaccination of all the eligible persons with even the first dose of the vaccine. Almost 23% of healthcare and frontline workers are yet to get their second dose in India. This is a huge crisis in public health as they will have to treat patients in case of a third wave. Even in Tamil Nadu, one crore eligible persons are yet to take the first dose, while 93 lakh are due/overdue for their second dose. Governments should have promoted scientific awareness and ensured accessibility. So, we have a lot more to do. Anti-vaxxers are actively spreading a lot of rumours, pseudoscience and unscientific information. Rumours are spread on social media and through WhatsApp. So, we have a big task at hand. The government should make vaccination a people’s movement by involving people from all walks of life. Is it feasible to make vaccination mandatory? Historically, have governments made any vaccination programme mandatory? Some States are aiming at 100% coverage. Is this possible? KK:Yes, it is feasible. I can claim to have the right to not get vaccinated but others are at risk of getting infected by me. So, my right ends when someone else’s right starts. Rather than the individual’s right, the community’s right, safety and health are top priority. In a classic example, smallpox, a dreaded disease, was eradicated by making vaccination compulsory from 1965 to 1975. Across the country, COVID-19 has been declared a notifiable disease under different Acts of the States or the Epidemic Diseases Act. In Tamil Nadu, the State government declared it a notifiable disease under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act of 1939. So, local health authorities have the power to make vaccination mandatory under Section 76. If anyone seeks exemption, they will have to approach the Judicial Magistrate. They cannot refuse to get vaccinated unless on acceptable medical grounds; unless vaccination could endanger their lives, which is very rare. So, enforcing legal measures to make people get vaccinated is highly feasible. GRR:It is possible to achieve 100% vaccination by intensifying campaigns, promoting vaccination and putting indirect pressure on the people. Some cities have already achieved 100% coverage (first dose). We have to study such models. The Nilgiris district model in Tamil Nadu is one. Many countries have made vaccination compulsory. Tamil Nadu has made vaccination mandatory for entry into public places. The rights of an individual can be curtailed for the rights of the community. During a pandemic, we have to look at the community’s rights. But we ought to come up with counter campaigns against anti-vaxxers who are spreading several rumours such as ‘vaccines could produce infertility’ or ‘vaccines could alter the DNA in the body’. We need to educate people about the importance of getting vaccinated — we need to tell them that it is a powerful weapon against the pandemic and will prevent severe disease, hospitalisation and death. A vaccine not only protects the individual but also safeguards others. Vaccination has brought in several changes in our lives. It has eradicated smallpox. Polio should be eradicated soon. Millions of children have been protected due to vaccination. The Central government has maintained that vaccination is voluntary, while noting that any misconceived doubts could result in vaccine hesitancy. Do you think governments have created adequate awareness on vaccines and their possible adverse effects? There are still some who fear vaccines. Has enough trust been built among the people? KK:The vaccination coverage achieved so far would not have been possible but for the education, awareness and trust built among people. At the same time, we should further educate people in a very focussed manner. Governments and health departments are taking adequate measures but we can still list out these population sub-groups and take up targeted efforts to create awareness. We need to focus on educating people and make sure that 100% immunisation is achieved. This may take a little more time. In public health, we believe in the education and service approach much more than the legal approach. At the same time, legal measures could be used appropriately — by restricting entry, incentives or disincentives — to convince people to get vaccinated. Rumour-mongering groups and anti-vaccine lobbies must be dealt with seriously, and legal action should be taken against them. GRR:Steps to create awareness have been taken by governments but they are inadequate. There should be innovative and creative advertisements in the media to draw people towards vaccination. We can take up door-to-door campaigns with local groups. In some districts, they have achieved complete vaccination by involving local people for campaigns. Panchayat leaders, ward members and women from self-help groups should be first made aware and then educate the public. We have to make a lot of effort to promote vaccines. There are aggressive campaigns against vaccines. We have to rely on science. Let’s look at vaccine equity and access. Has vaccination reached even the remotest villages in the country? KK:Yes. We have come across several video clippings of healthcare workers travelling to inaccessible and remote places such as hillocks and forest areas. Initially, we had issues in the availability of vaccines and logistics. These issues have been solved gradually. Accessibility and availability have been fully addressed. Now the real challenge is to reach the reluctant population. GRR:Eligible persons should be vaccinated by the middle of next year. For this, vaccine equity is very important. Many Western and developed countries have more vaccines than they require and are wasting/stockpiling vaccines, while low-economic countries do not have sufficient vaccines. In fact, only less than 20% have been vaccinated in low-economic countries. This is a huge problem and will create a lot of new strains or variants in the future. This is why the World Health Organization has stated that instead of giving booster shots to all, we must provide two doses of vaccines to all the eligible people across the world. Developed countries have a big role to play. They should understand their responsibilities and the problems faced by developing and low-economic countries. The COVAX programme should be respected. All countries producing adequate vaccines must supply them to the COVAX programme of the WHO. India has a lot of manufacturing capacity. So, the government should take measures, and also involve public sector companies in vaccine production. Do you think there is transparency on reporting adverse events following immunisation in the country? KK:Reporting of adverse events is systematically done at the primary, sub-centre, block and district levels. There are various committees that include specialists who go through the reports. I strongly believe that adverse events following immunisation are reported in a transparent manner. There is no need for any doubt on the reporting of adverse events following immunisation and the safety of vaccines. People who have any fears can get vaccinated in a larger facility where there are many doctors and emergency services. What should be the way ahead in promoting vaccination among people? GR:Governments should come up with advertisements on television or newspapers. There should be adequate stock of vaccines, while newer vaccines should be introduced. We should vaccinate children, while booster doses should be administered to the eligible population. We must increase vaccine production and supply for poor countries to end the pandemic. Governments should provide incentives for people who get vaccinated. Building the confidence of people is very important. KK:The focus should be on educating people by involving doctors, community influencers such as religious leaders, political leaders, panchayat leaders and other influential groups, frontline and healthcare workers. I think we can promote vaccines by putting social and legal pressure on the reluctant population and taking stringent action against anti-vaxxers. If full vaccination is achieved in the next few months, and we consider vaccinating children, the overall incidence of COVID-19 will come down.  The rights of an individual can be curtailed for the rights of the community. But we ought to come up with counter campaigns against anti-vaxxers who are spreading rumours. G.R.

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Barriers to a knowledge society in Kerala||Even as leaders of the dispensation that presently governs Kerala have repeatedly spoken of their intention of transforming the State into a “knowledge society”, a public spat broke out between the Governor and the Chief Minister. This concerned the governance of the State’s higher education sector. Far from this being seen as a source of embarrassment, it should be welcomed as an opportunity to ensure that the Government’s ambition is fulfilled. Particularly as it comes soon after the Kerala government constituted three Commissions to recommend ways to improve higher education. No mirror to society It is customary when discussing the state of higher education in India to wring our hands at poorly educated youth, devoid of analytical ability and communication skills, lacking in an understanding of India’s past, unmindful of their role in the success of democracy and certified by companies as “unemployable”. While all of this is applicable to Kerala, arguably, the production of employable youth is not the principal task of a university. A society maintains universities so that they hold a mirror up to it, in which it is able to discern itself, warts and all. It is in this role that Kerala’s universities fail the most. The State faces challenges on multiple fronts. Its economic future is tenuous as remittance from West Asia begins to slow. Its ecological security is threatened by the assault on the earth to extract stone for the construction of luxury homes that signal social status. Its record of gender equality is questioned when we see the abysmally poor representation of women in decision-making bodies, itself related to the masculinist culture of its political parties. Its commitment to democracy is moot when religious interests and a small minority of the working class behave with scant regard for those outside their fold. Now, most societies have their vested interests but they also have independent intellectuals, often based in the university, who call them out. Where is Kerala’s Noam Chomsky, or Medha Patkar? We do not have to agree with them to see how important a role they play in securing the democratic space free of commercial and religious interests and the dictates of political parties. The last time Kerala had one of its own critique its elites was when Arundhati Roy wrote her debut novel almost a quarter century ago. Predictably, there had been the response that ‘religious sentiments’ were hurt by it. A knowledge society can exist only if religion is kept at bay, for, historically, organised religion has stood in the way of the revelation of secular truth. Where, we may ask, are our universities when it comes to drawing attention to the tenuousness of Kerala’s economic prospects, its high consumption inequality, its grim ecological future and its religion-and-patriarchy-sodden civil society? Left’s error Neither of Kerala’s political fronts has any answer to the pathetic state of its universities. A fatal error of the Left political parties in Kerala is to have worked to undermine excellence and encouraged the illusion of the possibility of unbounded material consumption without regard for productivity. It is instructive that Russia soon after the Revolution was the site of high creativity both in the arts and agriculture, and its people were encouraged to think of the country as their cherished motherland. Not even Stalin’s ruthless suppression of freedom could stamp this out. The Red Army reached Berlin first in 1945 and Khrushchev gave the Americans a fright by sending a human being to outer space. None of this could have been achieved without the concerted application of high intelligence and the expectation that everyone in society pull their weight. This is something decidedly missing in the approach of the Kerala Left, who seem to aspire for little beyond pension spread thinly across the population and condiment kits handed out through the Public Distribution System, even as the State cries out for solutions to its problems of polluted rivers, destabilised hills and accumulating household and industrial waste. Congress empowered groups While the Left’s contribution to the decline of the university was more the collateral damage of its obsession with levelling down the population, the Congress, which constitutes the greater part of the alternative to the Left political parties, has had a more direct role in the decline of not just higher education but education itself. This the Congress has done by empowering caste and religious groups who virtually “own” educational institutions. The original sin, so to speak, was committed in the late 1950s when the Congress party encouraged these groups to oppose the educational reforms initiated by the government of E.M.S. Namboodiripad. It is not obvious that his Education Minister, Joseph Mundassery, was particularly concerned with academic excellence but he could see the pernicious influence of these communal groups. The staged agitations that followed were used by Jawaharlal Nehru, in a disappointingly partisan act, to dismiss a democratically-elected government. Having tasted victory, caste and religious groups have never looked back. After Nehru’s death, the Congress was to joyfully interpret secularism as a profusion of religions in public spaces and Kerala’s private educational institutions capitalised on this. It is widely put about that they indulge in the practice of selling teaching appointments to the highest bidder. The latter may be unproven but rumoured estimates of how much the last zoology lectureship fetched serves to keep suspicion alive. The apotheosis of the Congress Party’s approach to education in Kerala is its history of appointing as Minister of Education legislators from sectarian parties confined to specific regions of the State. That this can be done so brazenly should be a source of shame in a democracy. At least, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has refused to do so, rejecting the practice of apportioning vice chancellorships according to caste and religion. But the Left’s weakness is their cadre, and so long as it rules the State, one cannot expect anyone but craven loyalists to make the cut. Between the strategy of communal mobilisation and the adherence to political ideology, respectively, practised by Kerala’s two main political formations, the higher education sector drifts rudderless. No will As I have stated, the true purpose of a university is to hold a mirror up to society. But the claim of pursuing this goal does not mean that our youth should not receive the education that they deserve. What protocols exist to see that instruction is of the highest international class, that new institutions or even programmes are started only when there is capacity to deliver excellence and that heads of institutions have demonstrated intellectual leadership and commitment to democratic practice? Over the past 50 years we have become far richer, and both disciplinary knowledge and awareness of global best practices in the administration of education are easily accessible. It is just that there is no will in Kerala to leverage this knowledge. While structural barriers to improving the state of higher education in Kerala, which I have outlined, exist, workable solutions that may be implemented with immediate effect exist too. Principal among them would be the institution of student evaluation of courses. These should be comprehensive without being extensive, revealing the distance from the global frontier of the instructional material, the quality of the instruction itself and the attention paid to learning outcomes. This information must be made public, as is the case in public institutions in the United States. In an IT-enabled environment, this should not be difficult to achieve. It will turn students into stakeholders, encourage teachers to give off their best and make the administrators, public and private, accountable.

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||In NFHS report card, the good, the sober, the future||The health system in India has been facing unprecedented stress during the COVID-19 pandemic which includes the looming Omicron threat now on the horizon. Against this backdrop, the recently released fifth edition of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-5 brings some positive news. NFHS-5, which presents a bird’s eye view of the state of the nation’s health and related development indicators, looks encouraging on several fronts: population growth is stabilising, family planning services have improved, and health systems are delivering better. However, it also highlights the need for further improvement to address gender-based violence and harmful practices against women and girls, such as child marriage and gender-biased sex selection. These have been exacerbated by discriminatory social norms and practices hindering the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030 Agenda and India’s development goals. Population is stabilising The good news is that India’s population growth appears to be stabilising. The Total Fertility Rate — the average number of children born per woman — has declined from 2.2 to 2.0 at the national level. A total of 31 States and Union Territories (constituting 69.7% of the country’s population) have achieved fertility rates below the replacement level of 2.1. The main reasons for decline in fertility include: Increase in adoption of modern family planning methods (from 47.8% in 2015-16 to 56.5% in 2019-21) and a reduction in unmet need for family planning by 4% points over the same period. This indicates significant improvements in access to family planning related information and services. Increased reach of the health system to more non-user couples with information about family planning (from 18% in 2015-16 to 24% in 2019-21). Further, 62% of current users have received information about the side-effects of contraceptives — a crucial indicator of the improved quality of family planning services. Significant improvements in female literacy, with 41% women having received 10 or more years of schooling (compared to 36% in 2015-16). Girls who study longer have fewer children, and are also more likely to delay marriage and find employment. In other Asian countries too, fertility decline has taken place alongside notable improvements in access to quality education, especially girls’ education. Improved health delivery Maternal health services are steadily improving. Antenatal care in the first trimester has increased by 11.4% points (from 2015-16 to 2019-21) to reach 70%; the recommended four antenatal care check-ups have increased by 7% points to reach 58.1% and postnatal care visits have gone up by 15.6% points to reach 78%. Institutional births were accessed by 88.6% of women in 2019-21, marking an increase of 9.8% points from 2015-16. There has also been an increase in institutional deliveries in public health facilities (52.1% to 61.9%), demonstrating an improvement in quality of services. The survey indicates a worrisome figure of 11% of pregnant women who were still either unreached by a skilled birth attendant or not accessing institutional facilities. Further analysis reveals an institutional delivery rate of under 70% in 49 districts of India. Over two-thirds (69%) of these districts are from five States (Nagaland, Bihar, Meghalaya, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh), indicating the need for an area-specific approach to improving maternal health services. Teenage pregnancy has declined marginally by 1% point, and 7.9% of women in the age group of 15-19 years who were already mothers or pregnant at the time of the survey. This highlights the need to invest in comprehensive sexuality education as a key component of life-skills education for both in school and out-of-school adolescents, and ensuring access to quality sexual and reproductive health services for them. A very small segment of the population is currently accessing the full range of sexual and reproductive health services such as screening tests for cervical cancer (1.9%) and breast examinations (0.9%). These services should be included while expanding the basket of reproductive health services. Discriminatory social norms Evidence indicates significant progress where women have the right to bodily autonomy and integrity, and the ability to take decisions about their lives. It is heartening to see that the proportion of women (aged 15-24 years) who use menstrual hygiene products has increased by almost 20% points between 2015-16 and 2019-21 and currently stands at 77.3%. The proportion of women who have their own bank accounts has gone up by 25.6% points over the same time period to reach 78.6%. Around 54% of women have their own mobile phones and about one in three women have used the Internet. This, coupled with the increase in the proportion of women with more than 10 years of schooling, lays the building blocks for women’s empowerment. In the next few years, the combination of mobile technology, banking, education and women’s economic empowerment will be significant drivers to address informal discriminatory norms. To empower women and ensure gender justice, it is imperative to address harmful practices, such as child marriage and gender-biased sex selection. The prevalence of child marriage has gone down marginally from 26.8% in 2015-16 to 23.3% in 2019-21. Similarly, sex ratio at birth has shown slight improvement (from 919 to 929 over the same time period). One in three women continue to face violence from their spouse. Hence, there is a need to enhance the value of women and girls by working on transforming unequal power relations, structural inequalities and discriminatory norms, attitudes and behaviours. Promote gender-equal values Women’s participation in the economy continues to remain low (only 25.6% women engaged in paid work, a meagre increase of 0.8% point). Women still bear a disproportionate burden of unpaid domestic and care work, hindering their ability to access gainful employment. This points to the need for engaging with men and boys, particularly in their formative years, to promote positive masculinities and gender-equal values. The pace of progress between one NFHS and the next should be accelerated by devising targeted strategies based on specific indicators and regions that are currently lagging. Convergence among multiple stakeholders is critical to bring about the desired change. Together, we must challenge discriminatory social norms that drive gender-based violence and harmful practices, and empower women to exercise agency and autonomy in all spheres of life. Women and girls having agency and bodily autonomy is not only the foundation for a better future; it is a fundamental human right.

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Legacy of the printed word||The printed word faces competition from rapidly evolving technology and that makes reading an accomplishment by all standards. It has undergone numerous reincarnations in style while taking on TV news, online portals and digitisation of the print media. But who will deny that the printed word is always read with interest and curiosity, is appreciated and criticised, and the best preserved for posterity? Whatever be the compulsions of the industry, it is the reader (read: subscriber) who has the final word because nothing matches the pleasure of holding a newspaper in hand and reading it from the first word of the first column on the top left of the front page to the last word at the bottom right of the back page. Archiving newspaper clippings for future reference or remembrance and laminating or framing articles as memorabilia are simple joys that cannot be snatched away from any generation. I knew of a social worker in Delhi who drew immense joy in marking articles in newspapers every morning. He spent his after-office hours diligently snipping the news items and pasting them on A-4 sheets with the date and name of the publication. As piles of his treasured clippings, beginning from the 1960s, grew, he stored them in mega steel trunks. When his family was shifting house, his wife audaciously sold the trunks to the junk dealer one day. Her contention was that she had never seen her husband unlock the trunks in the two decades of their marriage. That evening their household peace was shattered. The husband almost sniffed the day’s ‘abnormal’ happening from the entrance of his house and bawled his heart out the moment he realised that the trunks were gone and empty shelves were staring at him. He ordered his wife to get the trunks back, no matter what. The poor lady had no choice and actually bought back the trunks from the kabadiwala. As a witness to this particular incident, I have remained bewildered by diehard fans of the written word. On another occasion on a trip to the Sittanavasal caves near Trichy in Tamil Nadu, an unwarranted encounter left me astonished about the value of the printed word and its readers. On an assignment for a travel column for the paper, I found myself alone atop the famous Jain caves when a man tried to strike a conversation. I grew wary of him. He addressed me as “sister” and persisted with self-introduction — he worked as a Tamil Nadu Electricity Board engineer in Dharmapuri and travelled alternate weekends to interesting places. He kept walking along with me and even asked for a lift to the main road to catch his bus. That 10-minute drive fuelled my belief in the printed word. He was curious about my background; I lied saying I was a student. He then pulled out a spirally bound book and I sat up. It was a collection from the same travel column, ‘Road Less Travelled’, 70 of the articles neatly laminated and numbered. And I could see my byline peeping out. He had already been to 30 of those places. He felt reporters’ lives were interesting and inspiring, filled with rich experiences. Indeed. I do not regret withholding my identity from him. But I learnt that day how much we journalists owe our readers and the power of the written word. The kind of delight and respect it evokes — can the digital ever be on par? Is the slow death of the printed word an exaggerated emotion? Be it a food for thought, yet again. soma.basu@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/legacy-of-the-printed-word/article38075084.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Killing the licence||If the past few years of enhanced measures against non-governmental organisations (NGOs) operating in India had not put enough of a squeeze on them, then the Ministry of Home Affairs’s long-drawn-out process of scrutinising their foreign-funding licences by year-end is sure to do so. Close on the heels of the news that the Missionaries of Charity group had been denied a renewal of its licence under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (amended in 2020), comes the revelation that more than four-fifths of the applications of the 22,000-plus NGOs that have sought renewal have yet to be scrutinised. Unless the Government extends the deadline by midnight, all of them stand to lose their ability to access international funding in the new year. As experts have explained, the NGOs have to prove not only that the source of funding and their usage of the funds is appropriate but also establish that their work does not qualify as harmful to “public interest” or “national security” — ambiguous terms that are left to MHA officials to define. So, as many as 2,000 NGOs under scrutiny may be denied a renewal of their FCRA licence as the Missionaries of Charity and its roughly 200 homes around the country have been in this round. Contrary to the Government’s defence that it is only following accounting and audit procedures, it seems clear that organisations that have particularly faced the Modi government’s ire are those that work in specific “sensitive areas”: pollution and climate change issues, human rights, child labour and human slavery, health and religious NGOs, particularly Christian and Islamic charities. Prominent names among nearly 20,000 NGOs to have lost their foreign-funding licences since 2014 include Amnesty International, Greenpeace India, People’s Watch, European Climate Foundation, Compassion International and the Gates Foundation-backed Public Health Foundation of India. If the Government has ample evidence to prove that Indians are better off without the work of these internationally renowned organisations, then it has yet to show it. It is time the Government gives a more transparent account of its actions against NGOs, which at present appear to mirror those in China and Russia which have used their NGO laws to shut down dissent and criticism. The actions in India over “foreign hand” concerns seem more hypocritical given the relative ease with which political parties are able to access foreign funds for their campaigns through electoral bonds, under the same FCRA that seeks to restrict funds to NGOs. At a time when India is facing the crippling effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and a long-term economic crisis, the Government’s moves that have resulted in an estimated 30% drop in international non-profit contributions, only hurt the poorest and most vulnerable recipients of philanthropic efforts, particularly those by NGOs working in areas where government aid fails to reach.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/killing-the-licence/article38075074.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Ground to dust||Ever since the maiden Test at Melbourne during March 1877, cricketing history always had a special place for the Ashes, the series that involves England and Australia, the rivals from that inaugural joust. The series-nomenclature Ashes was coined by a British newspaper in 1882 and that term and the trophy, the urn, have become part of sporting folklore. England lost the 1877 game and cut to the present, Old Blighty suffered defeat yet again at Melbourne to hand over the current Ashes at 0-3 to host Australia while two Tests still remain in the series. The juxtaposition of history and the present may seem like a one-way street but the Ashes remains far from it with Australia having won 34 and England 32 through a series that has attained mythical proportions over the decades. However, recent history would vouch for Australia’s dominance with the Ashes being snapped up in 2017 and 2019, and the latest result too favours the former colony while the mother-country is resigned to eating humble pie. The three defeats in consecutive Tests have shown England in poor light. The will to fight seems to have declined and Joe Root’s men have been tagged as the worst tourists to land in Australia and as it has been pointed out, all that the host needed was just 12 days to seize the urn. There have been times when England looked anaemic, especially in the contests in the 1980s against the marauding West Indians. To those tales of ignominy, cricket’s birthplace has added the latest chapter. England’s batting has leant on Root while his colleagues fell with tentative feet, itchy hands and an insipid mind. With the batters failing, England’s attack has struggled to mount pressure. And when the bowlers did strike with James Anderson belying his 39 summers and clocking a masterly spell in Melbourne, the England batters failed to offer support and Australia won by an innings and 14 runs. Debutant Scott Boland’s six for seven in the second innings further reiterated Australia’s talent base and its strong domestic structure while England was left to ponder about its County circuit. That an injured Josh Hazlewood was not missed spoke volumes about the inherent strengths within the Aussie pace-pack. Boland showed that at 32, hope could still float for the committed athlete. That he is the second after Jason Gillespie to emerge from the aboriginal community to turn out for the Australian men’s Test team also revealed cricket’s democratic footprint. Before the series, Australia seemed unsettled having lost its regular captain Tim Paine to a hushed-up scandal. But in Pat Cummins, the Aussies have found a calm skipper, and with England in disarray, the Ashes will stay in the southern hemisphere.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/ground-to-dust/article38075075.ece

31 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Edible oil firms have cut prices by 15-20%: Pandey||Major edible oil companies, including Ruchi Soya and Adani Wilmar, have reduced the maximum retail price of their products by about 15-20% following measures taken by the government, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said. “This (edible oil prices) has been a concern for sometime and after very, very close engagement with the oil industry and very proactive measures by the government and meetings with oil industry, a very serious and significant reduction has happened,” Mr. Pandey said during a virtual conference. During a presentation, he noted that Ruchi Soya Industries had reduced retail prices on various oils by Rs. 14-Rs. 30 per litre, Bunge India in the range of Rs. 10-Rs. 20, Adani Wilmar by up to Rs. 40 and IFFCO Allana by up to Rs. 35. “When you are dependent almost 60% on the import component, then the domestic prices are naturally influenced by the international prices,” he said. “What the government of India did was to reduce duty to almost zero in case of edible oils, which showed significant reduction in the prices across brands of oil,” he added, noting this was the second such instance. Earlier too, an 8-10% reduction had happened.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/edible-oil-firms-have-cut-prices-by-15-20-pandey/article38075061.ece

31 December 2021||COIMBATORE,||‘New GST rates to push up garment prices’||Prices of garments will climb by 7% from January 1 as the GST rates are set to increase from 5% to 12%, industry sources said. Clothing Manufacturers Association of India (CMAI) chief mentor Rahul Mehta said the industry was not in a position to absorb the increase in rates that would take effect on January 1. “Garments will become expensive by 7% at the consumer level immediately, and [prices] may go up further in the future with the increase in other prices,” he said. According to the South Indian Hosiery Manufacturers’ Association in Tiruppur, garments across price ranges, from basic wear to branded products, will be hit by higher GST from January 1. The direct and immediate impact would be a rise of 7% in prices, said sources in the association. Citing a recent study, Mr. Mehta said the clothing and textiles sector has different GST rates for different products. With uniform 12% duty, 85% of the market is expected to be affected. While the Centre may see higher revenue of Rs. 7,000 to Rs. 10,000 crore, the overall industry compliance is expected to be reduced. The government should look at uniform 5% duty, instead. Textiles and clothing manufacturers have been urging the Centre to review the decision to raise GST to 12%.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/new-gst-rates-to-push-up-garment-prices/article38075057.ece

31 December 2021||Centurion,||Bowlers lead assault as India breaches the SuperSport bastion||Test matches are won and lost in moments like these: see a chink, exploit it! A battling Dean Elgar, defending solidly for most part, moved across and turned a Jasprit Bumrah delivery on off-stump past the square-leg ropes. The shot also provided the Indians the opening they needed for a breakthrough. The trap The trap was laid. The Indian changed the angle. Bumrah, bowling round the wicket, released from closer to the stumps to Elgar. And he struck gold! Elgar (77) shuffled across, attempting to work the ball, and was trapped leg-before. This was the pivotal moment of the final day. Rain stayed away on Thursday and India, defending 305 under sunshine, dismissed South Africa for 191 soon after lunch to win the first Freedom Test by 113 runs for a 1-0 lead in the three-Test series. This was India’s first win at this venue. The cricket caravan will move to the Wanderers for the second Test, beginning January 3. K.L. Rahul was adjudged Player-of-the-Match for his first innings 123, the difference between the two sides in reality. After breaching the South African bastion at the SuperSport Park, the Indians are well on course for a maiden Test series triumph in South Africa. The Indian pace attack hunted like a pack of wolves. Relentless, clever and always dangerous. The three — Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj — have the uncanny knack of conjuring up wicket-taking deliveries out of nowhere. This also means the opposition batters are never really ‘in’, as the ball moves away, nips back or holds its line. In the morning, Elgar, all focus and determination, and Temba Bavuma, appeared confident. There was an opportunity for India but Shami spilled a tough caught-and-bowled chance when Elgar (on 63) could not keep a drive off a full-length delivery down. There was nothing alarming in the pitch on day five. If anything the surface appeared to have settled down but for the odd delivery deviating off the crack. However, South Africa lost wickets at regular intervals. Quintion de Kock once again promised much with a couple of rousing on-drives off Bumrah. However, the left-hander played-on attempting to cut a Siraj ball, delivered from round the wicket, and holding its line outside off. The impulsive de Kock is often his worst enemy. Bavuma stands tall Even as wickets fell around him, Bavuma (35 not out), putting mind over matter, kept the challenge alive. He was compact with his defence and timed the ball sweetly. Bumrah was cover-driven majestically and Ashwin was off-driven to the fence with footwork. In the end, the South Africa vice-captain was left high and dry even as Kohli made all the right moves. Kohli brought back Shami from the Press Box end and the skilful paceman, his seam position upright, made further inroads. All-rounder Wiann Mulder got a nick to a lovely good-length delivery from Shami that straightened outside off. With South Africa 164 for seven, India was now looking at the tail. Cleaning up Soon after lunch, Shami moved one away off the seam to find Marco Jansen’s edge. Ashwin’s flight and dip accounted for Kagiso Rabada and moments later Lungi Ngidi was picked up by the close cordon. India had won! The celebrations reflected the joy of an away win. A first Test series triumph on South African soil is still some distance away though.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bowlers-lead-assault-as-india-breaches-the-supersport-bastion/article38075429.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Neeraj and Sindhu epitomised India’s remarkable surge||To think of India’s Olympic history in track and field is to think of two heartbreaks. At the 1960 Rome Olympics, the late Milkha Singh — who passed away this June — fell short of a podium finish in 400m by one tenth of a second. Twenty-four years later, P.T. Usha lost out in the 400m hurdles by one hundredth of a second. Liberating This was until Neeraj Chopra, a beefy 23-year-old from Haryana, hurled a javelin over 87.58m to secure India’s first-ever Olympic track and field gold and only the second individual gold after Abhinav Bindra (Beijing 2008).  The lung-bursting run, the roar as he released the javelin and the no-look celebratory raise of the fist felt liberating, not just for him but for legions of Indian fans.  Coming as it did in the year of a devastating pandemic, Neeraj’s effort meant people could experience a momentary deadening and a brief escape from all the pain. But he was not alone in helping the populace find reprieve. India registered its best-ever tally at the Olympics with seven medals. Badminton ace P.V. Sindhu’s halo shone even brighter as became only the first Indian woman to win multiple individual Olympic medals, adding a bronze to the silver she earned at Rio. The Indian men’s hockey team bridged the gap with its golden past by securing the bronze, ending a 41-year wait for a medal (since Moscow 1980). The gallant Indian women’s hockey side came agonisingly close, losing 3-4 to Great Britain in the bronze-medal playoff. But after having finished 12th out of 12 teams at Rio, the performance in Tokyo — which included a 1-0 quarterfinal win over three-time champion Australia — will glint like gold. Silver medals for Mirabai Chanu (weight-lifting) and Ravi Kumar Dahiya (wrestling) and bronze medals for Lovlina Borgohain (boxing) and Bajrang Punia (wrestling), ensured India had new additions to its sporting pantheon. Incredible display In the Paralympic Games that followed, the country finished with an incredible 19 medals (five gold, eight silver and six bronze), with Sumit Antil’s record-breaking spree in the javelin and teenaged Avani Lekhara’s splendid double in shooting ranking among the best. The enduring image, though, will be of Pramod Bhagat jump-hugging his coach after becoming India’s first-ever Paralympic badminton gold medallist. It is not often that cricket takes such a backseat, and yet, India’s series triumph in Australia in January will rank among the greatest. Rishabh Pant’s swashbuckling 89 n.o. helped India chase down a venue-record 328 on the final day in Brisbane and clinch the series 2-1. That it came after Virat Kohli’s men were shot out for a humiliating 36 in the first Test showed their remarkable powers of recovery. It set the tone for the superlative performance in England, where they lead an unfinished series 2-1. Thursday’s fine win over South Africa at Centurion capped off an outstanding year and has set India on course for that elusive series win in the Rainbow nation. Smriti Mandhana’s classy century in India women’s pink-ball debut in Australia and Mithali Raj becoming the first Indian batter and second overall to score 10,000 international runs were the other notable moments. Heart-warming After four years’ struggle, K. Srikanth’s return as a force to reckon with in badminton was heart-warming. The 28-year-old became the first Indian men’s singles player to secure a world championship silver. Equally impressive was the young Lakshya Sen’s effort, who lost to Srikanth in the last-four and settled for a bronze. Another youngster who caught the eye was 17-year-old Shaili Singh, who won the girls’ long jump silver at the World U20 Championship. Likewise, prodigies thrived in chess, as always, with India adding six more Grandmasters – Leon Luke Mendonca, Arjun Kalyan, Sankalp Gupta, Mitrabha Guha, Raja Rithvik and Harshit Raja – to take the number to 72.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/neeraj-and-sindhu-epitomised-indias-remarkable-surge/article38075486.ece
31 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Rashmi thrilled with her third Federation Cup||Rashmi Kumari is the most accomplished woman carrom player in the country.

It was her third Federation Cup trophy, after the earlier triumph in 2012 and 2010. “I am very happy to win this title’’, said Rashmi, Chief Manger with the ONGC). Rashmi beat the reigning World Champion S Appoorwa 11-15, 25-6, 25-12 in the final, to assert her class. “The standard of players has gone up a lot. Many junior players have come up. So, it was a great experience to struggle a lot to reach the final and meet the reigning world champion’’, said Rashmi, quite appreciative of the other players. Rashmi has also won the World Cup twice, the ICF Cup twice, and been a SAARC champion four times, apart from being the Asian champion thrice. She has been a dominant force in the domestic circuit, winning the national title ten times. It has not been easy training for the event. Rashmi’s mother had to come from Patna to Delhi, so that Rashmi could entrust her children, nine-year-old daughter Shambhavi and five-year-old son Shubh, to her and travel to Varanasi for the tournament. “My husband Sumit works in SBI, and supports me a lot. But, with online classes for children, I have to wait for them to sleep to start my carrom training’’, revealed Rashmi. The next competition for Rashmi is round the corner, the Public sector championship scheduled in Jaipur from January 4 to 7. “All these national level tournaments are important for our ranking. Also, I will be representing my employer ONGC in this. It was in 2014 that I had won this tournament last time. The current world champion Appoorwa will also be there as the defending champion. So, it will be interesting”, said Rashmi. Despite all the achievements over the years, the urge to excel keeps burning bright and drives Rashmi to train hard for the events ahead, especially the National championship scheduled in Dadar, Mumbai, from February 28 to March 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rashmi-thrilled-with-her-third-federation-cup/article38075620.ece

31 December 2021||Centurion,||2021 one of India’s greatest years, says vice-captain Rahul||The serenity in K.L. Rahul’s deep baritone voice reflects his state of mind. The classy opener’s 123 in the first innings of the first Test here had a huge impact in how the contest progressed and eventually ended in an Indian win. Right up there! Asked how he would rate this hundred, Rahul said, “Right up there in terms of the conditions, the wicket and how challenging the bowling was. I was happy that I could get a hundred and put my team in a winning position.” He conceded it was a crucial toss to win for India. “Particularly after how the pitch behaved on days three and four when the cracks opened up,” he said. Asked about 2021 in the context of Test cricket for India, Rahul said, “It will go down as one of the greatest years in Indian cricket, particularly Test cricket.” He added, “We are a happy dressing room. Put in a lot of effort in the two weeks leading to the Test. We shared our experiences from the past tours. It was all about training, mindset, preparation and grit.” About him ‘leaving’ so many deliveries outside off, he said, “The key to Test-match batting is leaving balls outside off. I am enjoying it, enjoying tiring the bowlers. Need to do the same thing at the Wanderers.” Lot of heart Talking about the Indian pace attack, he said, “Bumrah, Shami and Siraj bowled with a lot of heart, hit the deck, there was something in there for them in the pitch that got them excited. Let me tell you, facing them in the nets is not easy for us.” The Dravid effect About the impact of coach Rahul Dravid on the team, Rahul said, “When such a legend comes to your dressing room as coach, you talk to him about the art of batting, learn from his experiences.

Made us work hard at the nets.” Predictably, Rahul was the man of the moment and Player-of-the-Match.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/2021-one-of-indias-greatest-years-says-vice-captain-rahul/article38075433.ece
31 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Neeraj sets sights on crossing the 90m mark||Neeraj Chopra has spent the last three weeks working more on his fitness and weight than actual throwing. The 24-year old Olympic gold medallist has shed weight, got back into rhythm and is enjoying “an athlete’s simple life” at Chula Vista, USA in the company of coach Klaus Bartoniez and physio Ishan. Feeling positive “It was very difficult initially because I had put on 12-13kg back home. When I went on track, I tried to train like before but the body ached and everything took a lot of effort — physically and mentally. I have now lost 5.5 kg and am feeling very positive for a good 2022,” Neeraj told a select group of journalists from his training base on Thursday. “I wake up, have breakfast and train for two-and-a-half hours, have lunch and rest, train again from 4.30 for about three hours, then have dinner and sleep. It’s great to return to normal training,” he smiled, admitting that post-Tokyo life in India was quite an experience. “The weather is good here and we can focus on training and put full effort into our programme. Back home it was very cold in Patiala plus it is wedding season and everyone wants to invite you and you cannot decline,” he grinned. He denied missing out on competition in the last five months even as the rest of the world continued with sporting action. “I didn’t have a Europe visa, I had missed training and also fell ill. There was no point in hurrying back into action only for the sake of participation and also risk injury so we decided to concentrate on the next year,” he explained. His focus now is on the 90m barrier. “I have always talked about breaching the 90m mark and my focus remains on that. It is a very important target because while winning a medal is one thing, managing a good distance is completely different. The Olympic gold is obviously very important but 90m is important for me to personally consider myself a genuine world-level thrower,” Neeraj said. Support for youngsters He did, however, make a request to the general public and officials. “I feel we need more competition, especially international ones. Even the upcoming ones should get more international exposure and experience, only then they will gain confidence to compete with the best in the world. “But we have to understand that we also need to support them after a poor performance, that’s when they need even more motivation to get back. We need to appreciate the effort as much as the result,” he signed off.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/neeraj-sets-sights-on-crossing-the-90m-mark/article38075494.ece
31 December 2021||London,||Manchester City pulls ahead in title race||Manchester City beat Brentford 1-0 on Wednesday to extend its lead at the top of the Premier League to an ominous eight points as title rival Chelsea conceded a last-gasp equaliser at home to Brighton. Phil Foden’s first-half goal was enough to give Pep Guardiola’s team a 10th consecutive league win as it took full advantage of injury-hit Chelsea’s slip-up at Stamford Bridge. The defending champion now has 50 points after 20 matches, putting it eight clear of second-placed Chelsea. Liverpool, which lost to Leicester on Tuesday, is a further point behind. Brentford created some good scoring opportunities in the opening stages in west London, but it was City which went ahead in the 16th minute when Foden cleverly tucked in a cross from Kevin De Bruyne. The visitors dominated possession but struggled to produce shots on target and Guardiola looked edgy in the latter stages as his team attempted to see out the victory. Off side It thought they had sealed the three points in the dying minutes when Aymeric Laporte rose to head home but his goal was ruled out by VAR for a marginal offside. Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea, which kicked off 45 minutes before City, looked poised for victory after Romelu Lukaku gave it a first-half lead but substitute Danny Welbeck struck in stoppage time for a 1-1 draw. It looked as though it was going to be a familiar story for Brighton, which has struggled to score this season, but substitute Welbeck had other ideas, heading home Marc Cucurella’s cross in the 91st minute. City travels to face fourth-placed Arsenal on Saturday knowing a win would take it 11 points clear of Chelsea, which hosts Liverpool the following day.  The results: Brentford 0 lost to Manchester City 1 (Foden 16); Chelsea 1 (Lukaku 28) drew with Brighton 1 (Welbeck 90+1) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/man-city-pulls-ahead-in-title-race/article38075497.ece

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||BFC downs Chennaiyin||Bengaluru FC notched up a much-needed win, beating Chennaiyin FC 4-2 in an error-strewn but entertaining encounter at the Tilak Maidan Stadium in Vasco on Thursday. Only BFC’s second victory of the season, it was sealed in the space of four second-half minutes. At 2-2 and 20 minutes to go, substitute Udanta Singh scored after a neat dummy from Brazilian Cleiton Silva, in which two other substitutes — Sunil Chhetri and Danish Farooq — also had roles. Immediately after, another substitute in Pratik Chowdhary bundled the ball in after a blunder from goalie Vishal Kaith — his second of the match — where he fluffed an easy take off a corner. But at the start of the evening, it was all Chennaiyin. The sensational Mirlan Murzaev put his team ahead in the fourth minute with a fine solo goal. Forward Rahim Ali should have scored thrice in the opening 20 minutes alone, but missed all three. Bozidar Bandovic’s side paid the price as Silva converted from the penalty spot in the 39th minute. On the stroke of half-time, Kaith charged out to punch a corner to safety, but barely touched it and the ball went in off BFC defender Alan Costa’s shoulder. After the restart, Rahim finally scored, but via a gift from BFC goalie Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, who fumbled a weak shot. At 2-2, Chennaiyin established the upper hand again but it was BFC which had the last laugh.  The result: Chennaiyin FC 2 (Murzaev 4, Rahim 49) lost to Bengaluru FC 4 (Silva 39, Costa 43, Udanta 70, Chowdhary 74) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bfc-downs-chennaiyin/article38075426.ece

31 December 2021||Wellington,||Ross Taylor to retire||New Zealand cricket icon Ross Taylor confirmed on Thursday he is bowing out of international cricket. Taylor said the two-Test series against Bangladesh starting on Saturday would be his last in Test whites and that he would call stumps on his career after the One-Day Internationals against Australia and the Netherlands in February and March. The 37-year-old has been a mainstay in the New Zealand batting order since making his debut in 2006, amassing a number of records and achievements, notably the most runs by a New Zealander (18,074) and most appearances (445). “It’s been an amazing journey and I feel incredibly fortunate to have represented my country for as long as I have,” he said. “It’s been such a privilege to play with and against some of the greats of the game and to have created so many memories and friendships.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ross-taylor-to-retire/article38075422.ece
31 December 2021||Centurion,||Back to the drawing board for South Africa||Dean Elgar’s visage mirrored his disappointment. The South Africa captain was clear where India got its big advantage. “You win the toss, bat first and lose only three wickets on day one. Then you post a total over 300. That was the difference between the sides,” he said. Good gameplan The opener added, “The opening partnership on day one between K.L. Rahul and Mayank Agarwal really built a solid platform for India. They were patient and had a very good gameplan.” In contrast, the Indians breached the South African opening partnership early in both the innings. Elgar, who made a typically battling 77 in the Proteas’ second innings said, “The Indian pacemen did not make things easy for us. Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah challenge you.” Elgar said the South Africans would have a number of honest and transparent discussions ahead of the second Test at the Wanderers. Among them would be talks to shift the talented Keegan Petersen down the order from No. 3. “These are early days in his career and he has batted in pretty difficult conditions. He has looked very good. He is one of our best batters at the nets,” he said. Pat for Jansen Elgar was all praise for debutant seamer Marco Jansen: “He was the player of the Test for us. Bowled very well. He’s tall, gets bounce and is an awkward customer to face. He had a brilliant debut.” The captain said there would be “conversations” about the team composition ahead of the second Test. “This defeat is not going to dent our confidence going into the second Test at the Wanderers,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/back-to-the-drawing-board-for-sa/article38075424.ece

31 December 2021||MUMBAI,||Vijay Merchant Trophy postponed||The fears of a third wave to Omicron variant of COVID-19 has forced the BCCI to postpone of the Vijay Merchant Trophy, the inter-State U-16 cricket championship. “The cases across lndia are spiraling and despite being a large number of adults doubly vaccinated, they have still been infected. “We have been closely monitoring the situation in lndia and across the world, and it is estimated that the caseload will shoot up in the immediate future if the situation is not controlled now,” BCCI secretary Jay Shah wrote in an email to all the affiliated units. The Merchant Trophy was scheduled to begin at various venues on Jan. 9. The email, accessed by The Hindu , cites lack of vaccinations as the main reason for the decision. “The primary reason is that the participants are still not vaccinated and, as such, are vulnerable. We must exercise caution and not be adventurous and put the health of our talented cricketers at grave risk,” Shah stated. This will be the second successive season that the pandemic has forced the tournament’s suspension.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/vijay-merchant-trophy-postponed/article38075484.ece

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Strengths of the opponent||Even assuming one is fighting for a just cause, one must first assess the strengths and weaknesses of the opponent. The Kauravas were not fighting for a just cause. And they failed to take into account the strengths of the Pandavas, said Kidambi Narayanan in a discourse. After the Kurukshetra war is over and the Kauravas have been wiped out, a sorrowful Dhritarashtra tells Sanjaya that he had been witness to the prowess of the Pandavas, and knew that because of this, the Kauravas would lose the war. Dhritarashtra lists the incidents that had indicated to him the outcome of the war. Arjuna shot a target simply by looking at its reflection. When the Khandava forest had to be burnt down, Indra prevented that by causing it to rain and thereby putting out the fire. But Arjuna defeated Indra. Bhima killed Jarasandha, the King of Magadha. Yudhishthira irresponsibly staked everything he possessed in a game of chess, including his brothers and his wife. And yet his brothers did not turn against him. Lord Siva gave Arjuna the Pasupatastra. Indra gave Arjuna many weapons. When Yudhishthira went on a pilgrimage, he received the blessings of sage Romasa. Arjuna went to devaloka and conquered the devas. None could go to Gandhamadana, but Bhima went there and met Kubera. When the Kauravas stole cows belonging to the Gandharvas, the latter imprisoned the Kauravas. Arjuna fought the Gandharvas and released his cousins. Arjuna had the bow known as Gaandeeva. Above all, he had Lord Krishna on his side. When Bhishma lay on his arrow bed, Arjuna struck the ground, and out came a spring of water to quench Bhishma’s thirst. Dhritarashtra says all these occurrences had indicated that his sons would lose to the Pandavas, and yet he had failed to warn his sons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/strengths-of-the-opponent/article38075385.ece

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||museums matter||Ever since it re-opened in May 2021, the Kerala Museum, one of the oldest in Kochi, located amid greenery in the heart of Edappally, has become increasingly busy during weekends. “With almost two years of being cooped up indoors, glued to their screens, visitors seem to like the idea of being back in a green, open space, where they can take in the quietude and bring children too,” says Aditi Nayar, the museum’s director. COVID-19 had devastating consequences for museums. Footfalls vanished, revenues plunged, and even the well-funded ones had to slash their payroll. But it also forced museums to rethink their fundamental purpose and identity. ‘What should a museum be in the post-pandemic world?’ is a question that museum directors across the world ponder on. It has been a few months since museums have reopened in India. Two key things that have helped them adapt to the post-pandemic world are having a strong digital presence and increased community engagement. Digitally stronger Spread over three buildings with 39 galleries, an in-person tour of the Salar Jung Museum in Hyderabad takes about half a day. As of July this year, the museum has digitised more than 47,000 of its artefacts but the museum’s director Nagender Reddy wants to encourage in-person visits, while keeping the pandemic in mind. On October 18, Salar Jung Museum launched an audio-guide app that invites a plug-and-play approach to a more physically-distanced tour, working with unique QR codes only available in the museum’s various galleries. Last year, the museum also partnered with Google Arts and Culture to showcase its prominent setup such as the interactive dissection of Raja Ravi Varma’s Disappointed and a comprehensive breakdown of Indian Epics in Art, comprising folk images from the Chitrakathi tradition of Paithan, Maharashtra. This technological shift has helped not only established museums, but also newer ones waiting in the wings. The Museum of Art and Photography (MAP) in Bengaluru, for instance, has 12 exhibits, even though its launch was deferred to 2022. It has been hosting a slew of online events over the last two years. Indian Music Experience (IME), another museum in Bengaluru, has three online exhibitions on Google Arts and Culture, including one dedicated to the late sitar legend Ravi Shankar on his 100th birth anniversary last year. Starting with Birdsong, which will be IME’s first physical exhibition in 2022, every exhibition the museum organises will also be available online, promises its director Manasi Prasad. Though their online programming started well, the audience for concerts and workshops declined this year, probably due to screen fatigue. Despite this, IME plans to continue its online offerings. “People don’t log into an event while it’s happening. But they watch it later. [These videos] are free resources they can refer to whenever they want,” says Manasi. The Kerala Museum is currently digitising its art collection. The exhibits will go online by the end of January 2022. Descriptions of the original works of art will be available for public viewing, along with curated stories of each of the 200 artworks on display. “All the well-funded museums are strengthening their digital presence. They are shifting most of their exhibitions online. This would not have happened or would have happened very slowly without the pandemic,” says Reena Dewan, the former president of the International Council for Museums (ICOM) India and the director of Kolkata Centre for Creativity (KCC). With the community Museums are starting to realise the significance of community engagement upon resumption after lockdowns. From being exclusionary spaces involving people from the art community and academia, they are opening up for participation from the public. IME, for instance, hosted a free open-mic during this year’s Navaratri wherein anyone from the public could perform. IME has partnered with the British Council to create a series of youth engagement initiatives. The museum has a Youth Advisory Board, wherein teenagers participate in the decision-making. This board advises the museum on how to improve its programming. One of its suggestions, for instance, is to do something on K-Pop. In a different attempt to reach out, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS), Mumbai, which turns 100 next year, announced the Adopt A Museum Artefact initiative. The adopters’ names were displayed near their respective artefacts and at the museum’s entrance. “Hundreds of Mumbaikars and some from Ahmedabad and Delhi came forward to support this initiative. They helped us raise Rs. 5 crore,” says Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Director-General of CSMVS. The Kerala Government is promoting a movement to make museums function as interactive spaces for youth. Keralam Museum, an organisation formed to build and modernise museums, has realised 11 of the 31 projects it initiated. “While well-funded museums, State- and private-owned, are burgeoning their digital presence and implementing community outreach plans, many small museums struggle for survival,” says Reena. This is where collaborations helped. During the World Heritage Week between November 19 to 25, for instance, KCC in collaboration with Paschimbanga Sangrahalaya Samiti organised the Cluster of Museums Exhibitions. The programme aimed to reimagine the future of museums through discussions, exhibitions, performances, workshops and film screenings over the week. “We invited 16 museums from Bengal, including the small ones. And it created a ripple effect. Now, people in Gujarat and Jammu University also want to host these kinds of events involving the smaller museums,” says Reena. As museums adapt to the new normal, they find it necessary to talk to the community and to each other. The pandemic has also nudged people to look at these spaces with renewed appreciation. “Culture is as important as health,” says Sabyasachi. “If you ignore culture, you are ignoring a significant part of being human.”  With inputs fromDivya Kala BhavaniandAnasuya Menon   Adopting art The pandemic was not merely a healthcare crisis. It created a ripple of crises that affected almost everything, including institutions of culture. Due to the financial upheaval it caused, many museums across the world had to sell some of their artworks to take care of the rest of their collections. This list included some of the world’s most renowned museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City (aka The Met). But the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS) in Mumbai came up with theidea to preserve their collection during a precarious time. The museum, which turns 100 next year, announced the Adopt a Museum Artefact initiative, wherein people could adopt its centuries-old artefacts. The adopters’ names were displayed near their respective artefacts and at the museum’s entrance. “Hundreds of Mumbaikars and some from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, and Delhi came forward to support this initiative. They helped us raise Rs. 5 crore,” says Sabyasachi Mukherjee, the Director-General of CSMVS, who headed this initiative. “When I shared this story with my foreign colleagues, they were pleasantly surprised to know that this was successful.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/museums-matter/article38075308.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Imprints of the year gone by||In one of the latest collections of Bodhi, by fashion designer Mala Sinha, a sari stands out. Trudging along the rim of its pallu is a young girl on a cycle, her braid flying with the wind, her father seated pillion. The breezy motif can in no way be called grim, yet it pays tribute to one of the most haunting images of India’s COVID-19 lockdown. Mala calls the design Babuji Ki Bitiya: it is a hat tip to the girl who had to cycle hundreds of kilometres from Gurgaon to her home in Bihar, with her ailing father. It is one of the more poignant components of her Corona Collection, “which also features some tongue-in-cheek patterns, translated using wooden blocks onto fabric,” she says over a phone call from Bengaluru. Mala Sinha is by no means the only creative mind to have been influenced by the pandemic, but it does take on a bit more significance than most others: her clientele comprises the country’s power corridors in Delhi. Playful still The patterns of Bodhi’s Corona Collection range from multi-coloured faces with masks, to animals gallivanting across bright broad borders of saris and stoles. “This was inspired by how much Nature managed to reclaim when we went into lockdown; it was their turn to cage us all,” she laughs. And then there is the Bodhi Reborn capsule, born out of a more urgent need earlier in the pandemic — a need to provide gainful employment for her team at a time when both the supply of raw material and the demand for fashion was limited. As Mala points out: “Situations like these strongly affect people who work with their hands; for we come to mind only when people are in a good place, when there is no tragedy. Why would they think of us while they are suffering?” And yet, incomes had to be sustained and households had to be supported by her team of artists and printers, who are predominantly women. That, says Mala, is when her Bodhi Reborn collection came to be. “Like many others, we began making masks, but all we had were scraps of material left behind over the years. Most of these scraps were already dyed and printed; we further died them in haldi (turmeric) so they would not affect anyone’s skin adversely,” says Mala. She adds, “We also created laptop sleeves, pouches and other things with them. You will never find a second piece in this collection, mainly because I cannot find the same scrap of fabric again,” she laughs.  The exhibition will be held from January 4 to 10 at Amethyst, Royapettah.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/imprints-of-the-year-gone-by/article38075326.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Kavya gallops to victory||Kavya Gopal, 20 years old, made Chennai proud by securing an individual gold as well as a team gold medal at the Junior National Equestrian Championship (JNEC) in Mumbai, with a groundbreaking score of 73.3475. She leads a pack of successful Chennai riders, who added to the city’s tally with a host of gold, silver and bronze medals. While Kavya’s individual gold medal was in the Young Rider Dressage category, her gold in Team Dressage was won along with Ariana Dhond, Tiyasha Vathul and Vibhu Rastogi. Other winners from Chennai are Tasha N — individual bronze and team silver in dressage (children II category); Samanna Everra — team gold in dressage and team bronze in show jumping (children I category); and Muzzamil M — team gold in dressage and show jumping (children II category). After three years of taking part in every JNEC, Kavya finally clinched her first-ever silver medal (team) in 2020. She made a powerful comeback for this year’s JNEC with more rigorous training and an unyielding attitude. The 2021 edition took place in Mumbai from December 17 to December 30, with riders from all parts of the country and their horses. Kavya’s horse — or “soulmate”, as many competitive riders call their steed — was Sechs Richtige, imported from Germany. She had the chance to practise with him only for five or six months prior to the championship, after he arrived in the country. About a month-and-a-half of her training period was spent just on building a connection with Sechs Richtige and getting to know his movements, she says. It helped that Kavya has been riding since the age of 12, and over the years has grown fond of animals. Riding a plethora of diverse horses in her growing years, Kavya has acquired the ability to understand the temperament of each horse and in turn, learn from it. “We connect instantly and can understand each other. We are inseparable,” as Kavya fondly explains the bond she shares with Sechs Richtige, it becomes clear why riders use the endearment ‘soulmate’ for their horses in the stable. “The partnership between Sechs Richtige and I in the competition was so graceful; he gave me moments to cherish for a lifetime,” she says. Kavya underlines that her victory was made possible only with the support of her seasoned coach, Isabelle Futnani: “She handheld me and groomed me into a better rider. Sechs Richtige and I clicked in no time with her complete guidance and training.” Kavya has planned out her future in the sports field and dreams of representing India on the international equestrian arena. “I have one more year to do Junior Nationals Championship, after which I will get to participate in National-level championships, which will be my next step. My ultimate aim is to reach the Olympics,” she signs off.

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Her world through his eyes||Clad in a sari, her hair in a neat braid, an umbrella peeping from her handbag slung across her shoulder, a resolute stride: think Vasanth S Sai’s film heroine and this is the image that comes to mind. She is always on the move: on her way to catch a bus to work; riding a scooter to keep an appointment with someone… In his latest Sivaranjiniyum Innum Sila Pengalum too, she is constantly on her feet. The film, that released on SonyLIV last month, is among the most talked-about ones of the year. “I don’t think I would have been this happy about the film’s reception even if it had had a theatrical release,” says Vasanth, who was in Coimbatore to take part in the Vishnupuram Literary Circle’s award event. Vasanth admits he was initially bent on the film being shown on the big screen. “The film’s journey began in 2018 when it won the Gender Equality award at the Mumbai Film Festival. From there, it travelled to film festivals across the world in 2019, and was the first Tamil film to be screened at most of them. I had to give it space for this travel,” he adds. By the time he readied it for release towards the end of 2019, the pandemic struck. Vasanth finally decided to release it on OTT, since he felt “it would get old” otherwise. OTT, he feels, “is a welcome change for films that have serious themes. The platforms help viewers see important films with deep concentration, enjoy the many nuances they have to offer.”  Sivaranjiniyum … is an anthology, featuring three 40-minute films, each of which is based on stories by master Tamil writers Ashokamitran, Aadhavan, and B Jeyamohan. The cast includes actors Parvathy Thiruvothu, Lakshmi Priyaa Chandramouli, and Kalieswari Srinivasan. The film explores the world of three married women: their desires, dreams, and little joys often swept under the carpet knowingly or unknowingly by the men in their lives. It makes for a powerful social commentary, one that Vasanth says takes roots in filmmaker K Balachander’s school of thought, whom he considers his inspiration.  The women in Vasanth’s stories shine with personality traits he admires in the women in his life. “This can be confidence, kindness, and perseverance despite their struggles. For a lot of women, it is never this or that. It is this and that.”  Sivaranjiniyum ... ultimately, explains Vasanth, talks about how women, in order to make people in their lives happy, often fail to make themselves happy. “It shows that you too are important. Your happiness matters,” he says. Critical thinking Vasanth’s questions on society’s unfair standards for women started when he was as young as 10 years old. “When I was a little boy, Sunday mornings were meant to play street cricket. But that was when my mother would send me on errands. We lived in Alwarpet then and she would ask me to accompany my college-going sister when she went to get Zoology notes from her friend. I found this odd: I was just 10, but here I was, expected to escort my sister just because I was a male,” he says. Gradually, as he grew older, and started reading, he found the answers. Reading shaped his thinking, and Vasanth says it is his mother who initiated him into literature. “The very thought of my mother brings to mind the image of her seated on an easy-chair with a book,” he recalls. “She would send me to a library in Nandanam when I was in Class V or VI to borrow books for her,” he says. “Mother would instruct me to look for titles by Sivasankari, Indhumathi, Soodamani, and Anuthama.” When he started reading later on, the names came rushing back. Vasanth started writing in his undergraduate years. He wrote short-stories, did a stint as a freelance journalist, and even set-up a small library at home. In fact, it is his love for literature that brought him to Coimbatore to participate at the Vishnupuram event. He hopes to share all that he learns with people. “This is my philosophy. Since I am a filmmaker, I do so through my films.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/her-world-through-his-eyes/article38075346.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Planting stories||In November 2019, when Aizawl-based Lalhruaitluanga Chawngte created a bookshelf attached to the roadside compound wall of his home, he was nervous. Yet he went ahead with the Little Library because he wanted to inculcate the habit of readingamong children. The library began with 35 books that he owned, mostly for light reading. While there had been similar mini libraries outside the Mizoram State Library, Chawngte — a journalist with The Mizoram Post — wanted to make them easily accessible, especially to children in his locality. With no librarians, membership fee, or time limits on borrowing, the free library includes Mizo and English language books. Popular choice Chawngte says he was inspired to set up the Little Library after he read about such libraries in the US and Europe. Now, two years later, the Little Library has grown manifold in Aizawl, and spread to nearly 20 villages in Mizoram. The library now has more than 1,000 books, all sourced through contributions from friends and well-wishers. Chawngte is delighted: “As a citizen, I wanted to contribute to society and as a writer of three books (in the Mizo language) I could think of no better way to re-introduce the habit of book reading. Children have lost touch with the beauty of reading books for leisure. When I started the library, a lot of curious people simply looked at it and walked past. However, within a day I was delighted to see school children stopping by to check out the books on the shelf.” Chawngte’s idea also paid off well as several individuals and organisations borrowed the concept and started similar little libraries in their own neighbourhoods and villages. “It gives me joy when people call or write to me seeking my approval to replicate the idea.

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Let the words find you||Poetry hides in plain sight. Inspiration can be discovered in receipts, spam emails and to-do lists, according to followers of ‘found poetry,’ a literary trend fuelled by the pandemic. Known as ‘poetic collage’ to some, and ‘remix poetry’ to others, a found poem is created by borrowing words, phrases and sentences from other sources or ‘texts’ and reframing them, imparting new meaning in the process. Words from a passage may be blacked out, or fresh words added, to reinterpet the text. The style is considered an outcome of Dadaism, a European art movement that surfaced in the wake of the First World War. “What is not a found poem?” asks Chennai-based poet K Srilata. Stating that all the words and sentences present in our head have been derived from elsewhere, she says, “In a sense, all poetry is found poetry... It is the juxtaposition of a new context against an old one that makes it ‘found’”. Shloka Shankar, a Bengaluru-based found poet and poetry instructor, acknowledges that although this style of verse is considered novel in India, the genre has enjoyed a gradual growth in interest. “Although it is more popular abroad, it has been picking up in India over the past year and a half”, she says. Her found poetry workshop Poetry is Everywhere is evidence of this. When she launched it in May 2020, little did she imagine that her pilot project would generate nearly 200 registrations. Today, she conducts hour-long virtual workshops on found poetry, and is all set to launch full-fledged four-week long workshops early next year. It is no surprise that since the onset of the pandemic, poetry has come to the rescue of those processing stress and gloom. Addressing its therapeutic power, Srilata claims that writing is a way of staying hopeful. “We turn to poetry not for sympathy, but when we just want to be seen and heard,” she says. She believes that this format is particularly useful in articulating life as it treats poetry as a conversation. Rohini Kejriwal, writer and founder of The Alipore Post, a community of writers and artists, says that found poetry has seen a reemergence during the pandemic. Her workshops, which she calls “meditative exercises”, give participants the chance to look at a page and find things that others cannot. Yet, Rohini believes that it is the words that find the poet. “The words come to you in very strange ways. They help you feel what is going on internally through the verses you find,” she says. The genre is also a stressbuster as it shifts the onus from ‘writing’ to ‘finding’; there is less scope for error since the lines and phrases in a found poem are borrowed. This release from the pressure of originality can be liberating, especially during the pandemic, when days may seem monotonous. As Rohini says, “Poetry has always been about escaping the world and meeting myself on a page”. Talking about poetry as a coping mechanism, Shloka recalls an instance from a workshop conducted by The Poeming in October 2020 where participants were told to create a found poem sourced from Michael Crichton’s 1990 novel Jurassic Park . All the participants composed found poems based on the pandemic. “Subconsciously, all of us had been thinking about the pandemic,” she says. Ramanujam Iyengar, an amateur poet who began dabbling in found poetry during the pandemic, says that it helped him merge his love for writing with another art form — doodling. The visual element of the form has given him scope to augment the appeal of one through the other. “It is very immersive as a creative medium”, he says, adding that digital art and online spaces have been an excellent productive outlet for him during the pandemic. Happy tool The rising interest in poetry during the pandemic led poet Aswin Vijayan to The Quarantine Train, an online poetry community of which he is the managing editor. “It has been a happy tool for those who cannot find the right words”, he says, calling found poetry “a type of ventriloquism”. “It can be used effectively in any context where you feel trapped and wordless. You borrow words and insert your emotions into it,” he says. The core appeal, however, lies in its malleability. It can take the shape of a haiku, a sonnet or an acrostic. Even when inspired by the same source, the poem’s contours are sculpted by each poet’s present frame of mind and approach to the text. In fact, Shloka promises that a poem drawn from a text today is sure to be different from one drawn from the same text the next day. Similarly, the community fostered by The Alipore Post is an active mix of students and professionals, aged between 11 and 30, while The Quarantine Train has drawn participation from those older than 18. Although both have largely been operating online, they are eager to shift to offline forums. The Quarantine Train hopes to establish local chapters and initiate offline meetings, while The Alipore Post is set to host a day-long event in 2022 for poets, musicians and artists. “This pandemic has made poets out of us all,” says Rohini.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/let-the-words-find-you/article38075337.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Friendships forged in fire||Treeza Louise Sequeira remembers the final moments of her mother’s funeral. Just as the coffin was being lowered into the grave, a woman came running towards her, in her hand, a bunch of jasmine — her mother had always been fond of them. To Treeza, this COVID volunteer was a stranger, yet like a thousand others across the country during the second wave, she helped prepare her mother’s meals and was now performing this final act of service. It has been a tough year. The Dubai resident flew down to Mangaluru in May, only to lose both her parents to COVID-19 within a week. Alone in the city, with even relatives afraid of stepping into the hospital to help, she says, “All that kept me sane, was the kindness shown to me by strangers.” “My father was admitted, after my mother, to the same ICU floor that she was in, but she had no idea he was there too,” she recalls. When her father passed away, she kept it a secret from her mother, trying to give him a send off herself. “I will always remember how Shivananda Prabhu, a friend of a friend of a relative — with whom I had never spoken before — helped me navigate the process of getting the death certificate. He even paid the hospital bill because I did not have enough cash on me.” “Prabhu and Subha Rao (the woman who got her mother flowers) were my rock then,” says Treeza, describing how Subha made liquid food for her parents when they were on a ventilator, and even for Treeza herself. “She would call and ask me which ingredients I wanted. In my 49 years, nobody has asked me that other than my parents,” she says. “When I asked her how I could repay her, she said ‘just do the same for somebody else’. It is because of the good in people that this universe goes on.” That is a lesson her parents taught her. “Dad and mum used to say: ‘our karma will come to you, and what you do will come to your children’.” Treeza is trying to do her bit now, making meals and sweets for daily wage labourers in her neighbourhood in Dubai once a month. “If I make even one person happy for some time, maybe the goodness will carry on.”      In Chennai, Deepthi Tanikella takes out her phone to read the first ever message she received from 61-year-old NB Sriram (Ramji, she calls him). “Dear Deepthi,” it reads. “I am touched by the note, it will remain with me. A daughter has been added to my family. It is going to be a long association between my family and yours.” The message was Ramji’s way of thanking Deepthi for sending him meals twice a day, complete with handwritten notes, for the month he was recovering from COVID-19. Under severe lockdowns, Ramji, who lived alone in Thiruvanmiyur, sought out Deepthi’s volunteer group, Meals for Madras to send him rice, kootu , sambar, idlis and fruit. Moved by their help, Ramji began to think of Deepthi as his third child. “I would also call him to see how he was doing. When he told me that he was living alone, I wanted to make sure he was okay,” says Deepthi. Even after Ramji recovered, she was the one he called when his throat felt itchy again. “Uncle called, saying please pray for me. I calmed him down,” says Deepthi. Her efforts have not gone unappreciated. Despite having moved to Bengaluru after the second wave, Ramji unfailingly texts Deepthi a good morning message every day. “He asks me how I am, gives me weather updates and tells me about his other children,” — standard dad behaviour — “On the days he doesn’t text, I get worried and call him,” she says. This friendship that took root in Chennai, will blossom in Bengaluru – for Deepthi, too, is moving with her family to the Garden City. And once in the same city again, they plan to finally meet.    Nijith M, a commando with the Central Reserve Police Force in Kashmir, and his elder brother Nijesh VP, also a commandant with the CRPF in Kashmir, were on leave during September-October 2020 and at home in Nadapuram, 63 kilometres from Kozhikode. When Nijesh started running a fever, Nijith tried contacting a hospital in Nadapuram, but was told that all vehicles were on calls. “I was given the number of a woman ambulance driver who stayed near our village in Vilangad,” he says. Fifteen minutes after he called her, Deepa Joseph, the first woman to drive an ambulance in Kerala, was at his house, wearing her PPE kit. She rushed Nijesh to the hospital where he was found to be COVID-19 positive. They advised her to take him to Kozhikode. “Deepa immediately contacted me and apprised me of the situation. She comforted me and told me that she would be taking him to Vadakara or Kozhikode. Since I was in quarantine, I sought the help of our friends to help my brother,” he says. By the time, the brothers’ friends reached there, Deepa had already ensured that Nijesh was admitted and given emergency treatment. “No matter where we are posted, we keep in touch with Deepa. She was our super hero that night when we were in dire straits. We WhatsApp each other once in a while,” says Nijith. Like him there are many who owe their life to this plucky woman. Thirty-six-year-old Deepa makes light of her work. She says she took up driving to make ends meet when she separated from her husband in 2013. “I was working as a bus driver of Puliyavu National Arts and Science College when the pandemic forced the Government to shut down all educational institutions. I had to look for a job,” she recalls. She began driving an ambulance at Pranavam Trust in August 2020 and has transported hundreds of patients with COVID-19 to the hospital since then. Many of those she transported to hospitals in a race against time keep in touch with her. “It feels great when I realise that I was able to help them,” she says, adding, “I don’t stop at reaching my passengers to hospitals. I ensure they receive medical attention and inform their relatives. In my village, the residents see me as their daughter or elder sister.” Input bySaraswathy Nagarajan    Life turned upside down for Prasanna Athi in February 2021. Even as she was settling into her lovingly decorated home in Washington, unforeseen visa issues meant she had to leave her job, her partner, family and friends, pack her bags and move back to Hyderabad with little to no warning. Uprooted and in between jobs, with no clarity on where she would be spending the rest of the year, there was a group of people anchoring her through this instability. Having joined a Covid squad by people from IIIT in early May, she found that helping others put her personal distress to temporary rest. “Everything in my life was uncertain at that point. And then I found this group with whom I would spend 12-15 hours a day on calls... people from all walks of life bringing in different skills to fight the pandemic,” she says. So overwhelming was the work, that the squad organised regular ‘chill sessions’ where they could forget everything and open up about their personal lives. “These sessions would start around 11pm and go on until 4am on some days,” she recalls, “We would even have dinner together.” When the group met for the first time in real life, it was to celebrate one of the volunteer’s NEET result. “We just picked up from where we left on calls, it was that effortless” says Prasanna. They held sleepovers, played badminton at 3am, watched cricket matches together, and sent each other food — their friendship based not on common tastes in movies or music, but on being open enough to experience what the other person likes. Three days before Prasanna left for Singapore for her new job, she met the squad one last time at a friend’s wedding. “I was very emotional because they were a major part of my 2021 journey. Since undergrad, I don’t think I have met people who I know will be there with me for a lifetime. To be able to say that about these guys is something rare and special,” she says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/friendships-forged-in-fire/article38075317.ece

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Full throttle||First meetings aren’t always the best. Tamil filmmaker H Vinoth knows that well. He first met actor Ajith Kumar fresh on the heels of his successful 2017 Karthi-starrer Theeran: Adhigaaram Ondru . At that time, Vinoth was selling the actor a script that featured a protagonist with shades of grey. Ajith, however, was not too keen on that, but insisted on remaking Hindi hit Pink in Tamil. “He wanted to do something I felt I was incapable of attempting,” laughs Vinoth, over a telephone chat, “That meeting didn’t go well.” But that is now history. Today, Vinoth has become one of Ajith’s favourite directors and is fast rising to be among Kollywood’s popular filmmakers. He has already finished two films with the star: Nerkonda Paarvai, the remake of Pink he finally ended up doing, and upcoming Pongal release Valimai , touted to be one of the biggest projects of 2022. The story does not end there: Vinoth will again team up with Ajith and producer Boney Kapoor for their next project, which makes it three consecutive projects from the same team. Excerpts from an interview with the 40-year-old filmmaker, who seems to be on a dream run in Tamil cinema: Take us back to the day when you first narrated the script of Valimai to Ajith... I narrated a one-liner of the story. He was impressed that it was socially responsible and was sure that it would turn out to be a film that would entertain all audiences. The last film you worked with him was a remake...was there inherent pressure to make Valimai more “mass”?  No, there wasn’t. The story we selected in the first place had all the elements of a mass, commercial entertainer. There is a real-life connect to the storyline, we hear...  As the subject features bikes prominently, we started researching and stumbled upon the story of how late CM Jayalalithaa directly appointed a racer as a policeman. We tried scouting for him in order to hear his life story, but we couldn’t track him down. We have taken that one incident as a small inspiration for Valimai . What do you think Ajith liked most in you to team up for three back-to-back projects?  Well, he has done it before, with director Siva (Ajith did Veeram , Vivegam and Viswasam with Siva). If Ajith feels comfortable with a person, he likes working with them continuously. I have myself told him this many times: ‘Sir, you should work with other directors too. Many assistant directors have written stories for you. If you work with them, they will also get a bright future, just like me’. He agrees with that, and he is meeting many other directors too, but he believes that there should be a spark for it to come together as a project. How happy are you making a film that has a lot riding on its star value?  I am fully aware of that, and the challenge is to tap into that as effectively as possible. I am not here to take cinema to the next level. I am here to take my life to the next level, and I have chosen this as my path for that. It is a simple demand-supply concept: working with a star, knowing what he wants and what his fans and audiences want, and delivering that to the best of my capabilities.  As a filmgoer, what about cinema fascinated you the most during your growing-up years?   I was a big Rajinikanth fan during my younger days. Till the release of Padayappa , I have queued up for FDFS tickets outside theatres. You should see the scene after the jostle of tickets is over...there would be a hundred slippers strewn everywhere near the counter. There would be so much excitement then.  Do you think the pandemic has changed the way films are being thought of, and shot?   The first time the world spoke about social distancing, as filmmakers, we were thinking about how to film the lead pair standing next to each other, and how to shoot crowds. We have moved a long way since then, as we have realised that there are plenty of ways to execute things. The pandemic has taught filmmakers to do things that we already did in a more effective manner, keeping in mind safety protocols.  When you entered the film industry, you would have had certain dreams. Do you think you have achieved all of them?   I will not describe myself as a filmmaker with a lot of passion for cinema. I treat it purely as a profession. I do not have any big dreams; all I want is to ensure that the producer makes enough and the audience who pays for the film leaves the hall satisfied and entertained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/full-throttle/article38075376.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Grains of goodness||Some of India’s precious native rice varieties — parakkum chittu, ilupai poo samba and Rajamudi— call out to visitors at Vilvah Agro, a new zero-waste store at Race Course. Curious, the visitors make a beeline to the rice section where the varieties are stored in tall glass canisters. “This is our objective — to get people talking about native rice varieties,” says Kruthika Kumaran, founder of Vilvah that stocks over 40 indigenous white, brown, red and black rice grains including Athur kichili samba, hand-pounded raw rice, poongar, and thooyamalli. Traditionally, each rice variety was used for specific purposes depending on the growing season or climate. While some varieties like kuzhiyadichan can withstand drought, the kattuyanam grows tall providing enough hay for fodder. “Each variety brings a unique character and health benefits to the table. There are short grains, long grains, and aromatic ones. The paal kudaivazhai, as the name indicates, benefits lactating mothers, while Rajamudi rice (a variety from Karnataka favoured by the Wodeyar kings) improves bone strength, and thooyamalli, a short-grain white rice with rich fibre content controls blood sugar levels. The grains have relatively lower glycaemic index and boast a rich micronutrient profile.” Passion for agriculture Kruthika and her husband Tamil Kumaran are from a farming background. “We have never consumed store-bought rice. We source them from our farms, but they are mostly the hybrid ones. As an experiment, we started growing karuppu kavuni, a variety preferred in Tamil Nadu, at our 40-acre farm in Gobichettipalayam, near Coimbatore. Now, we have added about 15 varieties.” The couple also networks with over 15 farmers from across India to source indigenous varieties, like Dehradun basmati rice or Katarni from Bihar. Currently, the store has seven varieties of fragrant rice like the mullan kaima from Wayanad, Kerala that is used to make the fragrant Malabar biriyani. The vellai milagu samba grown in Tamil Nadu and parts of Sri Lanka has grains that resemble pepper. And the aromatic gandhasaale cultivated in Wayanad that gives out a heavenly fragrance. Kruthika says that many traditional varieties are dying out because farmers have stopped saving seeds. “We want to carry forward this heritage by saving native seeds. This can happen when consumers try out diverse varieties encouraging farmers to grow them.” Agro is the latest addition to Vilvah, the parent brand that specialises in organic skin care and hair care products. The rustic life “We have a curated collection of products like yoga mats, herbal dyed towels and handwoven vetiver footwear under Vilvah Life. We are working with rural communities that make natural dyes in Dindigul, and jamakkalam weavers in Bhavani and Komarapalayam. An in-house design team from NIFT take charge of creative ideas.” There are plans to convert the store into a rice museum. “We already have heritage walk teams visiting the store to know about the history. We want to encourage people to consume these grains. Since it takes time to cook these varieties, they can start by using red rice to make idli, adai or dosai batter.”  Prices start at Rs. 85 and go up to Rs. 500 for varieties like bamboo rice.

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||museums matter||Ever since it re-opened in May 2021, the Kerala Museum, one of the oldest in Kochi, located amid greenery in the heart of Edappally, has become increasingly busy during weekends. “With almost two years of being cooped up indoors, glued to their screens, visitors seem to like the idea of being back in a green, open space, where they can take in the quietude and bring children too,” says Aditi Nayar, the museum’s director. COVID-19 had devastating consequences for museums. Footfalls vanished, revenues plunged, and even the well-funded ones had to slash their payroll. But it also forced museums to rethink their fundamental purpose and identity. ‘What should a museum be in the post-pandemic world?’ is a question that museum directors across the world ponder on. It has been a few months since museums have reopened in India. Two key things that have helped them adapt to the post-pandemic world are having a strong digital presence and increased community engagement. Digitally stronger Spread over three buildings with 39 galleries, an in-person tour of the Salar Jung Museum in Hyderabad takes about half a day. As of July this year, the museum has digitised more than 47,000 of its artefacts but the museum’s director Nagender Reddy wants to encourage in-person visits, while keeping the pandemic in mind. On October 18, Salar Jung Museum launched an audio-guide app that invites a plug-and-play approach to a more physically-distanced tour, working with unique QR codes only available in the museum’s various galleries. Last year, the museum also partnered with Google Arts and Culture to showcase its prominent setup such as the interactive dissection of Raja Ravi Varma’s Disappointed and a comprehensive breakdown of Indian Epics in Art, comprising folk images from the Chitrakathi tradition of Paithan, Maharashtra. This technological shift has helped not only established museums, but also newer ones waiting in the wings. The Museum of Art and Photography (MAP) in Bengaluru, for instance, has 12 exhibits, even though its launch was deferred to 2022. It has been hosting a slew of online events over the last two years. Indian Music Experience (IME), another museum in Bengaluru, has three online exhibitions on Google Arts and Culture, including one dedicated to the late sitar legend Ravi Shankar on his 100th birth anniversary last year. Starting with Birdsong, which will be IME’s first physical exhibition in 2022, every exhibition the museum organises will also be available online, promises its director Manasi Prasad. Though their online programming started well, the audience for concerts and workshops declined this year, probably due to screen fatigue. Despite this, IME plans to continue its online offerings. “People don’t log into an event while it’s happening. But they watch it later. [These videos] are free resources they can refer to whenever they want,” says Manasi. The Kerala Museum is currently digitising its art collection. The exhibits will go online by the end of January 2022. Descriptions of the original works of art will be available for public viewing, along with curated stories of each of the 200 artworks on display. “All the well-funded museums are strengthening their digital presence. They are shifting most of their exhibitions online. This would not have happened or would have happened very slowly without the pandemic,” says Reena Dewan, the former president of the International Council for Museums (ICOM) India and the director of Kolkata Centre for Creativity (KCC). With the community Museums are starting to realise the significance of community engagement upon resumption after lockdowns. From being exclusionary spaces involving people from the art community and academia, they are opening up for participation from the public. IME, for instance, hosted a free open-mic during this year’s Navaratri wherein anyone from the public could perform. IME has partnered with the British Council to create a series of youth engagement initiatives. The museum has a Youth Advisory Board, wherein teenagers participate in the decision-making. This board advises the museum on how to improve its programming. One of its suggestions, for instance, is to do something on K-Pop. In a different attempt to reach out, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS), Mumbai, which turns 100 next year, announced the Adopt A Museum Artefact initiative. The adopters’ names were displayed near their respective artefacts and at the museum’s entrance. “Hundreds of Mumbaikars and some from Ahmedabad and Delhi came forward to support this initiative. They helped us raise Rs. 5 crore,” says Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Director-General of CSMVS. The Kerala Government is promoting a movement to make museums function as interactive spaces for youth. Keralam Museum, an organisation formed to build and modernise museums, has realised 11 of the 31 projects it initiated. “While well-funded museums, State- and private-owned, are burgeoning their digital presence and implementing community outreach plans, many small museums struggle for survival,” says Reena. This is where collaborations helped. During the World Heritage Week between November 19 to 25, for instance, KCC in collaboration with Paschimbanga Sangrahalaya Samiti organised the Cluster of Museums Exhibitions. The programme aimed to reimagine the future of museums through discussions, exhibitions, performances, workshops and film screenings over the week. “We invited 16 museums from Bengal, including the small ones. And it created a ripple effect. Now, people in Gujarat and Jammu University also want to host these kinds of events involving the smaller museums,” says Reena. As museums adapt to the new normal, they find it necessary to talk to the community and to each other. The pandemic has also nudged people to look at these spaces with renewed appreciation. “Culture is as important as health,” says Sabyasachi. “If you ignore culture, you are ignoring a significant part of being human.”  With inputs fromDivya Kala BhavaniandAnasuya Menon   Adopting art The pandemic was not merely a healthcare crisis. It created a ripple of crises that affected almost everything, including institutions of culture. Due to the financial upheaval it caused, many museums across the world had to sell some of their artworks to take care of the rest of their collections. This list included some of the world’s most renowned museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City (aka The Met). But the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS) in Mumbai came up with theidea to preserve their collection during a precarious time. The museum, which turns 100 next year, announced the Adopt a Museum Artefact initiative, wherein people could adopt its centuries-old artefacts. The adopters’ names were displayed near their respective artefacts and at the museum’s entrance. “Hundreds of Mumbaikars and some from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, and Delhi came forward to support this initiative. They helped us raise Rs. 5 crore,” says Sabyasachi Mukherjee, the Director-General of CSMVS, who headed this initiative. “When I shared this story with my foreign colleagues, they were pleasantly surprised to know that this was successful.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/museums-matter/article38075354.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Her world through his eyes||Clad in a sari, her hair in a neat braid, an umbrella peeping from her handbag slung across her shoulder, a resolute stride: think Vasanth S Sai’s film heroine and this is the image that comes to mind. She is always on the move: on her way to catch a bus to work; riding a scooter to keep an appointment with someone… In his latest Sivaranjiniyum Innum Sila Pengalum too, she is constantly on her feet. The film, that released on SonyLIV last month, is among the most talked-about ones of the year. “I don’t think I would have been this happy about the film’s reception even if it had had a theatrical release,” says Vasanth, who was in Coimbatore to take part in the Vishnupuram Literary Circle’s award event. Vasanth admits he was initially bent on the film being shown on the big screen. “The film’s journey began in 2018 when it won the Gender Equality award at the Mumbai Film Festival. From there, it travelled to film festivals across the world in 2019, and was the first Tamil film to be screened at most of them. I had to give it space for this travel,” he adds. By the time he readied it for release towards the end of 2019, the pandemic struck. Vasanth finally decided to release it on OTT, since he felt “it would get old” otherwise. OTT, he feels, “is a welcome change for films that have serious themes. The platforms help viewers see important films with deep concentration, enjoy the many nuances they offer.”  Sivaranjiniyum …is an anthology, featuring three 40-minute films, each of which is based on stories by master Tamil writers Ashokamitran, Aadhavan, and B Jeyamohan. The cast includes actors Parvathy Thiruvothu, Lakshmi Priyaa Chandramouli, and Kalieswari Srinivasan. The film explores the world of three married women: their desires, dreams, and little joys often swept under the carpet knowingly or unknowingly by the men in their lives. It makes for a powerful social commentary, one that Vasanth says takes root in filmmaker K Balachander’s school of thought, whom he considers his inspiration. Critical thinking The women in Vasanth’s stories shine with personality traits he admires in women in his life. “This can be confidence, kindness, and perseverance despite their struggles. For a lot of women, it is never this or that. It is this and that.” Sivaranjiniyum ... ultimately, explains Vasanth, talks about how women, in order to make people in their lives happy, often fail to make themselves happy. “It shows that you too are important. Your happiness matters,” he says. Vasanth’s questions on society’s unfair standards for women started when he was as young as 10 years old. “When I was a little boy, Sunday mornings were meant to play street cricket. But that was when my mother would send me on chores. We lived in Alwarpet then and she would ask me to accompany my college-going sister when she went to get Zoology notes from her friend. I found this odd: I was just 10, but here I was, expected to escort my sister just because I was a male,” he says. Gradually, as he grew older, and started reading, he found the answers. Reading shaped his thinking, and Vasanth says it is his mother who initiated him into literature. “The very thought of my mother brings to mind the image of her seated on an easy-chair with a book,” he recalls. “She would send me to a library in Nandanam when I was in Class V or VI to borrow books for her,” he says. “Mother would instruct me to look for titles by Sivasankari, Indhumathi, Soodamani, and Anuthama.” When he started reading later on, the names came rushing back. Vasanth started writing in his undergraduate years. He wrote short-stories, did a stint as a freelance journalist, and even set-up a small library at home. In fact, it is his love for literature that brought him to Coimbatore to participate at the Vishnupuram literary event held recently. “I spent the whole day listening to young and senior writers talk. I enjoy this,” he says. He hopes to share all that he learns with people. “This is my philosophy. Since I am a film maker, I do so through my films.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/her-world-through-his-eyes/article38075362.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Startups take on the pandemic||Krishna Reddy G lost his diabetic father to COVID-19 during the first wave. Travelling from their village to nearby Tadripati in the Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh to pick up his diabetes medicine, his father fell ill and within days, was gone. The sudden loss sent Krishna into depression. But months later, after witnessing people in the nearby villages struggling to procure essentials in the midst of the pandemic, Krishna decided to create something in his father’s memory. Krishna and long-time colleague Paramesh Gandlu left their Big Tech jobs and founded KarryNow in April 2021 to create a seamless line of transportation between villages and nearby towns. Through multiple experiments with village leaders and word-of-mouth grassroots marketing, KarryNow was able to scale up quickly. Since its inception, the startup has partnered with 130 villages across the State. In the same ‘quick commerce’ realm of KarryNow, Chennai-based Boonbox has also stepped up to deliver essential goods and provide rural aid to rural areas; the startup had already established a considerable and trusting network across Tamil Nadu, and 15 other states. Meanwhile in Gujarat, vegetable farmer-vendor Sarojben from Bhuteshwari village of Gandhinagar district was eager to make profits from a bumper harvest of produce which she started selling in February 2020. But then the lockdowns brought about transport shutdowns and endless red tape of permissions to sell vegetables at Agriculture Produce Market, Dehgam, which closed for many days. Refusing to give up, she approached Padma Shri awardee Reema Nanavaty’s NGO Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), which partnered with WhatsApp to facilitate an end-to-end effective business model, connecting women farmers to customers in urban areas without physical contact. The goal was to ensure that farmers get market rates for their produce, and to create a business model that is easy to understand by everyone involved. While the pandemic highlighted the massive digital divide between urban and rural India, technologists (startups, incubators and Big Tech) have been working diligently to close this gap, choosing to work with neighbouring villages, explaining why India was named the third largest startup ecosystem in the world — just this year, Indian startups bagged a record US$36 billion in funding this year alone. A growing online presence Krishna is certain that the solution he and his partner Paramesh came up with would not be possible without the current state of Internet penetration across the country; a model like this would not have been viable 10 years ago. Similarly, Reema explains, “For the informal working women sector, innovation is a coping strategy for survival. Part of that is using more technology they are already comfortable with and for millions, in our context, this meant using WhatsApp. We started with a WhatsApp group with farmers working near Ahmedabad and potential customers. This helped connect the two and create an enterprise. Now, the model has evolved to see 200 vegetable growers selling directly to customers.” “In our early research we found that around 60% of the villagers in Anantapur use smartphones while a large portion of the rest use a keypad phone,” says Krishna. “Through our chats with residents, we found out that a vernacular app would best serve everyone, so at the end of December 2021, we are launching the app officially.” Trumping the distance The pandemic ensured that even the smallest distances between cities and nearby settlements felt vast. But companies like WhatsApp, Haryana-based fintech startup RBP Finivis and KarryNow as well as NGOs like SEWA make sure that this is addressed. Sam Gupta, CEO and founder of RBP Finivis, explains, “Often times, people in rural areas depend on cash-in-hand, and during the pandemic, it is not easy to travel to nearby towns for withdrawals and not a lot of people in these areas have confidence to use digital payment apps or use a debit card. To help them through a stressful time, we eliminate that pressure.” The machines are across the Northeast, North and Delhi-NCR to set some grounding, but they have plans to expand nationally. SEWA wanted to make sure that the produce of cherry, strawberry and apple farmers in Kashmir produce did not go waste due to the halted central supply chains. They helped these women farmers build their own decentralised supply chain and build relationships with customers. “We sent customers pictures of women farmers plucking and sorting the various fresh fruits. This was a great motivator to get a new market going and also be transparent about the fruits’ state,” says Reema. This growing trust, in spite of physical distance, has seen SEWA help bring 2,000 kilograms of cherries and strawberries and 15,000 kilograms of apples to Ahmedabad. By 2030, KarryNow hopes to work with 6,00,000 villages in India, creating more rural entrepreneurs and employees. “Startup founders in the last year have had to be problem solvers,” concludes Krishna, “and the pandemic presented countless different problems for everyone. Startups now solve two or three problems at the same time — the new norm for business and tech.”  Future forward WhatsApp partnered with a number of NGOs including SEWA, MannDeshi and Robinhood Army to foster more skill-building and create more hyperlocal entrepreneurs, without overwhelming people with hordes of technical lingo. WhatsApp is also kicking off its own startup incubator in 2022. The Rural Access Coalition is the result of a union between three rural-tech startups (last-mile distribution company Frontier Markets, agri-tech firm HESA and social impact company 1Bridge) to collectively uplift the post-COVID depreciating infrastructures across Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan and Karnataka. Hyderabad-based cybercrime startup Cyber Jagrithi has been creating awareness in Telangana’s villages about general digital hygiene and vaccine misinformation, given the spread of fake news about COVID-19 and the increasing number of online scams. Law and justice platform Agami pivoted to fill the information gap that existed in rural communities, creating ruralindia.help that currently has 845 initiatives across 30 states. The system is a central hub for people in cities to find and support rural COVID responses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/startups-take-on-the-pandemic/article38075363.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Kavya gallops to victory||Kavya Gopal, 20 years old, made Chennai proud by securing an individual gold as well as a team gold medal at the Junior National Equestrian Championship (JNEC) in Mumbai, with a groundbreaking score of 73.3475. She leads a pack of successful Chennai riders, who added to the city’s tally with a host of gold, silver and bronze medals. While Kavya’s individual gold medal was in the Young Rider Dressage category, her gold in Team Dressage was won along with Ariana Dhond, Tiyasha Vathul and Vibhu Rastogi. After three years of taking part in every JNEC, Kavya finally clinched her first-ever silver medal (team) in 2020. She made a powerful comeback for this year’s JNEC with more rigorous training and an unyielding attitude. The 2021 edition took place in Mumbai from December 17 to December 30, with riders from all parts of the country and their horses. Kavya’s horse — or “soulmate”, as many competitive riders call their steed — was Sechs Richtige, imported from Germany. She had the chance to practise with him only for five or six months prior to the championship, after he arrived in the country. About a month-and-a-half of her training period was spent just on building a connection with Sechs Richtige and getting to know his movements, she says. It helped that Kavya has been riding since the age of 12, and over the years has grown fond of animals. Riding a plethora of diverse horses in her growing years, Kavya has acquired the ability to understand the temperament of each horse and in turn, learn from it. “We connect instantly and can understand each other. We are inseparable,” as Kavya fondly explains the bond she shares with Sechs Richtige, it becomes clear why riders use the endearment ‘soulmate’ for their horses in the stable. “The partnership between Sechs Richtige and I in the competition was so graceful; he gave me moments to cherish for a lifetime,” she says. Kavya underlines that her victory was made possible only with the support of her seasoned coach, Isabelle Futnani: “She handheld me and groomed me into a better rider. Sechs Richtige and I clicked in no time with her complete guidance and training.”  The partnership between Sechs Richtige and I in the competition was so graceful; he gave me moments to cherish for a lifetime Kavya Gopal   About a month-and-a-half of her training period was spent just on building a connection with Sechs Richtige and getting to know his movements||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/kavya-gallops-to-victory/article38075365.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Making of a native superhero||The making of techie-turned-film director Basil Joseph’s third film Minnal Murali is as much a story of challenges and determination as the narrative of any superhero movie. As the Christmas film soars high on Netflix, it affirms the faith Basil and his team had in the script written by Arun Anirudhan and Justin Mathew. In the making for nearly three years, Basil says they were aware of the hurdles to make a ‘superhero film’. He says, “It was the success of My Dear Kuttichathan (1984) that inspired me to dare dream of a film like Minnal Murali .” The concept of a native superhero was scenarist Arun’s. He narrated a story about a youngster, a tailor called Jaison in Kurukkanmoola, a village, who acquires superpowers after he is struck by lightning. On Basil’s suggestion, Justin was taken on board as co-writer. They worked on the script for nearly a year to come up with an interesting screenplay. “It was not easy to come up with a hero like Minnal Murali, enacted by Tovino Thomas, a grounded, common man who could strike a chord with viewers. We knew that they would immediately compare it with superhero films from Marvel and DC.” The team was aware that though the budget was extravagant for a Malayalam film, it would come nowhere near the budget of a Hollywood film. VFX, action sequences and costume were worked out in detail before the film went on floors. “If the VFX had looked cartoonish, the film would have fallen flat. The action scenes had to be different from the usual stunt scenes. There had be exaggeration but it had to measure up to international standards,” he recollects. Another challenge was designing the costume. Graphic artist Pavi Shankar designed the costume in red and blue and it was executed by Mumbai-based costume designer Deepali Noor. The team’s challenges multiplied once the pandemic interrupted shoot. “The film included crowds, a large crew, night shooting and wide frames. We wondered if we would have to compromise on some of the scenes.” To make matters worse, a set was vandalised, a first for Malayalam cinema, and the location had to be moved to Hassan in Karnataka. The long gap in between schedules created other problems. “Some actors had gained weight, while others had lost kilos. I can now laugh at it all because we were able to complete the film the way we visualised it. By then, Minnal Murali was no longer a project; it had become an emotion for us. That helped us overcome all the challenges.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/making-of-a-native-superhero/article38075381.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Planting stories||In November 2019, when Aizawl-based Lalhruaitluanga Chawngte created a bookshelf attached to the roadside compound wall of his home, he was nervous. Yet he went ahead with the Little Library because he wanted to inculcate the habit of readingamong children. The library began with 35 books that he owned, mostly for light reading. While there had been similar mini libraries outside the Mizoram State Library, Chawngte — a journalist with The Mizoram Post — wanted to make them easily accessible, especially to children in his locality. With no librarians, membership fee, or time limits on borrowing, the free library includes Mizo and English language books. Popular choice Chawngte says he was inspired to set up the Little Library after he read about such libraries in the US and Europe. Now, two years later, the Little Library has grown manifold in Aizawl, and spread to nearly 20 villages in Mizoram. The library now has more than 1,000 books, all sourced through contributions from friends and well-wishers. Chawngte is delighted: “As a citizen, I wanted to contribute to society and as a writer of three books (in the Mizo language) I could think of no better way to re-introduce the habit of book reading. Children have lost touch with the beauty of reading books for leisure. When I started the library, a lot of curious people simply looked at it and walked past. However, within a day I was delighted to see school children stopping by to check out the books on the shelf.” Chawngte’s idea also paid off well as several individuals and organisations borrowed the concept and started similar little libraries in their own neighbourhoods and villages. “It gives me joy when people call or write to me seeking my approval to replicate the idea. I believe that good multiplies when shared. So, I don’t stop anyone who wants to replicate it as long as it helps develop the habit of reading books.” With Northeast India prone to heavy rainfall, what happens to the books during the monsoon? Chawngte assures that though the libraries are made with concrete and are covered, they still don’t take a chance. “On days with extreme weather, the books are brought indoors.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/planting-stories/article38075355.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Remember the Luna?||A petite 50cc lightweight bike, the Luna became the vehicle of choice for mothers dropping their kids to school, the only affordable moped you could purchase with a first salary in the ‘70s, a cross between a cycle and a motorcycle. The diminutive vehicle has made countless memories for families across India, but this particular one, owned by collector Vinit Kenjale, also managed to race a train. “This was in the mid-’70s. Our Luna took on the heavyweight Deccan Queen. Both started at 7.20 am for Dadar station, and the Luna beat the Deccan Queen by 20 minutes. It was unbelievable!” Kenjale’s eyes light up as he recounts this and other stories of the 550 mopeds, motorcycles and scooters, he proudly owns, and will soon put on display in Mahabaleshwar at the end of 2021, at Vintage Miles, India’s first museum dedicated to its two-wheeled wonders. “Soon, India is going to transition to electric scooters, and I want to tell the story of our two-wheelers, from when you could hear them before you laid eyes on them. There was a certain charm to the kickstart or your friends pushing your moped and later, scooter, to start it. Each of the bikes I have collected from people across India has a story to tell,” explains Kenjale, who currently houses his impressive two-wheeler collection at a shed close to his home in Pune. “I have a crew of old mechanics who are familiar with two wheelers from the 1960s-70s. They love working on the mopeds, creating spare parts, polishing them to a shine, or just hearing the engines revv again.” What started as a hobby collection in 1986 soon took up all the space in Kenjale’s yard. He realised that other Pune households faced a similar issue — garages cluttered with unused old vehicles owners refused to part with, for sentimental reasons. The museum, Vintage Miles, has been decades in the making. Spread over a large plot in Mahabaleshwar, the impressive collection will be organised in three sheds: one each for mopeds, scooters and motorcycles. “The idea is to have audio-visual aids for visitors, so they can experience what these vehicles sound like on the road. Some vehicles will be available for experiences and rides as well. I want to keep the ticket sales affordable,” adds Kenjale, whose collection has been featured in the Limca Book of Records in 2018. “I was featured on a show on The History Channel and that brought a lot of inquiries from across India; owners wanted their vehicles to get a second life at the museum, rather than lie unused in the parking lot,” adds Kenjale. While most vehicles in the collection are from Maharashtra, Kenjale organises and pays for the transport if the two wheelers are from out of State. From the oldest — a military green Matchless (1930) — to the Innocenti B-125, with a visible chassis, that was a pet project to refurbish, Kenjale’s penchant for mopeds and scooters is evident. “Theytake you back to simpler times,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/remember-the-luna/article38075349.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Let the words find you||Poetry hides in plain sight. Inspiration can be discovered in receipts, spam emails and to-do lists, according to followers of ‘found poetry,’ a literary trend fuelled by the pandemic. Known as ‘poetic collage’ to some, and ‘remix poetry’ to others, a found poem is created by borrowing words, phrases and sentences from other sources or ‘texts’ and reframing them, imparting new meaning in the process. Words from a passage may be blacked out, or fresh words added, to reinterpet the text. The style is considered an outcome of Dadaism, a European art movement that surfaced in the wake of the First World War. “What is not a found poem?” asks Chennai-based poet K Srilata. Stating that all the words and sentences present in our head have been derived from elsewhere, she says, “In a sense, all poetry is found poetry... It is the juxtaposition of a new context against an old one that makes it ‘found’”. Shloka Shankar, a Bengaluru-based found poet and poetry instructor, acknowledges that although this style of verse is considered novel in India, the genre has enjoyed a gradual growth in interest. “Although it is more popular abroad, it has been picking up in India over the past year and a half”, she says. Her found poetry workshop Poetry is Everywhere is evidence of this. When she launched it in May 2020, little did she imagine that her pilot project would generate nearly 200 registrations. Today, she conducts hour-long virtual workshops on found poetry, and is all set to launch full-fledged four-week long workshops early next year. It is no surprise that since the onset of the pandemic, poetry has come to the rescue of those processing stress and gloom. Addressing its therapeutic power, Srilata claims that writing is a way of staying hopeful. “We turn to poetry not for sympathy, but when we just want to be seen and heard,” she says. She believes that this format is particularly useful in articulating life as it treats poetry as a conversation. Rohini Kejriwal, writer and founder of The Alipore Post, a community of writers and artists, says that found poetry has seen a reemergence during the pandemic. Her workshops, which she calls “meditative exercises”, give participants the chance to look at a page and find things that others cannot. Yet, Rohini believes that it is the words that find the poet. “The words come to you in very strange ways. They help you feel what is going on internally through the verses you find,” she says. The genre is also a stressbuster as it shifts the onus from ‘writing’ to ‘finding’; there is less scope for error since the lines and phrases in a found poem are borrowed. This release from the pressure of originality can be liberating, especially during the pandemic, when days may seem monotonous. As Rohini says, “Poetry has always been about escaping the world and meeting myself on a page”. Talking about poetry as a coping mechanism, Shloka recalls an instance from a workshop conducted by The Poeming in October 2020 where participants were told to create a found poem sourced from Michael Crichton’s 1990 novel Jurassic Park . All the participants composed found poems based on the pandemic. “Subconsciously, all of us had been thinking about the pandemic,” she says. Ramanujam Iyengar, an amateur poet who began dabbling in found poetry during the pandemic, says that it helped him merge his love for writing with another art form — doodling. The visual element of the form has given him scope to augment the appeal of one through the other. “It is very immersive as a creative medium”, he says, adding that digital art and online spaces have been an excellent productive outlet for him during the pandemic. Happy tool The rising interest in poetry during the pandemic led poet Aswin Vijayan to The Quarantine Train, an online poetry community of which he is the managing editor. “It has been a happy tool for those who cannot find the right words”, he says, calling found poetry “a type of ventriloquism”. “It can be used effectively in any context where you feel trapped and wordless. You borrow words and insert your emotions into it,” he says. The core appeal, however, lies in its malleability. It can take the shape of a haiku, a sonnet or an acrostic. Even when inspired by the same source, the poem’s contours are sculpted by each poet’s present frame of mind and approach to the text. Similarly, the community fostered by The Alipore Post is an active mix of students and professionals, aged between 11 and 30, while The Quarantine Train has drawn participation from those older than 18. Although both have largely been operating online, they are eager to shift to offline forums. The Quarantine Train hopes to establish local chapters and initiate offline meetings, while The Alipore Post is set to host a day-long event in 2022 for poets, musicians and artists. “This pandemic has made poets out of us all,” says Rohini.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/let-the-words-find-you/article38075368.ece

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Empathy in the sunset years||“In our country, with the culture of the joint family disappearing due to various reasons, the percentage of elderly parents living by themselves has increased drastically. The pandemic has further aggravated their plight, and added another dimension to this issue,” says Sanjay Dattatri, author of The Home Stretch: Family Caregiver’s Handbook , (Penguin). Sanjay, a software engineer, in the last seven years has been working on various initiatives to make the lives of the elderly in India better. He has been running Old is Gold, a store exclusively for senior citizens, in Chennai for the past five years. He adds, “There was already a certain amount of isolation and with the pandemic they became completely left to themselves, with no visitors and they could not even seek any assistance from relatives or friends either.” “The pandemic has taken away the social life of the geriatric population and further isolated them in their twilight years.

The author had spent many years taking care of his bed-ridden mother; the book reflects his caregiving experience and interactions with doctors, counsellors, senior citizens and other caregivers.

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||A force to reckon with||Post the success of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion , filmmaker SS Rajamouli’s initial idea was to make a film free from visual effects and complicated stunt sequences. By his own admission, he wanted to make a story with a love quadrangle. But when he shared the idea with his wife, she asked him: “Who will watch the film, if you make a love story?” Crediting his wife and family for being his “harshest” critics, Rajamouli says he had to shoot the idea down. The filmmaker admits that he has a fascination for bringing two superpowers together ever since childhood. It was the emotional excitement of bringing Telugu superstars Jr NTR and Ram Charan that led to the journey of RRR, a film that has been in the making for close to three years. In RRR , Rajamouli reunites with his writer-father Vijayendra Prasad and composer MM Keeravani. Set in pre-Independence India, RRR is a fictional account of two freedom fighters Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Jr NTR). When Rajamouli was scripting the film, one of the things he insisted on was to ensure that the audience was on the edge of their seats every 10 minutes. Rajamouli, however, maintains that it is the underlying emotion that drives his narratives forward, which in turn drives the spectacle. Has he ever felt the emotion may get lost in the face of visual extravaganza? Driven by emotion “If the spectacle is there just for the sake of impressing the audience, then it will fall flat. If you take a song like ‘Naattu Koothu’ [from RRR ] which is an enjoyable, foot-tapping number, what drives me even in that song is the emotion,” says Rajamouli, during a recent press interaction in Chennai along with his actors, Jr NTR and Ram Charan.  For actors Jr NTR and Ram Charan, both of whom have worked with Rajamouli previously in Student No 1 and Magadheera , RRR was a homecoming in more than one way. Although Jr NTR admitted that both their families have been professional rivals for nearly three decades, he has always been friends with Charan and RRR gave them the opportunity to spend more time together. Asked if ever there was a sense of insecurity of being outperformed by the other actor, Jr NTR clarified that there was no room for such thoughts. “Let us say Charan gives a great shot today... I will have to live up to what he has done. Rajamouli will not leave until he extracts it from me,” says NTR with a laugh, “We have been chosen and guided by one of the most secure directors. So, there was no insecurity.” Ram Charan agrees. He says RRR ’s script made him feel secure as an actor. “The entire film is just beautifully-placed. It is not like NTR gets a great action scene and I will get one...it was never about those calculations.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-force-to-reckon-with/article38075380.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||sparrow nest||Chittukuruvigal Arakattalai Trust founded by N Dhanasekar has been working tirelessly for over a decade to bring sparrows back to Coimbatore. Besides conservation measures like awareness meetings, and camps at educational institutions and Government schools, they also distribute nest boxes and bird feeders to homes and institutions. The trust has also branched off into many sub-organisations that restore water bodies, promote green drives with native trees and in the process also conserve birdlife. Sparrow nests are in danger as high-rise buildings and modern concrete structures discourage nesting of birds. And, the solution lies in artificial nest boxes. Made of pine wood, it is designed to provide comfortable nesting. It can be kept on terraces, windows and compound walls. The opening to the nest is just about 1.5 inches. This will stop other predators like mynas, shikras and crows from entering the nest. There are discounts for the festive season. You can order the nest boxes at chitukuruvigalarakkattalai.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/sparrow-nest/article38075357.ece

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||museums matter||Ever since it reopened in May 2021, the Kerala Museum, one of the oldest in Kochi, located amid greenery in the heart of Edappally, has become increasingly busy during weekends. “With almost two years of being cooped up indoors, glued to their screens, visitors seem to like the idea of being back in a green, open space, where they can take in the quietude and bring children too,” says Aditi Nayar, the museum’s director. COVID-19 had devastating consequences for museums. Footfalls vanished, revenues plunged, and even the well-funded ones had to slash their payroll. But it also forced museums to rethink their fundamental purpose and identity. ‘What should a museum be in the post-pandemic world?’ is a question that museum directors across the world ponder on. It has been a few months since museums have reopened in India. Two key things that have helped them adapt to the post-pandemic world are having a strong digital presence and increased community engagement. Digitally stronger Spread over three buildings with 39 galleries, an in-person tour of the Salar Jung Museum in Hyderabad takes about half a day. As of July this year, the museum has digitised more than 47,000 of its artefacts but the museum’s director, Nagender Reddy, wants to encourage in-person visits, while keeping the pandemic in mind. On October 18, Salar Jung Museum launched an audio-guide app that invites a plug-and-play approach to a more physically-distanced tour, working with unique QR codes only available in the museum’s various galleries. Last year, the museum also partnered with Google Arts and Culture to showcase its prominent set-up such as the interactive dissection of Raja Ravi Varma’sDisappointedand a comprehensive breakdown of Indian Epics in Art, comprising folk images from the Chitrakathi tradition of Paithan, Maharashtra. This technological shift has helped not only established museums, but also newer ones waiting in the wings. The Museum of Art and Photography (MAP) in Bengaluru, for instance, has 12 exhibits, even though its launch was deferred to 2022. It has been hosting a slew of online events over the last two years. Indian Music Experience (IME), another museum in Bengaluru, has three online exhibitions on Google Arts and Culture, including one dedicated to the late sitar legend, Ravi Shankar, on his 100th birth anniversary last year. Starting with Birdsong, which will be IME’s first physical exhibition in 2022, every exhibition the museum organises will also be available online, promises its director Manasi Prasad. Though their online programming started well, the audience for concerts and workshops declined this year, probably due to screen fatigue. Despite this, IME plans to continue its online offerings. “People don’t log into an event while it’s happening. But they watch it later. [These videos] are free resources they can refer to whenever they want,” says Manasi. The Kerala Museum is currently digitising its art collection. The exhibits will go online by the end of January 2022. Descriptions of the original works of art will be available for public viewing, along with curated stories of each of the 200 artworks on display. “All the well-funded museums are strengthening their digital presence. They are shifting most of their exhibitions online. This would not have happened or would have happened very slowly without the pandemic,” says Reena Dewan, the former president of the International Council for Museums (ICOM) India and the director of Kolkata Centre for Creativity (KCC). With the community Museums are starting to realise the significance of community engagement upon resumption after lockdowns. From being exclusionary spaces involving people from the art community and academia, they are opening up for participation from the public. IME, for instance, hosted a free open-mic during this year’s Navaratri wherein anyone from the public could perform. IME has partnered with the British Council to create a series of youth engagement initiatives. The museum has a Youth Advisory Board, wherein teenagers participate in the decision-making. This board advises the museum on how to improve its programming. One of its suggestions, for instance, is to do something on K-pop. In a different attempt to reach out, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS), Mumbai, which turns 100 next year, announced the Adopt A Museum Artefact initiative. The adopters’ names were displayed near their respective artefacts and at the museum’s entrance. “Hundreds of Mumbaikars and some from Ahmedabad and Delhi came forward to support this initiative. They helped us raise Rs. 5 crore,” says Sabyasachi Mukherjee, Director-General of CSMVS. The Kerala Government is promoting a movement to make museums function as interactive spaces for the youth. Keralam Museum, an organisation formed to build and modernise museums, has realised 11 of the 31 projects it initiated. “While well-funded museums, State- and private-owned, are burgeoning their digital presence and implementing community outreach plans, many small museums struggle for survival,” says Reena. This is where collaborations helped. During the World Heritage Week between November 19 and 25, for instance, KCC in collaboration with Paschimbanga Sangrahalaya Samiti organised the Cluster of Museums Exhibitions. The programme aimed to reimagine the future of museums through discussions, exhibitions, performances, workshops and film screenings over the week. “We invited 16 museums from Bengal, including the small ones. And it created a ripple effect. Now, people in Gujarat and Jammu University also want to host these kinds of events involving the smaller museums,” says Reena. As museums adapt to the new normal, they find it necessary to talk to the community and to each other. The COVID-19 pandemic has also nudged people to look at these spaces with renewed appreciation. “Culture is as important as health,” says Sabyasachi. “If you ignore culture, you are ignoring a significant part of being human.”  (With inputs fromDivya Kala BhavaniandAnasuya Menon)   Adopting art The pandemic was not merely a healthcare crisis. It created a ripple of crises that affected almost everything, including institutions of culture. Due to the financial upheaval it caused, many museums across the world had to sell some of their artworks to take care of the rest of their collections. This list included some of the world’s most renowned museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City (aka The Met). But the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS) in Mumbai came up with theidea to preserve their collection during a precarious time. The museum, which turns 100 next year, announced the Adopt a Museum Artefact initiative, wherein people could adopt its centuries-old artefacts. The adopters’ names were displayed near their respective artefacts and at the museum’s entrance. “Hundreds of Mumbaikars and some from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, and Delhi came forward to support this initiative. They helped us raise Rs. 5 crore,” says Sabyasachi Mukherjee, the Director-General of CSMVS, who headed this initiative. “When I shared this story with my foreign colleagues, they were pleasantly surprised to know that this was successful.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/museums-matter/article38075950.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Planting stories||In November 2019, when Aizawl-based Lalhruaitluanga Chawngte created a bookshelf attached to the roadside compound wall of his home, he was nervous. Yet he went ahead with the Little Library because he wanted to inculcate the habit of reading among children. The library began with 35 books that he owned, mostly for light reading. While there had been similar mini libraries outside the Mizoram State Library, Chawngte — a journalist with The Mizoram Post — wanted to make them easily accessible, especially to children in his locality. With no librarians, membership fee, or time limits on borrowing, the free library includes Mizo and English language books. Popular choice Chawngte says he was inspired to set up the Little Library after he read about such libraries in the U.S. and Europe. Now, two years later, the Little Library has grown manifold in Aizawl, and spread to nearly 20 villages in Mizoram. The library now has more than 1,000 books, all sourced through contributions from friends and well-wishers. Chawngte is delighted: “As a citizen, I wanted to contribute to society and as a writer of three books (in the Mizo language) I could think of no better way to reintroduce the habit of book reading. Children have lost touch with the beauty of reading books for leisure. When I started the library, a lot of curious people simply looked at it and walked past. However, within a day I was delighted to see schoolchildren stopping by to check out the books on the shelf.” Chawngte’s idea also paid off well as several individuals and organisations borrowed the concept and started similar little libraries in their own neighbourhoods and villages. “It gives me joy when people call or write to me seeking my approval to replicate the idea. I believe that good multiplies when shared. So, I don’t stop anyone who wants to replicate it as long as it helps develop the habit of reading books,” he says. With northeast India prone to heavy rainfall, what happens to the books during the monsoon? Chawngte assures that though the libraries are made with concrete and are covered, they still don’t take a chance. “On days with extreme weather, the books are brought indoors,” he says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/planting-stories/article38075857.ece

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Some highs and a few lows||Aditya Madhavan chose Mayamalavagowla, a Melakarta raga, as the centrepiece of his concert. Nadanamakriya is derived from it, a raga with which Sunil Gargyan had begun his concert the previous evening. So, the latter’s ‘Intha paraka’ was far shorter compared to Aditya’s ‘Meru samana’. The concerts of these two youngsters, who belong to schools with similar musical traits, revealed the rich variety Carnatic music has on offer. Much before scaling the upper register of the Mayamalavagowla alapana, Aditya generated phrases dunked in delectable nasality, an unmistakable sign of his heritage, passed down from Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer’s disciple, Radha Namboodiri, Aditya’s guru during his formative Mumbai years. The Tyagaraja kriti followed conventional aesthetics even as some new-age ornamentations were obviously an influence of Sanjay Subrahmanyan, under whom the 25-year-old is now training. Sunil, a few months older than Aditya, has a robust voice. His ability for modulations came clear in softer treatment around, say, ‘Kanna talli’, as the gateway to the charanam of the opening item. Into the swaraprastara, his end-rally emphasis on the ‘pa’ had particular proximity to the enunciation of that note by Semmangudi, the guru of Sunil’s mentor P.S. Narayanaswamy. Flurry of brigas Thodi was Sunil’s main suite. The alapana was driven more often by a flurry of brigas typical of T.N. Seshagopalan. No coincidence. Given that one of Sunil’s teachers is P.B. Srirangachari, who learned under TNS. ‘Kundram kudikonda velava’ by Papanasam Sivan featured a niraval that Sunil sometimes struggled to tame. The package, overall pleasing, lasted 39 minutes and wound up with an Adi tala tani avartanam by M.S. Venkatasubramaniam (mridangam) and N. Sundar (morsing). The accompanists for the two vocalists M. Shrikanth (violin), Akshay Anand (mridangam) and Madipakkam Murali (ghatam) seldom disappointed. Still, if the two online shows got listless across certain long passages, it was because both vocalists sought to bite off more than they could chew. After the main piece, Aditya went for a Ragam Tanam Pallavi. The alapana rolled out Salakabhairavi, Vasanthabhairavi and Sindhubhairavi. All three ragas reappeared in that order down the subsequent segments. (The tanam strangely painted shades of Mukhari and even Bhairavi, inviting quizzical looks from Shrikanth). Again lasting 39 minutes, the vocalist rarely sounded in control, with an end round that turned out to be graceless acrobatics. Sunil faced a similar problem, but that was with a fairly simpler exercise — alapana of Bilahari. Fast vibrations popped up off-key notes in increasing frequencies, but they couldn’t dampen the vocalist. Violinist V. Deepika dodged the pitfalls and responded calmly. In her alapana, however, she faltered at least once. To his credit, Sunil did display high standard in his previous exposition. Poornashadjam came in full bloom through an alapana that revealed the core of the Natabhairavi-janya raga beyond what initially sounded like Manirangu punctuating Ritigowla. ‘Lavanya Rama’ was as beautiful as its lines — and Sunil looked settled after ‘Ethavuna Nerchitivo’ (Yadukula Kamboji), also by Tyagaraja. The Bilahari was sad, though the kriti (‘Paridanamichithe’) did salvaged it somewhat. The subsequent Vegavahini was avoidable owing to its near-duplication. The parent raga being Chakravakam, a key member of the morning raga family that includes Nadanamakriya — Sunil’s opening selection. Such replication crept into Aditya’s concert as wll: Vasanthabhairavi, when expanded in the RTP, embraced strains of the vocalist’s piece de resistance. Since, Mayamalavagowla isn’t that far off Vakulabharanam, from which is derived Vasanthabhairavi. Salakabhairavi being a janya of Karaharapriya gave Aditya’s penultimate Kapi-raga ‘Parulamata’ an awkward sense of déjà vu. Coincidentally, Sunil too sang this Subbaraya Iyer javali, escorting it to Mangalam, where the humble Surutti capped ‘Prahlada naradadi’ in Sourashtram. Again coincidentally, Aditya’s second composition was in Sourashtram. The invocatory ‘Saranu Siddhi Vinayaka’ (Purandaradasa) bore a swaraprastara that first appeared like a stray-off but went on to revel in the raga’s own freshness. More noticeably, Aditya’s opening ‘Viribhoni’ delivered the illustrious Bhairavi varnam’s less-heard anubandham beginning with ‘Chiru chematalu’. This enriched the literary content after ‘Chiru navvu momuna’, which is usually the end point of Pacchimiriyam Adiyappayya’s 18th-century magnum opus. After Sourashtram, Aditya intelligently juxtaposed ‘Jambupate’ in an unhurried Yamuna Kalyani against ‘Ninuvina verevaru’ set to raga Malavi. That set the backdrop for the 70-minute main in Mayamalavagowla.  The Kerala-based reviewer focuses on music and dance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/some-highs-and-a-few-lows/article38075294.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||As zestful as always||During his concert for Madhuradhwani, veteran vocalist T.V. Sankaranarayanan once again proved that his voice and virtuosity are his strengths. Trained under his uncle, the stalwart Madurai Mani Iyer, Sankaranarayanan exuded energy right from the beginning. He opened with the Saranga virutham, ‘Karpaka Vinayaka’ and the Periyasami Thooran composition, ‘Gananathane gunabodhane’ rendered with several rounds of spiralling swaras at the pallavi. Adventurous exercise Next came Tyagaraja’s ‘Sogasujuda tarama’ in Kannadagowla (Rupakam), a kriti that describes the beauty of Rama. His swaraprastara was an adventurous exercise. Sankaranarayanan’s son and disciple Mahadevan provided vocal support while Embar Kannan was on the violin. The Pantuvarali alapana saw Sankaranarayanan displaying his usual exuberance, negotiating all the three sthayis with utmost ease. Embar Kannan’s response was marked by prompt and elegant swara statements. Dikshitar’s ‘Visalakshim visveshim’ was the chosen kriti. Sankaranarayanan’s extraordinary manodharma came to the fore in the niraval and kalpanaswaras at the samashti charanam, ‘Kasirajnim kapalinim’. His Kanada delineation and the response on the violin succeeded in drawing out the subtle nuances of the raga. G.N. Balasubramaniam’s ‘Nee allaal ini yaarennai kappar’ on goddess Parvathi, was a refreshing and impressive rendering. The Mohanam raga alapana was imaginative, He lent a new dimension to the raga with some long and some breezy phrases. Sankaranarayanan’s inspiring rendition of the Papanasam Sivan masterpiece ‘Kapali’ offered fresh insights into the kriti. In the extensive swara segments at the pallavi, his voice efortlessly traversed all three octaves . His total grip on the laya came through particularly in the brisk phrases. Both in the alapana and swaras, Embar Kannan excelled. Mahadevan won appreciation for his rendering of kalpanaswaras. Thanjavur Murugabhoopathy on the mridangam and S.V.Ramani on the ghatam enriched the concert with their appropriate rhythmic support. The former displayed his ability to highlight the kriti by changing the gait at specific moments. Both offered a splendid thani, with focus on the khanda nadai, winning admiration both from the singer and the rasikas. After two pasurams, he rendered another Papanasam Sivan kriti in Hamsanandi, ‘Srinivasa thiruvenkatamudaiyan’. Bharati’s ‘Paarukkulle nalla naadu’ evoked patriotic emotions. Sankaranarayanan wound up his concert with Papanasam Sivan’s Madhyamavati kriti, ‘Karpagame’, on the goddess of Mylapore. Age certainly has not withered Sankaranarayanan’s music.  The Chennai-based reviewer specialises in Carnatic music.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/as-zestful-as-always/article38075298.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Teamwork at play||Paati was there again. Hadn’t seen her in a week. “I got the link for some online concerts and I was listening to them on this,” she said, pulling out her smart phone from a cloth bag. “I never miss concerts by young musicians,” she whispered into my ears. ‘Bournvita’ mama, whom I often bump into at canteens, turned back irritatedly and said, “Shshhhhh”. Gearing up for paati’s running commentary, I tried to look straight at the stage. “See the seating is exactly like the way it is at his guru T.M. Krishna’s concerts. A lot of youngsters these days follow this arrangement,” she whispered again while I was curious to see where the tanam in Arabhi was heading. Rithvik Raja followed the tanam with ‘Saadhinchane’, Tyagaraja’s Pancharatna kriti, on a rather mellow note. Paati hurled another point: “Arun Prakash (mridangam) and Aniruddh Athreya (kanjira) are his guru’s favourite accompanists.” A kriti that is often heard as goshti gaanam has a different pace and energy, but on the concert stage it was acquiring a more sedate character. L. Ramakrishnan, a violinist I hugely admire, played the entire kriti with the musician with elan. The movement of the kriti — the rise and fall — was captured beautifully by both the artistes. A meditative opening. Imaginative niraval  Pantuvarali alapana was slightly sketchy and the rendition of the kriti could have been better. The niraval at ‘Veda shastra purana’ was highly imaginative, pushing the boundaries of meaning. It flowed seamlessly into an equally competent swaraprastara. Next, the melodious notes of Anandabhairavi began to fill the space, evoking the emotions of karuna, sringara and more in the listeners. Rithvik opened Dikshitar’s Kamalamba Navavarana kriti, ‘Kamalamba samrakshatu’, with the anupallavi, ‘Sumana saaradhita’. I was totally immersed in the beauty of the phrase ‘Sundara manah priyakara sakhi’ and the eloquence with which the violinist played it. ‘Marivere dikkevarayya Rama” in Shanmukhapriya was brisk, engaging and the musician worked the mood to a crescendo with the swaraprastara. Paati seemed to thoroughly enjoy the piece and kept tala loudly with her hands. The Kedaragowla alapana was a bit repetitive, however, Ramakrishnan’s delineation was more imaginative and the tanam that followed made for a rich listening experience. The exchange of ideas between the vocalist and the violinist was interesting. Even this composition, ‘Saraguna palimpa’ began with the anupallavi. Arun Prakash is among the finest musicians today. Not just a percussionist, he is a composer too. In the tani avartanam, without trying to dazzle, he drew attention to the inner workings of laya. Along with Anirudh Athreya, he gave a fresh dimension to the concert.

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Planning it right||Since artistes outnumber the time slots during the Season, young musicians should plan and present their concerts keeping an eye on the clock. Aishwarya Vidhya Raghunath made the most of the one-hour concert with her precise execution. A raga is a vast ocean and one needs to plumb the depths to unravel the nuances. But realising the time limitation, Aishwarya presented a smart precis of Sankarabharanam, touching upon the characteristic phrases of the raga. She concentrated on the sruti-based karvais in her initial passages and rounded off the alapana with fast rolling brigas in the second segment. In Tyagaraja’s ‘Emi neramu nannu brova’, the brief niraval on ‘Deenabanduvani devadevudani’ paved way for swarakalpana. With a few rounds of keezh kala swaras, she switched over to the mel kala exercise focusing on the note ‘ga’. The rounding off was done with neat extensions and combinations. She managed to explore Dhanyasi, a heavy raga. Here again her musical acumen helped her present an essay without sacrificing the scope for involved rendition. ‘Meenalochana brova’ by Syama Sastri was rendered keeping intact the underlying melody. The niraval was on ‘Gama palini brova’ and just a few streaks of swaras were added. Aishwarya flagged off her concert with Subbaraya Sastri’s ‘Sankari neeve’ in Begada with shadjam-centered kalpanaswaras and ended her recital with ‘Sri Venkata gireesam’ in Surutti by Dikshitar. M. Vijay on the violin and K.H. Vineeth on the mridangam used their time assiduously. It is not mandatory to suffix every kriti with either swaras or raga essays to reinforce one’s competence. In fact, a dedicated rendition with alapana or swaras for just one or two kritis is enough to establish an artiste’s credentials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/planning-it-right/article38075296.ece
31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||From the pages of history||Puli Thevar, Velu Nachiyar, Marudu Sagodharargal, Veerapandiya Kattabomman, V.O. Chidambaram, Bharathiyar and Kodi katha Kumaran are freedom fighters from Tamil Nadu, but barring a few popular names, most people may not be much familiar with others. So it was a good idea to present their stories as an ode to these freedom fighters and to commemorate 75 years of Independence. Srekala Bharath and students of Thejas, her dance school, presented ‘Veeram Vilayndha Bhoomi’ at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s Natya Utsavam. Beginning with salutations to Mother India by a group of young dancers, the narrative moved from one story to another with one of the youngsters playing the protagonist. A few roles were performed by Srekala herself. The use of folk tunes and the visualisation of some sequences such as ships on sea in the episode on VOC were interesting. Scenes from the battlefield and freedom fighters being hanged to death were depicted as part of the theme, but were not backed by powerful dramatisation, imaginative choreography, or aesthetic lighting design. For a production that focuses on historical personalities, it’s important that the characters are fleshed out well, or else it could appear like a list of events, defeating the very purpose of the production. Script and music was by Rukmani Ramani. Popular songs like ‘Endru thaniyum indha’, ‘Parukkule nalla naadu’, ‘Achamillai’ and ‘Vetri ettu dikkum’ were woven into the musical score. The musical team consisting of L. Narendra Kumar on nattuvangam, Chitrambhari Krishnakumar on vocals, Veda Krishnan on the mridangam, K.R.Venkatakrishnan on rhythm pad and Ganesan on the violin, performed with a competence borne out of experience, but somehow fell short of bringing in the nationalistic fervour into their music. Thejas dancers Nivedita, Ramyapriya, Abhirami, Kshiraja, Vyomini and Divyashree performed with Srekala, who had choreographed the production and designed the costumes.

31 December 2021||December 31 2021 00:00 IST,||Grains of goodness||Some of India’s precious native rice varieties — parakkum chittu, ilupai poo samba and Rajamudi— call out to visitors at Vilvah Agro, a new zero-waste store in Coimbatore. Curious, the visitors make a beeline to the rice section, where the varieties are stored in tall glass canisters. “This is our objective — to get people talking about native rice varieties,” says Kruthika Kumaran, founder of Vilvah that stocks over 40 indigenous white, brown, red and black rice grains, including Athur kichili samba, hand-pounded raw rice, poongar and thooyamalli. Traditionally, each rice variety was used for specific purposes depending on the growing season or climate. While some varieties like kuzhiyadichan can withstand drought, the kattuyanam grows tall providing enough hay for fodder. “Each variety brings a unique character and health benefits to the table. There are short grains, long grains, and aromatic ones. The paal kudaivazhai, as the name indicates, benefits lactating mothers, while Rajamudi rice (a variety from Karnataka favoured by the Wodeyar kings) improves bone strength, and thooyamalli, a short-grain white rice with rich fibre content, controls blood sugar levels. The grains have relatively lower glycaemic index and boast a rich micronutrient profile.” Passion for agriculture Kruthika and her husband Tamil Kumaran are from a farming background. “We have never consumed store-bought rice. We source them from our farms, but they are mostly the hybrid ones. As an experiment, we started growing karuppu kavuni, a variety preferred in Tamil Nadu, at our 40-acre farm in Gobichettipalayam, near Coimbatore. Now, we have added about 15 varieties.” The couple also networks with over 15 farmers from across India to source indigenous varieties, like Dehradun basmati rice or Katarni from Bihar. Currently, the store has seven varieties of fragrant rice like the mullan kaima from Wayanad, Kerala, that is used to make the fragrant Malabar biryani. The vellai milagu samba grown in Tamil Nadu and parts of Sri Lanka has grains that resemble pepper. And the aromatic gandhasaale cultivated in Wayanad that gives out a heavenly fragrance. Kruthika says that many traditional varieties are dying out because farmers have stopped saving seeds. “We want to carry forward this heritage by saving native seeds. This can happen when consumers try out diverse varieties encouraging farmers to grow them.” Agro is the latest addition to Vilvah, the parent brand that specialises in organic skin care and hair care products. The rustic life “We have a curated collection of products like yoga mats, herbal dyed towels and handwoven vetiver footwear under Vilvah Life. We are working with rural communities that make natural dyes in Dindigul, and jamakkalam weavers in Bhavani and Komarapalayam. An in-house design team from NIFT takes charge of creative ideas.” There are plans to convert the store into a rice museum. “We already have heritage walk teams visiting the store to know about the history. We want to encourage people to consume these grains. Since it takes time to cook these varieties, they can start by using red rice to make idli, adai or dosa batter.”  Prices start at Rs. 85 and go up to Rs. 500 for varieties like bamboo rice.
