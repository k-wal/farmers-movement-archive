03 December 2021||BENGALURU/NEW DELHI,||Doctor, South African national India’s first cases of Omicron||India has confirmed two cases of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus in Karnataka. One is a 66-year-old South African national and the second, a 46-year-old anaesthetist from a Government hospital in Bengaluru. Both reportedly have “mild symptoms”. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said in Bengaluru that the Indian doctor had no travel history. The announcement was made following confirmation from the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) that monitors the genomic variations of the pandemic. The Indian developed fever and body ache on November 21 and underwent the RT-PCR test on November 22 when he tested positive for COVID-19. 5 contacts test positive Karnataka Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said the person was under home isolation till November 24 and was admitted to a hospital on November 25. He was discharged on November 27. “We have tested 13 of his primary and 205 secondary contacts. Three primary contacts and two secondary contacts have tested positive. Their samples have been sent for sequencing. Although all the six, including the doctor, are clinically stable, we have admitted them to a dedicated Government facility for further treatment and observation,” the Minister said. The South African national left for Dubai on November 27 after testing negative. He came to India on November 20, and was quarantined in a hotel. As many as 24 of his primary, and 240 secondary contacts were tested, and found to be negative. They were still under watch, the Minister said. Genome sequencing experts, who declined to be identified, said it was a matter of concern that the Bengaluru resident had been infected with the Omicron variant without any travel history. Sources said he might have attended some conference where he would have come into contact with foreign returnees. Mr. Sudhakar claimed that Karnataka had acted quickly to detect the new variant.

Stalin, urging him to ensure that the shutters of the Mullaperiyar dam are opened “only after sufficient warnings” and “during daytime”. Mr. Vijayan said he had received information that shutters V1 to V8 of the dam were opened at 3.30 a.m. on Thursday. “Sufficient warning was not given before substantial discharging of 6,413 cusecs which was subsequently increased to 8,017 cusecs at 4 a.m. by opening all the 10 shutters,” he said. The Kerala Chief Minister sought Mr. Stalin’s intervention so that anxiety and apprehensions of the people living downstream are put to rest. He called for a planned and gradual release of water only during daytime instead of releasing it at night or early morning. “The Government of Kerala is of the considered opinion that Tamil Nadu should get adequate water while the safety of people in Kerala is ensured,” Mr. Vijayan said. He stressed the need for the neighbouring States to discuss and devise strategies to tackle the consequences of climate change that impact the lives and livelihood of the people. Houses flooded Earlier in the day, flooding was reported in the residential areas of Vallakadavu, Vandiperiyar, Chappathu and Upputhara in Idukki district following the “highest quantum” of water released into the Periyar this year. Residents of Vallakadavu blocked a vehicle from which announcements were made about the opening of the dam after water was released.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/open-dam-after-alert-kerala-urges-tn/article37816680.ece
03 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Congress hits out at Mamata’s moves||In an all-out attack on the Trinamool Congress, a day after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s ‘there is no UPA’ comment in Mumbai, the Congress on Thursday pointed out that Ms. Banerjee had once described the BJP as “a naturaly ally” when the Trinamool was a part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala recalled that Ms. Banerjee was an ally of the BJP between 1999 and 2001 and again from 2003 to 2006-07 and had two stints as Cabinet Minister in the Vajpayee Government. Questioning the Trinamool’s expansion plans in States such as Goa and Uttarakhand, where the Congress is the main challenger to the ruling BJP, Mr. Surjewala asked them to introspect “whether the fascist forces are being strengthened by those pretending to be fighting them”. Mr. Surjewala’s sharp attack came moments after election strategist Prashant Kishor, who is advising Ms. Banerjee since the West Bengal Assembly election, hit out at the Congress’s top leadership and stated that no one had a “divine right” to a leadership position. Mr. Surjewala, however, insisted that “as a political party, we would not comment on the views of a consultant, especially if the person doesn’t have any ideology and earlier advised Narendra Modi”. Hitting back at the Congress, Trinamool leader in the Rajya Sabha Derek O’Brien asked the Congress to “wake up and smell the coffee”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/congress-hits-out-at-mamatas-moves/article37816688.ece

03 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Delhi pollution: SC gives Govt. 24 hours to take ‘serious action’||Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana on Thursday asked the Government as a ‘layman’ the question that haunts the Capital, that is, why does pollution continue to smother Delhi despite orders from the Supreme Court, action from Government and lawyers arguing so much. The court gave the Government 24 hours to find a way or make way for the Supreme Court to act. “As a layman, I am asking you... It has been days since we have been hearing this case, yet pollution continues to remain high. Pollution continues to go up despite us passing orders, Government saying it is doing everything and lawyers arguing so much... It is a simple question,” Chief Justice Ramana asked Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre. The question came in the middle of yet another inconclusive hearing which ended with the court giving the Government a 24-hour deadline to take “serious action” to beat the smog enveloping the Capital. The court decided to hear the case at 10 a.m. on Friday, half an hour before usual court timings to underscore the gravity of the issue. The court said it would be forced to pass directions on Friday if the Government could not decide and act in time to save lives. Mr. Mehta said he had a plan and would discuss with the Environment Minister and come back on December 3. “We are not here as Opposition leaders. We are here to control pollution,” the CJI emphasised. The CJI said there was no point to creating multiple task forces to find ways of curbing pollution. Mr. Mehta urged the court not to replace the task forces, they were working at “jet speed”. Justice Chandrachud said the problem was non-implementation of the directions. The CJI said the problem was also a lack of creativity on the part of the bureaucracy to deal with the urgent situation. The court asked the Delhi Government why schools had opened in the Capital. “Children of classes three and four are going to school early in the morning in the smog... While adults have the ‘work from home’ option, little children have to go to school,” Chief Justice Ramana asked. Mr. Mehta interjected to clarify that the Centre had said that schools would be closed “till further orders”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/delhi-pollution-sc-gives-govt-24-hours-to-take-serious-action/article37816389.ece
03 December 2021||New Delhi,||No sign of truce, Govt. firm on apology by 12 suspended MPs||The Opposition and the Government on Thursday showed no sign of truce on the issue of suspension of 12 MPs. They clashed, citing rules and propriety. Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu noted that a message was being sent out that while the “sacrilege of the House is democratic, action against sacrilege is undemocratic”. The Opposition insisted that the suspension is not legal. Mr. Naidu informed the House that since 1962, on 11 occasions till 2010, members have been suspended using Rule 256. The reasons for the latest suspensions, he said, were in the public domain. While calling the suspension undemocratic both within and outside the House, not even a word was being said about the reasons given for it and the disdainful conduct of some members in the last session. “Unfortunately, a message is sought to be sent out that ‘sacrilege’ of the House is democratic but action against such sacrilege is undemocratic. I am sure people of the country would not buy this new norms of democracy,” he said. ‘No going back’ The Government said the suspension could not be revoked till each of the 12 MPs apologised on the floor of the Upper House of the Parliament. Mr. Naidu said he was deeply pained to know from media reports of categorical refusals to express any regret for the acts of “misconduct”. “You don’t want to regret your misconduct but insist on revoking the decision of this House taken as per due process stipulated under the Rules of the House. Does this amount to upholding the principles of democracy?” The Government, using the argument of continuity of the Rajya Sabha, insisted that MPs could be suspended for misconduct in a previous session. Seeking to puncture this argument, Deputy Leader of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma sought a ruling on whether the House was prorogued after the monsoon session or not. Under Article 83 of the Constitution, the Council of States was a continuous House unlike the Lok Sabha. But for functioning, the President summoned each session and at the conclusion of the session, it was the President again who prorogued the session. The monsoon session that concluded on August 11, he observed, was prorogued on August 31 by the President.“I want to know whether the prorogation was in order? If so, is this a separate session or a continuation,” he asked. Deputy Chairman Harivansh, who was in the Chair, reserved ruling on the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-sign-of-truce-govt-seeks-apology-by-12-suspended-mps/article37816401.ece
03 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||ZyCoV-D to be launched in seven States||Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Thursday asked seven States to identify high-priority districts where the three-dose ZyCoV-D vaccine could be launched initially. Following a review meeting with States, Mr. Bhushan stated that Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, will identify the districts with high numbers of people who have not received the first dose, for introduction of ZyCoV-D. The Health Ministry said in a release that national training for administration of ZyCoV-D has been completed. Also, the selected States have been asked to plan sessions based on pharmajet injectors and identify vaccinators for training. Unlike some vaccines, ZyCoV-D needs a special applicator for administration. The States have been told to ensure that all eligible beneficiaries of the first dose are covered and available vaccines given timely and that no dose expires in both the Government and private facilities. Around 12 crore people who have taken the first does are still due to take their second jab across the country, the Ministry said. “The ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ nation-wide COVID-19 vaccination campaign has resulted in a hike of 5.9% in the first dose coverage [till November 30] and a jump of 11.7% in the second dose coverage has been registered during the campaign,” Mr. Bhushan said. Second dose coverage At the review meeting, the Health Secretary urged the States to optimally utilise local influencers and community leaders to enhance the awareness among communities to come forward for the doses, especially the ones who are overdue for the second dose. The cumulative number of vaccine doses administered in the country crossed 125 crore on Thursday. Out of this, 79.13 crore (84.3%) people have been vaccinated for the first dose and 45.82 crore (49%) received the second dose as per the provisional report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/zycov-d-to-be-launched-in-seven-states/article37816413.ece
03 December 2021||Kolkata,||Governor meets SEC on civic polls||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Thursday sought details of deployment of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) for civic polls in Kolkata from State Election Commissioner (SEC) Sourav Das who met him. “SEC @MamaOfficial indicated to Governor Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar that as regards deployment # CAPF he would revert by December 4 and assured that all steps for fair, impartial and free elections will be diligently taken,” Mr. Dhankhar said on social media. The Governor said he “indicated to SEC that constitutional provisions have overriding effect and be followed”. The Governor had met the SEC on November 23 and emphasised that the “SEC in its authority was at par with the ECI and it should be non-partisan, independent and effective and not extension of Govt.” The SEC has said decision on deployment of the CAPF would be take in consultation with police officials. The issue has been crucial to all polls in the State because of the apprehension of poll-related violence. Trinamool’s response The Trinamool Congress leadership accused the Governor of acting beyond his jurisdiction as the SEC is an independent body “empowered with superintendence, direction and control of all elections to panchayats and civic bodies”. Party spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said the Trinamool had won 217 seats and the BJP only 70 despite the deployment of the CAPF in the Assembly polls. BJP State president Sukanta Majumdar said there is no possibility of holding free and fair polls without the deployment of the CAPF. He said the BJP will approach the Supreme Court seeking the deployment. Petition in HC The Calcutta High Court is hearing a petition filed by the BJP leadership demanding that the polls to all civic bodies be held on a single day. Elections to 112 civic bodies are pending. The SEC has announced that polling for the 144th ward of the KMC will be held on December 19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/governor-meets-sec-on-civic-polls/article37816383.ece
03 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Pandemic mismanaged, says Opposition||The Opposition on Thursday hit out at the Government for lack of data on deaths during the second wave of COVID-19 due to oxygen shortage, little clarity on booster doses or vaccines for children and mismanagement during the ongoing pandemic. Accusing the Centre of favouring BJP-ruled States in allocation of vaccines, Shiv Sena leader Vinayak Raut, participating in the discussion on COVID-19 in the Lok Sabha, pointed out that the pandemic had highlighted the need for close coordination among the States and the Centre. “The Prime Minister is responsible for the entire population of the country and allocation during a pandemic should be made on the basis of the population density,” Mr. Raut stated. Describing as “premature” the celebrations around crossing the 100-crore milestone in vaccination, he said two-dose coverage is poor even now. “Should we be satisfied with this? We cannot launch premature celebrations for 100-crore doses,” he remarked. On the PM-CARES fund, he refrained from making a direct attack on the Centre. Instead, he targeted contractors tasked with supplying ventilators to hospitals and establishing PSA oxygen plants. “The Centre or the Prime Minister is not to be blamed. It’s the suppliers who provided sub-standard ventilators, which could not be used for the welfare of people.” The Prime Minister had made an announcement of setting up more than 1,500 PSA oxygen plants in hospitals across the country, but in reality less than 400 plants were functional. “Contractors have betrayed the Centre and strict action should be taken against such people,” he observed. Mr. Raut also raised the issue of private hospitals overcharging COVID-19 patients, particularly during the second wave. “In the first wave, private doctors ran away, but in the second wave, they all opened shop, and... billed poor patients. We have to ensure this doesn’t happen again and we need laws barring this kind of thing.” Vaccine coverage Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and AIMIM leader A. Owaisi questioned the Centre as to when they would be able to ensure full vaccination coverage for adults. Had the Government taken adequate preventive steps before the second wave, many people could have been saved, Mr. Chowdhury said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pandemic-mismanaged-says-opposition/article37816411.ece
03 December 2021||New Delhi/Colombo,||Four-pronged plan on Sri Lanka crisis||India and Sri Lanka agreed to a four-pronged approach to discuss initiatives on food and energy security to help mitigate Sri Lanka’s economic crisis, during a two-day visit by Sri Lankan Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa to New Delhi. Four-pillar initiative The decisions included a four-pillar initiative, comprising lines of credit for food, medicines and fuel purchases granted by India, a currency swap agreement to deal with Sri lanka’s balance of payment issues, an “early” modernisation project of the Trinco oil farms that India has been pursuing for several years, and a Sri Lankan commitment to facilitate Indian investments in various sectors. “It was agreed that modalities to realise these objectives would be finalised early, within a mutually agreed timeline,” said a Sri Lankan High Commission statement issued at the end of the visit by Mr. Rajapaksa, who met External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in an unusual “joint meeting” on Wednesday. It was also attended by Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner to India Milinda Moragoda and Finance Secretary S.R. Attygalle. Mr. Jaishankar will meet Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Saturday in Abu Dhabi when they will inaugurate the Indian Ocean Region Conference organised by the India Foundation. Direct communication “Ministers Sitharaman and Jaishankar agreed to open direct lines of communication and to be in direct and regular contact with each other to coordinate the initiative,” the statement said. Mr. Rajapaksa, brother of President Gotabaya and Prime Minister Mahinda, also met National Security Adviser Ajit Doval on Thursday. According to a statement by the Sri Lankan Finance Minister’s office, they discussed a “range of issues pertaining to mutual strategic interests”. However, the MEA and the Finance Ministry did not issue any statements on the outcome of the meetings in Delhi. India and Sri Lanka have had a number of differences on economic issues in the past two years, particularly over the perception that the Rajapaksa Government has favoured Chinese companies on projects that it expedites. Matters came to a head this year after President Gotabaya cancelled an MoU signed with India and Japan for the East Coast Terminal project. India protested the cancellation though it later agreed to the West Coast Terminal being developed by the Adani group.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/four-pronged-plan-on-sri-lanka-crisis/article37816669.ece
03 December 2021||New Delhi,||Grand plan for Grand Old Party ends in a bitter tussle||After months of negotiations at several levels, a grand plan for the entry of election strategist Prashant Kishor into the Congress has collapsed into bitterness between the two, and outbursts on Thursday. Until late August, the Congress was trying to fit him into its organisational structure, but his demands were found to be unworkable and the idea was abandoned, according to a senior party functionary. Mr. Kishor, who advises Trinamool leader and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, is coordinating her expansion drive outside West Bengal that is undermining the Congress. “Sushmita Dev left the Congress for the Trinamool when we were still in talks... It is now very clear what his plans were... Good that we did not fall for that,” a senior Congress functionary told The Hindu . Mr. Kishor did not respond to The Hindu ’s request for an interview. Kishor’s demand A source in the Congress said Mr. Kishor wanted a formal position in the party and also retain his consulting business with leaders of other political parties. He did not want to be a part of the party strategy for the coming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakkhand. “He said he would start from the Gujarat Assembly election next year,” said a Congress functionary. These conditions were difficult from the beginning, but former Congress president Rahul Gandhi asked a three-member committee to consult senior leaders on Mr. Kishor’s induction and other ideas he had outlined for the party’s revival. A.K. Antony, Ambika Soni and K.C. Venugopal spoke to senior leaders, who largely opposed any condition-based induction, sources said. Mr. Kishor questioned Mr. Gandhi’s leadership in an oblique but still provocative Twitter post on Thursday, suggesting an alignment of the Congress and other Opposition parties without Mr. Gandhi. Ms. Banerjee also targeted Mr. Gandhi on Wednesday without naming him. “The IDEA and SPACE that #Congress represents is vital for a strong opposition. But Congress’ leadership is not the DIVINE RIGHT of an individual especially, when the party has lost more than 90% elections in last 10 years,” Mr. Kishor said. “Let opposition leadership be decided democratically.” Within an hour of this post, Anand Sharma, Congress leader who is part of a group within the party that had called for organisational elections, posted on Twitter: “Congress, as principal national opposition party, remains a central pillar for a collective national effort… To oppose and defeat the BJP, a broad-based understanding and cooperation among secular, progressive and democratic political parties on people’s issues is the need of hour. That will connect with people’s expectation.” In July, Mr. Sharma and Ms. Banerjee had a meeting. Last week, Mr. Sharma and Congress president Sonia Gandhi met, ahead of Ms. Banerjee’s visit to Delhi. Mr. Sharma and Mr. Kishor are both outlining the conditions for Opposition unity and the role of the Congress in it, and there appears to be convergence between their views. This is, perhaps, the prelude to a script in the making. When Narendra Modi emerged as the face of the BJP’s 2014 campaign, Mr. Kishor was his key strategist. In a way, Mr. Modi had taken over the BJP to reshape it. Mr. Kishor had suggested something similar for the revival of the Congress. Ms. Banerjee possibly believes that it is her turn to lead the Opposition in 2024. The strategy at play is to target around 50 Lok Sabha seats for the Trinamool, which could be close to the Congress’s own strength. Even if the Trinamool wins all seats in West Bengal, it will only be 42. Any additional seats from other States, even if only a handful, could buttress her claim to be a national leader. In the cross-hairs of this strategy is not Mr. Modi — at least for now. It is Mr. Gandhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/grand-plan-for-grand-old-party-ends-in-a-bitter-tussle/article37816403.ece
03 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||India lashes out at UN rights agency for comments on J&K||The Government on Thursday took strong exception to the UN Human Rights agency’s criticism of the arrest of Kashmiri activist Khurram Parvez, accusing the Geneva-based Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) of “bias” for referring banned terror organisations in Jammu and Kashmir as “armed groups”. “[The OHCHR statement] betrays a complete lack of understanding on the part of the OHCHR of the security challenges faced by India from cross-border terrorism and its impact on the most fundamental human right ‘the Right to Life’ of our citizens including in Jammu and Kashmir,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi, who called the U.N. agency’s concerns about the arrest of Parvez and civilian killings during the Hyderpora encounter on November 15 as “baseless and unfounded allegations” . “Referring to proscribed terrorist organisations as ‘armed groups’ demonstrates a clear bias on the part of OHCHR,” the MEA said. On Wednesday, OHCHR spokesperson Rupert Colville criticised the Government and security forces in Jammu and Kashmirand said the U.N. Human Rights office was “increasingly alarmed” over the rise in civilian killings including religious minorities by security forces in the course of counter-terrorism operations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-lashes-out-at-un-rights-agency-for-comments-on-jk/article37816395.ece
03 December 2021||New Delhi,||‘Govt. stonewalling demand for discussion on China’||Lok Sabha member and senior Congress leader Manish Tewari on Thursday charged the Narendra Modi Government with “stonewalling” the Opposition’s demand to have any discussion in Parliament on the border situation with China, and argued that it does not augur well in a democracy. Mr. Tewari made these remarks at the launch of his new book 10 Flashpoints; 20 Years: National Security Situations that Impacted India that had earlier created a political storm by questioning India’s response to the 26/11 attacks under the United Progressive Allliance (UPA) Government. The book was formally launched by former Foreign Secretary Shiv Shankar Menon, who also served as the National Security Adviser (NSA) in the Manmohan Singh Government. While lauding the author for the book that looks at various national security challenges, Mr. Menon said that he disagreed with some of the tactical positions taken by Mr. Tewari. The former NSA also described India’s “China challenge” as “the foremost challenge”. At the same time, Mr. Tewari condemned the tactic of using military operations for political gains and winning elections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/govt-stonewalling-demand-for-discussion-on-china/article37816671.ece

Khanwilkar. The S-G, representing Gujarat, was countering an appeal filed by petitioners Zakia Jafri and activist Teesta Setalvad against the closure of the plea to investigate a “larger conspiracy” involving the highest echelons of Gujarat in 2002 when Narendra Modi was Chief Minister. Mr. Mehta said the miseries of Ms. Jafri, who lost her loved ones in the riots, was “exploited”. Witnesses were tutored and evidence was fabricated, he added. “When the Supreme Court said ‘we will constitute a SIT [Special Investigation Team]’, we agreed, saying we have nothing to hide. When the court said ‘we will decide the members of the SIT’, we said ‘we have nothing to hide’. When the court said ‘we will ask the SIT to file its reports to us’, we said ‘we have nothing to hide’,” he submitted. “The allegation of a larger conspiracy is not just a castle in the air, it is bubbles in the air.” Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for the SIT, said the allegation of larger conspiracy was made to “keep the courts boiling”. The complaint was made four and a half years after the riots.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/larger-conspiracy-to-malign-state-of-gujarat-s-g-tells-court/article37816417.ece

The State Government categorised South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe as the “high risk countries”, adding that it is a dynamic exercise based on the evolving situation of the Omicron variant and hence will be updated as required by the State Government. The State has directed authorities to follow guidelines for other countries as specified by the Centre. The passengers will be declared high risk if they are either coming from above-mentioned countries or have visited any of them in the past 15 days before arrival. The passengers will be de-planed and separate counters will be arranged for them. They will have to undergo RT-PCR test immediately on arrival at the international airport and seven-day institutional quarantine with second RT-PCR test to be carried on the seventh day. In case of positive result, the passengers will be shifted to the hospital. Otherwise, they will have to go for a seven-day home quarantine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/maharashtra-issues-guidelines-for-flyers/article37816418.ece
03 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Paika rebellion to be in history textbooks||The 1817 Paika rebellion of Odisha could not be called the first war of Independence, but considering it as a beginning of a popular uprising against the British, it would be included as a case study in the Class 8 National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) history textbook, the Union Culture Minister said on Thursday. In response to a question by BJD MP Prashanta Nanda, Mr. Kishen Reddy informed the Rajya Sabha that the Culture Ministry had received a reference from the Odisha Chief Minister asking that the Paika rebellion be declared the first war of Independence. First War He said the matter was examined in consultation with the Indian Council of Historical Research, under the Union Education Ministry, and according to the comments by the Indian Council of Historical Research, the Paika rebellion could not be called the first war of Independence. “However, from a historical point of view, it can be said that the ‘Paika Bidroha’, which was set off in March 1817 and continued until May 1825, had set an example for the classes as well as the masses in India to follow later on. Accordingly, considering that this is one of the beginnings of popular uprisings against the British in India, it has been decided to include it as a ‘case-study’ in the Class VIII history textbook of NCERT...,” the Minister said in a written reply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/paika-rebellion-to-be-in-history-textbooks/article37816374.ece
03 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Undertrials under UAPA can’t be held indefinitely’||Putting a person accused under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act behind bars for an unduly long time with no progress in the trial or appeal process is a violation of his or her fundamental right and a threat to public confidence in the administration of justice, the Supreme Court has held in a judgment. “While deprivation of personal liberty for some period may not be avoidable, the period of deprivation pending trial/appeal cannot be unduly long. At the same time, timely delivery of justice is part of human rights and denial of speedy justice is a threat to public confidence in the administration of justice,” a Bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S. Oka observed in a recent judgment. Once it is known that a timely trial is not possible and the accused has already suffered a significant period of incarceration, the courts are “obligated” to enlarge an undertrial on bail. The judgment came in an appeal filed by a 74-year-old man, Ashim. He was booked under UAPA and has been in prison awaiting trial for nearly a decade. “The charges against the accused are undoubtedly serious but the charges will have to be balanced with certain other factors like the period of incarceration which he has undergone and the likelihood period within which the trial can be expected to be finally concluded,” the Supreme Court said. The court noted that cases investigated by the National Investigation Agency should be tried on a day-to-day basis and have priority over other cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/undertrials-under-uapa-cant-be-held-indefinitely/article37816376.ece

Sebastian, a resident, said water entered the houses in the early hours. As it was a clear sky on Wednesday, no one expected that the dam would be opened. He said water began to recede by 10 a.m. after most shutters were closed. The Chokkenpetty forest area bordering Tamil Nadu witnessed heavy rain on Wednesday night. The inflow, when the water level was close to the permitted maximum level of 142 ft, resulted in the sudden opening of the spillway shutters. This was the fourth time in a month Tamil Nadu opened the shutters after 10 p.m. Water Resources Minister Roshy Augustine told The Hindu that a serious situation prevailed as the dam shutters were opened after midnight without giving time for informing the people. “The Tamil Nadu Government was also informed [on Tuesday last] that raising the shutters during night should be avoided to the maximum. Now it has violated all norms,” he alleged, adding that it would be informed to the supervisory committee appointed by the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the Vaigai dam in Theni district of Tamil Nadu, where water from the Mullaperiyar was stored, was opened as the water level reached the maximum level of 71 ft. The 14 shutters remained open on Thursday, according to an official of the Tamil Nadu Public Works Department. Tamil Nadu can draw a maximum of 2,300 cusecs through tunnel discharge.

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Genome consortium advises booster shots||The advisory was prepared on Monday and before it confirmed the presence of the Omicron variant in India. “Vaccination of all remaining unvaccinated at-risk people and consideration of a booster dose for those 40 years of age and over, first targeting the most high-risk/high-exposure may be considered, since low levels of neutralising antibodies from current vaccines are unlikely to be sufficient to neutralise Omicron, though risk of severe disease is still likely to be reduced,” the release noted and added that “population immunity and vaccine-induced immunity may not sufficiently block its propagation”. Indian studies are already showing evidence that real-world effectiveness of both Covaxin and Covishield was lower than that reported in clinical trials and that immunising antibodies reduced over time, creating opportunities for breakthrough infections and sometimes reinfections. A study by the Translational Health Science Institute, Faridabad, published last week in the Lancet Infectious Diseases , reported that two shots of Covishield gave 63% protection against symptomatic infection and 85% protection against moderate or severe disease. Anurag Agrawal, Director-General, CSIR-IGIB and who is part of the INSACOG, said these specific recommendations only reflected the WHO’s views on the same. “The INSACOG isn’t an advisory body. The evidence right now is that a booster reduces reinfections and that’s all that we have stated. In a few more weeks we’ll have better information [from South Africa] on whether Omicron is linked to increased disease severity,” he told The Hindu . The U.S. and the U.K. have approved booster doses for all adults, six months after their second dose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/genome-consortium-advises-booster-shots/article37816391.ece

03 December 2021||New Delhi,||60% of Rajpath revamp done as deadline nears||Of the work of redeveloping the Central Vista Avenue, which had a deadline of December 2021, 40% was still pending, according to information given by the government to the Lok Sabha on Thursday. Replying to a question by Congress MP Manish Tewari, Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs Kaushal Kishore said the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue had achieved 60% physical progress. So far, the Government had incurred a cost of Rs. 190.76 crore out of the estimated total cost of Rs. 608 crore, the reply stated. On the new Parliament building, the Minister said 35% of the work had been completed at a cost of Rs. 340.58 crore out of the total cost of Rs. 971 crore. The project was estimated to be completed by October 2022. The Minister’s reply comes a week after the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry set up a Central Vista Oversight Committee on November 25. Ministry officials had earlier said that the unusually heavy rain during the monsoon had led to delays, leading to an increase in the workforce at the sites. While the Central Vista Avenue has to be completed before Republic Day, the new Parliament is supposed to be ready in time for the winter session next year. Asked why the committee was set up, a Ministry spokesperson had said it was for “independent continuous and holistic monitoring”. On Thursday, the spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on if the projects were running behind schedule. ‘On schedule’ Asked about the progress, the Centre’s consultant for the Central Vista project, HCP Design, Planning and Management, said: “The construction of the new Parliament building is on schedule. The Central Vista Avenue is facing a slight delay due to COVID-19 and unexpected rainfall.” In a written response to The Hindu , the Ahmedabad-based firm said the Parliament building would meet the “scheduled deadline of November 2022” as per the “present pace”. “The contractors are working hard and deploying additional resources to meet the deadlines for the Central Vista Avenue. All components necessary for the 2022 Republic Day Parade will be ready in time. The underpasses and a few amenity blocks will be completed shortly after,” the firm said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/60-of-rajpath-revamp-done-as-deadline-nears/article37816405.ece

03 December 2021||AHMEDABAD,||Eight Gujarat fishermen go missing||Around eight fishermen in Gujarat have gone missing, prompting the authorities to launch a rescue operation near Veraval in Saurashtra region. They went missing after their boats anchored at a fishing harbour near the coast capsized in the stormy weather and rain overnight as Gujarat is witnessing unseasonal rains in coastal areas. The Gujarat Government, in coordination with other agencies, has launched a rescue operation deploying a Coast Guard helicopter as well as boats to find the fishermen. Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel directed the officials to make all efforts to trace the missing. Chief Secretary Pankaj Kumar is monitoring the rescue operation launched by the Coast Guard personnel. According to local people, at least 10 boats were completely destroyed and 40 others, which were anchored at the coast, were partially damaged due to the stormy weather that turned the sea conditions extremely rough with high waves along the coast. “The sea conditions turned rough after midnight in Navabandar village due to the strong winds and sea waves. Initially 12 persons were untraceable, but four of them managed to swim back to the shore, while eight are still missing. We have started a rescue operation with the help of a helicopter sent by the Coast Guard,” a local official told media persons from Una. It is learnt that the fishers were sleeping inside their anchored boats when the strong winds and waves struck the coast after midnight. Unseasonal rains Since Wednesday, Gujarat witnessed a change in the weather conditions with some parts of the State particularly the coastal areas in South Gujarat and Saurashtra regions receiving rain, which is unusual in December. On Wednesday, part of Maharashtra and Gujarat received rain owing to a low-pressure area in the Arabian Sea and a western disturbance, the India Meteorological Department earlier said, adding that the showers were likely to continue on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/eight-gujarat-fishermen-go-missing/article37816380.ece
03 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Soaring air fares leave flyers in a fix||When Manam Jain planned to to go the U.S. for his education, he did not expect that he would have to pay Rs. 1.67 lakh for his flight. Similarly, Kala Mishra who planned to come down to Chennai from London, was shocked to learn that she would have to pay Rs. 60,000 as against the usual fare of Rs. 30,000. “I have been longing to see my family and wanted to somehow fly back to India. I am looking at various options to see how I can plan my trip,” she says. Flyers are struggling to make it as the fares have been rising on some routes. Prakash S. says: “My son and his family are coming down from Canada in December and he is spending Rs. 2.5 lakh on flights alone. We haven’t seen one another for two years.” Travel agents attribute the steep rise in fares to limited number of flights available and high demand. S. Jeyasekaran of Travel Agents Association of India, Chennai chapter, says fares are phenomenally high for destinations in the U.S., the U.K., Canada and Dubai in December and passengers are feeling the pinch. For instance, a flight ticket from London to Chennai is priced from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 60,000 and some days, it rises to Rs. 1.2 lakh. Similarly, for destinations in the U.S. and Canada, fares touch Rs. 1 lakh and above. “People don’t have a choice. The ones travelling are the ones who want to meet their families because of some emergency or prior commitment, including weddings,” he says. Travel agents say one of the primary reasons for such high rates is the limited number of flights and high demand for seats. Tushar Jain of Roundtrip.in says as against the normal number of eight to 10 flights, there are only two or three now. “For instance, there used to be usually six or seven flights to Dubai but only two are in operation now. Similarly, there are just one or two flights to London,” he says. Sriharan Balan of Madura Travels says that earlier, flyers were reluctant to travel because of safety concerns but since the economy has picked up and the daily tally of COVID-19 cases has been on the decline, people are confident of flying abroad. “Many have waited for more than a year to visit their families. We hear that regular commercial flights may start soon and we are asking passengers to push their travel dates to avoid spending so much on flight fares,” he adds. There aren’t many who want to travel abroad during Christmas and New Year this reason as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/soaring-air-fares-leave-flyers-in-a-fix/article37816838.ece

03 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Civic poll will be subject to verdict on quota for women: HC||The Madras High Court on Thursday ordered that all proceedings to be initiated for the conduct of local body elections in Greater Chennai Corporation limits would be subject to the result of a writ petition filed in the court insisting that the reservation of wards for women should not exceed 50%. Acting Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu passed the interim orders after ordering notices, returnable within two weeks, to the State government, the State Election Commission and the Corporation Commissioner where 105 of the 200 wards had been reserved for women. The judges granted a short date for filing counter- affidavits after advocate-general R. Shunmugasundaram said the Supreme Court had ordered conduct of local body polls at the earliest. Accordingly, elections to panchayats had been conducted and polls were due only for urban local bodies, he said. R. Parthiban of West Mambalam had filed the case stating that 89 wards had been reserved for women (general), 16 for Scheduled Castes (women) and 16 for Scheduled Castes (general) candidates. The rest of the 79 wards had been left to the general category. Senior counsel S. Prabhakaran, who represented the petitioner, said only 84 seats should have been reserved for women (general) leaving an equal number for both men and women. He said more seats had been reserved for women because of an erroneous process followed by the Corporation in zone-wise reservation of wards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/civic-poll-will-be-subject-to-verdict-on-quota-for-women-hc/article37816817.ece

03 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Plan to build training wall at mouth of Cooum to prevent sand bar||The Water Resources Department (WRD) has proposed to construct a training wall at the mouth of the Cooum to prevent formation of sand bar. Work is expected to be taken up in three months after getting environment clearance. The Cooum carried about 13,000 cusecs of water during recent heavy rain. The flow has dipped to about 8,500 cusecs. Officials said heavy machinery were used to clear the sand deposited now at the mouth of the river and keep it open up to 120 metres. The river had minimal flow during the other months of the year. The flow was inadequate to minimise sand bar formation. The activities at the Chennai harbour led to sedimentation at a fast pace. The proposed training wall for 265 m on northern side and 310 m on the southern side was estimated to cost Rs. 70 crore. A combination of boulders and concrete tetrapods had been planned for the construction of training wall. This would add more strength to the structure and allow tidal exchange, the officials said. The training wall was designed based on a study by the National Institute of Ocean Technology.  Free of obstructions The project will help keep the mouth of the river open. It would allow free flow of water and prevent inundation in areas such as Arumbakkam and Aminjikarai due to sand bar formation. Work would be completed in 18 months. The structure would be built without disturbing the groynes laid near the mouth and help in coastal protection, the officials added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plan-to-build-training-wall-at-mouth-of-cooum-to-prevent-sand-bar/article37816809.ece
03 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK announces schedule for organisational election||A day after the AIADMK’s executive committee decided to amend the mode of election for the posts of coordinator and co-coordinator, the party on Thursday announced the schedule for organisational elections, including the two posts. Hours after the party’s move, V.K. Sasikala, former interim general secretary of the party, in a statement, vowed that she would work relentlessly to turn the party “again into a movement of workers.” As per the schedule drawn up by the party, December 7 will be the date of polling for the posts of coordinator and co-coordinator.

For the 35 district units, the poll will be on December 13 and 14, and for the remaining 40, on December 22 and 23. In her statement, Ms. Sasikala expressed her concern over, what she called, the present plight of the party, and said ever since the party was “used for the likes and dislikes of individuals,” its esteem had “gone down.” The workers had been “forgotten.” Pointing out that a number of cadres were “yearning” for the return of the party to its past glory, she told them not to get disheartened and expressed hope that it would be “set right.” ‘Release MLACDS funds’ The AIADMK co-coordinator and Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, on Thursday demanded that funds under the Member of Legislative Assembly Constituency Development Scheme (MLACDS) be released immediately. In a statement, he said that ordinarily, the release of funds under the scheme would take place during August. But, even now, this had not been done yet. In a series of tweets, AMMK general secretary T.T.V. Dhinakaran deplored the reported move of the refusal of pay to those employees of the State electricity utility who had not taken the vaccination against COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-announces-schedule-for-organisational-election/article37816803.ece
03 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||All subways opened to vehicular traffic||The Greater Chennai Corporation has opened all subways, which were hitherto closed to traffic because of floods. With this, all the major traffic bottlenecks have been cleared in various parts of the city. Madley subway and Rangarajapuram subway were the last among the 22 to be cleared by the civic body. Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi inspected major flood-affected areas to assess the damage and initiate relief work. A total of 561 localities were flooded in Chennai between November 25 and December 2. Until November 24, 1,128 localities had reported flooding.

With rise in water level, many residents along the banks of the Cooum in Arumbakkam were shifted to various shelters. The Corporation arranged for blankets to be given to people in all flood-affected areas on Thursday. In Arumbakkam, residents sought more blankets from the civic officials as the number of blankets had been inadequate. “The officials distributed blankets to 150 families. More than 600 families were affected by floods. We do not even have utensils to purchase food or milk for our children. Our house is flooded,” said a resident of Radhakrishnan Nagar in Arumbakkam. More than 16,000 residents participated in medical camps organised by the civic body on Thursday.

03 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||BJP man, others restrained from making defamatory statements||The Madras High Court on Thursday restrained a BJP functionary, some journalists, an advocate and a writer from making and circulating defamatory statements against Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) president Thol. Thirumavalavan, who also represents Chidambaram in the Lok Sabha. Justice Abdul Quddhose granted the interim injunction on a civil suit preferred by the MP, seeking nominal damages to the tune of Rs. 1 crore from them, for having harmed his reputation. The judge also ordered notices, returnable by January 28, to the respondents, accused of having made the defamatory statements. Senior counsel E. Omprakash told the court that D. Periyasamy alias ‘Thada’ Periyasamy, once associated with the VCK, had switched sides and shifted to the BJP. After joining the Opposition camp, the respondent started vilifying Mr. Thirumavalavan, and began a malicious campaign against him, posting defamatory content on social media accounts. Similarly, activist-advocate P. Rathinam too had started making disparaging remarks, with respect to the personal character of the MP, the court was told. Referring to the 2003 honour killing of a Dalit engineer, S. Murugesan, and his Vanniyar wife D. Kannagi in Cuddalore, and the recent verdict in the case, imposing the death sentence on the deceased woman’s brother and awarding life imprisonment to her father and 11 others, Mr. Thirumavalavan said he had been demanding justice for the deceased all along. However, Mr. Rathinam, who spearheaded the legal battle, accused him of having forced the family members of the deceased engineer to withdraw their complaint. A Tamil magazine too, had published them, Mr. Thirumavalavan said, and sought to restrain all of them from making such defamatory allegations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjp-man-others-restrained-from-making-defamatory-statements/article37816853.ece

03 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu’s fiscal deficit stood at Rs. 22,269 crore in first half of 2021-22||Tamil Nadu’s fiscal deficit (the difference between total revenue and expenditure) stood at Rs. 22,269 crore in the first half of 2021-22. Its revenue collection improved, but expenditure remained higher. According to unaudited provisional figures from the Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG), the State’s total receipts (including the State’s Own Tax Revenue and the share of Central Taxes, among others, and excluding borrowings) was Rs. 85,452.77 crore in April-September 2021, up 26.2% from Rs. 67,707.63 crore in the comparable period last year. The State’s Own Tax Revenue, which accounts for 70% of the total revenue, increased 36.35% to Rs. 50,324.31 crore in the first half of 2021-22 from Rs. 36,907.46 crore in the first half of 2020-21. The revenue in the first half of 2020-21 was impacted by a stringent lockdown imposed to curb the first wave of COVID-19. This year, the lockdown was imposed for only a few months to control the second wave, and this has helped in a higher revenue collection. Among the State’s Own Tax Revenue components, revenue from stamps and registration fees increased 74% to Rs. 6,236.55 crore in the first half of 2021-22 from Rs. 3,586.56 crore in the comparable period last year. The State’s Goods and Services Tax collection increased about 39.9% to Rs. 19,173.05 crore in the first half of 2021-22, compared with Rs. 13,700.47 crore in the same period last year. Taxes on sales and trade (including the tax on petroleum products and sales tax on liquor) increased 30.3% to Rs. 21,327.53 crore in the first half of 2021-22 from Rs. 16,366.68 crore in the comparable period. The State had cut the petrol price by Rs. 3 by reducing the sales tax. The revenue from excise duties grew 9.6% to Rs. 3,496.07 crore in the first half of 2021-22 from Rs. 3,190.03 crore in the same period last year. RBI report The recent report by the Reserve Bank of India, ‘State Finances: A Study of Budgets of 2021-22’, pointed out that so far in 2021-22, revenue receipts of the States had posted a robust growth, driven by their own tax revenue. Higher devolution and front-loading of the GST compensation by the Union Government had provided a cushion. Tamil Nadu received Rs. 10,611.38 crore as share of the Union Taxes in the first half of 2021-22 and Rs. 17,716.54 crore as grants-in-aid and contributions. The State’s total expenditure increased to Rs. 1,07,722.32 crore in the first half of 2021-22 from Rs. 98,913.22 crore. Its revenue expenditure increased to Rs. 94,628.34 crore in the first half of 2021-22 from Rs. 90,991.27 crore. The RBI report said the Tamil Nadu Government had incurred an additional expenditure of Rs. 17,618.8 crore on account of COVID-19 relief this year. It said the States’ revenue expenditure subsided by July. Tamil Nadu fiscal deficit was lower than Rs. 31,205.59 crore in the first half of last year. Revenue deficit was Rs. 9,418.60 crore in the first half of 2021-22, down from Rs. 23,591.04 crore in the first half of last year. Last month, Tamil Nadu Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan said the State would reduce its revenue deficit during 2021-22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadus-fiscal-deficit-stood-at-rs-22269-crore-in-first-half-of-2021-22/article37816800.ece

03 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Digital literacy index in T.N. already high: Union Minister||A total of 5.36 crore candidates have been enrolled under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyaan (PMGDISHA) Scheme to improve literacy. Out of this, 4.54 crore candidates have been trained and 3.37 crore candidates have been duly certified. In Tamil Nadu, over 10.7 lakh people registered, and of this, over 8.7 lakh were trained and over 5.78 lakh people were certified, said Ashwini Vaishnaw, Union Minister for Electronics and Information Technology, responding to a query raised by DMK’s Member of Parliament (MP) Thamizhachi Thangapandian in the Lok Sabha. The MP from Chennai South constituency immediately threw another question at the Minister, asking why the enrolment numbers were low in Tamil Nadu for this specific scheme. Mr. Vaishnaw said, “Tamil Nadu has a history where the State government has already rolled out similar schemes over a decade ago to enhance digital literacy. They even give out free laptops. And the digital literacy index of the State is already very high and that is why there is lesser enrolment under this scheme,” he noted. The MP also raised questions on whether marginalised sections of the society including Scheduled Castes (SCs)/Scheduled Tribes (STs), women, differently abled persons, etc. have been enrolled and certified, to which the Minister responded that in the SC category, around 1,03,97,563 people enrolled, and of this, 89,22,690 were trained and 67,88,527 certified. Details furnished by the Minister showed that in the ST category, the enrolment numbers stood at 48,69,800. As many as 40,70,145 people were trained and of this, 29,26,211 were certified. Under the differently abled category, 9,65,209 had registered and out of this 8,20,350 were trained and 5,86,291 were certified. Impact assessment So far, three impact assessment studies of the scheme have been carried out. The first Impact Assessment Study was carried out by the Council for Social Development (CSD) in 2017-2018. The second was done by Indian Institute of Technology Delhi in 2019. The last impact assessment study of the scheme was carried out by the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) in financial year 2020-21. The aim of the study was to analyse the ground level situation of the scheme, with a larger aspect of continuation of the scheme beyond the 12th plan period. The IIPA, after the comprehensive and methodological evaluation of scheme, concluded in the report that PMGDISHA as a digital literacy programme plays an indispensable part in not only bridging the digital gap in the country but also transforming it into a knowledge economy and society. The IIPA recommended the continuation this scheme.

03 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Minister calls for exempting educational services from GST||Higher Education Minister K. Ponmudi has written to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, urging her to exempt educational services from the Goods and Services Tax (GST). In his letter, the Minister said according to the Central Tax (Rate) notification, issued on June 28, 2017, education was exempted from the GST. He said educational services were classified under the heading 9992, which was subdivided into six groups, which were exempted from GST. These included services provided by educational institutions to students, faculty and staff. State’s GER The State’s Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) now stands at 51.4, against the national average of 27.1. “Tamil Nadu has a student strength of 35.25 lakh, pursuing higher education in arts and science, engineering, law and medicine,” the Minister wrote, adding: “The levying of GST can potentially lead to a decrease in GER and an increase in the number of dropouts, jeopardising the academic career of aspiring students.” The GST will adversely affect students from rural areas and economically weaker backgrounds. It will cause hardships to parents due to the additional financial burden, Mr. Ponmudi added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/minister-calls-for-exempting-educational-services-from-gst/article37816805.ece

Mr. Varghese said as per their records, they were able to cover over 70% of the adult population with disabilities in the State. Among the newer initiatives, a Differently Abled Employment and Livelihood Centre (DELC) has been set up, which the Commissioner said aims to enhance the skills, socio-economic status and livelihood of persons with disabilities. “The centre will act as a platform to connect persons with disabilities with prospective employers, and will work closely with the Skill Development Mission to conduct programmes,” he said. With a focus on ensuring employability and job opportunities for persons with disabilities, the State Commissionerate will work on the implementation of the equality policy, which aims to provide more opportunities to people and making workplaces accessible.

03 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Make public spaces inclusive for queer people’||The priority, while designing and transforming public spaces, must be to make them inclusive and safe for queer people and all other marginalised sections of society, said panellists at a discussion here on Thursday. In a virtual discussion on the topic “Making public spaces LGBTIQ+ inclusive” organised under the Chatham House Rule, which demanded non-disclosure of the identity of the speakers, the panellists said the public spaces were mostly designed with the heteronormative, upper class and upper caste people in mind. The discussion was organised by The Prajnya Trust in association with Orinam as part of the former’s annual 16-day campaign against gender violence. The panellists said there was a misconception that making public spaces inclusive for queer people and marginalised sections would alienate the spaces from the majority of the public. Gender-neutral marking Highlighting that accessing toilets in public spaces marked for “men” and “women” was difficult for queer people, one of the panellists argued that making all the toilets in public spaces gender neutral would go a long way in making them inclusive and safe. Another panellist wondered why the toilets in public places such as restaurants and bus stands could not be de-gendered when the toilets in planes and trains had always been gender neutral. Arguing that most decision makers from government bodies often came with heteronormative conditioning, a panellist stressed on the need for finding avenues to have continuous discussions with them to make the public spaces more inclusive. One of the ways to make the public spaces inclusive was to display artworks by queer people, the panellists said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/make-public-spaces-inclusive-for-queer-people/article37816839.ece

03 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Rajesh Das approaches HC again||Suspended special Director General of Police Rajesh Das has filed yet another petition in the Madras High Court and this time, he has challenged an order passed by Villupuram Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) on July 30 taking cognisance of a charge-sheet filed against him in a sexual harassment complaint lodged by a woman Indian Police Service (IPS) officer. When the matter was listed before Justice M. Nirmal Kumar on Thursday for deciding its maintainability, the judge directed the High Court Registry to number the petition and list it for admission in regular course. In his petition, the suspended DGP contended that it would have been virtually impossible for the CJM to have read a 1,300-page charge-sheet within a few hours. He pointed out that the Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID) probing the sexual harassment case had filed its charge-sheet on July 29 and the CJM took cognisance of it the very next day and issued summons to him. “It is impossible for the CJM to have read 1,300 pages of the charge-sheet between July 29 evening and July 30 morning,” he contended. The suspended DGP also alleged that the CJM was under heavy pressure since the High Court had taken suo motu cognisance of the complaint and monitored the investigation by CB-CID. “The learned Magistrate was influenced by the orders of this court in suo motu proceedings and took cognisance of the offence without proper application of judicial mind,” his petition read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rajesh-das-approaches-hc-again/article37816847.ece

Speaking to the mediapersons, he alleged that the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO) would acquire 3,800 acre of agricultural lands spread over six villages for this project. “Allow the farmers to practise agriculture here,” Mr. Annamalai appealed to the DMK government and urged that the industrial estate must be constructed elsewhere in the State. The BJP was prepared to stage rallies and would “go to any levels for farmers” on this issue, he said. On the three farm laws that were repealed recently by the Union government, Mr. Annamalai said Prime Minister Narendra Modi repealed the law “out of respect for the farmers.” Dismissing rumours of rift in the AIADMK-BJP alliance, Mr. Annamalai said both the parties were “united in terms of principles” despite minor disagreements. Speaking in Salem, he said the BJP was of the view that fuel prices should be brought under GST. The BJP was protesting against the State government as it had not been ready to reduce fuel prices to rates as promised in manifesto even after the Centre reducing the prices. Governor of Telangana and Lt.Governor of Puducherry Tamilisai Soundararajan told presspersons in Salem that all people should get vaccinated. All should be vigilant and her focus as Governor was on vaccination in both the States. She also appealed to the people of Tamil Nadu to get vaccinated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/annamalai-opposes-proposed-industrial-estate-in-coimbatore/article37816860.ece

03 December 2021||Erode,TAMIL NADU||AITUC wants minimum wages given for workers||The All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) has urged the district administration to implement the daily minimum wages for workers in the government hospitals and other government organisations. In an email sent to the District Collector H. Krishnanunni, AITUC district president S. Chinnasamy said that the administration, as per the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, had fixed daily minimum wages for skilled and semi-skilled labourers and other unskilled menials and for part-time menials for 2021-22. The order was issued on October 7, 2021 for the period from April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022. As per the order, skilled labourers should be paid a minimum of Rs. 808 in corporation limit, Rs. 731 in municipality limit, Rs. 655 in town panchayat limit and Rs. 578 in village panchayat limit. Sweepers in corporation limit should be paid Rs. 693, Rs. 578 in municipality limit, Rs. 501 in town panchayat limit and Rs. 424 in village panchayat limit. But, the email said that minimum wages were not paid to any workers who continue to receive the old wages so far. “It is causing hardship to thousands of workers in hospitals and other government establishments”, the email said and urged the Collector to implement the minimum wages for the labourers.

Collector P.N. Sridhar inspected the drive at Kesavalu Nagar in Kallakurichi municipality in the town. Mr. Sridhar said that the administration had embarked on a comprehensive anti-dengue drive across the district. Besides the officials of public health department, officials of municipalities, town panchayats and rural development have also been roped in to create awareness on dengue and destroying the breeding grounds of mosquitoes. Apart from surveillance of COVID-19, 47 fever survey workers will visit houses in all the 21 wards in Kallakurichi municipality. The workers will check for stagnation of water inside the households, which could end up becoming breeding grounds for the dengue-causing Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes. The administration has deployed personnel from various departments in the exercise to destroy mosquito breeding sources across the district. He urged the public to check for coconut shells, broken pitchers, plastic cups at home or in their surroundings. Mosquitoes, especially the dengue-carrying aedes aegypti mosquitoes, breed in clean water. Buckets holding water, cement pots, and drums used to store water, must be kept closed at all times, he said. Mr. Sridhar said fogging had also been intensified across the district. Reports on the number of households covered, number of locations where fogging was done are monitored on a daily basis.

03 December 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||A rough ride all the way to Periyar Nagar||After a few days of heavy rains, residents of Periyar Nagar in Avaniapuram have to put up with not just waterlogging but also a main road that looks like a dirt track stripped off its blacktop and riddled with craters. This road that branches off from the Ring Road at Periyar Nagar leads to Avaniapuram and passes through Santosham Nagar. It is dotted with many small-scale units and newly-developed residential areas on either side. Wild growth of ‘karuvela’ trees ( Prosopis juliflora ) amid pools of stagnant rainwater on empty plots poses a health hazard to residents here. Though the area is located within Madurai Corporation limits, there are only mud tracks here. Slushy roads, which look more like ploughed fields, lead to houses. For residents, navigating this stretch is not the only contentious issue - it is the main road that gives them jitters. Traffic on this road is heavy. Two-wheelers, cars, lorries bringing consignments to industries - all these vehicles use this slushy and tattered road. Lorries with heavy cargo deepen the potholes. Workers at a scrap yard located here say the road has been bad for more than a year and after the rains it is almost unmotorable. Moorthy, a taxi driver who regularly takes the route, says as far as he remembers, the road was laid only before the elections and after that it was forgotten. “Earlier, we could reach Avaniapuram in 5 to 10 minutes but now because of the bad condition of the road, it takes almost half an hour,” he rues. Two-wheeler riders have a tough time, especially at night. Overtaking is just impossible and even if the drivers want to give way to other vehicles, dexterity is needed along with a niggling fear that they would either end up in a puddle or slip off the road. ‘Relaying soon’ Bose Muthiah, former DMK councillor, points out that earlier this road was under Tirupparankundram panchayat union but later it was brought under the Corporation limits and now it comes under the State Highways Department. The project to relay the entire road is a major one, and he said it would be done soon. But till then what people like Shekar, a security guard at one of the units, want is patchups or at least filling up of the deep craters with gravel to make the ride less dangerous.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-rough-ride-all-the-way-to-periyar-nagar/article37817133.ece
03 December 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Huge crater appears on road||A huge portion of Mela Anuppanadi Main Road caved in creating a deep crater on Thursday evening. Though the size of the crater was around 10 feet in diameter and 15 feet deep, and that it formed during peak hours in the evening, no one was injured. Madurai City police who rushed to the spot barricaded the road on both sides immediately to keep people away from the danger zone. Corporation engineers rushed to the spot and took up repair works. An engineer said that a main pipeline of underground drainage system was lying deep below on the road. The officials suspect that a burst in the pipeline could have triggered the sudden caving in of the road. Besides, they also suspect that the continuous rain in the recent days could have washed away the soil below the tar road causing the crater. Similar incident happened last year in the close vicinity on the same road, said M. Bose, a Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam functionary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/huge-crater-appears-on-road/article37817135.ece
03 December 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Compensation: kin of cracker unit fire victims move HC||Five other families of the employees of Rajammal Fireworks in Virudhunagar district who lost their lives in the 2020 fire accident in the unit filed petitions before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday, seeking a direction to the State to provide them compensation. Already, six petitions had been filed by other families of the fire accident victims. In separate petitions, S. Selvakumar, K. Balasubramanian, C. Jeyakumar, M. Muppidathi and S. Ganesan said the State government had announced an interim compensation of Rs. 1 lakh for each victim and the Collector had also assured that the State government would provide a compensation of Rs. 10 lakh and employment to one member of each of the families of the victims. But, no relief had been granted to the family members. Though they had sent a number of representations to the authorities, no steps had been taken, they said. The authorities had failed to properly monitor the cracker units in the region. Since the State had allowed Rajammal Fireworks to function without a proper licence and permission, the authorities were vicariously liable to pay adequate compensation, they said. Justice C.V. Karthikeyan sought a response from the State and adjourned the hearing till December 6. During the course of the hearing, the State submitted that a proposal was made to decide the compensation amount.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/compensation-kin-of-cracker-unit-fire-victims-move-hc/article37816936.ece

A Division Bench of Justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P. Velmurugan sought the report from the authorities on a public interest litigation petition filed by A. Alagu of Melur. She complained that the houses built by Tamil Nadu Adi Dravidar Housing and Development Corporation (TAHDCO) were more than 30 years old. They were damaged and not fit for living. The ceilings were completely damaged and the houses could collapse any time. They posed a threat to people living in them, she said. Despite sending repeated representations to the authorities concerned, requesting them to reconstruct or renovate the houses, the authorities did not look into the requests. The authorities have to take necessary steps to renovate or reconstruct the houses in order to protect the lives of 25 families living in Kanmaipatti, she said. The court had earlier directed the district administration to file a report after inspecting the houses in the Government Adi Dravidar Welfare Colony in Melur. During the hearing, the State submitted that a proposal was made to reconstruct the houses as they were in a dilapidated condition. The authorities said it would take six months to complete the reconstruction work. The hearing was adjourned till December 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-seeks-report-on-temporary-accommodation/article37817130.ece

03 December 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Plea to ensure identity of sexual abuse victims is not revealed||An advocate has moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday seeking a direction to the authorities to regulate print, electronic and particularly social media so that it is ensured that the identity of the victims of sexual abuse is not revealed. Pointing to the recent incidents, the petitioner, J. Kirubha Priyadharshini of Madurai, said the identity of the victims was being revealed on social media platforms like YouTube and Instagram. Such posts had to be removed. Despite several guidelines being issued with regard to reporting of such offences, some print and electronic media organisations were revealing the identity of the victims directly or indirectly. There was no proper implementation of the guidelines that had been issued, she complained. Freedom of Expression was an important Fundamental Right, but it should not be at the cost of the victims’ Right to Life and Privacy, the petitioner said. She said these guidelines should be publicised widely so that mediapersons were made aware of them. The petitioner also sought a direction to constitute a body of experts to monitor media and social media platforms so that the identity of victims of sexual abuse was not revealed. A Division Bench of Justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P. Velmurugan ordered notice to the Centre and the State, and adjourned the hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-to-ensure-identity-of-sexual-abuse-victims-are-not-revealed/article37816952.ece

03 December 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Waste dumping near paddy fields annoys Uchimedu farmers||Uchimedu farmers are an angry lot after civic officials started indiscriminate dumping of solid waste on a piece of land close to their paddy fields and a lake on which they depend for irrigation. Despite objections from farmers, the waste collected from around 10 villages in the Bahour, Kuruvinatham, Kirumampakkam, Kannikoil, Manapet and Madhikrishnapuram areas is dumped on the land adjacent to the paddy fields and 10-15 metres away from the Uchimedu pond. Road turns unusable The locals say the waste dumping started around two months ago, and the small road dividing the fields and the pond has become unusable because conservancy workers are dumping waste on both sides. “Two years ago, the Bahour commune panchayat tried to dump the waste, but the then Lt. Governor intervened and halted its attempt because it was against the rules. According to the guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board, the 50 metre-100 metre periphery of a waterbody must be treated as a green or buffer zone,” G. Sathiyamoorthy, president of the Uchimedu pond association, told The Hindu . The Central Pollution Control Board’s guidelines mandate that in case of any residential or commercial or industrial activity taking place within the buffer zone, measures should be taken to prevent waste discharge into the waterbody. “The crux of the guidelines is that no activity that allows waste discharge should be encouraged around waterbodies. In Uchimedu, there is no industrial or residential activity resulting in waste discharge; instead, the civic body has allowed the periphery of the lake to be used as a dumpyard,” Mr. Sathiyamoorthy said. Two truck loads of garbage is dumped every day on the periphery of the lake, he said, and the farmers are worried about any adverse impact on their crop. “If the lake is 10 metres-15 metres away, the paddy cultivation will be around 20 metres away. In the recent rain, the water stagnating on the paddy fields looked coloured. We don’t know the impact of waste accumulation on the soil,” said Sarangipani, a farmer and resident of Kannikoil. Around 40 hectares near the pond is under paddy cultivation. “Paddy has started growing only now. Workers sit on the road and eat food during breaks. They complain about foul smell emanating from the waste, especially in the last few days following the heavy rain. The authorities have become insensitive to the farmers’ concerns,” he said. According to an official of the Puducherry Pollution Control Committee, the commune panchayat is responsible for the enforcement of the Solid Waste Management Rules. As per the Schedule (1) of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, landfill sites are not allowed within 100 metres of a river and 200 metres of a pond. ‘Wall mandatory’ “We have not given permission for any landfill but only for a solid waste processing facility. We have asked them [the civic body] to have a compound wall around the site. The processing area should be provided with lining to avoid ground water contamination. Roofing or leachate collection and treatment should be provided to control surface run-off,” said the official. Mr. Sathiyamoorthy said anyone could visit the spot to find whether any of the measures have been adopted. “Nothing has been done; in a few months after the area gets filled, they will dump waste even on the paddy fields and the lake. Moreover, the land where the waste is dumped was allotted for crushing paddy after harvest.” With garbage around, the farmers would have to take the paddy elsewhere for crushing, he said.  Two years ago, Bahour commune panchayat tried to dump the waste, but the then Lt. Governor intervened and halted its attempt. The periphery of a waterbody must be treated as a buffer zone G.

03 December 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Cleopatra in Kathakali avatar at Auroville show tomorrow||Over several years of engaging with the bounded realm of cross-cultural theatre, as performer, choreographer and researcher, Kathakali exponent Prabal Gupta has evolved a repertoire of solo acts in the classical dance-drama form of Kerala. On Saturday, Prabal’s ‘Cleopatra’, a Kathakali adaptation of William Shakespeare’s ‘Anthony and Cleopatra’, will be performed at the Sri Aurobindo auditorium in Auroville as part of the golden jubilee fete of the Bharat Nivas, the India Pavilion in the international township. The performance starts at 8 p.m. While there have been quite a few successful Kathakali adaptations of Shakespeare in the past, from King Lear to Othello, Prabal Gupta is blazing a new trail with his Kathakali adaptations centred on solo female protagonists. ‘Cleopatra’, will be a one-hour performance that encapsulates what the artiste described as “long hours of research, out-of-the-box forays beyond the boundaries of convention and improvisations on the choreography elements without compromising the traditional core”. The performance, which will be enacted through six scenes, will follow a theatrical style that is heavily movement-oriented and very different from a typical Kathakali act, he said. Prabal, who is a disciple of Kathakali stalwart Sadanam P.V. Balakrishnan, and specialises in the ‘sthree vesham’ (portrayal of women characters), has used the Koodiyattam snakehood-like headgear for the character instead of a Kathakali head dress, “as the character is no less than a fabled Egyptian pharaoh”, and using pre-recorded rendering of padams (verse musically rendered in the sopanam style of music that evolved from temples in Kerala). Prabal had debuted his ‘Cleopatra’ in 2016 to mark the 15th anniversary as Kathakali artiste though his first tryst with Shakespeare was in 2014 with a Kathakali adaptation of Lady Macbeth. The exponent could not have asked for a better guru than Sadanam Balakrishnan, who has been helping shape the ‘attakatha’, or the traditional narrative for the dance-drama enactment, the choice of costumery or the ragas for the padams. Sadanam Balakrishnan epitomises the fine balance between purist and improviser whose inter-cultural creations, from the adaptations on Shakespeare’s ‘Othello’ to ‘Euripedes’ ‘The Bacchae’ and ‘Helen’ have won critical acclaim. Prabal, who is based in Bengaluru, says that the creative process behind these solo acts were driven by a host of factors, including the low lump sum for a show that makes it impossible to perform as an ensemble of artistes, make-up experts, vocalists and percussionists, the organisers’ whim on the ideal duration of performance and the shrinking attention span of the modern audience. Trying to perform Kathakali outside Kerala, where there still is a small but loyal network of patrons, is a real challenge. Getting an opportunity is rare enough, but then begin various demands such as restricting the number of troupe members or shortening the duration of the performance, he said. He has encountered similar issues whether the performance call comes from low-profile organisers or big ticket hosts. Prabal is an empanelled artiste with the Indian Council for Cultural Relations and was conferred “Outstanding Citizen of New York” civilian award by the Council of New York after a performance coinciding with the 70th anniversary of India’s Independence in 2017.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cleopatra-in-kathakali-avatar-at-auroville-show-tomorrow/article37817210.ece

In a statement, A. Anbalagan, party’s east secretary, said there are many spas and beauty parlours functioning without any licence. Even in those with permits, there are activities happening beyond licence regulations. The recent arrests, involving running of prostitution rackets showed that several illegal activities are happening in the name of tourism, he said. Such illegal activities would lead to law and order problems. Several houses now have been converted into homestays and hostels. Many of them have not received permission for running such enterprises, he said. Homestays, lodges and hostels have become a nuisance for residents during weekends. The Chief Minister should immediately intervene to stop such activities, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/streamline-spas-parlours-in-ut-says-anbalagan/article37817215.ece

03 December 2021||Ramanathapuram,TAMIL NADU||Vaigai water inundates paddy crops||Paddy farmers of three villages near here fear rot of standing crop following inundation of their fields due to overflow of water from the Vaigai. Farmers claimed that crops on hundreds of acres in Thoruvalur, Thavarankulam, Pappakudi and Idaithangi have been submerged for over a week now. A. Ramu, 42, a farmer, said that 45-days of paddy crop was under water for nearly10 days and he is not confident that the crops could be saved. He had raised the crop on three acres through direct sowing and has spent over Rs. 20,000 till date. “Several rounds of ploughing, three bags of seeds, fertilizer and wages of farm hands have been drained by the stagnant water,” he said. While the crop was just around one inch above the farm, the land has been submerged in ankle-deep water. P. Muniyaraj, another farmer, who holds a small piece of land, complained that all his hard work and investment on cultivation has gone waste. The farmers complained that overflowing water from the Vaigai had inundated the low-lying areas. “The unchecked wild growth of Prosopis Juliflora on the riverbed has caused the damage to the crops,” said Mr. Muniyaraj. Joint Director of Agriculture, Tom P. Silas, who inspected the affected areas on Thursday, exuded confidence that the crops could be saved if the water gets drained in the next two days. Stating that the water has submerged the fields to the extent of around 110 acres in three villages, he said that most of the farmers had registered their crops under the crop insurance scheme. Farmers said that they could not go for another paddy crop in December as they would not get adequate rain for raising the crop in the coming days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaigai-water-inundates-paddy-crops/article37816944.ece

Since Singapore has been identified by the Union Government as one of the 12 high-risk countries, testing measures have been strengthened, Health Minister Ma. Subramanian said. So far, no patient has been identified as COVID-19 positive, he told mediapersons after inspecting the arrangements.. On Thursday morning alone, 663 passengers arrived via two flights to Tiruchi. They were tested and after negative test results were received, they were sent home. Two more flights were expected to land in the night.

Radhakrishnan and Director of Public Health T. S. Selvavinayagam. When a patient takes a test, they will have to wait at a holding room – set up by the airport authorities until the results arrive. The Rapid-PCR test takes four hours, and necessary arrangements, including food and beverages, have been arranged in the room, Mr. Subramanian said. For patients who test positive, they will be immediately rushed to the specially set up isolation ward at the Tiruchi Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital. “During the previous waves of the COVID-19 we allowed for home quarantine and COVID Care Centres, we will not permit it as the patients need to be monitored,” the Minister said. The officials were instructed to take two per cent of random samples of travellers from passengers of other flights too. The cost of these tests too would be undertaken by the district administration. Those who test negative will be sent home and must undergo home quarantine for seven days. Another COVID-19 test would be taken on the eighth day following which they must self-monitor. Local authorities, including revenue, police and local bodies would be alerted to ensure that the people are monitored.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/testing-measures-strengthened-at-tiruchi-airport-minister/article37816924.ece

The man, identified as Krishnan had gone out to purchase some essentials and had not returned home, his family members said. According to the victim's neighbours, he had gone out at around 3 p.m. as he needed to buy some groceries. He had to wade through the water to go to the nearby shop but never came back. “We looked for him everywhere and even sent the young boys in the locality to look for him,” Vishnu, a resident said. The man’s body was found behind his house on Vivekananda Street at 8 a.m. when the members of the Fathima Nagar Residents Welfare Association went about on a coracle to distribute milk packets and food from door to door. Woraiyur police then secured the body and had the post mortem conducted at the Tiruchi Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital. Later, the body was cremated. Residents were angered by the incident and demanded immediate action. “It’s been a week but there has been no relief from the flooding. Only after the drowning incident have the authorities bothered to look at our locality. We hope the authorities will drain out the stagnant water at least now. This incident could have been averted if the officials were vigilant and had taken steps to drain the water in time,” another resident said. Speaking to The Hindu , another member of the Fathima Nagar Residents Welfare Association under the condition of anonymity said that several encroachments were made in the locality, due to which the water was not draining out. “Private schools and some residential buildings have been constructed by encroaching drainage channels, because of which there is no way for the water to pass. We have asked the authorities to clear them,” the member said. Senior officials of district administration and city corporation rushed to the spot. They promised immediate relief for the residents, and also compensation to the victim’s family.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-drowns-in-flooded-street-of-fathima-nagar-residents-incensed/article37816926.ece

03 December 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Vulnerable points across Kudamuriti embankment identified by PWD||The Public Works Department (PWD) has identified 10 vulnerable points on the bunds of the Kudamuriti that causes water inundation in residential colonies along the embankment whenever the flow crosses 5,000 cusecs. The Kudamuriti, basically a flood carrier, is being used to discharge surplus water from the Koraiyar and the Ariyar. The 6.1 km long Kudamuriti from Puthur weir traverses via Kallangadu and Woraiyur and joins the Cauvery river near Melachinthamani. Though the Kudamuriti has a maximum carrying capacity of 10,000 cusecs, it faces strain whenever the flow crosses beyond 5,000 cusecs. The water spillovers happen at various points. It faced severe strain during the last three weeks due to heavy of water, resulting in water inundation in at least 40 residential colonies. The PWD had to pool together resources to prevent major breaches. Based on the field work, the PWD has now identified at least 10 vulnerable points of breach along Kudamurity. A senior official told The Hindu that a plan has been devised to carry out complete rehabilitation along the watercourse of Kudamuriti at a cost of Rs. 50 crore. There was a need to strengthen both eastern and western bunds. Besides the strengthening measures, the bunds would have to be raised so as to prevent spillover. Shutters had to be erected at a minimum of 10 points. In addition, erection of falling shutters is under contemplation at vulnerable points along the western bank. The entire stretch would have to be desilted. The official said that the preparation of the Detailed Project Report was on. The exact project cost and features of the rehabilitation plan would be known after finalisation of the DPR, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vulnerable-points-across-kudamuriti-embankment-identified-by-pwd/article37817352.ece

03 December 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Former Minister seeks action against expelled functionary||Udumalpet MLA and former Minister ‘Udumalai’ K. Radhakrishnan demanded action against an expelled AIADMK IT wing functionary who allegedly circulated false information about him on social media platforms. In a petition submitted by a group of lawyers to Superintendent of Police G. Shashank Sai here on Thursday, the former Minister stated that the person, who was formerly deputy secretary of the party’s IT wing for Pollachi South block, was expelled by the party recently. Mr. Radhakrishnan stated in his complaint that the former functionary had reportedly forged a document bearing the AIADMK’s letterhead and the signatures of coordinator O. Panneerselvam and co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami to depict as if he was expelled from the party. This forged document was circulated on social media platforms on Thursday, he claimed. Mr. Radhakrishnan stated that prior to this incident the former functionary had circulated another message that “brought disrepute to his name and post in the party.” “I have already lodged a complaint at Udumalpet Police Station in this regard,” he stated in the petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/former-aiadmk-minister-seeks-action-against-expelled-functionary/article37816862.ece
03 December 2021||TIRUVARUR,TAMIL NADU||Irregularities crop up in farm insurance requests in Tiruvarur||The Agriculture Department and Crop Insurance Company officials noticed that the total area of the crop for which insurance applications were filed by the farmers in Tiruvarur worked out to double the area of cultivation taken up during this samba and thaladi season. As per the data available with the Agriculture Department, samba and thaladi paddy crop had been raised in 1,48,067 hectares in the district during the current season. However, crop insurance applications with farmers’ share of premium had been received for an area of 1,64,163 hectares for samba and 1,47,014 hectares for thaladi , taking the total area to 3,11,177 hectares. Disclosing this at the agriculture grievance meeting held here on November 30, Collector P. Gayathri Krishnan said the total area for which the crop insurance cover was sought by the farmers was more than the actual area of sowing. Hence, steps have been initiated to scrutinize the crop insurance applications in order to identify duplicate applications and/or mentioning of an excessive area of coverage. Last season, a total of 1,27,881 farmers have insured their crop. A total of 1,14,888 farmers’ crops have become eligible for compensation, and the process of disbursement of compensation to the tune of Rs. 297 crore has already commenced. At the same time, clearance was awaited from the Central government for disbursement of compensation to 9,316 farmers who have insured their crop in an excessive area of 8,406 hectares. Further, the mismatch in bank details submitted by some farmers was also being rectified, Ms. Gayathri added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/irregularities-crop-up-in-farm-insurance-requests-in-tiruvarur/article37816802.ece
03 December 2021||Tiruvarur,TAMIL NADU||Unmanned library at Collectorate||An unmanned library has come up at the District Collectorate here. This will function as a repository as well, relying on the honesty of visitors and government employees. The idea of setting up the unmanned repository was conceived by Collector P. Gayathri Krishnan who aspired to share the hundreds of books personally owned by her with others so that the knowledge she had acquired from reading those books could be disseminated to more people. The officials have given shape to the Collector’s idea that resembles the ‘happy wall’ concept. Expecting a similar response towards the book repository at the Collectorate, official sources said while donors can contribute their books, those in need could take the books home and return them after reading. Books that are useful for students could also be deposited, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/unmanned-library-at-collectorate/article37816922.ece
03 December 2021||VELLORE,TAMIL NADU||Trench being dug to discharge excess rainwater from moat in Vellore||A new trench is being dug on Thursday to discharge excess rainwater from the fort complex, including the moat and the temple, as the premises, especially the temple, still remains inundated for nearly a fortnight with devotees barred from visiting the temple. The work, undertaken jointly by the PWD and Vellore Corporation, after obtaining consent from the district administration and the ASI, begins after pumping of rainwater from Jalakanteshwara temple, an ASI protected monument, inside the fort complex, failed since last week. The Collector, P. Kumaravel Pandian, inspected the temple on Thursday to ascertain ways to discharge stagnated water from the fort complex. "After heavy rain, the temple turned a soak pit due to rising water level in the moat. Percolation is also slow around the waterbody due to the increased water level,” M. Varadaraj Suresh, Archaeological Officer (A.O), ASI (Vellore), told The Hindu . Need for repair Officials said that the British era sluice gates on the northern end of the fort have to be repaired to discharge excess water from the moat to the nearby canal, especially during heavy rainfall. The existing sluice gates are located at a depth of 15 feet in the moat. Along with the mosque and the parapet wall of the Fort, the 16th century Shiva temple is a protected monument inside the Fort complex, which has 58 colonial buildings, including Mahals where the Mysore king Hyder Ali and his warrior son, Tipu Sultan, spent their last years as prisoners with their families in the end of 18th century.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/trench-being-dug-to-discharge-excess-rainwater-from-moat-in-vellore/article37817242.ece

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||No Omicron case found in T.N.||“The Health Department acted immediately upon hearing about the new variant having infected some 60 persons in a few countries,” Mr. Subramanian said in Madurai. The new variant had spread to 11 countries and all passengers coming from these countries were being screened at the airports. “Swab samples are lifted at the airports and passengers are let out of the specially created holding area only after they test negative,” he said. These facilities have been created at the international airports in Chennai, Madurai, Tiruchi and Coimbatore. Apart from the screening of passengers from high-risk countries, 2% of the international passengers from non-risk countries are randomly selected and put through RT-PCR tests. RT-PCR tests have been made free by the Tamil Nadu Government for those who cannot afford Rs. 600 charged at the airports, Mr. Subramanian said. Passengers can opt for the rapid test by paying Rs. 3,400 to avoid the waiting period of five-six hours. Passengers from high-risk countries will have to undergo seven-day home quarantine. Besides health inspectors, a team of officials from the local bodies, the police and the Revenue Department will keep a watch on them. “They will have to undergo another RT-PCR test after seven days. They will be allowed to go out only if they test negative,” Mr. Subramanian said. The Minister said fever screening was also being done at the airports and anyone with an abnormally high temperature would be isolated and put to a swab test. International passengers testing positive on arrival will be taken to the Government Medical College Hospital and admitted to the specially created COVID-19 wards. “These patients will not be kept with local COVID-19 patients.” Collectors can decide The Collectors can decide on banning the unvaccinated from public places, Mr. Subramanian said. The Department of Public Health had already issued a circular. “Any person can say, ‘no’ to vaccination, claiming to have good immunity. But he can spread the infection to others. Hence, everyone is bound by the order of the Department of Public Health.” He was answering to a question on the Krishnagiri Collector banning the unvaccinated from public places. “Even the Kanniyakumari Collector has said the vaccination certificate is mandatory to buy liquor from Tasmac shops,” he said. Such restrictions could be imposed in districts that had a lower vaccination coverage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-omicron-case-found-in-tn/article37816807.ece

03 December 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Parents and children organise anganwadi session on road||Some parents and their young children staged a protest against the delay in starting an anganwadi centre in their village, by holding an anganwadi session on the road in Hebballi village in Dharwad district on Thursday. The parents said that officers of the gram panchayat and of the Women and Child Welfare Department have not responded to the demand for starting a centre in their village. The old building has become dilapidated and they have not allotted a new building. The gram panchayat promised to demolish and build a new one at its place. But this has not been done even after three years, they said. The department took a room for rent to run the angawadi. The owner of the house asked them to vacate it after officers failed to pay rent, they said. This led to the shifting of the centre to a temple, where there are no proper facilities for the children. At least 50 children from the village are affected by this, they complained. The protest was withdrawn after the Panchayat Development Officer and other officers gave a written assurance that the anganwadi will be run in the B.R. Ambedkar Bhavan till permanent arrangements are made.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/parents-and-children-organise-anganwadi-session-on-road/article37816970.ece
03 December 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Lion dies at Rani Channamma Zoo||A lion in the Rani Channamma Zoo died of illness in Bhoot Ramana Hatti village in Belagavi district on Thursday. The 11-year-old lion, Nakul, fell ill a few days ago. It was suffering from a digestive disorder. A team of veterinary doctors tried hard but failed to save it, a senior officer told The Hindu . “The lion brought from Shivamogga zoo also had some problems adjusting to the climate here,” another zoo officer said. A team of doctors that carried out the post-mortem said that the wild animal died of multi-organ failure. It suffered from vomiting and dysentery for the last few days before dying on Thursday. Similar problems had plagued the animal four months ago, veterinarian Prakash Jattennavar, who conducted the post-mortem, said. There were cysts in its kidney and liver and there was some damage to the lungs. One reason could be advancing age. But such sudden problems are common among animals of the cat family, he said. “It was well fed and well cared for. There is no doubt about it,’’ he said, in response to a query. The lion’s two siblings that were brought from Shivamogga are doing fine, Deputy Conservator of Forests Harsha Bhanu said. Zoo curator Rakesh Arjunwad, zoo doctor Nirupama Jaisingh and others were present at a media briefing on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lion-dies-at-rani-channamma-zoo/article37816969.ece
03 December 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Speaker defends RS members’ suspension||Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri, has defended the Rajya Sabha Chairman’s action of suspending 12 Opposition members from the ongoing session, saying the members’ conduct was not in line with parliamentary discipline. He told journalists in Belagavi on Thursday that members of all legislative/parliamentary Houses were expected to obey the rules of procedure and maintain discipline. “What is happening in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha is a painful development. Members should avoid it. They should maintain high attendance, and engage in discussions by raising constructive and pro-people issues,” he said. To a query, he said that members who violate the decorum of the legislature would face action. He said the dates of the legislature session scheduled in Belagavi had been decided only after recommendation from the COVID-19 technical advisory committee that it was safe to hold the session. However, all COVID-19 protocol would be followed, he said. The spectators’ gallery would be restricted to adults and students would not be allowed. Legislative Council Chairman Basavaraj Horatti said he would recommend to the Government to build the second legislators’ home in Belagavi on the lines of Shimla. “Our aim is to hold the session prudently and avoid unnecessary costs,” he said. Earlier, Mr. Kageri and Mr. Horatti held meetings with officials to review preparations for the winter session.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/speaker-defends-rs-members-suspension/article37816771.ece

03 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||3 police personnel suspended for ‘torturing’ 21-year-old youth||Three police personnel from Varthur police station have been suspended for allegedly torturing a 21-year-old youth who they had illegally detained while probing a theft case. Salman Khan, who was detained for days without being produced before the magistrate, subsequently had to get his arm amputated after he was allegedly subjected to custodial violence. The personnel were suspended on Thursday after a delegation from the National Confederation of Human Rights Organisations (NCHRO) approached Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant. The suspended police have been identified as head constable Nagabhushan Gowda and constables Nagaraj B.N. and Shivaraj H. S. Balan, senior advocate, said: “A team comprising several human rights organisations and advocates, including the NCHRO, the All India Lawyers’ Association for Justice and Campaign Against Hate Speech conducted a fact-finding into the incident a week ago. They found through inquiries that Mr. Khan had been illegally detained from October 27-31. He was neither produced before a magistrate nor was there compliance with the due procedure established by law, the report claimed. It found that he had been “subjected to extreme forms of torture at the hands of the police.” “He was suspended from his toes, beaten up, kicked, stomped on by boots, placed in positions with a rod tied behind his back, and was kicked on his arm to such an extent that the arm was swollen. On account of the torture inflicted Mr. Khan and lost his arm which had to be amputated later. The incident was riddled with illegality, with allegations of extortion, torture and abuse coming to light,” Mr. Balan alleged at a press conference. The human rights activists claimed that when they questioned the Police Inspector of Varthur Station, he denied any instance of police brutality. He stated that Mr. Khan had been detained and released on the same day. The team on Thursday demanded that action be initiated against the officials under Section 220, 330, and 331 of IPC, amongst other provisions of law. They also called for a monitored inquiry against the Inspector and officials of Varthur station and that Mr. Khan and his family receive a compensation no less than Rs. 50 lakh. The State Human Rights Commission, Commissioner of Police and Minorities Commission must take cognisance of the incident and take strict action against erring officials, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/3-police-personnel-suspended-for-torturing-21-year-old-youth/article37816749.ece
03 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Omicron may have been in State much earlier: Experts||With one of the two persons in Bengaluru who have been detected with the Omicron variant having no travel history, COVID-19 experts here said that the variant could have been introduced to Karnataka much earlier. Sources said the 46-year-old anaesthetist from a Government hospital in South Bengaluru, who did not have any travel history, had attended a two-day cardiology conference that was held at a five-star hotel near the Chief Minister’s home office from November 19. “He attended the conference only on November 20 and developed fever on November 21st. How can he get infected within 24 hours? He must have contracted the infection much earlier and can in no way be connected to the conference. Moreover, no foreign nationals had attended the conference,” sources said. “While nothing can be said now, this only indicates that the variant could have emerged here much earlier,” sources said. Nanjangud incident V. Ravi, nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, told The Hindu on Thursday that the 46-year-old’s case is similar to what was seen during the first wave of COVID-19 in Nanjangud of Mysuru district. “This case reminds us of the index case of COVID-19, an employee of a pharmaceutical company in Nanjangud of Mysuru district, who tested positive on March 26, 2020. This person later became a superspreader during the first wave. He did not have any travel history but we later learnt that he was a tertiary contact of a person who had come from China,” he said. “Probably Omicron could have been introduced here much earlier and was detected now. The Netherlands is also telling that the new variant has been circulating there earlier,” said Dr. Ravi, who also heads the State’s Genomic Surveillance Committee. ‘A rule, not exception’ Concurring with Dr. Ravi, C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said it is not necessary for a new variant to be imported always. “Mutation is a rule rather than an exception. Such mutations are bound to happen in many countries and not necessary that it has to be imported always. The new variant could have been here much earlier,” he said. “As per guidelines in Karnataka, samples that have a high viral load (with a cycle threshold value of less than 15) are being sent for genome sequencing. That is how this person (who does not have a travel history) has been picked up and detected to have been infected with the new variant,” he explained. U.S. Vishal Rao, member of the State’s Genomic Surveillance Committee, said all COVID-19 variants, including the dominant Delta variant, can cause severe disease or death, more so in the case of most vulnerable people. “Thus, prevention continues to be the principal counter measure. This is a wakeup call reminding us that the war against COVID-19 is far from over. Vaccine passport coupled with COVID appropriate behavior — mask, ventilation, social distancing, hand hygiene — are still our best bets to keep the virus at bay,” he said. Meanwhile, a high-level meeting with experts and senior officers has been convened on Friday to discuss the measures to be taken and new guidelines would be formulated, said Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai in New Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/omicron-may-have-been-in-state-much-earlier-experts/article37816755.ece
03 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Metro: Road-widening work near Tin Factory to start in 15 days||The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) is set to begin road-widening work along a 1.5 km stretch from Benniganahalli to K.R. Puram railway station in 15 days. The project is aimed at easing vehicular movement from Outer Ring Road and from Baiyappanahalli side towards Whitefield and Silk Board. BMRCL managing director Anjum Parwez said that due to the incessant rains that lashed the city in November, work could not be taken up. The BMRCL has already started building a drainage system in the area. “Due to heavy rains, metro construction works especially erecting piers and other related works got delayed to some extent. Near K.R. Puram Bridge, the BMRCL had taken up widening of road. A majority of the properties have already been acquired,” he said. To widen the road, BMRCL has acquired 80 properties worth more than Rs. 340 crore. Buildings acquired have either been fully or partially demolished. Selva Kumar, who works in a shop, said: “A couple of months ago, the BMRCL had started demolishing buildings. Many owners shifted their business to the next lane. Now construction of new drainage is in progress. Early completion of work will help motorists and shopkeepers.” Three bus bays The BMRCL is also building three bus bays at various locations from Benniganahalli to K.R. Puram Railway station. At present, without bays, buses stop at the entry of the bridge to allow passengers to board, which adds to traffic snarls that the stretch is notorious for. The BMRCL has also taken up road widening work on the other side of K.R. Puram Bridge. “Roads on either side of the bridge will be widened. From the under-construction K.R. Puram Metro station to Tin Factory, the road has already been widened by two lanes and one more lane will be added after Tin Factory towards Baiyyappanahalli. In this stretch, two bus bays will be built,” said Mr. Parwez. He said the foot-over-bridge located near Tin Factory will be removed once girders are placed on the piers. “BBMP will be consulted prior to removing the FoB. Pedestrians will be allowed to use the metro station near the junction to cross the road. However, if the BBMP asks us to shift FoB to another location in the stretch we will go by their advice,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/metro-road-widening-work-near-tin-factory-to-start-in-15-days/article37816740.ece

03 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||South African man left hotel for Dubai before genome sequencing results||The city and State health machinery is on high alert after two persons tested positive for the Omicron variant of coronavirus in Bengaluru. The authorities have no clear answer as to how one of the patients, a 66-year-old African national who was isolated in a hotel on November 20, was allowed to fly to Dubai on November 27. His samples were collected on November 22 and sent for genome sequencing. The patient also took another test with a private lab on November 23, which came back negative. He then proceeded to Dubai by taking a taxi from the hotel to Kempegowda International Airport on November 27. When asked how the individual was allowed to leave with the results of genome sequencing yet to be declared, BBMP Chief Commissioner Gupta said: “I don’t think there was the issue of the Omicron variant, at least at the State level, then. I will be able to answer this only at a later stage.” He pointed out that all the 24 primary and 240 secondary contacts of the South African man tested negative. K.V. Thrilokchandra, BBMP Special Commissioner (Health), said when the South African national tested negative, he left for Dubai on his own accord. “Omicron was still not clear then,” he maintained. Contract tracing The second person, a 46-year-old man, who tested positive for Omicron, has sparked fears of community spread as he has no travel history. He is hospitalised and is said to be clinically stable, the civic chief said. He tested positive on November 22 after developing symptoms of fever and body ache. His samples were sent for genome sequencing, as he had low CT (cycle threshold) values, indicating a high viral load. ` “Experts have to determine how the person with no travel history tested positive for the Omicron variant,” said Mr. Gupta. He was hospitalised again as a precautionary measure after the results of the genome sequencing showed he had the strain The BBMP has been able to trace and test 13 primary and 205 secondary contacts of the man, of whom three primary and two secondary tested positive on November 22 and 25. All those who tested positive have been isolated and the BBMP has taken up their contact tracing. Incidentally, both persons who tested positive for Omicron had been fully vaccinated. Stating that earlier the results of genome sequencing would take months, Mr. Gupta said that the results are now declared in a week's time. “According to experts in South Africa, the Omicron variant is milder, but easily transmissible. It is therefore important for all citizens to adhere to COVID-19 appropriate behaviour and be vigilant,” he added. ‘Surveillance adequate’ Stating that the existing surveillance system was adequate, Mr. Gupta that the BBMP had already ramped up testing in the city. Speaking to reporters here on Friday, he said that the samples of international travellers and citizens who test positive, and have a high viral load are sent for genome sequencing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/south-african-man-left-hotel-for-dubai-before-genome-sequencing-results/article37816753.ece

03 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Owners of 300 buildings to get SMS on regularisation||Owners of 300 buildings identified by the Supreme Court-appointed committee headed by retired judge A.V. Chandrashekar, in areas notified for formation of Shivaram Karanth Layout, will be getting SMSes with regard to regularisation of their property. In a recent order, the Supreme Court directed Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) to regularise buildings that were constructed between 2014 and 2018. “The committee will continue to accept applications from property-owners till the end of December,” said Mr. Chandrashekar. The land notified for Shivaram Karanth Layout is spread over 17 villages, of which 15 come under BDA limits and two under Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike limits. Former BDA Commissioner Jayakar Jerome, who is a member of the committee, said, “In the notified areas, 13 approved layouts and 2 group housing schemes had come up over 134 acres. The committee continues to accept applications from building-owners in the notified areas for regularisation of their property. The four help desks in the villages have been closed, but property-owners can submit their applications at the help desk in the BDA office,” he said. Mr. Chandrashekar said the committee had received 6,278 applications with regard to 5,740 residential and 538 non-residential buildings constructed between 2008 (when the preliminary notification had been issued) and 2018. The committee, during scrutiny of documents submitted by the applicants, found that 4,718 buildings had been constructed without any approval, 675 had been constructed with approval from a non-competent authority, and 471 with approval from a competent authority. Between November 2014 and August 2018, the committee found 1,055 residential and 64 non-residential buildings had come up in the notified area. Of these, 191 were constructed with approval from the competent authority, 367 with approval from a non-competent authority and 338 without any approval. Mr. Jerome said that the entire process of submitting applications and relevant documents had been paperless. “This is for the first time, perhaps, that such an exercise (paperless) has been carried out,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/owners-of-300-buildings-to-get-sms-on-regularisation/article37816744.ece
03 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Govt. issues list of lessons to be omitted for SSLC students||The Department of Public Instruction on Thursday put out a truncated SSLC syllabus, days after the government announced that portions would be cut by 20%. While students will not be evaluated on the lessons that have been omitted, they can consider them for extended reading. In English, many poems and prose lessons have been cut. In Social Science, political developments of the 20th century, Indian Population, Social Problems, and Energy Resources will be cut for evaluation. However, many private school managements pointed out that they have completed the entire syllabus. Sumanth Narayan, founder of Shanthinikethana School, said that they had completed the syllabus. “All teachers can do is to tell students which chapters will not be tested in the examination. We will have to revise our question banks so that students don’t get confused. We hope that the Karnataka Secondary Education Examination Board will publish new question banks,” he said. On the other hand, H.K. Manjunath, president, Karnataka High School Assistant Masters Association, welcomed the revised syllabus. “Several government school teachers will be relieved as most of the omitted chapters were from second semester portions,” he said. Some teachers expressed concern that the omissions would make it difficult for students who opt for these subjects in PU. “In social studies, for instance, if students do not learn about the population, it will be difficult for them to grasp lessons if they opt for humanities in PU. So schools should at least do a cursory reading of these lessons,” said a government school teacher in South Bengaluru. Those schools that are yet to complete portions have decided to ask students to finish these lessons as assignments or project work. But not all parents are on board. “When students are racing against time to study for the examination, why should school managements give such pointless exercises ?" said Shreyas S., parent of a Class X student.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-issues-list-of-lessons-to-be-omitted-for-sslc-students/article37816748.ece
03 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘State has started aggressive testing and contact tracing’||Calling upon people not to panic, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar on Thursday said the State is equipped to handle the situation and has started aggressive testing and contact tracing. “We know very little about the clinical presentation of people infected with this variant. It is like any other variant and there is no need to panic. But everybody should be vigilant,” the Minister said. Mr. Sudhakar said Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who had gone to Delhi to meet the Union Health Minister, will hold deliberations with experts and officials after returning on Friday and announce further measures to be taken up. “We have already intensified screening and testing at the airports following his directions,” the Minister said. COVID-19 experts in the State said aggressive contact tracing is the need of the hour now. “So far, it does not look like the mortality rate or hospitalization of cases infected with this variant in other countries has gone up,” said V. Ravi, nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka. “There is no need to panic as this variant also belongs to COVID-19 family and symptoms will be more or less the same. While transmissibility is high, severity is low,” he said. Asserting that people due for the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine should come forward to get the shot, Dr Ravi said: “It is essential that people follow COVID-appropriate behaviour and avoid crowding.” Booster doses C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the States’ COVID-19 task force, said it was too early to say if this can be the onset of a third wave in the State. “Now the time has come for healthcare and frontline workers to get the booster dose. People should not panic as over 90% of the eligible population has got at least one dose of vaccine here. The scenario is different in the African continent where hardly 8% of the total 70 crore population is vaccinated,” he said. “Although there are reports that this variant evades vaccine-induced immunity too and even vaccinated people can get infected, inoculation can still reduce hospitalisation and disease severity,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-has-started-aggressive-testing-and-contact-tracing/article37816757.ece
03 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Siddaramaiah flays Gowda for indulging in ‘family politics’||The former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Thursday hit out at Janata Dal (Secular) national president and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda for his recent meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and once again called the regional party the ‘B team’ of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Speaking to reporters after inducting the former MLC C.R. Manohar from the JD(S), the former MLA Nagaraju from the BJP and other leaders and their supporters into the Congress, Mr. Siddaramaiah accused the regional party of indulging in “family politics”. “The JD(S) is a party of family politics. Now the eighth member from the family [Mr. Deve Gowda’s family] has entered politics. Remaining members of the family will also become elected representatives. They field family members where they can win. In places where they will lose, they field others. This is family politics,” the Congress leader said. Mr. Siddaramaiah, who is Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly, said the JD(S) had formed a government with the BJP in the past. “That’s the reason we call the JD(S) the B team of the BJP. The JD(S) has no ideology and its leaders indulge in opportunistic politics.” Only the Congress could stick to its ideology and fight against the “communal” BJP in elections, Mr. Siddaramaiah said. The Congress leader was referring to a recent meeting between Mr. Modi and Mr. Gowda in Delhi and a possible alliance between the BJP and the JD(S) for the Legislative Council elections scheduled for December 10. KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar welcomed all those who joined the Congress and said leaders from the BJP and the JD(S) had joined without any pre-conditions. “There is no difference between old and new members in the party. Anyone who joins us is part of us. Without indulging in personality cult, work for the party,” he told the newcomers. Noting that there was a pro-Congress wave in the State, Mr. Shivakumar said the party would win maximum number of seats in the Council polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/siddaramaiah-flays-gowda-for-indulging-in-family-politics/article37816779.ece

The police arrested Mohammed Sahil, who was wielding the machete, and later tracked down his associates Faisal, Fazal, and Abdul Manas from Kerala. They recovered over Rs. 20 lakh of unaccounted cash and hundreds of deposit slips from various banks from their houses. Police claim they are part of a huge money laundering racket involving crores of rupees. High drama near ATM A Bengaluru-based businessman, Venkatesh T.S., saw a man, later identified as Sahil, acting suspiciously while trying to deposit cash into an ATM at a kiosk at Jaraganahalli on Tuesday. The businessman watched the man closely and estimated that he was carrying around Rs. 1 lakh that he was trying to deposit. He spotted a machete in the man’s backpack, and alerted people in the area. A small group of people attempted to corner Sahil who pulled out a machete and tried to attack them. By then others, who had gathered at the spot, joined in and were able to pin him down. “Inquiries revealed that Sahil and his associates were involved in a racket where they would deposit money into accounts for a commission of Rs. 60,000 per month. During a search of their residences, we recovered Rs. 20,15,700 in cash, along with a cash counting machine,” said a senior police officer. The police also recovered hundreds of deposit slips with details of multiple accounts in 25 banks over the last three months. On Thursday, the police arrested Abdul Manas, the fourth accomplice of the three arrested accused. The four accused revealed that they were operating on the directions of another man who is currently absconding. “They converted unaccounted cash into white money by depositing it into various bank accounts as part of a money laundering exercise,” Harish Pandey, DCP (South) said. “A total of Rs. 31.5 crores seems to have been deposited in the 185 out of 2,656 accounts for which we have received statements from the banks already,” he added. Further investigation is in progress and the police have the cooperation of other agencies who specialise in money laundering.

03 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Pothole death: BBMP engineer held||An assistant executive engineer of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and a truck driver were arrested after a 21-year-old food delivery executive died while reportedly negotiating a pothole-ridden stretch on Thanisandra Main Road on November 27. The victim, Azeen Ahmed, was on his scooter when he is believed to have lost his balance while riding on a bad patch on the newly-asphalted road. He fell down and was run over by a goods vehicle. He was taken to a nearby hospital where he succumbed due to excessive bleeding. During the course of investigation, Banaswadi traffic police found negligence on the part of the assistant executive engineer (AEE), Mahadevapura zone, who reportedly failed to get the bad patch repaired. “This amounts to sheer negligence. The assistant executive engineer was made prime accused and arrested, along with the truck driver,” said the police. BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that he has sought a report from the Special Commissioner (Projects). “It’s not right for the police to file an FIR based on rumours or suspicions. Civic officials are on the spot and attend to problems. Such accidents will not be justified and action should be initiated against the officials who are found to be at fault. However, in this particular instance, it appears prima facie that the BBMP is not at fault,” he said. Both the AEE and the truck driver have been charged with death due to negligence, and the driver also for rash and negligent driving. Efforts are on to track down the civil contractor, who is the third accused in the case, and is presently on the run. The AEE was later released on station bail.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pothole-death-bbmp-engineer-held/article37816745.ece

PIL petition A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum issued the directions while hearing a PIL petition filed in 2019 by one Gurunath Vadde of Bidar complaining about failure of the Government to establish various offices of the Government for the benefit of public in these taluks. The Government, in response to the court’s March 2020 direction to indicate outer limit to establish offices in 50 new taluks, on November 23 stated that the offices of tahasildar and taluk panchayat were functioning in these taluks but opening of other taluk-level offices had been postponed for administrative reasons for the time being as suggested by the Finance Department. The Government has also said that there was financial constraint to establish other offices in these taluks at present. The Secretary of the Revenue Department will have to appear in person if the Government fails to file a better affidavit by February 1, 2022 on making the offices functional.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-expresses-displeasure-over-delay-in-opening-of-govt-offices-in-50-new-taluks/article37816773.ece

A Division Bench comprising Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice Anant Ramanath Hegde issued the direction while upholding the November 3, 2020 judgment of a single judge, which had quashed the Union Government’s February 14, 2019 notification of including the RRMCH under the Chennai-based deemed university on the recommendations made by the UGC. The order was passed while disposing of an appeal filed by Moogambigai Charitable and Educational Trust, which was managing RRMCH against the single judge order. The Division Bench said the UGC violated the regulations, which mandate consideration of the State Government’s views. The Karnataka Government in January 2019 wrote to the UGC opposing the opinion given by a panel allowing transfer of the RRMCH to the Chennai-based deemed university. Meanwhile, the Division Bench said the judge, after quashing transfer notification, ought not to have dealt with the other issues, namely whether Moogambigai Trust and the MGR Trust are administered by separate managements, etc. The Division Bench has given two months to the UGC and the Centre to decide on the issue of transfer after considering the objection submitted by the State Government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/examine-afresh-transfer-of-medical-college-to-deemed-university-ugc-centre-told/article37816774.ece

03 December 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Uniform wholesale pricing sought for medicine||In view of the stiff competition being faced by the retail medical stores against the relatively strong branded medical stores that have established a chain of medical stores across the country, Sharanu Pappa, secretary of Hyderabad Karnataka Chamber of Commerce & Industry (HKCCI), a body of traders and industrialists, has demanded that the government bring out a uniform wholesale pricing mechanism for both the chain medical stores and the retail medicine stores to enable the latter to compete with the former and survive in business thereby sustaining the employment of hundreds of youths. In a media note released here on Thursday, Mr. Pappa expressed apprehensions of retail medical stores with small investments collapsing against the onslaught of chain medical stores with heavy investments thereby rendering thousands of youths employed by the former jobless. “Branded medicine companies that have established chains of medical stores across India are buying medicines from producers in a large-scale at very low prices and offering heavy discounts to customers. This is directly affecting the business of retail medicine stores that have been established with low investments. The onslaught of big players in the sector has pushed the retail business to the verge of collapse. The retail medical stores have provided employment opportunities to thousands of youths across the country and are supporting the livelihoods of their families,” Mr. Pappa said. He then appealed to the government to intervene and bring out a uniform wholesale pricing mechanism for both the branded medicine stores (chain medical stores) and the retail medicine stores so as to enable the latter to compete with the former and survive in business.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/uniform-wholesale-pricing-sought-for-medicine/article37816971.ece

It would pave way for fostering relations among communities and religions. All religions stressed on the welfare of mankind, maintaining humanity and on maintaining cordial relations with people of different religions. In his introductory remarks, Pattadhikari of Shree Kshetra Dharmasthala D. Veerendra Heggade said that practising dharma and social service should go hand-in-hand.

03 December 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Forest guards open fire on tribal in Nagarahole||A controversy is brewing over forest guards opening fire on a tribal in the Hunsur wildlife range of Nagarahole in Periyapatna. The incident took place near Rangigate hamlet on Wednesday and the tribal identified as Basava is undergoing treatment at K.R.Hospital in Mysuru. A section of the adivasis led by Jede Jayappa claimed that the Forest Department was trying to fix Basava on false charges. Averring that he was an eyewitness to the incident Jayappa said Basava had gone to an adjoining field to answer the call of nature but was shot by forest guards at around 10.30 a.m. without any reason. But the forest guards brough a few gunny bags with sandalwood logs and kept it at the spot where the shooting took place and painted a picture that Basava was caught red-handed in the act, alleged Jayappa. Jayappa, who spoke to media persons in Mysuru on Thursday, said the local police have refused to take cognisance of their complaint or register an FIR. “We were told that the Forest Department itself has filed an FIR against us and hence there was no need to register the case twice as the details will be unraveled during the course of the investigation’’, said Jayappa. Meanwhile, Mahesh Kumar, Director, Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, refuted the allegations of harassment or fixing anyone in a smuggling case. He said Basava was part of a sandalwood smuggling gang and hunt was to nab the others who are absconding. The guards opened fire in self-defence as they had come under attack and were hospitalised at Kushalnagar but discharged later. Countering the charges of the adivasis that the Forest Department brought sandalwood to set up a crime scene Mr. Mahesh Kumar said the department had prior information of timber felling and sandalwood smuggling and reached the spot. “It is a frequent occurrence in this part of the forest and they had gone scot-free all these days but have been caught red-handed this time. In case the Forest Department wanted to wreak revenge, it would have registered any number of cases. But instead the case has been handed over to the police for investigation’’, he added. Meanwhile, Kannada actor Chetan who was informed of the developments by a network of activists, took up cudgels on behalf of the adivasis and said such ‘atrocities’ on tribals should stop.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/forest-guards-open-fire-on-tribal-in-nagarahole/article37817166.ece
03 December 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||LIC employees demonstrate against IPO||Employees of LIC of India in the Mysuru region staged a demonstration during lunch break on Thursday to oppose the Government’s proposed move to disinvest from LIC and float Initial Public Offer (IPO). More than 100 employees assembled at the LIC Divisional Office at the Millennium Circle in the city to air their opposition. In all, about 1,000 employees are on the rolls of LIC in Mysuru Division and the demonstration was held at all the 23 branches of LIC in five districts comprising the division. The LIC employees said the BJP Government was in a hurry to sell the national assets at a throwaway price by disinvesting in public sector companies. Instead of taxing the rich to meet the budgetary requirements, the Government was trying to sell the public assets to corporates and private capital and this is contrary to the concept of Atmanirbhar Bharat, according to the members of South Central Zone Insurance Employees Federation.  The demonstrators demanded that the proposal to list LIC in the stock market should be withdrawn, increase of FDI in insurance from 49 per cent to 74 per cent should be withdrawn, privatisation of public sector general insurance companies should be stopped and the GST on the insurance premium should also be withdrawn.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/lic-employees-demonstrate-against-ipo/article37817164.ece

Arguing that electricity should be considered as a public welfare service and not a commercial commodity, the SUCI, in its memorandum to the Prime Minister, said the electricity tariff should not be increased for the common consumers in the name of lifting the purported “cross-subsidy”. They demanded that electricity should be supplied free to agriculture, free up to 200 units to households and small industries, whereas the small businesses should be billed one rupee per unit. They demanded that no restrictions should be imposed on common consumers in the production and use of non-conventional energy.

The immediate cause for the rift among the artistes is the choice of Chakravarthi Sulibele, founder of Yuva Brigade, as one of the speakers of an event during the festival to be held from December 10 to 19 in the city. The amateur artistes have not planned a joint protest or demonstration as of now but have taken the decision in their individual capacities. The general argument is that Chakravarthi Sulibele is not connected in anyway with theatre and is known to harbour a specific ideology. “We have no issues with any of our fellow artistes harbouring different ideologies, but Sulibele is neither an artiste nor has he contributed anything to the cause’’, according to an amateur artiste who has expressed his ire over the developments. Verbal spar The issue also came up during the press conference and Rangayana Director Adannda Cariappa was embroiled in a verbal spar with a section of the journalists over the choice of the speaker who was described as “social worker’’. The theme of the festival is mother and encompasses a wide gamut of issues under it including Jaminu (agricultural land), Jala (water), Jangal (forest), Januwaru (animals) and Jana (people). The festival will feature 33 plays apart from seminar, film festival, folk programmes etc.  The general argument is that Chakravarthi Sulibele, founder of Yuva Brigade, is not connected in anyway with theatre and is known to harbour a specific ideology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/amateur-artists-to-boycott-bahurupi-2021/article37816750.ece

The order for 3,750 cast iron bricks is worth more than Rs. 1 crore. “We handed over six samples of cast iron bricks to the CSL. The Indian Navy examined the samples and gave clearance. We hope to hand over the rest of the cast iron bricks, each weighing 30 kg, by the end of this month,” said an official of Autokast. In March 2021, Autokast supplied five deck-mounted closed chocks, manufactured as per ISO 13729, for INS Vikrant . Another order Officials said Autokast had received a separate order from the CSL for 16 bulwark-mounted chocks. Autokast, which was accorded a Class ‘A’ Foundry status by the Lucknow-based Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO) of the Union Ministry of Railways in 2019, recently handed over five Casnub bogies for goods trains built at its manufacturing unit at Cherthala in Alappuzha to the Northern Railway. Autokast, which was once listed for privatisation, is on the path of revival. Its change of fortune can be attributed to the previous Left Democratic Front government’s efforts, which injected money and helped it to modernise the unit.

03 December 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||This passionate farmer grows 170 varieties of plantain||The 3.45 acres owned by M.K. Nishant, a farmer at Peruvaka near Mananthavady in Wayanad district, is literally a treasure trove of bananas, as he has been nurturing as many as 178 cultivars of plantains collected from across the country. Plantain varieties such as ‘Kadhali’, ‘Chenkadhali’, ‘Matti’, and cultivars of the commonly cultivated varieties of ‘Nendran’ such as ‘Chengalikodan’, ‘Swarnamukhi’, and ‘Nedunendran’ are luxuriously growing in his farm. A rare variety called ‘Mancharikullan’, which flowers in the sixth month, is also kept in his collection along with medicinal bananas such as ‘Adukkan’, ‘Kunnan’, and ‘Karinkadhali’. ‘Peyan’, a variety with an exclusive use for curry purpose, is also being conserved in the garden. Interestingly, Mr. Nishant uses social media for collecting the banana germplasm and to be in touch with banana farmers across the country. Since the farmer is an active member of banana lovers group like ‘Vazhagramam’, most farmers give him new saplings. Most of his collections are from his friends who live in Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam districts. He gets rare varieties such as ‘Engambi’, ‘Buluvazha’, and ‘Peyan’ from friends on social media. “I love plantain owing to its fast growth, high yield, exquisite taste, and aroma. My father has conserved 53 varieties on our farm, and that inspired me to collect more,” Mr. Nishant said. “As many farmers approach me for the medicinal verities, I am planning to cultivate more such varieties to cater to their needs,” he added. A balanced approach is being followed in his garden, as attention is paid to both conservation and commercial production of fruits. Experimental trials have to be started with the most suitable varieties of banana since the farmer provides sufficient quantities of saplings, said Joseph John, scientist at the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation here. Modern techniques such as tissue culture and other vegetative propagation methods should be used in getting more suckers from the rarest of banana varieties conserved in his garden, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/this-passionate-farmer-grows-170-varieties-of-plantain/article37817051.ece

In turn, Muslim communalists had attacked shops and other places. The CPI(M) came forward to thwart the RSS’s plan to extensively demolish mosques. Mr. Jayarajan said that the Muslim League’s attempts to misuse mosques for political propaganda had created opportunities for Hindutva extremists.

Lekshmi won the best director for the film, which was screened at the monthly Cannes World Film Festival in October. The film will be one of the entries at the Cannes World Film Festival — Remember the Future’s annual competition in 2022.  Kombal , which roughly translates to girl, depicts a middle-aged woman’s daily struggle to live. Trapped in an oppressive environment at home, she finds solace in taking care of her pet hen and chicks. “The story is built around an incident that pushes her into an abyss of pain and hopelessness,” she says. “An entry at Cannes World Film Festival is a huge encouragement. The selection process involved multiple rounds, and it had some of the best films from around the world. I consider it an achievement to have been able to tell a story from my region for a global audience,” says Ms. Pushpa, who hails from Andoorkonam in Thiruvananthapuram. Shot at Pangode in Thiruvananthapuram, the 20-minute film has been winning accolades in the Indian festival circuit. It won over 12 awards, including those for best actor, screenplay, direction, background score, and sound design. It was the ‘best film’ at the Blackboard International Film Festival and the ‘second best film’ at IFTA Short Film Festival. Jolly Chirayath won the best actor award for her lead role in the Museum Talkies International Film Festival and the Madras Independent Film Festival. Ms. Pushpa’s debut short film, Ama , also dwelt on the female experience. “What I express through my films is a natural extension of what I have seen, felt and gone through as a woman,” she says. Scripted by Arathi M.R., Kombal was produced by Preeya Nair and P.V. Omana. Sreerag Mangatt has done the cinematography, and background music is by Basil C.J.

03 December 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Water Metro ferries to be rolled out in April 2022||The first lot of Water Metro ferries will in all probability be launched in April 2022, a further revision on the extended deadline of December 25 this year, sources in Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) said. According to the initial revised deadline, the ferries were expected to be rolled out in December 2020. This was postponed every few months, after the first couple of hybrid vessels, which were tailor-made to operate on both electric power and power from a diesel generator on board, reportedly encountered teething problems related to propulsion systems. The latest revision of deadline to April 2022 will make their launch come 14 months after the Vyttila-Kakkanad route was commissioned by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in February 2021. Back in September, the metro agency had said the ferries would initially kick off operations in the Vypeen-Bolgatty-High Court-Eloor-Cheranalloor corridor and a few other routes where boat jetties were under different stages of completion, from December-end. “The first batch of five vessels will operate from April,” said KMRL managing director Loknath Behera. The metro agency has entrusted the construction of a total of twenty-three 50-seater ferries conceived in the first phase of the project to Cochin Shipyard. Glitches rectified Sources said Cochin Shipyard had set right technical glitches that the first couple of ferries had encountered, which delayed their sea trials. A few problems like the ones associated with their ‘battery power’ have been sorted out. The vessels ought to go through more trials to ensure their foolproof operation, they added. Such teething issues had resulted in they undergoing basin trials for an extensive period. This resulted in the Centre and other stakeholders being critical of the delay in launching the ferries. Indigenous technologies On the vast many components of Water Metro ferries being sourced from abroad, Sandith Thandassery, a naval architect whose firm built Aditya , India’s first solar-powered ferry which won global acclaim, said the ferries could have been launched way earlier had the shipyard banked on technologies that were available within the country. “One ought to learn from ship operators from Europe who outsource labour-intensive works like hull construction to developing countries, while banking on their own technology for installing key components. It is under this circumstance that I shot off letters to the Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises earlier this year, taking offence at qualified firms within India / Kerala not being part of the Water Metro project,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/water-metro-ferries-to-be-rolled-out-in-april-2022/article37817071.ece
03 December 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Hike in LPG prices puts hoteliers in a bind||Wednesday’s hike of over Rs. 101.50 for the commercial cooking gas cylinder has dealt a blow to the hotel industry, especially small eateries, desperately trying to stay afloat following the COVID-19 outbreak. Since the start of the year, the price has been raised by Rs. 1,000 while it has been offset by a meagre reduction of Rs. 187. The biggest hike of Rs. 266 kicked in last month. Small-scale traders “Now I have to buy a cylinder for around Rs. 2,150, including the tip to the delivery boy. But I can hardly increase the price of tea as it will not go down well with customers. The government seems hell bent on disrupting the lives of small and marginal traders,” says Ajo George, who runs Chayakoppa, a coffee shop, at Jos Junction. Helpless G. Jayapal, State general secretary, Kerala Hotel and Restaurants Association (KHRA), says the majority of small and medium eateries are not in a position to hike prices despite the gas cylinder turning costlier by Rs. 367 in less than two months and around Rs. 1,000 this year. “They are scared that even a marginal increase in price will strip them of what little business they have now. It has been our long-standing demand to bring down GST of the commercial cooking gas cylinder from 18% to 5% in parity with the domestic cooking gas cylinder at least in the case of small and medium players,” he says. The KHRA is now planning to organise a Parliament march in coordination with their counterparts from across the country to bring their plight to the notice of the rulers. Agency commission LPG agencies are a worried lot as well with their agency commission not having been revised in the past four to five years. “With the increased price, we have to pay around Rs. 4 lakh up front to oil companies for a load of commercial cooking gas of about 216-220 cylinders. Since the agencies lift loads almost on a daily basis, finding funds for that and operational expenses is posing a serious challenge,” says a staff with a city-based gas agency.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hike-in-lpg-prices-puts-hoteliers-in-a-bind/article37817088.ece
03 December 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Underpass proposed at Collectorate Jn.||The PWD (Roads Wing) has submitted a proposal to the State government to build an underpass at Collectorate Junction, for inclusion in the upcoming State Budget, to streamline traffic through the congested junction on Seaport-Airport Road. In addition, the agency is formulating a proposal to widen the stretch from Bharat Mata College to Collectorate Junction and the portion from Infopark Junction to Irumpanam into four-lane, for government approval. Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) is already engaged in widening the corridor from Collectorate Junction to Infopark Junction as part of the metro’s Kakkanad extension. For now, the PWD has done patch work on potholed portions, using bituminous concrete, District Collector Jafar Malik said. Land was acquired at 30-metre width by the Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala (RBDCK) for the 11.50-km-long Seaport-Airport Road over two decades ago, to develop it into a four-lane corridor. Successive governments turned down proposals in this regard, despite a massive increase in the number of vehicles and accidents on the stretch. This resulted in the agency being able to widen only the limited stretch from HMT Junction to Bharat Mata College. Even worse, the width of the tarred carriageway from Chitrapuzha Bridge to Irumpanam is still limited to seven metres, leaving little room for safe movement of pedestrians and vehicles. The PWD took over the road in 2020, while the Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala (RBDCK) is still in charge of extending it beyond HMT Junction up to the international airport. “The rest of the stretch can be widened without much hassles, since embankments to support the road are limited to mostly the Collectorate Junction-Olimugal Junction stretch. With KMRL engaged in widening the portion through which the metro viaduct will pass, the PWD’s job has been made easy, especially so since the tarred carriageway and vacant land on either side are at much the same height elsewhere on the corridor. The Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board [KIIFB] can easily allot funds, especially since there is no need for fresh land acquisition,” official sources said. Underpass Minimal land acquisition is required for the underpass mooted at Collectorate Junction, to ready service roads on either side. This is unlikely to be a problem, since land on all four sides is owned by government agencies, sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/underpass-proposed-at-collectorate-jn/article37817069.ece

The rising economic power of India would need to be underpinned by military power and hence the need for a potent, flexible, survivable platform such as an aircraft carrier with a range of capabilities, he told the media on board the lead ship of the First Training Squadron INS Tir on Thursday. The plan was awaiting the nod of the Ministry of Defence and a third carrier was actually ‘affordable’ given the fact that the outlay would be spread over a period of 15 years, he said. On the growing concerns over China, he said while the Navy had factored this in in its Maritime Capability Perspective Plan, all the Services were seized of the challenges and developing capabilities accordingly. Best practices learnt during interactions with friendly foreign navies got dovetailed into the Navy’s training philosophies, the way it operated and even in the ‘requirements’ on its platforms. To a question, he said the Navy inducted women since 1992 in various roles and they even served as pilots and air operations officers (airborne combatants) besides on board ships since last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/navy-clear-about-need-for-3rd-aircraft-carrier-vice-admiral/article37817081.ece

The court convicted Megha Bhargava, who married the man, and her sister, Prachi Sharma Bhargava, in the case. The prosecution case was that the third accused, Mahendra Bundela from Madhya Pradesh, approached the family members of the man and made the marriage proposal with Megha after wilfully concealing the fact that she had married twice before. According to the prosecution, after the marriage, which was held in Kochi, Megha escaped to Indore, Madhya Pradesh. She took along with her gifts like gold and diamond ornaments, watch, clothes, and Rs. 5.5 lakh in cash. Later, she got married to another person and duped him too, the prosecution submitted. Eldos Mathew, the Judicial First Class Magistrate 8, ordered that the man shall be paid a compensation of Rs. 9.5 lakh. Lenin P. Sukumaran and S. Saiju, Assistant Public Prosecutors, appeared in the case, which was charged by the Kadavanthra police. While convicting the women, the court noted that the accused had targeted only disabled persons, as they were vulnerable and, therefore, unable to react to atrocities committed against them. The law has to take its will to safeguard disabled persons from the wicked, the court noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/two-get-jail-for-cheating-speech-impaired-person/article37817072.ece

The waste generated from the demolition of the buildings should have been collected and transported to a designated place. Thereafter, construction and demolition waste was required to be processed for re-utilisation in various civil works, according to the report filed by the southern zone regional office of the Ministry before the National Green Tribunal. It said each waste generator was prima facie responsible for collection and segregation of concrete and soil and should ensure that other waste (solid waste) did not get mixed with the former and was stored and disposed separately. The local authority has to ensure that waste is transported to appropriate sites for processing and disposal either through its own resources or by engaging private contractors. The PCB has to monitor the implementation of rules by the local bodies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/onus-on-local-bodies-to-shift-waste-says-centre/article37817079.ece
03 December 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Eight drug cases against Syju Thankachan||The Kochi City police have registered eight cases at six different police stations against Syju Thankachan, an accused in the Chakkaraparambu accident case, under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act for consumption of synthetic and natural drugs. Cases have been registered at Panangadu, South, Maradu, Thrikkakara, Infopark and Fort Kochi police stations. More cases are likely to be registered against him. Police explain action “We have bunched up instances of use of drugs in terms of days and locations and will register separate cases,” said C.H. Nagaraju, District Police Chief (Kochi City). The move comes close on the heels of discovery of videos and images of parties attended by the accused in which drugs were widely used. The police have not ruled out the possibility of Syju being involved in dealing in drugs as well. They feel that since he has been found in the company of so many different groups, he could either be the supplier or the common link. The police have also identified most persons who attended those parties and are in the process of tracking them down. They could also end up as accused for consumption of drugs. Hotel owner in hospital Meanwhile, efforts by the police to get the owner of the hotel No. 18, Roy. J. Vayalat, discharged from hospital proved in vain on Thursday. He is recuperating after undergoing angioplasty. The cardiologist treating him told the police that his blood pressure was unstable. Roy is supposed to appear before the police on the first Monday after his discharge. They suspect him to be delaying the discharge for fear of being confronted along with Syju. The police are confident that they have a solid case despite not being able to retrieve the hard disk, which is supposed to contain crucial evidence from the party at the hotel prior to the accident. “As such, we have enough evidence, including CCTV footage of the accident, to prove the charges,” said Mr. Nagaraju.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/eight-cases-against-syju-thankachan/article37817073.ece

Justice Devan Ramachandran also directed the State government to inform the court whether the government had evolved any policy with respect to the issue. When a petition seeking a directive to remove illegal flagpoles in the Mannam sugar mill compound at Pandalam came up for hearing, the government submitted that various flag-masts along roads and at public spaces, if erected without authorisation, would have to be dealt with appropriately in law. Policy decision The government submitted that since these flagpoles were made several years ago , it would require the State government to take an appropriate decision to avoid unnecessary law-and-order problems in future. The Chief Minister would convene an all-party meeting to take a policy decision in this regard. The court observed that there was actually no need for the CM to look into the matter and take a policy decision. While appreciating the government for taking steps in this regard, the court observed that “the competent authorities are obligated to act as per the law.” The court said the stage was now set for the District Collectors to step in and take necessary action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/illegal-flag-masts-hc-asks-collectors-to-file-report/article37817085.ece

Corals has already departed Androth with passengers from Kalpeni, Androth, and Agatti bound for Kochi. Soon after the fire broke out at noon on Wednesday, the ship’s operator, Lakshadweep Development Corporation Ltd. (LDCL), alerted the Coast Guard Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre in Mumbai following which Samar, which was in the vicinity of the vessel in distress, was given instructions to provide assistance. Power outage m.v. Kavaratti’s crew was able to control the fire, but there was power outage. Although CGS Samar reached the spot without delay, the passengers could not be transferred due to shell evacuation door remaining non-operational. The sea was not conducive for passenger transfer, either. Despite Samar being a much smaller ship compared to m.v. Kavaratti, Coast Guard officers took the call to tow the stranded ship in consideration of passenger safety. The ships’ movement, therefore, was very slow, said an official. The Indian Navy also dispatched its ship Shardul with a team of engineers to provide assistance to m.v. Kavaratti. Towed to Androth on Thursday morning, m.v. Kavaratti remained berthed there at the time of filing this report for instructions to be taken under tow to Kochi for repairs. “We would also see if it would be possible to run on one of the unaffected engines. But that is a call to be taken by LDCL,” said an official. Food supplied Meanwhile, after some delay, the stranded passengers of m.v. Kavaratti received food and water. m.v.

The four vehicles which were flagged off by people’s representatives on Thursday are loaded with 13 essential items including rice and pulses to ensure an affordable purchase for ration card holders. Supplyco’s Assistant Regional Manager Manoj Kumar says the two-day special drive is expected to cover maximum number of distant villages where consumers have limited access to fair price outlets controlled by the government. Compared to the high market price, Supplyco products are now offered at a very affordable price to ration card holders, he adds. The total sales of Rs. 4.38 lakh during the two-day special drive recently conducted in Kasaragod and Wayanad districts have been a rewarding experience for the Supplyco authorities to proceed with the mobile fairs covering more taluks in other northern Kerala districts. There are nine vehicles now in service for the Mobile Maveli units in Kozhikode and Kannur districts. According to the Supplyco authorities, the units have been doing well in Kozhikode, Kannur, Wayanad and Kasaragod districts. Wayanad district has four permanent units covering Kalpetta, Manathavady and Sultan Bathery. In Kannur district, the permanent units are functioning at Taliparamba and Thalassery. Kozhikode district has two units covering Koduvally and Vadakara areas, they point out. The main intention behind launching the mobile units is to reach out to financially backward segments and tribespeople in rural areas. Five major village pockets will be covered by the vehicles a day. Detailed schedules have already been circulated in various villages to attract public participation. To clarify doubts, there is also a control room at the State headquarters. The drive may be extended after reviewing the public response to the service.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/supplycos-mobile-maveli-stores-to-cover-distant-rural-villages/article37817056.ece

But, things are slowly getting back to normalcy and next month will see the Kerala Literary Festival, one of the biggest events in the State’s cultural calendar, making a return to the physical world. The sixth edition of the KLF will be held here from January 20 to 23. “We are happy that we are conducting the KLF once again,” Ravi Deecee, the festival’s chief facilitator, told The Hindu on Thursday. “Though we organised an online KLF this year – and it was well-received too – we the organisers missed the real thing.” So did the book-loving people of Malabar, and beyond, too – if the number of registrations is anything to go by. “More than 8,000 people have registered during the last one week,” said Ravi. “The KLF has gained a reputation as one of India’s most important literature festivals and we didn’t want to lose the momentum we have built. That is why we decided to conduct it this year, despite the challenges posed by COVID-19.” 400 speakers As in previous years, this year too will feature a long, strong line-up of speakers from across the world. Jeffrey Archer, Wendy Doniger and Chris Kraus are among the biggest attractions. About 400 speakers will take part in some 200 sessions. They include Ada Yonath, Abhijit Banerjee, Arundhati Roy, Remo Fernandes, Sagarika Ghose, Shashi Tharoor, Manu S. Pillai, Devdutt Pattanaik and Sudhir Kakar.

At a joint meeting of Muthavallis (managing trustees of waqf) and office-bearers of mahal madrasas here on Thursday to chalk out strategies against the government, IUML Malappuram district president and Sunni Yuva Jana Sangham State vice president Panakkad Syed Sadiqali Shihab Thangal said the party leadership had not taken a decision to sensitise the Muslim community to the Wakf appointments during the Friday prayers. The decision was taken at the core committee of Muslim organisations, he said. CPI(M) reaction The decision drew sharp reactions and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) came out against using mosques for “anti-government campaign.” Mr. Sadiqali Thangal said the IUML, which endorsed all the decisions of the Samsta Kerala Jameyyath Ul-Ulama in this regard, was withdrawing for the time-being from the awareness discourse owing to the political controversy triggered in the State. Also, the party supported the campaign of the Samasta on December 10. Protest on Dec. 10 Earlier, Samasta president Syed Mohammed Jafri Muthukoya Thangal, who inaugurated the meeting, said the organisation and all its feeder outfits would support the protest of the Muslim organisations and the campaign on December 10 to explain the fallout of the decision of entrusting the Waqf Board appointments to the PSC. The Samasta wanted the existing system of appointments to prevail. So far, the organisation had not officially given a call for any protests, he said. Mr. Muthukoya Thangal said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had called him over phone and had agreed to hold discussions on the apprehensions of the Muslim community. Samasta general secretary K. Alikutty Musliyar had also deliberated with CPI(M) leader Elamaram Karim on the issue. Decision after talks He said the Samasta would take a call on agitations after these discussions. If a concrete decision was not arrived at, the Samata would be in the forefront of the struggles. He slammed Minister for Wakf and Haj V. Abdurahiman for stating that the proposal would be implemented at any cost. If the Chief Minister had talked in a respectful manner, the Minister showed arrogance on the issue, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/iuml-not-for-mosque-campaign/article37817084.ece

According to sources, the strike affected services at the outpatient department and many wards and it is likely to impact patients in the coming days. Emergency services such as casualty, intensive care units, labour wards and COVID duties were exempted from the strike. Functionaries of the Calicut chapter of the Kerala Medical Post Graduate Association (KMPGA) said that the workload of resident doctors had increased because fresh batch of students were yet to join medical colleges. Every year, new batches arrive at least by July. This year, however, the NEET-PG results had been delayed and counselling for admissions was yet to begin even two months after the results were declared, they said. This had also affected the academic works, the PG doctors pointed out. The Supreme Court has delayed the allotment for another four weeks as a final verdict is yet to be issued on the reservations for the economically weaker sections (EWS). Right now, only two batches of postgraduate medical students are there in medical colleges. They are supposed to engage in studies while being part of hospital functioning. By January-February, final year students would be relieved from duties as they are about to write their final exams. At a time when the health infrastructure is expecting a third wave of the pandemic with the discovery of the Omicron variant, leaving only one batch of medical postgraduates in medical colleges would prove to be risky, they said. The PG doctors are demanding that the contentious issues related to the EWS category be sorted out at the earliest or the new guidelines be included in next year’s admissions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pg-doctors-at-kozhikode-mch-join-indefinite-strike/article37817046.ece

According to senior government doctors, blood donation is yet to reach the pre-pandemic levels. Because of the COVID-19 protocol, there are restrictions on large-scale outreach camps. Both the Government Medical College Hospital and the Government Hospital for Women and Children in Kozhikode have not been holding such events these days. Instances of individuals coming on their own to donate blood are also becoming rare. M.K.

Though COVID-19-related doubts are preventing many from donating blood, Dr. Sribiju said that infected persons can do it if they test negative in an RT-PCR test after two weeks. The donor should be in good health, mentally alert and physically fit. They must be in the 18-65 age group. Right after taking vaccination and inoculation, people cannot donate blood or components. Those who are taking COVID-19 vaccines should wait for two weeks. The Forum is planning awareness events in the coming days, he added. Sources at the Government Hospital for Women and Children said that there is no bar in private individuals from donating blood to government-approved blood banks. Voluntary organisations also need to be more proactive, they said. Another government doctor, who wished not to be quoted, claimed that some private hospitals are found to be conducting camps in violation of rules. Blood bank functionaries, however, said they were not aware of any such developments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/blood-donation-yet-to-pick-up-pace-in-kozhikode-district/article37817047.ece

Techies, including women, harvested 70 cents of paddy adjacent to the park building. In addition to paddy, vegetables and fruits are grown in the park, a press release said here. At a time when widespread concerns about work-related stress of IT professionals are mounting, a variety of crops are being grown on the park’s spacious grounds, with the aim of providing stress relief to UL Cyberpark workers. UL Cyberpark is owned by the Uralungal Labour Contract Co-operative Society (ULCCS), one of the largest primary co-operatives in Asia. Ramesan Paleri, Chairman, ULCCS, inaugurated the harvest festival. It is the policy of ULCCS to promote agriculture in all the project sites and institutions of the Uralungal Society, said Mr. Ramesan Paleri. The Cyberpark is a green campus with the gold certification of the India Green Building Council. He added that a model like this that connects professionals in modern industries to land and agriculture developing organic links to nature is rare to find. The Rakthasali variety of rice is cultivated in the Cyberpark. This seed variety is high yielding and has various medicinal properties. The fact that very little water is sufficient for its cultivation makes this seed important in this age of climate change and planned water use, said T.K. Kishore Kumar, General Manager, UL Cyberpark.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/when-techies-turn-to-farming-to-beat-stress/article37817043.ece

The deceased was identified as P.B. Sandeep Kumar, 33, secretary of the Peringara local committee of the CPI(M) and a former member of the local panchayat. The incident took place around 8.30 p.m. when he reportedly intervened in a dispute between the assailants and another person. As he left the spot on a motorcycle, the accused chased him in another vehicle and attacked him. The victim, who sustained deep injuries on his chest, was rushed to the Thiruvalla taluk hospital, but his life could not be saved. RSS blamed Local CPI(M) workers alleged that the murder had been executed by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh workers. A top CPI(M) leader in the district said the murder was politically motivated and that the Sangh Parivar was behind the murder. According to unconfirmed reports there has been tension in the area for the past few days following friction between CPI(M) activists and RSS workers.

The members of the commissions held preliminary discussion with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Higher Education Minister R. Bindu here on Thursday as part of evolving a strategy for the exercise. To hold discussions Interacting with mediapersons later, Shyam B. Menon, chairman of the Commission for Reforms in Higher Education, said the panels would hold discussions with officials of universities, teaching and non-teaching staff, students, and other stakeholders. Various aspects, including access to higher education, creation of centres of excellence, and the relationship between universities and colleges will be taken into context. “Having been given a comprehensive mandate, the commissions will reach out to all stakeholders,” Dr. Menon said. Opportune phase Commission convener Pradeep T. said the State was passing through an opportune phase with all sections, right from the government to the common populace, yearning for a change in the higher education sector. Mahatma Gandhi University Pro Vice Chancellor C.T. Aravindakumar, the chairman of the Commission for Reforms in Examinations in Universities and Higher Education Institutions, said the panel would provide high priority to using technology in the examination system and reforming outdated laws. Dr. Bindu said the commissions had been asked to submit their recommendations by March 2022. On whether the National Education Policy would influence the endeavour, the Minister said the constructive provisions of the policy would be assimilated in a manner that suited the ground realities in the State. Suggestions While the proposed reforms would concern universities that come under the purview of the Higher Education Department, they could include suggestions that could have bearing on the others like the Kerala University of Health Sciences, the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/education-panels-set-to-hold-meets/article37817337.ece
03 December 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||74 kids rehabilitated under Sarana Balyam project||As many as 74 children have been rescued from child labour across the State and rehabilitated under the Sarana Balyam project of the Women and Child Development Department since November 2018. Sarana Balyam, piloted by the department in 2017 and extended across the State a year later, focusses on child labour along with areas such as child beggary, children living on the streets, abandoned, trafficked, and so on. Of the 74 children rescued from child labour, the maximum have been in Pathanamthitta district – 18. Idukki follows with 10 cases, and Ernakulam with nine. An official with the Idukki rescue says the number of cases reflects the increase in reporting of child labour in the district. During 2019-2020, seven children hailing from other States were rescued from an areca processing unit in the district, and sent back with their parents. Following the incident, joint drives with the support of the police, Motor Vehicles Department, Labour department, District Child Protection Unit, and Childline were held at the border check-posts in the district. Now, there was heightened vigil at the border and on the part of the police, leading to better reporting. The official said at least 15 children have been repatriated to other States from Idukki. Rehabilitation process Following a rescue, a child is presented in front of the district child welfare committee (CWC), and housed in a child care institution. If their parents turn up with legitimate identity documents, the children are sent back with them. If doubts still exist, DNA tests are conducted at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology to verify the child’s ties with the parents. In some cases, the children are sent back to their State under police escort. There, the CWC there either sends them back to their home if located or puts them up in a child care institution and makes arrangements for their education, the official said. During the pandemic, instances of child labour did not come to attention. In one case though, a couple took their three children along with them for work as the children could not be left behind owing to school closures. The children, however, did not engage in any work, he says. While the team does come across cases of adolescent labour, action cannot be taken if they are not engaging in hazardous jobs. In such cases, the Sarana Balyam team makes sure they are not exploited by creating awareness among employers of the need to ensure the children’s education, pay minimum wages, and give adequate rest, he says. Domestic labour A child rescue officer at Sarana Balyam, says children have been found working in hotels or selling bangles and the like in Pathanamthitta. Some cases of domestic labour have been reported in Ernakulam. Search drives, he says, have been intensified by the district Sarana Balyam task forces owing to the possibility of children reaching the State now that COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/74-kids-rehabilitated-under-sarana-balyam/article37817125.ece

Mr. Vijayan was formally inaugurating the fourth edition of the Young Innovators Programme (YIP), organised under the aegis of Kerala Development and Innovation Strategic Council (K-DISC), here on Thursday. The State could develop only when youngsters played an active role in developing innovative solutions to everyday problems in society, he said. Calling YIP an unparalleled endeavour in the country, he said it brings together school and college students and researchers under a common platform to identify young innovators. K-DISC has been offering the participants technical and financial support in realising their innovative ideas across 20 diverse themes. Witnessing a massive growth in popularity since its launch in 2018 when the inaugural YIP featured 203 students, the programme currently has 5,500 registered educational institutions. K-DISC has targeted the participation of 1 lakh students representing as many as 30,000 teams during the current edition. Each edition involves a four-year-long process that includes mentorship, several rounds of evaluation, fab lab and rapid prototyping, road shows, and separate tracks for accelerated, normal and rapid innovation that depends on the nature and requirements of selected ideas. The Chief Minister said the programme has introduced new themes such as digital and creative art forms, biotechnology and genetics, problems of the marginalised, and innovation collectives and cooperatives. Mentoring will also be provided in domain, technology, business plan, intellectual property and prototyping. Several higher educational and research institutions across the State have been designated as domain mentoring institutions. General Education Minister V.

Minister for Cooperation V.N. Vasavan, in a letter on Thursday, requested RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das to direct his officials to draft their messages without ambiguity. In a separate letter to Yogesh Dayal, Chief General Manager (Department of Communication), RBI, on Wednesday, the Registrar of Cooperative Societies, Kerala, P.B. Nooh sought the withdrawal of the RBI notice saying it was contrary to the law and would create confusion among members of the cooperative societies and the public. In its November 22 notice, the RBI had cautioned the public against dealing with the cooperative societies using the words ‘bank,’ ‘banker’ or ‘banking’ in their names without authorisation. It noted that some cooperative societies were accepting deposits from non-members/nominal members/associate members in violation of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. Not under ‘banking’ According to the State Cooperation department, financial transactions by the cooperative societies do not fall within the ambit of ‘banking.’ They cannot be called a ‘banking company’ as per the definition given by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. Cooperative societies collect deposits from members and release loans to members. Loans are not released to non-members or other institutions, the letter noted. On accepting deposits, the department held that ‘members’ include active members and nominal and associate members as per the Kerala Cooperative Societies Act, 1969. The latter also are eligible to deposit money in a society and get the services offered by it. They are eligible for loan facilities as applicable to ‘A’ class members. The RBI warning that deposits made in cooperative societies are not covered by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) is also misleading, according to the department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/withdraw-rbi-notice-state/article37817236.ece

Speaking at a meet organised by the Thiruvananthapuram Press Club, Mr. Surendran said the Periye twin murders were an illustrative example. A Central Bureau of Investigation inquiry had zeroed in on CPI(M) assailants, he said. Islamist parties The Popular Front of India was the cat’s paw of the CPI(M) in Kerala. The government was tacitly encouraging Islamist parties to deny political space for nationalist organisations in the State. ‘Steeped in graft’ The LDF government was steeped in corruption. It was deeply involved in the illegal logging of protected rosewood trees in Wayanad. The government had gone out of its way to shield officers responsible for the timber theft.

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,KERALA||A weak script defeats Marakkar||More than the preparation for the two wars at the centre of Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham , if there is anything happening on a war footing in the film, it is the character introductions. Almost an hour into the film, new characters are being introduced, with each just getting a minute or two to create an impression on the viewers, who are at times left bewildered by the crowd on the screen. The star cast is so huge that the scriptwriters at some point must have wondered where to fit some of them in. Focus on grandness It is perhaps this approach, that focusses more on the grandness of the whole thing, be it the budget, the star cast, the sweeping battle sequences or the visual effects, which made them lose sight of the basic building block on which one need not spend crores — the script. Director Priyadarshan, who scripted the film along with Ani I.V. Sasi, had the task of building a cinematic tale around the well-known story of Kunjali Marakkar, the naval chief of the Zamorin of Kozhikode, who led a valiant fight against the Portuguese in the 16th century. The fictional embellishments come in various forms, including the young Marakkar’s (Pranav Mohanlal) short-lived marriage with Ayesha (Kalyani Priyadarshan), a love affair between Marakkar’s trusted lieutenant Chinali (Jay J. Jakritt) and Archa (Keerthy Suresh), the daughter of a local ruler. No emotional core But, all of these fictional additions to the basic story lack an emotional core, one reason being that the viewers do not get time to get used to most of the characters. Even someone like Manju Warrier, as the grieving wife of one of Marakkar’s men, fails to make an impression, though she has an important role to play in the narrative. Stars such as Arjun Sarja, Prabhu, and Suniel Shetty all get roles that are interchangeable with each other, with no defining character. Character development suffers, in the case of Marakkar (Mohanlal) too, who does not even get a few worthy lines to deliver. Some of the lines even end up as unintentional humour in the most sombre of situations, while some seem out of place in a period movie. A few references to Priyadarshan’s own films are placed at inappropriate junctures, like when Marakkar asks Ayesha to jump off a rock, promising to catch her. Visual effects stand out The film’s promotional USPs were the visual effects by Siddharth Priyadarshan and Sabu Cyril’s production design, both of which are commendable by Malayalam cinema’s standards and limitations. The dated background music only serves to remind the viewers of the Hollywood movies that the battle scenes are directly ‘inspired’ from. By the time one walks out of the hall, after a tiring three hours, one would struggle to recollect a memorable line or scene, other than the ones filled with special effects. That the writers failed to elicit such moments out of a story with immense heroic and emotional possibilities, makes it an even bigger disappointment. Kunjali Marakkar certainly deserved a much better tribute. S.R.

Till date, 96.3% of the eligible population above 18 years (2,57,04,744 persons) have received the first dose, while 65.5% (1,74,89,582 persons) have been fully vaccinated. The State has at present, 8 lakh doses in stock. Ms. George said those who are unable to take vaccine because of any medical condition or serious allergies should take caution to ensure that they do not get infected. Cause for concern Ms. George said the State was bracing itself to deal with a possible new situation involving Omicron and that all necessary precautionary measures had been strengthened. Apart from high transmissibility, immune evasiveness or the immune escape property predicted for Omicron is a cause for concern. The Health Department has already anticipated that there could be a surge in cases and hospitalisations and steps were being taken to meet such exigencies, the Health Minister said. Travellers from abroad It would be ensured that travellers from abroad followed the quarantine norms and protocols strictly. The cooperation of other departments would be sought to enforce quarantine norms. The Minister said that the exact numbers of those who had come from abroad, from the time Omicron was reported, was being collected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/special-vaccination-drive/article37817096.ece
03 December 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Citizens’ Forum backs CUAP students’ cause||The Central University of Andhra Pradesh is more than three years old now but is still struggling to provide good faculty members, a library on the temporary campus and hostels for the girls and boys with no budgetary allocations from the Central government. The students had been protesting against the lack of amenities and faculty by sleeping in the open on the temporary campus during the last week. “The State government had allocated land near Janthuluru on the city outskirts, but no construction activity has started and it is very unfortunate that the students from various parts of the country taking admission in the prestigious Central University had to struggle with both academics and infrastructural facilities on the campus,” opined former MLC M. Geyanand. Mr. Geyanand was part of a delegation that met CUAP Vice-Chancellor S.A. Kori to highlight the concern of the students and to urge him to put pressure on the Central authorities to provide proper accommodation and library facilities. Citizens’ Forum general secretary A.G. Rajmohan, leading the delegation, said that it was indeed a matter of serious concern that the institution was unable to provide even the basic facilities to students. The absence of a Registrar, academic council, finance committee, and other such bodies renders the institution ill-equipped to be called a Central University set up as part of the A.P. State Reorganisation Act. “The institution with 11 departments requires at least 88 teaching faculty members but has only 13 teaching staff. A full-fledged placement cell can play a proactive role in boosting the confidence of students,” the delegation members said. Funds allotted in the Central Budget were not being released, hindering the functioning of the university. The forum also decided to take up these issues with the HRD Ministry to ensure that prompt and timely action was taken, said the forum members Sathyanarayana Reddy and Jayaramappa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/citizens-forum-backs-cuap-students-cause/article37817176.ece

The TV tower was built in 1990 and was functional from 1991. The tower for the residents of Anantapur is not just a TV signal transmitter but one of the major landmarks of the city on its southeastern boundary. Radio to continue People hardly know the names of the colonies around and identify the places with reference to this tower. While it will be no more in use for transmitting TV programmes, the All India Radio programmes on 101.7 MHZ. in the FM Channel will continue from this tower. The head of operations of Prasar Bharathi at Anantapur M. Sudhakara Babu said that the Prasar Bharathi Board had taken a decision to close down terrestrial transmissions from 10 KW effectively from the midnight of December 31 as there were no takers for the service in its service area.

The high-powered steering committee for implementation of national projects will take up the proposal at its next meeting scheduled for December 6 and Mr. Shekhawat positively responded to the State’s proposal, Mr. Bommai told presspersons after the meeting. The committee functions under the jurisdiction of the Central Water Commission of the Jal Shakti Ministry. The Upper Bhadra Project ensures irrigation of around 2.25 lakh hectares in Chikkamagaluru, Chitradurga, Davangere, and Tumakuru districts with around 19 tmcft of water. The project also envisages filling up more than 350 tanks using 10.8 tmcft of water, along with augmenting the capacity of the Vani Vilas reservoir. Krishna waters The Chief Minister also appealed to Mr. Shekhawat to give directions to the department to issue a gazette notification on sharing of the Krishna waters. Telangana and Andhra Pradesh submitted in the Supreme Court on Monday that there was no information forthcoming from Karnataka for the past 14 years about how much Krishna waters it has diverted. Karnataka has sought the vacation of a November 16, 2011 directive of the Supreme Court which stopped the Centre from publishing in the official gazette the final order of the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal II (KWDT) pronounced in December 2010, allocating the river water to Karnataka, erstwhile Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. The KWDT had further modified its final order and report on November 29, 2013 to allocate surplus water to Karnataka, Maharashtra, and the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh while preserving the allocation of 2,130 tmcft already made amongst them. A Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud has posted the case for December 13. Interlinking projects Mr. Bommai appealed to Mr. Shekhawat not to grant clearance to the detailed project report on Cauvery, Mahadayi, and Krishna interlinking river projects without the consent of Karnataka. The Chief Minister also formally registered Karnataka’s opposition to Tamil Nadu’s river-linking project, which proposed to utilise surplus water from the Cauvery Basin, and urged the Centre not to grant clearance to it. TamilNadu too has been opposing the Karnataka Government’s proposal on developing a balancing reservoir at Mekedatu in Ramanagaram district, and the former filed a petition in the Supreme Court.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/karnataka-cm-seeks-national-project-status-to-upper-bhadra/article37816425.ece

The gangs, operating from the national capital, duped a large number of bank customers for hundreds of crores, Police Commisioner M. Stephen Raveendra said, while announcing the arrest of the accused on Thursday. Fourteen members of the SBI fake call centre gang were involved in 14 cases in the Cyberabad Commissionerate. “After getting customers’ data from SBI’s direct sale agents, the fraudsters would call the customers pretending as bank employees and collect card details and OTPs on the pretext of activation of card or deactivation of insurance or enhancing the credit card limit, etc.,” the officer said. Mr. Raveendra stated that it’s the biggest fraud in the country and this year alone the gang had made over 33,000 calls and cheated thousands of customers. The kingpin of the gang, Nikhil Madaan, who established a call centre at Uttam Nagar in Delhi, had vast experience in the banking sector and took the calls to look genuine, he took reseller IDs for the spoofing applications like MoSIP and Silver Dialer from one Murshid Alam, who purchased them from Farman Hussain, and called people using SBI customer care number. Further, in Dhani Loan Bazaar fake loan call centre fraud, the police arrested 14 persons involved in nine cases in Cyberabad and five in other districts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cyberabad-police-nab-members-of-two-gangs/article37816434.ece

The Health department has also received a few complaints from people who did not take their second dose but received a message that they took the jab. Dr. Srinivasa Rao has also urged people to wear mask, failing which they will have to pay a fine of Rs. 1,000. “The Health department has requested enforcement authorities to keep an eye on citizens not wearing their masks.

Jagan Mohan Reddy led an entourage of Ministers to inspect the flood-affected villages of Mandapalli, Pulapathuru, and Eguva Mandapalli, and interacted with the victims sheltered in the relief camps in Rajampet mandal of Kadapa district on Thursday.

As per the statement given by the official, A.K. Venkataswamy, to the police at Vijayanagar Institute of Medical Sciences, he and his family members were attacked with lethal weapons by a group of around 25 people led by Makbul, a sand extractor. He, his wife, and their son were injured in the attack. The official told the police that he, acting on a tip-off, had gone to Tolamamidi village on Tuesday night, along with Kuntanal village accountant Manjunath and Tolamamidi village accountant J. Ganesh, to seize vehicles that were transporting sand extracted illegally. But the sand extractors managed to escape with one of the two vehicles after attacking Mr. Ganesh. A case was registered in Ballari Rural police station against seven persons on Wednesday. Makbul had allegedly threatened Mr. Venkataswamy over the phone of serious consequences for seizing his sand-laden vehicle and interfering in his sand-extraction business. On Wednesday night, Makbul allegedly led the attack on the official and his family. Based on the victim’s statement, the Brucepet police registered an FIR under various sections of IPC.

03 December 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Govt.’s clean chit for Maradu municipality||The State government has given a clean chit to the Maradu municipality on allegations of shortcomings in submitting action plans and data on removal and disposal of debris following the demolition of the four apartment complexes in January last year. The Department of Local Self Governments said the service providers engaged for removal of debris as per the agreement with the civic body had completed the process. Data not submitted The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) had earlier said that the municipal secretary had not submitted action plans and data on disposal of debris despite repeated reminders. Compensation It had sought advice from the Central Pollution Control Board for fixing guidelines to impose environmental compensation on the municipality while pointing out that the non-submission of action plans by the civic body and service providers had made it difficult to identify sites for disposal of debris. A report filed by the government before the National Green Tribunal claimed that the municipal secretary had carried out duties assigned diligently to ensure compliance with the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016. The mission vested with the municipality was properly completed, and the PCB had issued directives and supervised the removal of debris. According to preliminary estimates, the quantity of demolition debris was around 76,300 tonnes. However, only 69,600 tonnes were removed, it said. The government maintained that there were no specific guidelines or model calculations available for imposing environmental compensation, if any, for violations by the municipal secretary by way of not providing periodical reports, action plans, data on removal, and disposal of steel as well as concrete debris. Guidelines needed However, it said that the shortfalls / violations by the municipality, if any, could be ascertained only after receiving such a document outlining the guidelines or model calculations for fixing environmental compensation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govts-clean-chit-for-maradu-municipality/article37816427.ece
03 December 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Police officer’s charge has Kerala High Court fuming||The Kerala High Court on Thursday lashed out at Additional Director-General of Police (Crimes) S. Sreejith for filing an affidavit accusing the court of passing orders on a writ petition by the former driver of fake antiquities dealer Monson Mavungal based on information in the public domain. Justice Devan Ramachandran made the observation while dismissing an application filed by the ADGP seeking to close the writ petition by the former driver alleging police harassment. Terming the action of the police officer extremely disconcerting, the judge orally observed that the application was intended “to browbeat the court and force a particular result”. If a police officer came to the court, made such allegations, and got away with it, it would be “the darkest times for the system”, he said. Exemplary cost Rapping the officer for making submissions of “an overbearing and recriminatory tenor” in the affidavit, the court said it would have been justified in imposing an exemplary cost on the officer to compensate for judicial time spent on the application. However, it chooses not to do so solely because it was “aware of its repercussions” for the police officer. The judge said that no one could dictate to the court how and in what manner it was to be decided. The court observed that the affidavit of the police officer said no material was on record to prove the allegations against high-ranking police officers when it was admitted by the State Police Chief in his affidavit that an Inspector-General of Police had been suspended for his alleged nexus with Monson and that the then State Police Chief and an Additional Director-General of Police made an unscheduled visit to the residence of Monson in 2019. The court also termed unfortunate the submission in the affidavit that any open discussion or consideration of critical information would provide undue advantage to the accused and investigation would be put to peril. The court was acting strictly based on material and documents placed on record by the respondents themselves.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-officers-charge-has-kerala-high-court-fuming/article37816428.ece

Sole capital After breaking coconuts and offering ‘harathi’ to the vehicle of Lord Venkateswara in the forefront, a group of 157 farmers led by Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti convenor A. Siva Reddy proceeded with their Nyayasthanam to Devasthanam Mahapadayatra on the 32nd day demanding retention of Amaravati as the sole capital of the State. The recent rains had left the Marupalli-Turimela road in a sheet of water in several stretches. The YSR Congress Party, which had promised to provide pothole-free roads on coming to power, had conveniently forgotten its poll promise, they contended. Hundreds of people from Podalakur and nearby places expressed solidarity with the ryots from the capital region, moved by their plight following denial of resting place en route allegedly by the authorities on Wednesday. “We will stand by the farmers who have parted with their land in the interest of the State,” they said. A large number of Muslims expressed their solidarity with the farmers at Degapudi village. Telugu Desam Party leaders Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy, Tenali Sravan Kumar and Abdul Azeez were among those who walked for some distance along with farmers. Activists of the BJP, CPI and CPI(M) joined the march which ended for the day at Turimela after covering a distance of 14 km.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bad-roads-no-deterrent-for-marching-amaravati-ryots/article37817180.ece
03 December 2021||New Delhi,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rajya Sabha passes Dam Safety Bill after four-hour discussion||The Rajya Sabha passed the Dam Safety Bill, 2019 on Thursday after a four-hour discussion. This is one of the first legislations to be passed this week as the Upper House has witnessed vociferous protests and disruption from the Opposition over the suspension of 12 members. Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said a national policy on the safe management of dams had been pending for 40 years. Opposition members raised concerns that the Bill encroached on the federal structure as dams and rivers are State subjects. An amendment moved by Tiruchi Siva of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) to send the Bill to a select committee was defeated with 80 votes against and 26 votes in favour. “When a dam breaks, it impacts the entire ecology. The safety of dams is an important issue. The Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha on 2 August, 2019. The Bill will ensure that accountability is fixed in case of a lapse. Forty-two dams have broken so far. In 1982, it was decided to prepare a national policy. We sought the advice of the Solicitor General. He said Parliament can make the law. Entry 17 of the State list doesn’t act as an embargo for the Union to make a legislation on this subject,” Mr. Shekhawat said. Shaktisinh Gohil of the Congress said this legislation was a right of the States. “I know they will say that the Bill first came in 2010, when Congress was in power, but the preamble of the Bill mentioned that it will be applicable only if a two-thirds majority of the State Assembly accepts it. We warned you on farm laws — don’t pass the Bills in a hurry. We asked for division of votes; you had to take back the [farm] Bills eventually...but even after this, you haven’t learnt anything and have come up with this Bill,” Mr. Gohil said. Manoj Kumar Jha of the RJD said there was “always a temptation to encroach on a State subject but they forget they will not be there [in power] forever”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rajya-sabha-passes-dam-safety-bill-after-four-hour-discussion/article37816422.ece

03 December 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||Kerala Govt. to pay Rs. 2,500 for reporting child labour||The Kerala Government has decided to give an incentive of Rs. 2,500 to those providing information about child labour. Child labour has been banned and made a criminal offence. While there are fewer instances of child labour in Kerala, children continue to be brought to the State along with migrant workers and through middlemen for work. It is in this context that a decision has been taken to incentivise furnishing of information on child labour. The incentive is expected to promote public participation in efforts to curb child labour. Information about child labour should be provided to the District Child Protection Officer (DCPO). The amount will be transferred to the bank account of the informant once the authorities are convinced about the veracity of the information. If more than one person provide the information, the person who provided the information first will be eligible for the incentive, the Government said. Furnishing details The details furnished should have the name of the establishment where a child works; name of the place, address, and photograph; name of the owner and any other details; photo of the child or children if available; or any other details that will help in clear identification. The identity of the informant will not be divulged. Integrated Child Protection Scheme officials said the incentive will help increase reporting of such cases through public participation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/kerala-govt-to-pay-rs-2500-for-reporting-child-labour/article37816431.ece

All local bodies have been asked to intensify the vaccination drive, by tracing the unvaccinated or those who are due/overdue for the second dose. Those who have already had COVID-19 infection need get vaccinated only after three months. Those who are due for the second dose should ensure that it is not delayed beyond the stipulated interval. Health workers, along with local body representatives, have been asked to get the list of those who are due for the second dose, to visit them at their homes and persuade them to get vaccinated.

The team consisting of K.S. Rao and Prasad emphasised the need for developing channels to prevent stagnation and allow free flow of rainwater downstream on the Seshachalam ranges and the ghat roads. Sensitive spots After visiting the severely damaged road, culverts and parapet walls, Mr. Rao said that the latest technology had proved useful in checking the incidents of landslips in different parts of the country. The same technology was employed in the reparation works in 2017 when the ghat road was badly battered by incessant rains. Sensitive spots were identified and precautionary measures like fencing, rock bolting, shock treatment and construction of breast walls were taken up along the ghat road. Falling of huge boulders each weighing between 30 to 40 tonnes from at a high altitude had nevertheless contributed to the present crisis, he said and opined that vehicular traffic could be regulated on to the link road connecting both the up and down ghat roads after taking up minor repair works at certain points. Mr. Rao said that about five to six locations also had been identified to be more vulnerable for landslips and that would submit a comprehensive report with regard to the proposed preventive measures in the next couple of days. TTD Technical Adviser Ramachandra Reddy, Chief Engineer Nageswar Rao, Superintendent Engineer-II, Jagadishwar Reddy and others accompanied the team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/iit-experts-from-delhi-chennai-inspect-tirumala-ghat-roads/article37816699.ece

03 December 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Dam Safety Bill essential, says Vijaya Sai||YSR Congress Parliamentary Party leader V. Vijaya Sai Reddy has said that the Dam Safety Bill, 2019 was essential to ensure that projects such as Dowleswaram, Prakasam and Thotapalli barrages, and Siddhapuram tank, which are 170, 165 and 112 and 101 years old respectively, do not suffer any breaches and cause damage to life and property. During a discussion on the Bill in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, Mr. Vijaya Sai said the legislation was urgently needed because as per the National Register of Large Dams, India had 5,745 large dams, of which over 75% were more than 20 years old and about 220 were more than 100 years old. He said the Bill rightly fixed responsibility on the dam owners for safety of constructions and their operation, maintenance and supervision and it provided for a dam safety unit at each project. The Bill also paved the way for the establishment of a National Dam Safety Authority (NDSA), which was mandated to implement the policies and guidelines of the National Committee on Dam Safety, thereby resolve issues between States and others and help in maintaining a national database on dams (almost 92% of dams in India are on inter-State river basins, thus, resolution of inter-State issues is crucial). Mr. Vijaya Sai said the rights of lower riparian States like Andhra Pradesh were being infringed upon, because of which it was not getting its fair share of waters from the upper riparian States. Since 65% of Andhra Pradesh’s population was dependent on agriculture, the adjudication mechanism should be just and efficient so that justice was done to the lower riparian States. While appreciating the positive aspects of the Dam Safety Bill, Mr. Vijaya Sai requested the Ministry of Jal Shakti to include 31 dams (Chitravathi balancing reservoir, Gundlakamma reservoir, Pampa, Paderu, Godavari barrage, mid Pennar stage-I, Somasila, Srisailam, Velugodu etc.) in phases II and III of Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Programme. Rehabilitation of these projects was estimated to cost Rs. 776 crore. He also sought early approval of the second Revised Cost Estimate (RCE) of the Polavaram project, by drawing the Central government’s attention to the fact that the Central technical advisory committee and revised cost committee already gave their sanctions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dam-safety-bill-essential-says-vijaya-sai/article37817187.ece
03 December 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||NGT asks govt. to pay Rs. 243 cr. for violation of clearances||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has slapped a penalty of more than Rs. 243 crore on the Andhra Pradesh government for violation of environmental clearances. The NGT, in its judgment pronounced and uploaded on Thursday, said the State government had violated the clearances with regard to the Polavaram project, Pattiseema project, Purushottapatnam project and Chintalapudi project. The Project Proponent of Purushothapatnam LIS shall pay environmental compensation of Rs. 24.5622 crore, which is 1.5% of the project cost of Rs. 1,637.48 crores. Similarly, Project Proponents of Pattiseema Lift Irrigation Scheme shall pay environmental compensation of Rs. 24.9 crore, which is 1.5% of the project cost of Rs. 1,660 crores. Also, Project Proponents of Chintalapudi LIS shall pay Rs. 73.635 crore, which is 1.5% of Rs. 4,909 crores as environmental Compensation. “This project is in process and it is said that 50% of the work has already been completed. Here, project cost approved in 2016 was Rs. 4,909.80 crores, hence we have taken above cost of project instead of considering the present cost,” the NGT said. Project Proponents of Polavaram/Indira Sagar MIP shall pay Environmental Compensation of Rs. 120.075 crore, which is 0.75% of Rs. 16,010 crores. Here the project cost of Rs. 16,010 crores was shown as per 2010-2011. “Since it is an ongoing project and there was compliance of requirement of EC etc. hence, we have not gone with the subsequent increase of project cost,” the NGT said. The NGT said that the environmental compensation should be paid by concerned PPs within 3 months with the APPCB.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ngt-asks-govt-to-pay-rs-243-cr-for-violation-of-clearances/article37817193.ece

The Tourism Department, in association with the private firm M/s Gill Marines, is taking up the project under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. It is expected to be completed in four to six months. Addressing the media at Tenneti Park here on Thursday, Tourism Minister M. Srinivasa Rao said, “m.v. Maa will be another feather in the cap of Visakhapatnam.” “The department is going ahead with the project only after ascertaining its feasibility from the Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT). Tourists will be allowed into the ship from December 29,” the Minister said. “The private firm has sought six months time to complete the works on the restaurant. But we have asked it to complete the task in four months,” Mr. Srinivasa Rao said, and added that either the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation or the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority would lay the pathway to the ship. The Bangladeshi ship had drifted to the shore from the anchorage port during a cyclonic storm on October 12, 2020, and ran aground near Tenneti Park. As it could not be salvaged, the vessel’s owner, M/s Advance Shipping Ltd., Dhaka, had declared the ship as abandoned. Later, M/s Gill Marines, Visakhapatnam, had taken over the vessel from the insurers of the ship. The Tourism Department had approached the private firm to develop it as a floating restaurant under PPP mode. Features As per the proposals, there will be an open-air restaurant on top of the ship. Another air-conditioned restaurant with skyroof will be operated inside the ship. Around 300 persons can be accommodated in the restaurant. The total project cost is nearly Rs. 10 crore. “The price of entry ticket may range from Rs. 50 to Rs. 200 basing on the day and time,” the officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/conversion-of-mv-maa-into-floating-restaurant-set-to-begin/article37817359.ece
03 December 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||COVID-19: is it time for administering booster dose?||With the threat from the newly mutated Coronavirus, Omicron, looming large, experts from the health sector feel that the government should now seriously think of opening up the booster dose. Omicron is already driving the fourth wave in South Africa and some other countries, and could very well be the driving force for the third wave in India. ‘Severity not known’ Though not much is still known about the virus, it is established that its transmissibility is higher than the Delta variant that shook the nation during the second wave from March to August this year. According to P.V. Sudhakar, District COVID Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College, experts and scientists across the globe have already indicated that this new mutation has high transmissible rate, but its severity is still not known. “As of now, it is found that the severity has been mild, but we never know,” he said. ‘It’s a third jab’ Senior doctors from Andhra Medical College and King George Hospital say the time has come for opening up the booster dose. The booster is nothing but a third jab of what has already been taken. If one has taken two doses of Covishield, then a third one can be taken as a booster, said Dr K. Raju, senior pulmonologist. In the U.S., the government has already started the booster dose for health workers, people above 65 years and those who are immunosuppressed, said Dr. Sudhakar. But it is learnt that the Union government is in dilemma to open up the booster dose, as it may create a scramble for it, leaving people who are yet to take the second jab high and dry. As per the CoWIN dashboard on Wednesday, the total doses administered in Inida was about 124.77 crore, which includes 79.12 crore who have taken at least one dose and 45.54 crores who have taken both the doses. In Andhra Pradesh, the total doses administered is 5.99 crore, which includes 3.49 crore who have taken at least one dose and 2.49 crore, who have taken both the jabs. Experts from the health sector feel that the campaign for the second dose and the booster dose can run simultaneously. Apart from the booster dose, adhering to COVID appropriate behaviour such as wearing of mask, avoiding public gatherings and sanitising the hands frequently can keep the third wave at bay. This apart, some travel restrictions and enforcing protocols at airports, railway stations and bus stations, is the need of the hour, said Dr. Sudhakar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/covid-19-is-it-time-for-administering-booster-dose/article37817184.ece

They had all come to watch the exhibits displayed on board the research vessels by the FSI as part of an ‘Open House’ organised to create awareness among students and the general public on the activities of FSI. The students were seen taking notes as the FSI representatives explained various aspects of the marine life species displayed at the expo. The section featuring sea snakes, lobsters and some varieties of fish, caught by the FSI team during its survey last month, caught the attention of the students. Some of the schoolchildren were seen enthusiastically asking questions regarding the life raft, and the safety equipment to release smoke and flares to seek help from faraway vessels or aircraft, in times of distress. Some of the younger students requested FSI representatives to allow them to sit in the raft after it was inflated for demonstration. FSI Zonal Director in-charge D. Bhami Reddy, who saw the enthusiasm of the students, directed the officials to allow them to sit and take photographs. The children thoroughly enjoyed taking selfies. While the smaller raft can accommodate up to six persons, the bigger ones can carry up to 25 persons. The rafts are used in times of emergency. Firefighting appliances and fire safety equipment were displayed on the vessel and the students and visitors were told about their use in fighting oil fires, which are common at sea. The FSI team supplied face masks to the students. The engine room of the vessel was another area which generated a lot of interest among the students. They asked questions on various instruments used to know the depth of water, the presence of marine species at different levels, and navigational and meteorological equipment. “We have 240 varieties of rare species of marine organisms, which were caught in our nets during our survey last month. We have two survey vessels – M.F.V. Matsya Shikari and M.F.V. Matsya Darshini – at the Visakhapatnam zonal base of FSI, the jurisdiction of which extends over three States, from Machilipatnam in A.P. to Sand Heads in West Bengal. We make studies on unidentified marine species and abnormalities, if any, in other species caught in our nets,” says Mr. Bhami Reddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fsi-open-house-enthralls-students/article37817371.ece

03 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Special task forces doing little about illegal structures||Illegal and unauthorised constructions are springing up with impunity across the city, notwithstanding the recently fortified enforcement system. While there is no tab on homes being constructed against norms by individuals, construction of multi-storeyed buildings by well-known real estate firms too is going on unchecked both in GHMC and HMDA peripheries. One such venture for a commercial complex at Uppal has been exposed recently when TPCC chief A. Revanth Reddy raised a hue and cry on social media about the same. A few weeks ago, another attempt by a well-known developer was stalled by GHMC at L.B.Nagar, midway through foundation work. Several developers are advertising about the ventures through social media to attract investors, even before any kind of permission is on paper. Some are going ahead blatantly with cellar digging too without proper authorisations. “I have received one such notification on my Whatsapp, seeking investments for a gated community project in Kollur with two towers and 550 apartments. Even while environment clearance and HMDA permission are pending, the notification says excavation work has already begun,” said Srinivas Nayudu, a resident of L.B.Nagar. While HMDA woefully lacks the means to control such construction, GHMC’s recent exercise constituting zonal level task forces has not made much difference. Post the rejig as per the TS-bPASS (Telangana State Building Permission Approval and Self-Certification) Act, the enforcement powers which earlier lay with Town Planning department, have been delegated to the Zonal Commissioners under whom special task forces have been constituted. Officials from the Police, Revenue and GHMC are part of the task force, under whom enforcement teams will work. Zonal commissioner will have the powers to reshuffle and randomly assign the members of the enforcement teams frequently, so as to curb underhand deals. Complaints received through various platforms too will be randomised among various teams. Most important functionaries are the engineers recruited from the National Academy of Construction whose job it is to inspect all the buildings under construction in their respective areas, and report irregularities. The Enforcement teams should submit Action Taken Reports about their inspections from time to time, which are to be reviewed by the Special Task Force once in a fortnight. However, there is little evidence on the ground about any action taken by the special task forces across the zones. Government orders stipulating fortnightly meetings of the task forces are being royally ignored. GHMC officials, when sought information pertaining to the illegal structures identified and razed since the constitution of zonal level task forces in June this year, only end up passing the buck.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/special-task-forces-doing-little-about-illegal-structures/article37817000.ece
03 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||CM tells ryots to go for alternative crops||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has asked farmers with whom he interacted today to go for cultivation of groundnut, cotton, black gram, green gram and bengal gram as an alternative to paddy which the government had decided not to purchase in the present rabi. He met the farmers at a couple of roadside villages of Pebbair and Kothakota mandals of Gadwal district while returning to Hyderabad in car from Gadwal after calling on the family of a TRS MLA whose father died recently. He saw for himself black gram and groundnut crops of two farmers walking down a little distance from the road. Instead of depending heavily on paddy and running into problems, Mr. Rao asked the farmers to focus cultivation on crops that have demand in market. A release said he enquired from the farmers regarding yields from black gram and groundnut, the rate they fetch in market and wetting required for them. He was informed that the yield of black gram was eight to twelve quintals an acre and earned over Rs. 8,000 a quintal against the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs. 6,300 a quintal. In the case of groundnut, it was ten to fifteen quintals of yield per acre and earning  Rs. 7,000 a quintal against the MSP of Rs. 5,500 a quintal. Crop diversification aided in improvement of soil health and resulted in higher yields, he was told. Driving down further, Mr. Rao stopped his car at a village in Kothakonda mandal to inspect paddy that was left for drying at the threshing yard in a field.

03 December 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Actor a bundle of nerves as he awaits new release||Actor Rahul Ramakrishna is a bundle of nerves and energy as he awaits the release of his latest movie. “Acting happened. Now I treat it as a 9-5 job where I get up in the morning, go to work and then come back home,” says the actor, who has carved a niche for himself with earthy language, quick repartee and expressive face. From doing roles as a friend and partner thriving on gags, the actor is now part of the troika in ‘Skylab’, a movie that uses the scare of the American satellite falling on a village in Telangana to show a humane drama. “The story is funny considering all the incidents that happened in rural Telangana at that time. It is kind of theme of the movie but within it is the comic nature of the entire episode. The drama happening to the guy who wants to set up a clinic, a writer who wants to start a newspaper in town and my role as a person whose sole goal is to clear the debts accumulated by his family,” says Mr. Ramakrishna. From doing odd jobs, to being a journalist in fly-by-night newspapers to working for an NGO, Ramakrishna has come a long way from Himayatnagar. “It was while working with an NGO that I experimented with street theatre. I befriended people in the movie industry and I got a break as people thought I have a highly eccentric and social nature. I have a lot more energy,” he says. From 15-17 cups of Irani chai at Red Rose Cafe near Irram Manzil to two cups of coffee, Mr. Ramakrishna says he has mellowed down while sipping at Irani cafe named ‘Skylab’ at Mettuguda. Like the movie, the restaurant Skylab too, is a relic of the time when people swung from paranoia to humour. “My father built this restaurant at the time of the big scare in 1979. His friend Ramdas suggested the name as it was very popular. It used to be a big place but shrunk due to the Metro,” says Mohammed Asfar, who now runs the restaurant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/actor-a-bundle-of-nerves-as-he-awaits-new-release/article37816994.ece
03 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Accused in murder test-fired weapon at Alwal tank||The night before he allegedly shot dead his cousin, Thota Narender Reddy test fired the country-made pistol at a secluded place near Alwal tank off Karimnagar-Hyderabad highway. He hatched a fool-proof murder plot and executed it with clockwork precision, said the police officers associated with the investigation of the sensational murder reported at RTC Colony of Trimulgherry three days ago. Carefully preparing for the killing of cousin Thota Vijayabhaskar Reddy, the accused (now behind the bars) cleaned the two country-made pistols with coconut oil. He wanted to ensure the short firearms did not get stuck in the last minute. After cleaning the two pistols, he test-fired one round in the darkness near Alwal tank and quietly returned to his house located less than a couple of kilometres away in Srinivasangar Colony. Finalising a deal The next morning, without arousing his cousin’s suspicion, he joined him to finalise the sale of a plot. They started in the car of Vijaybhaskar, who drove it. As per his plan, Narender asked his cousin to halt for a few minutes at RTC Colony stating that the persons selling the plot were coming with original documents. Vijaybhaskar stopped the car, but Narender got off on the pretext of making a phone call. “Actually, no one was coming. After strolling for a few minutes, he got into the car’s rear seat,” said a police officer, seeking anonymity. All the while, Vijaybhaskar sat on the driver’s seat, watching some video clips in his mobile phone. Narender allegedly took out his weapon silently and fired on the back of Vijaybhaskar’s head. As the victim slumped on the driver’s seat, Narender stepped out of the vehicle, walked a couple of yards and returned to ensure the man was dead. “He later went home with the bag of Rs. 10 lakh Vijaybhaskar carried and had lunch as if nothing had happened,” the police officers said. He took some money from the bag and left the house telling his wife that he was going to Srisailam with friends on some work, according to the investigators. The accused reportedly admitted to the police that he got familiarised with the usage of firearms watching related videos on YouTube.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/accused-in-murder-test-fired-weapon-at-alwal-tank/article37816998.ece
03 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Interest payment, debt servicing this fiscal to cross Rs. 17,500 cr.||The State government’s interest payments and debt servicing during the current financial year is pegged at Rs. 17,594.38 crore. This is almost Rs. 3,000 crore higher than Rs. 14,625.36 crore according to the revised estimates of the previous financial year. Of the total debt servicing this year, interest on internal debt alone is Rs. 16,502.1 crore, over Rs. 2,500 crore higher than Rs. 13,898 crore of the previous financial year.  According to the handbook on State Budgets “State Finances: A study of Budgets 2021-22” released by the Reserve Bank of India, a major component of debt servicing is Rs. 14,635.34 crore interest on open market loans borrowed by the State government. Interest on loans from the Central government for the current year is pegged at Rs. 281.82 crore, close to Rs. 100 crore higher than Rs. 188.05 crore of the previous fiscal. Interest on National Social Security Fund (NSSF) and that on small savings, State provident funds and other instruments is pegged at Rs. 787.77 crore and Rs. 800.45 crore respectively. The State government had been opting for open market borrowings since the onset of Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to fulfil the immediate financial requirements as well as to implement spree of welfare schemes like Rythu Bandhu. Fiscal borrowings Borrowings during the current fiscal are inching towards Rs. 30,000 crore mark reaching Rs. 25,573 crore by the end of the first half of the current financial year between April and September. The State had raised another Rs. 3,500 crore during the third quarter of the fiscal so far as against the total borrowings of Rs. 6,295 crore during the quarter (October – December) projected in the tentative calendar of borrowings released by the RBI. Keeping in view the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the finances, the government had estimated borrowings and liabilities could be of the order of Rs. 45,509 crore for the current fiscal year and the same was placed in the budget under capital receipts. Sources, however, said there would not be any major cash outflow on account of debt servicing as a major chunk of the interests would be offset through book adjustments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/interest-payment-debt-servicing-this-fiscal-to-cross-rs-17500-cr/article37817022.ece

HMR was the first public transport system in the country to give its passengers the option to download or stream content for free, even in the absence of an active internet connection in transit or at stations. Apparently, a recent survey highlighted that commuters spent approximately 60 minutes on their phone in a day when on-the-go. During this time, they use a number of services, YouTube and Messenger apps being the most preferred. Almost 75% users latched on to the network to start using SugarBox services. Most content is consumed during weekend and afternoons on weekdays and at daily peak commute hours (11 a.m. / 6 p.m.) on working days. Intermittent connectivity was cited as one of the main obstacles for people to view content on OTT platforms. “We leverage LANs to provide users access to relevant apps. For the unserved, in collaboration with other connectivity providers, we are re-imagining rural connectivity to provide reliable access at affordable rates. So, this miniaturised cloud ‘Hyperlocal Edge Cloud’ works wonders for a collaboration like L&T MRH for commuters to enjoy seamless content during their travel time,” said CEO and co-founder Rohit Paranjpe.

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,TELANGANA||‘Akhanda’ movie review: Boyapati Srinu and Nandamuri Balakrishna’s loud action entertainer is strictly for the fanbase||There are films, and there are films by director Boyapati Srinu. Then there are films by Boyapati Srinu starring Nandamuri Balakrishna. In the cinematic universe where the two collaborate, everything is larger than life. Nothing is subtle, not even remotely. In their third outing together after Simha and Legend , the two decide to up the scale and the decibels. Telugu film Akhanda stars Balakrishna in a dual role, but we’ll come to that in a bit. The director is aware of the star’s massive fanbase. Chants of ‘Jai Balayya’ are the norm when his films arrive at the theatres. This time, the fans took it a step further. Sample this: ‘Edukondalavada Venkataramana… jai Balayya!’ In Akhanda , one of the roles essayed by Balakrishna is akin to a demi-God. The other character played by Balakrishna is named Murali Krishna, a Good Samaritan who has been instrumental in stopping faction strife and is revered by all. With the stage set for a larger-than-life canvas, Boyapati goes all out. The 167-minute film begins and ends with action sequences that are carefully choreographed, with ample slow motion shots designed to be dutifully lapped up amid loud cheers. Balakrishna walks between two large wheels and later tyres that are rolling away, after beating people to a pulp, of course, in slow motion. Elsewhere, he thrusts a trishul into someone and turns it round a couple of times, just so we know he isn’t letting the evil ones get away easily. In another scene, bullets pop off someone’s skull. The story is that of twins separated at birth. Been there, seen that? A uranium miner exploits the land and its people to the hilt. Seen such stories too? Boyapati gives these oft-repeated mainstream storylines an added edge with the ‘Akhanda’ (invincible) aspect, throwing in a good measure of religion, spirituality, good Vs. evil godmen. The narrative unfolds in a familiar fashion, depicting the hero’s good deeds. There’s room for romance as well. The new district collector Saranya Bachupalli (Pragya Jaiswal) is depicted more as a romantic interest and later as wife and young mother than as a civil servant. Poorna, as principal secretary Prabhavathi, probing the mining scandal, has slightly better scope to portray a no-nonsense government official. Srikanth is cast as mine owner Varadaraju who knows no remorse. He eats at a poor woman’s house and in return, presents her with the severed head of the man of the house. If that gives an idea of the depiction of evil in this film, there’s more. A series of barbaric events sets the stage for the arrival of ‘Akhanda’ as the saviour. The drama goes on and on, with Boyapati and team not tiring of several more action sequences.

The proposed flyover is a first of its kind. “The flyover will come up between Rairakhol and Sambalpur. Vehicular traffic will move on the flyover while elephants will take their traditional path underneath the structure,” said Ram Prasad Panda, Chief General Manger of NHAI, Odisha, on Tuesday. At present, when elephant herds near the NH-55 between Cuttack and Sambalpur, the elephant tracker teams of Forest and Environment Department stop vehicular traffic from both sides. It helps the jumbos cross the NH. The second flyover, which will be 532 metre long, has been proposed between Pallahara and Keonjhar. Apart from the one-km-long flyover in the 112-km section of NH-55 between Angul and Sambalpur, 12 elephant underpasses have been proposed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/flyover-to-ease-elephant-movement-in-odisha/article37817112.ece
03 December 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Kejriwal hits out at Channi’s remarks on his complexion||The political battleground in Punjab is heating up ahead of Assembly elections due next year, with leaders of various parties pulling out all stops and making personal attacks. Delhi Chief Minister and national convenor of Aam Aadmi Party Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday hit out at Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s remarks equating AAP with “ kale angrej ” (black Englishman). “I may be black, but my intentions are absolutely clear,” he said. Leading his party’s Tiranga Yatra in Pathankot, Mr. Kejriwal said “Mothers of Punjab adore their ‘black son’ Kejriwal and sisters like their ‘black brother’ because my intention is not black. Aam Aadmi Party will form the government in Punjab and this black man (Kejriwal) will fulfil all his promises.” Mr. Channi had on Wednesday commented on Mr. Kejriwal’s clothes and complexion. The Delhi CM said ever since the AAP announced that on coming to power in Punjab, it would give Rs. 1000 per month to all women in the State, Mr. Channi has been abusing him. “Channi is referring to me as the man who wears cheap clothes and is of black complexion. My complexion has turned dark as I go from village to village on foot,” he said. Mr. Kejriwal also promised “high quality and free education” to the people of Punjab. Hitting out at Mr. Channi, the national spokesperson of AAP and co-in-charge of Punjab, Raghav Chadha said Mr. Channi has crossed all boundaries of slander, which is a shame. People of Punjab trust Arvind Kejriwal and want the Delhi model of governance Mr. Chadha said adding that his party would form the next Government in the State with “outright majority”. The 32-year-old leader, who is considered to be a confidant of the Mr. Kejriwal said the party would announce it’s CM candidate at the right time. Mr. Chadha claimed that the people of Punjab were fed up with traditional political parties like the Congress and Akali Dal and wanted to give AAP a chance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/kejriwal-hits-out-at-channis-remarks-on-his-complexion/article37816908.ece

Accusing Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal of indulging in mudslinging, Mr. Channi said criticism for the sake of mere criticism is not only unethical but undesirable. “Mr. Kejriwal should not to be envious of my pro-people agenda.

03 December 2021||Ghaziabad,||Congress will fight U.P. polls on development agenda: Priyanka||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday said politicians would get away with communal and casteist politics unless the voter held them accountable for the development work in his city and village. Addressing a rally in Moradabad, she said when she came to Uttar Pradesh, she was surprised by the number of mafias that existed in the State. “From river, land, and sand to exam and jobs, there is a mafia in every domain in Uttar Pradesh. I am surprised there is no mafia on the breath that you take. Somebody could take a cut on breathing as well,” she said sarcastically. Raising the slogan of ‘Janta Zindabad’, Ms. Vadra said things would not change in the State as long as the politician knew in his heart that he could get away by selling his communal and casteist agenda. “It is your job to make your leader responsible. You have to tell them that empty promises won’t work and that’s why the Congress will fight the coming Assembly polls on the agenda of development,” she said. Playing on a Hindi proverb, Ms. Vadra said the BJP Government believed in building andher nagri (chaotic cities) and such cities have a chaupat raja (confused king). “The future of youth is ruined, businessmen are making losses and the budget of the housewife is in tatters,” she said. Vacant jobs Taking on the Adityanath Government for the recent leak of UPTET paper, the Congress leader said this was not the first case and there had been at least dozen similar cases in the past. “At least 10 lakh jobs are lying vacant but the youth is roaming without employment.” Ms. Vadra also took on the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party for missing from the ground when the Congress was fighting for the cause of the Dalits and the poor. “They should be asked why they become active only at the time of elections,” she said. Addressing women, Ms. Vadra said if they, the 50% of the population, stood united the politics of communalism and casteism would wither away. “We are reserving 40% tickets for women because we want them to have a share in governance. Some of you might lose for the first time but it will empower you in the long run.” Farmers’ movement The farmers’ movement, the Congress leader said, had proved that if people make up their minds, the Government had to bow. Still the Prime Minister didn’t shed a single tear on the death of 700 farmers during the agitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cong-will-fight-polls-on-development-agenda-priyanka/article37816910.ece

The Government has freed its property from the mafia and illegal slaughterhouses have been shut down,” he added. Third university Mr. Shah was in Punwarka village of the district to lay the foundation stone for a State university named after Mata Shakumbhari Devi, the presiding deity of a popular temple in Saharanpur. After Raja Mahendra Pratap University in Aligarh and Raja Suheldev university in Azamgarh, this is the third approved higher education institution that has been named after a local icon by the BJP Government, in the run-up to the Assembly polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/crime-rate-falls-in-up-amid-bjp-rule/article37816903.ece

As per the directions by Deputy Commissioner Yash Garg, the departments concerned such as the police, health and municipal corporation and committees have been ordered to issue challans to those not wearing face masks and violating social distancing norms at public places such as educational institutes, factories, business complexes, railway stations and bus stands. All departments have been directed to ensure compliance of standard operating procedures for COVID-19-appropriate behaviour.

03 December 2021||Mumbai,||‘Only 38% got education during lockdown’||As several parts in Maharashtra reopen physical primary classes from Wednesday, a recent survey by policy think tanks LIRNEasia and ICRIER has shown that the State was able to ensure continuity in formal education for only 38% of its school-enrolled children during the COVID-19 lockdown, which stands more than the national average. The survey also points out that even among those that had continuity in their education, the experience varied vastly in terms of the format and the level of interactivity between students and teachers. While many received education through more than one channel (e.g., live online lessons, instructions sent to smartphones or delivered home, etc.), those that had access to more channels were more likely to receive feedback than those with access to less. Such variations can in turn lead to disparities in educational outcomes even among those that did receive educational services during the closures. The State compares well against the India’s national average, as well as that of NCT Delhi, whose performance stood at 20% and 25% respectively. However, report shows that 59% households did not  have continuity in their formal education, or receive any educational services from their school or private tuition providers during lockdown.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/only-38-got-education-during-lockdown/article37817106.ece

03 December 2021||New Delhi,||‘6 more international fliers test positive’||Six more travellers from “at-risk” countries, including one with travel history to South Africa, tested positive for COVID-19 on arrival at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here on Thursday, officials said. Three out of 243 people on an Air France flight that landed at the airport around midnight tested positive for COVID. Two persons from London were also found to have contracted the virus, an official said. Another passenger, who had stayed in Johannesburg, South Africa, for a week and travelled from Tanzania to Doha and from there to Delhi, has also tested positive, the official said. A total of 10 people from “at-risk” countries have tested positive for COVID-19 since stricter norms for international passengers came into effect from Tuesday midnight. Samples of all the six passengers have been sent to the National Centre for Disease Control for genome sequencing to ascertain if they have the new Omicron strain, which has been classified as a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization. Designated hospital All COVID-positive international travellers are being admitted to the Lok Nayak Hospital, where a dedicated ward has been set up for isolating and treating such patients. Under the new norms, RT-PCR tests are mandatory for passengers arriving from “at-risk” countries and they will be allowed to leave the airport only after the results come. Also, 2% of the passengers arriving in flights from other countries will be subjected to the test randomly. An official said a little over 2,950 passengers arrived at the Delhi airport in international flights from Wednesday midnight till 7 p.m. on Thursday. Of them, more than 2,150 passengers took Rapid PCR test while the rest opted for RT-PCR test. According to the official, the result of a Rapid PCR test takes around 90 minutes while that for an RT-PCR test is at least four to six hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/6-more-international-fliers-test-positive/article37816895.ece
03 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Schools shut again as air quality turns ‘severe’||The Delhi Government on Thursday announced closure of all schools, colleges and other educational institutions in the Capital till further orders as the air quality deteriorated to the ‘severe’ category on Thursday. Schools in the city had reopened for all classes on Monday after being closed since November 17, as there was a slight improvement in the air quality. The decision to shut schools again came hours after the Supreme Court directed the Centre and the Delhi Government to come out with suggestions to control air pollution within 24 hours and expressed dissatisfaction over the steps taken so far. Board exams exempted Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the Government is constantly monitoring the situation and the decision will be reviewed when the situation improves. Only institutes where Board exams are being conducted will be exempt from the order, he added. The Delhi Government also asked people to use public transport as far as possible. It said it hasn’t considered implementing the odd-even rule yet as it is not in a condition to increase the capacity of buses and metro trains anymore due to COVID-19 regulations. “We have started a special bus service to and from Government offices. I would appeal to everyone to use public transport and avoid using private vehicles,” Mr. Rai said. The Air Quality Index of Delhi was 429 on Thursday, up from 370 on Wednesday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4 p.m. bulletin. The air quality is expected to remain in the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ levels for the next three days, according to experts. Weather officials said the current spike in air pollution is chiefly due to a drop in speed of local surface winds and a fall in the height up to which pollutants can be distributed in the atmosphere. Demand for resignation Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and Delhi Congress president Ch. Anil Kumar called for the resignation of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for “failing” to control pollution in the Capital. “The intention of the Kejriwal Government is not to work and it keeps trying to mislead the people with announcements and claims. When pulled up by the Supreme Court, the Delhi Government did not show concern about improving Delhi’s public transport, repairing roads, planning new flyovers, or similar steps but chose to close schools,” Mr. Bidhuri said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/schools-shut-again-as-air-quality-turns-severe/article37816902.ece
03 December 2021||New Delhi,||Four years on, GRAP yet to evolve||Despite the Central Government’s directions nearly five years ago to “learn from experience” and “calibrate” the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to control air pollution, the policy has not been revised to accommodate predictions. Many times, the courts have had to intervene for the authorities to take action, which are already mentioned in GRAP. For instance, on Thursday afternoon, the Delhi Government decided to shut down schools after the Supreme Court earlier in the day questioned why schools were functioning despite high pollution. There are similar examples in the recent past. Closing of schools, odd-even vehicle rationing scheme, and banning construction activities are actions under the “emergency” category of GRAP. “The Graded Response Action Plan should be seen as an evolving plan… As more experience is gained in its implementation, it may be suitably calibrated and the Hon’ble Supreme Court be apprised accordingly,” Arun Kumar Mehta, Joint Secretary, MoEF&CC, had said in a letter dated January 13, 2017, to then chairman of the erstwhile EPCA, which used to implement GRAP. But GRAP did not evolve to take actions in anticipation of deteriorating air quality as per predictions from Government agencies. GRAP is a set of measures to be taken to reduce air pollution depending on the current level of pollution. Problems in the past too On November 13, the Supreme Court pulled up the Centre and the Delhi Government for the air pollution and later in the day, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced closure of schools and a ban on construction activities. Though these two measures are on the list of actions under the “emergency” category of GRAP, the CM’s announcement was separate. The CM doesn’t have the authority to impose GRAP, as per rules. On November 24, the Supreme Court asked the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR and Adjoining Areas to take actions under GRAP based on predictions of air quality rather than waiting for the AQI to get worse. The CAQM is in the process of doing it, as per officials, but an updated GRAP is yet to be notified. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment, said that the Government should consider forecasts of air quality to implement GRAP measures rather than waiting for the air to be “severe” for days at a stretch.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/four-years-on-grap-yet-to-evolve/article37816897.ece
03 December 2021||New Delhi,||City sees season’s lowest daytime temperature||The maximum temperature in the Capital fell to 19.8 degrees Celsius on Thursday, which was five degrees below normal and the lowest recorded this season. Parts of the city also received light showers in the evening after the sky remained overcast all day. Due to the cloud cover, the minimum temperature settled at 13.4 degrees Celsius, which was four degrees below normal. The weather station at Safdarjung, which is the official reading for the city, recorded 1 mm of rainfall till 5.30 p.m. The Met department has forecast partly cloudy skies for the next two days with thundershowers expected on December 6. The department said that the rain was caused by a western disturbance over north Pakistan and neighbouring areas. It added that a fresh western disturbance is also likely to impact weather over north-west India from the night of December 4. For December 3, the forecast read “partly cloudy sky with shallow fog in the morning. The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to hover between 22 and 12 degrees Celsius respectively”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/city-sees-seasons-lowest-daytime-temperature/article37816892.ece
03 December 2021||New Delhi,||SDMC workers intensify drive to control dengue||South Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Mukesh Suryan on Thursday said it has “intensified” its drive to control vector-borne diseases. This comes a day after the Delhi High Court pulled up the municipal corporations over their “failure to control dengue” with the Capital recording over 8,000 cases. The SDMC said that fogging drives were being carried out by 1,300 field workers. It said that close to 92 lakh houses were inspected this season and mosquito breeding was found in 75,000 houses. “Workers have ensured insecticide spraying in nearly 25 lakh houses. Nearly 60,000 notices were served while legal action was taken against 7,000 people and institutions after detecting mosquito breeding/larvae on their premises,” the statement read. “We are doing our bit but the Delhi Government is not helping us,” said Mr. Suryan. SDMC Standing Committee chairman B.K. Oberoi said dengue cases in the city were “dipping in number”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sdmc-workers-intensify-drive-to-control-dengue/article37816888.ece
03 December 2021||New Delhi,||‘Manpower, training key to success of cyber stations’||Dedicated cybercrime police stations were opened in most of the 15 districts in the Capital on Wednesday. Police officers, however, said that the project will be a success only when the required manpower is deployed and they are well-trained to handle such cases. A senior officer from the New Delhi district, where a cybercrime station was opened on the Mandir Marg police station compound, said until now victims of cybercrime would come to the police stations to lodge their complaints but were not taken seriously as there were more “serious cases” to work on. “However, that will not be the case anymore. Officers at the police station would direct the victims to the cybercrime police station where they will be heard seriously and action taken on their complaints,” he said. A senior officer from Dwarka district said that the initiative has been taken by Commissioner of Police Rakesh Asthana because the system has to catch up with newer technologies and ways to tackle such crimes. “These days, crimes are occurring on the dark web and as India is becoming digital, it is only natural that online fraud will increase. Therefore, dedicated police stations are the need of the hour,” he said. About the challenges of working on cybercrime cases, the officer said that the force does not have the resources or trained personnel. “There are officials who don’t even know how to use a computer. For now, those who have domain knowledge and IT background have been deployed at the stations,” he said. “Trained manpower, required infrastructure along with a focused approach in a customised setting are now being addressed by the Commissioner of Police by way of cybercrime police stations,” said DCP (Dwarka) Shankar Choudhary, who formally inaugurated the station in the district on Thursday. A sub-inspector rank officer, privy to the developments, said currently officers who were earlier with the cyber cell in each district have been deployed in the cybercrime police stations. “According to the procedure laid out for such police stations, a total of 38 officials should be deployed but that hasn’t happened so far. This project will be a success only when the required staff are posted and they have domain knowledge,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/manpower-training-key-to-success-of-cyber-stations/article37816890.ece

03 December 2021||PATNA,||FIR against doctors, staff of Bihar private hospital over botched surgeries||Days after the botched cataract surgeries in which at least 16 people lost their vision, the Muzaffarpur district administration has lodged an FIR against doctors and employees of a private hospital. A team of officials from the State Health Department will visit the hospital on Thursday to probe the incident. Earlier, Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Vinay Kumar Sharma said that a three-member team was set up to look into the incident. On November 22, as many as 65 people had undergone cataract surgeries at a free medical camp organised by a private hospital in Muzaffarpur, a north Bihar district. Of them, 26 developed eye infection, while six lost their sight. Four more are said to be undergoing treatment at a local Government hospital at Srikrishna Medical College (SKM). “An FIR has been lodged in the matter against the medical team that conducted eye surgeries on the people. A three-member team has also been set up to look into the incident. A complete list of patients who had undergone cataract surgery on that day too has been sought from the hospital authorities”, said Muzaffarpur Civil Surgeon Vinay Kumar Sharma. State Additional Chief Secretary (Health) Pratyaya Amrit said, “Strong action will be taken against those found guilty in the inquiry. Let the investigation get over.” A junior doctor at the hospital told The Hindu on the condition of anonymity that lack of hygiene at the hospital led to eye infections and some patients developed serious complications. The National Human Rights Commission took suo motu cognizance of the matter and asked the Bihar Chief Secretary to submit a detailed report on it.  Strong action will be taken against those found guilty in the inquiry.

03 December 2021||Pune,||‘Mamata visit was not to ‘rob’ Maharashtra of its industries’||The visit of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her meetings with political leaders, industrialists and members of civil society, among others, has had an unexpected fallout. Shiv Sena MP and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut on Thursday criticised the Opposition BJP for accusing Ms. Banerjee of ‘diverting’ business from Maharashtra to her State. Instead, he wanted to know why the Maharashtra BJP was silent about the visit of Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel to Mumbai on Thursday. Mr. Patel along with a high-level delegation from his State, met with business leaders and industry executives at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel ahead of the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit to be held in Gandhinagar from January 10-12 . The Sena MP said the BJP’s charge of Ms. Banerjee trying to ‘rob’ Maharashtra, after she met industrialists in Mumbai on Wednesday, was absurd. “The Gujarat Chief Minister has brought half his cabinet to Mumbai for the Vibrant Gujarat summit. Why is the Maharashtra BJP silent now?” Mr. Raut asked, and added that Gujarat was becoming ‘self-reliant’ by feeding on Mumbai. Loss of IFC Continuing with his attack mode, Mr. Raut said the State BJP was responsible for losing the International Finance Centre to Gujarat. “At that time, why did the BJP watch Mumbai lose its dream of having the International Finance Centre? Now, Uttra Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is bidding to pull the cinema industry to his State. What does the Maharashtra BJP’s leadership have to say about this? The BJP ought to take a look at their poor record in losing industries to Gujarat,” he said. Political agenda Meanwhile, former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said Ms. Banerjee’s visit had a purely political agenda to stitch up an alliance of non-Congress parties. He said her idea seems to have found support by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar. The NCP and the Congress are part of the three-party ruling alliance in the State along with the Shiv Sena. Mr. Fadnavis said on Thursday that any plan by non-BJP parties would have no effect on the BJP as Prime Minister Narendra Modi would again emerge triumphant in the 2024 Lok Sabha election. “Meeting industrialists was merely a cover for Mamata didi ’s visit. As it becomes obvious that 2024 too will go Prime Minister Modi’s way, the other parties are indulging in these political manoeuvrings… While Mamata didi speaks directly, Mr. Pawar speaks between the lines. But their intent is the same which is to keep the Congress aside, and Mr. Pawar agrees with Ms. Banerjee’s views on this,” said the BJP leader. Mr. Fadnavis said that the Congress had objected to Ms. Banerjee’s manoeuverings and had responded by stating that any opposition to the BJP at the Centre was not possible without them. “The Trinamool Congress [TMC] has openly said that they are the ‘real’ Congress now and that the old Congress is irrelevant…that is the reason why Mamata Banerjee is contesting in Goa and the Northeast because she wants to project TMC as the principal opposition instead of the Congress,” he said. The Leader of Opposition. added, “Mr. Pawar supports the TMC’s opinions. He had no alternative in Maharashtra as the political situation did not favour him and hence, he had to take the Congress along [to form the MVA government].”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/mamata-visit-was-not-to-rob-maharashtra-of-its-industries/article37816906.ece
03 December 2021||Moscow,||Stop NATO expansion, Russia tells U.S.||Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday that Moscow needed “long-term security guarantees” that would halt NATO’s eastward expansion, Moscow said. Mr. Lavrov and Mr. Blinken were in Stockholm for a meeting of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, one of the few international dialogue forums to which both the United States and Russia belong. During a bilateral meeting with Mr. Blinken, Mr. Lavrov told the U.S. diplomatic chief that Moscow wanted a legally binding promise that Ukraine would not be allowed to join NATO and that the bloc would stop its eastward expansion, Moscow said. The top Russian diplomat warned Washington against “drawing Ukraine into the geopolitical games of the United States”, which he said “will force us to take retaliatory measures to straighten out the military-strategic balance,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Mr. Lavrov added that Russia needed “long-term security guarantees on our western borders, which should be viewed as an imperative requirement”. ‘Direct threat’ The remarks by Mr. Lavrov came on a day the Kremlin said that Ukraine’s stated goal of retaking Crimea — which Moscow seized in 2014 — amounted to a “direct threat” to Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had said on Wednesday that Crimea was Ukrainian territory and Kiev’s goal was to “liberate” it. He focused however on diplomatic solutions and made no mention of taking the peninsula by force. “Speaking in Parliament, Zelensky said that ... the return of Crimea should be the main goal and philosophy of Ukraine,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “We see this as a direct threat to Russia. “Such wording of course means that the Kiev regime intends to use all available means — including force — in order to encroach on a Russian region. This is how we are leaning towards perceiving it.” Kiev and its Western allies have been sounding the alarm since last month over a fresh Russian troop build-up around Ukraine’s borders and a possible winter invasion. Moscow, which is accused of backing the separatists fighting Kiev, has denied preparing an attack and accuses NATO of raising the temperature. Minsk deal Mr. Blinken warned Russia against invading Ukraine. “We have deep concerns about Russia’s plans for renewed aggression against Ukraine,” Mr. Blinken told Mr. Lavrov, warning of “serious consequences” if Russia “decides to pursue confrontation”. Striking a conciliatory note, Mr. Blinken said the U.S. was ready to “facilitate” the “full implementation” of the Minsk peace accords. The Minsk deal was reached after the annexation of Crimea and aimed at resolving the conflict with pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine but never enforced.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/stop-nato-expansion-russia-tells-us/article37816663.ece
03 December 2021||Moscow,||Ukraine’s Crimea goal a threat: Russia||The Kremlin said on Thursday that Ukraine’s stated goal of retaking Crimea — which Moscow seized in 2014 — amounted to a “direct threat” to Russia, as tensions soar over Kiev’s conflict with pro-Russia separatists. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had said on Wednesday that Crimea was Ukrainian territory and Kiev’s goal was to “liberate” it. He focused, however, on diplomatic solutions and made no mention of taking the peninsula by force. “Speaking in Parliament, Zelensky said that ... the return of Crimea should be the main goal and philosophy of Ukraine,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “We see this as a direct threat to Russia,” he said. “Such wording of course means that the Kiev regime intends to use all available means — including force — in order to encroach on a Russian region. This is how we are leaning towards perceiving it.” Kiev’s Western allies have warned in recent weeks that a Russian invasion of Ukraine may be imminent and that Moscow may use a threat to its security as a pretext. “The likelihood of hostilities in Ukraine is still high,” Mr. Peskov said Thursday. “This remains a matter of particular concern and worry for us. We are seeing an increase in the intensity of provocative actions on the contact line.”  Pro-Moscow rebels seized two eastern Ukrainian regions shortly after Russia annexed Crimea in a long-simmering conflict that has claimed over 13,000 lives. Kiev and its Western allies accuse Moscow of backing the separatist fighters with forces and weapons — claims the Kremlin denies. Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine’s Army said one of its soldiers was killed in clashes with the separatists this week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/ukraines-crimea-goal-a-threat-russia/article37816365.ece
03 December 2021||Hong Kong,||WTA suspends events in China over Peng concerns||The Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) has taken the unprecedented step of immediately suspending all of its events in China, citing the failure of the authorities to take up Chinese star Peng Shuai’s allegations of sexual abuse by a former senior Communist Party leader. WTA Chairman Steve Simon said he was “announcing the immediate suspension of all WTA tournaments in China, including Hong Kong”. “In good conscience, I don’t see how I can ask our athletes to compete there when Peng Shuai is not allowed to communicate freely and has seemingly been pressured to contradict her allegation of sexual assault,” he said. “Given the current state of affairs, I am also greatly concerned about the risks that all of our players and staff could face if we were to hold events in China in 2022.” China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin, reacting to the suspension, said China was against “politicising sport”. Ms. Peng had posted a message on November 2 on Chinese social media revealing she had been sexually assaulted by former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli 10 years ago, when she was 25 and he was 65, and then subsequently began a years-long affair with him. The message was deleted by the censors within half an hour of being posted and was followed by an extensive censorship effort aimed at removing all information about the case. The WTA and a number of stars expressed concerns about Ms. Peng’s whereabouts after she disappeared from public view for two weeks after the statement and had her account on Sina Weibo, a Chinese Twitter equivalent, blocked from public view. Peng’s safety Responding to the outpouring of concern, Chinese state media subsequently released videos showing the former women’s doubles world number one in Beijing, having dinner with friends and attending a youth tournament. The WTA responded saying the videos did not address questions about her safety or the allegations, adding that it had been unable to contact her. Announcing the suspension of tournaments, Mr. Simon said, “When on November 2, 2021, Peng Shuai posted an allegation of sexual assault against a top Chinese government official, the Women’s Tennis Association recognised that Peng Shuai’s message had to be listened to and taken seriously. The players of the WTA, not to mention women around the world, deserve nothing less. From that moment forward, Peng Shuai demonstrated the importance of speaking out, particularly when it comes to sexual assault, and especially when powerful people are involved. As Peng said in her post, ‘Even if it is like an egg hitting a rock, or if I am like a moth drawn to the flame, inviting self-destruction, I will tell the truth about you.’ She knew the dangers she would face, yet she went public anyway. I admire her strength and courage.” He added that since then, the issue had been censored in China while Chinese officials “have been provided the opportunity to cease this censorship, verifiably prove that Peng is free and able to speak without interference or intimidation, and investigate the allegation of sexual assault in a full, fair and transparent manner.” “Unfortunately,” he added, “the leadership in China has not addressed this very serious issue in any credible way. While we now know where Peng is, I have serious doubts that she is free, safe and not subject to censorship, coercion and intimidation. The WTA has been clear on what is needed here, and we repeat our call for a full and transparent investigation – without censorship – into Peng Shuai’s sexual assault accusation.” He said he “very much regret[s]it has come to this point” and that “the tennis communities in China and Hong Kong are full of great people with whom we have worked for many years.” “However,” he added, "unless China takes the steps we have asked for, we cannot put our players and staff at risk by holding events in China. China’s leaders have left the WTA with no choice.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/wta-suspends-events-in-china-over-peng-concerns/article37816371.ece
03 December 2021||COLOMBO,||Chinese firm signs energy deal with Male||Chinese firm Sino Soar Hybrid Technology, whose energy project was suspended in Sri Lanka after India raised concern over its location close to the Tamil Nadu coast, recently signed a similar project in the Maldives. PSM, the state broadcaster in the Maldives, reported that the country’s Ministry of Environment, Climate Change and Technology signed a contract with the Chinese energy company for the “design, supply, installation and maintenance of grid-tied” solar PV-diesel hybrid power generation plants in all 12 inhabited islands of Thaa Atoll, south of capital Male. “We are installing total of 2.5 MW of solar PV, 975 kW of Battery Energy Storage Systems and other related works in all the inhabited islands in Thaa Atoll — with this, we will reduce our emissions by 2,900 tonnes of CO2 and save approx mvr 12 million annually,” a tweet from Shauna Aminath, Minister of Environment, Climate Change & Technology said on November 29. It was in January this year that Sri Lanka’s Cabinet cleared an energy project involving the same firm, in its northern islands of Nainativu, Delft or Neduntheevu, and Analaitivu, located off Jaffna Peninsula in the Palk Bay, some 50 km off Tamil Nadu. The company had won the competitive bid to execute the project that was to be carried out with a loan from the Asian Development Bank. India’s concerns However, New Delhi raised concern, offering to execute the project with a grant of $12 million. While there has been no official announcement on the project since, sources told The Hindu that “discussions [on the India-backed project] are on”. Sri Lanka’s Tamil parties too objected to the Chinese project then, saying it posed a “security threat” to India. Drawing attention to the development, the Chinese Embassy in Colombo on Thursday tweeted: “Sino Soar Hybrid Technology, being suspended to build Hybrid Energy system in 3 northern islands in Sri Lanka due to ‘security concern’ from a third party, has inked a contract with Maldivian govt on 29 Nov to establish solar power plants at 12 islands in Maldives.” According to the company’s website, it won the project in a competitive bid in August. Following news of Sri Lanka suspending the project in February, the Chinese firm issued a strongly worded statement objecting to “outrageous interference” by a “third party”, referring to India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/chinese-firm-signs-energy-deal-with-male/article37816358.ece
03 December 2021||Seoul,||U.S. slams China ‘drive’ for hypersonic weapons||America’s defence chief rebuked China on Thursday, vowing to confront its potential military threats in Asia and warning that its pursuit of hypersonic weapons intended to evade U.S. missile defences “increases tensions in the region”. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s stern comments after annual security talks with South Korea are a window into one of the Biden administration’s top foreign policy worries: how should Washington and its partners contain a Chinese military that is strengthening — both in sheer firepower and in confidence — as it pursues an end of American dominance in Asia? China sees much of Asia as its natural sphere of influence. But many in the region warn of a pattern of Chinese interference, accom- panied by moves to acquire the weapons needed to dominate its rivals. Mr. Austin’s comments were directed at China’s July test of a hypersonic weapon capable of partially orbiting Earth before reentering the atmosphere and gliding on a manoeuvrable path to its target.  “We have concerns about the military capabilities that the PRC continues to pursue, and the pursuit of those capabilities increases tensions in the region,” Mr. Austin said about the weapons test, using the abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China, the country’s official name. “We’ll continue to maintain the capabilities to defend and deter against a range of potential threats from the PRC to ourselves and to our allies,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-slams-china-drive-for-hypersonic-weapons/article37816368.ece

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Should the state stop focusing on population control?||According to the recently released National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-5, India’s Total Fertility Rate (TFR), which is the number of children a woman would have in the course of her life, is 2, a decrease from 2.2 in NFHS-4. Is this cause for cheer and should women be credited with stabilising the population? Poonam Muttreja and S. Irudaya Rajan discuss whether governments should stop focusing on population control, in a conversation moderated by Serena Josephine M. Edited excerpts: India launched its National Programme for Family Planning in 1952. What are the factors that have helped the country bring down its TFR? Poonam Muttreja:Yes, it was good that India had an early start. But while India has the oldest family planning programme, it does not have the best or even an average programme. I’d first like to give credit to the women and their aspirations. The men have demonstrated that they are not responsible for family planning and rarely support women in family planning decisions. The decline is on expected lines. If you look at NFHS-4, women, on average, wanted 1.8 children. So, it’s just that we have a huge unmet need for family planning. It was 13% in NFHS-4. In NFHS-5, it has come down to close to 10% on average in many States. There are 16.4 million abortions every year, which I think is an under-estimate and a proxy for contraception. So, there is determination in India in spite of men not participating. Having said that, I do want to say that in the last five or six years, we’ve had new methods introduced, though we need to do a lot better on numbers and we need more temporary methods. Another reason for women having or desiring fewer children is education. It is the best contraceptive pill, and better education means women will have fewer children. There are many factors for the drop in TFR, but I’d like to give maximum credit to women. Also, fertility has come down across religious lines. S. Irudaya Rajan:Though I agree that the programme was managed by women because the sterilisation rate among women is extremely high compared to that of men, the fertility decline is not the end of the story but the beginning of a new era. Most policymakers and journalists think that when you achieve a fertility rate of 2.1, the population policy is over. Unfortunately, the population policy is not just a fertility control policy. We have to educate our administrators and policymakers that population policy includes not just fertility but also mortality and migration. These are the three components of population growth. This is the beginning of the work that the government has to do in terms of child nutrition, child mortality and providing employment for the youth — what we call the demographic dividend. I don’t think it is time to celebrate the NFHS-5 results. Many view this drop in TFR as a sign of population stabilisation. Is that really so? IR:I don’t think it is a sign of population stability. Kerala, for instance, has almost the same replacement level of fertility for close to 30 years now. We have not stabilised; the population is still growing. Population momentum will set in right now and continue for perhaps a few years or a decade. Only then can we talk about population stabilisation. Basically, population momentum means that the population will continue to grow and it is not going to have a negative growth rate. Kerala still has a positive growth rate and we expect a negative growth rate may be after the 2031 to 2041 Census. It will take several decades for India to reach population stabilisation. This is the first point. As I said earlier, this fertility decline is not going to end the story of India’s human development. Even as we discuss the low fertility rate, according to the data, 23% of women were married before 18 years. The percentage of women aged 15 to 19 years who were already mothers/pregnant at the time of survey was 6.8. However, adolescent fertility rate for women aged 15 to 19 years was 43. This is only the beginning of a new era in India’s population policy. It is very important for us to wait and do more work than what we have done so that we have healthy women, healthy children and a healthy society. At this point in time, does India need a population control law or drastic measures such as the two-child norm proposed by Uttar Pradesh and Assam? Do you think the country should move away from coercive measures for population control, keeping in mind the lessons learned from China’s one-child policy that was scrapped a few years ago? PM:If there’s anything in the news in the NFHS, it is that it’s taking the wind out of those who are saying India needs coercive population control measures. India needs to move away from not only the coercive measures it has, but shouldn’t even think about population control measures. Let me explain why. First, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and other States that have achieved a TFR of 2 [have done so] without coercion. Second, we are going to have a balance in India as migrants from Bihar and U.P. are already moving to the southern parts. The country will balance its population even when we reach a minus growth rate. Let there be a secular decline, which is already happening. In fact, 70% of the population is going to be fuelled by population momentum as we have a very young population. We need to provide three or four things keeping them in mind. Our population policy needs to get more spacing methods, which are long lasting. A large percentage, if you look at people’s access to family planning, depends on where you live, what your wealth quintile is and what your age is. Younger girls have the least access to family planning services and so, there are high teenage pregnancies. We need to not only increase the age of marriage but keep girls in school and university for their own empowerment and growth. If we keep focusing on coercion, we will not focus on the right things. We are barely talking about ageing. Those who are talking about coercive policies in U.P. and Assam haven’t thought about investing in ageing and improving the health systems. If we use coercive methods and use the population to create greater disharmony, if we victimise or demonise one particular population, we should remember the Emergency and the impact that forced sterilisations had. The biggest lesson from that is that we shouldn’t be talking about population control or population in a coercive manner. IR:We should not do politics with fertility. We should talk about the quality of family planning services, which is pathetic. Family planning programmes have been about following the women. They have the first child, then the second. In between they probably have one abortion as there was no method [of contraception]. And then sterilisation. We should change this and propagate temporary methods [of contraception] among men and women. We need innovations in family planning programmes. What do you think of incentives and disincentives in family planning? PM:There is no evidence to show that linking incentives and disincentives to family planning and social schemes work globally. In India, we invest so much money in incentives for sterilisation. That’s part of the problem why women are not able to have the number of children that they wish to have. They have more children than they wish to have and go through multiple abortions, which impacts their health. Abortion-related mortality is close to 8%. IR:I am against providing incentives. I think people are addicted to the two-child family. We should think of new ideas of how to promote the quality of family planning services. Historically, if you look at India’s family planning programme, we started with the ‘cafeteria approach’ where you can ask what they have and choose. Now, you will be told there is only sterilisation and not many are promoting other methods. Many couples are using abortion as a contraceptive method. This indicates that we have failed to promote temporary methods. The use of contraceptives has improved, as per the latest NFHS, but male sterilisation continues to be low. What are the implications of the continued thrust on women with regard to family planning? PM:Once again, NFHS-5 proves that women are taking more responsibility and men are taking less. How do we change men? There are myths about adopting contraception. I don’t believe coercion is needed, but we need more communication on behavioural change. We have to change social norms, especially among the younger population, but we don’t even have sex education. Much of our population momentum is going to come from the young. We should recognise that the overuse of female sterilisation has been adversely impacting women's health. IR:We have to start educating women as well because some do not want their husbands to be sterilised. Family planning should be converted into family welfare. A family includes men and women. We should recognise this in our data collection. I think we have to do more research on women and men. We should convert that into a family affair. Probably then we will succeed. So, if not population control, what should be the focus areas? PM:I think there’s going to be the targeting of one minority community, which is the reason behind the population control push. As Professor Rajan said, we shouldn’t do politics in population. Given that India has a strong preference for sons and an aversion for daughters, our sex ratios will get more skewed. I don’t believe that on the whole, the population will decline faster. It will just distract us from all the good things that we are talking about doing such as expanding choice and social indicators like age at marriage. IR:There are two important components. One, what we are celebrating is that in India people are living longer. Now, living longer is being celebrated because it gives you the human development index. But we are only adding years to the people, not a better quality of life for our senior citizens. Second, migration is going to play a major role in India. My estimate is that right now, 600 million people are internal migrants. But we don’t have any policy on migration. We should look at population policy beyond fertility. We should include mortality decline, quality of life in old age and create a migration policy. What is the way ahead in terms of population control, family planning and in men taking greater responsibility in adopting sterilisation? PM:The family planning budget is only 6% of the health budget. Within that, we spend 2.5% on temporary methods of contraception. The money spent on incentives is 60% of the budget. This can instead be used on bringing about behavioural change. We have to recognise that India is going to keep growing because of a young population. And they don’t need family planning, they need access to contraception.  Education is the best contraceptive pill, and better education means women will have fewer children.

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||A white touch to a refreshed green revolution||November 26, 2021 was celebrated in Anand, Gujarat as the 100th birth anniversary of Verghese Kurien, the leader of India’s ‘white revolution’, which increased the incomes and the wealth of millions of cattle-owning small farmers in India, many of them women. November 26, 2021 also marked one year from the day when thousands of crop-growing farmers, who have been the beneficiaries of the ‘green revolution’ which increased their incomes, began a non-violent protest to force the Indian government to withdraw the new laws it made to undo the policies of the green revolution. The Government’s new policies intended to double incomes of small farmers, which have been languishing while stock markets are soaring. The protesting farmers feared the new policies would enable corporations to make more profits and marginalise farmers further. The Government must now go back to the drawing board to find better ways to increase farmers’ incomes. Revolutions, varied purposes The contrast between the two revolutions provides valuable insights. Their purposes were different. The purpose of the green revolution was to increase the output of agriculture to prevent shortages of food. The purpose of the white revolution was to increase the incomes of small farmers in Gujarat, not the output of milk. The green revolution was largely a technocratic enterprise driven by science and the principles of efficiency. Whereas, the white revolution was a socio-economic enterprise driven by political leaders and principles of equity. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Tribhuvandas Kishibhai Patel had a vision of a cooperative movement of Gujarati farmers for increasing their incomes. Verghese Kurien recounts in his autobiography, I Too Had a Dream , how they enrolled him in their visionary enterprise and how he became a servant of the farmers for whose sake the enterprise was created, and amongst whom he lived. Amul has become one of India’s most loved brands, and is respected internationally too for the quality of its products and the efficiency of its management. It has successfully competed with the world’s largest corporations and their well-established brands. The fledgling, farmer-owned, Indian enterprise the two Patels sponsored had many technological problems to solve. That is why they enrolled Kurien, who had studied engineering in the United States (on a Government of India scholarship). Kurien and his engineering compatriots in the organisation were compelled to develop solutions indigenously when Indian policy makers, influenced by foreign experts, said Indians could not make it. Equity was key Kurien’s accounts of the political battles he fought for ‘Make in India’, and of the ‘can-do’ spirit and innovation of Indian engineers, are inspiring. However, as he repeatedly emphasises, the enterprise achieved its outcome of empowering farmers because the governance of the enterprise to achieve equity was always kept in the foreground, with the efficiency of its production processes in the background as a means to the outcome. The green revolution’s aim was to increase outputs by applying scientific breakthroughs with methods of management to obtain economies through scale. It required inputs, like chemical fertilizers, to be produced on scale and at low cost. Therefore, large fertilizer factories were set up for the green revolution. And large dams and irrigation systems were also required to feed water on a large scale. Monocropping on fields was necessary to apply all appropriate inputs — seeds, fertilizer, water, etc., on scale. Focus on only one or two crops at a time enabled their outputs to be increased by avoiding diversion of land use to other “non-essential” crops. Monocropping increased the efficiency in application of inputs. Thus, farms became like large, dedicated engineering factories designed to produce large volumes efficiently. Diversity in the products and processes of large factories creates complexity. Therefore, diversity is weeded out to keep the factories well-focused on the outputs they are designed for. Similarly, in large-scale farms and plantations, any plants other than those the farm is designed to produce on scale are weeds. On productivity In large, modern factories, workers are only a means for producing outputs. Workers are replaced by machines whenever possible to increase outputs more efficiently. Thus, ‘productivity’, when defined as output per worker, can be increased by eliminating workers. This may be an acceptable way to measure and increase productivity when the purpose of the enterprise is to increase profits of investors in the enterprise. It is a wrong approach to productivity when the purpose of the enterprise is to enable more workers to increase their incomes, which must be the aim of any policy to increase small farmers’ incomes. The need for new solutions to increase farmers’ incomes has become imperative. Moreover, fundamental changes in economics and management sciences are necessary to reverse the degradation of the planet’s natural environment that has taken place with the application of modern technological solutions and management methods for the pursuit of economic growth. IRMA, or the Institute of Rural Management Anand, which Kurien had founded to develop a new breed of manager for increasing the well-being of farmers, convened a workshop to celebrate his 100th birth anniversary to discover what can be learned from the white revolution to regreen the green one. Leaders of on-the-ground movements, who are applying the principles of cooperative management in “natural (environmentally suitable) farming” around India, assembled to distil insights for better economic policies and better management methods to increase inclusion and improve environmental sustainability. The guidelines The first insight is: inclusion and equity in governance must be hardwired into the design of the enterprise. Increase in the incomes and wealth of the workers and small asset owners in the enterprise must be the purpose of the enterprise, rather than production of better returns for investors. The second: the ‘social’ side of the enterprise is as important as its ‘business’ side. Therefore, new metrics of performance must be used, and many ‘non-corporate’ methods of management learned and applied to strengthen its social fabric. The third: solutions must be ‘local systems’ solutions, rather than ‘global (or national) scale’ solutions. The resources in the local environment (including local workers) must be the principal resources of the enterprise. The enterprise must be embedded in the local community from whom it gets its environmental resources, and whose well-being it must nourish by its operations. The fourth: science must be practical and useable by the people on the ground rather than a science developed by experts to convince other experts. Moreover, people on the ground are often better scientists from whom scientists in universities can learn useful science. The fifth: sustainable transformations are brought about by a steady process of evolution, not by drastic revolution. Like strong drugs to treat specific ailments, large-scale transformations imposed from the top can have strong side-effects too. They slowly weaken the patient’s health, as the scientific managerial solutions of the green revolution have harmed the soil and water resources of northern India. Large-scale farming using modern scientific methods was the approach in the Soviet Union to improve agricultural outputs, as it is in the United States, and it achieved equally spectacular results. However, it wiped out peasants in the Soviet Union and has swept off small farmers in the U.S. Kurien told Premier of the USSR Aleksey Kosygin who visited him in Anand that top-down ownership of enterprises, whether by the state (in the Soviet model), or by remote investors (in the capitalist model) was the wrong solution. The essence of democratic economic governance is that an enterprise must be of the people, for the people, and governed by the people too.

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Breathing fresh air into the NCR’s pollution control||Experts frame environmental concerns in technical terms — pollutants, their monitoring and penalties — whereas air pollution in cities is driven by urban form and transport infrastructure; solutions depend on the stage of development. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had begun the process of taking a new look at an old problem by asking the Government to list its causes. For example, there is a report that the NGT directed the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to modify the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) which proposes 20%-30% reduction of air pollution by 2024. But the NCAP with its ‘collaborative and participatory approach’, monitoring, targets, emergency measures and even role for international organisations has still to make an impact. Just a day ago, on December 2, the Supreme Court of India asked pertinent questions: despite the compliance reports, why are the results on the ground negligible and what is the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region doing? At a hearing where the Court gave the Centre and Delhi government 24 hours to come out with suggestions to control air pollution, the Solicitor General’s response was that the Commission’s power structure needed reworking, to which an exasperated Court asked for ‘creativity’. This exchange raises the fundamental question about the role of the Commission, what it should be doing — and not just what it has done — as it has not been responding to interdependent causes driven by complex urban problems. Urban transformation is a social process (people, services, lifestyles) rather than a physical problem (congestion, technology, regulation). Therefore, the focus of the Commission has to be on how cities are organised, which in turn requires collaboration between multiple stakeholders. The challenge is to move away from solutions that merely require coordination between discrete administrative units, and enforcement taking the matter to the courts. Lessons from Beijing The UN Environment Programme’s review of Beijing’s control of air pollution provides useful lessons for policymakers. The population size of both cities, Beijing and Delhi, is comparable. Delhi also shares with Beijing, and other cities, the three stages in dealing with urban air pollution as a long-term task. It starts with end-of-pipe air pollution control gradually moving to integrated measures targeting primary pollutants (SO2, NO2, PM10, and CO), with the Government playing the main role. Later, secondary pollutants, or particulate matter leading to smog, primarily PM2.5, become the main focus for control with a regional coordination mechanism. The similarity ends there. The review by the UN points to a management system characterised by systematic planning, strong monitoring capacity, local standards, specific enforcement mechanism and public awareness. First, the key result area is a new model of network operation and quality control to provide early warning to effectively reduce the level of pollution under adverse weather conditions. In case of forecasted heavy pollution, warnings are issued at least 24 hours in advance through the media, in addition to daily air quality reports and forecasts. The technical system combines high-resolution satellite remote sensing and laser radar, an integrated network combining ‘air-land’ data for quality monitoring with greater analytical capacity and over 1,000 PM2.5 sensors throughout the city to accurately identify high-emission areas and periods. Approach to urbanisation Second, in Beijing what really made a difference was not shutting down polluting units, restricting car ownership and travel, and improved fuel standards but the approach to urbanisation. ‘Smart cities’ such as New York, London and Beijing provide more space for public transport and mixed land use spatial planning minimising travel. The problems of Beijing and Delhi, as transit centres with no peak-hour traffic, require additional measures. Beijing’s 7th Ring Road to ease congestion is 1,000 kilometres long, and even before buildings came up, the metro link was operational. Beijing already has more than 550 km of metro, more than one-and-half times that of the Delhi Metro; the plans are to have 1,000 km of metro rail. The bus transport system has 30,000 low floor buses, more than eight times the number with the Delhi Transport Corporation. In China, 72% of travel is completed by public transport compared with 37% in Japan, 17% in Europe and 10% in the U.S. Vehicle policy Third, when it comes to air pollution, particulate matter is the most difficult to control, leads to smog and serious health issues, and is largely caused by vehicle emissions. Traffic has been identified as a distinct and growing challenge. Systematic study on PM2.5 source apportionment in Beijing has found that local emissions constituted two-thirds of this, of which vehicle emissions were nearly half the main source. Regional transport contributes to pollution on heavily polluted days. On-road diesel vehicles formed the largest part of mobile sources, and  the policy focus gradually changed from gasoline vehicle emissions to heavy-duty diesel vehicle emissions. Phasing out older vehicles made the most significant contribution. Beijing plans to have 48 lakh charging points by 2022 to push the use of electric vehicles. Delhi has nearly two times the number of registered vehicles than Beijing, increasing at a faster pace and source apportionment is still being debated. Fourth, innovative implementation steps were instituted in Beijing. Local regulation targeted controlling both the concentration and total emission amount leading to transforming and upgrading the industrial structure production processes and equipment. Economic incentives were tailored to the specific problem, with attractive levels of subsidies to high-polluting enterprises to close their production and differentiated fees charged according to the concentration of waste gas emissions for those who chose to remain in production. Enforcement at the municipal and State levels is coordinated, with each level having different responsibilities and a mechanism for cooperation. Municipal environmental enforcement teams do specific inspections and hotspot grid supervision based on a detailed emission inventory for each source, passing on serious cases to the State level. Lastly, independent evaluations review the air quality management system, conduct quantitative assessments of the pollution reduction effects in selected areas, analyse new challenges, and provide recommendations for enabling further improvement in air quality and building public support. The problem in the NCR is not the peculiar mix of administrative levels. It is their common approach to air pollution with cosmetic steps, unverified claims, statistical compliance and shifting responsibility which the powerful Commission has failed to override with a joint plan to modify trends.

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Back to the Kamaraj Plan||The imminent ‘Kamaraj Plan’ in Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) could serve as an opportunity as well as a challenge for the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) government. After the formation of the Cabinet in 2019, A.P. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy announced that the entire Cabinet should be prepared to resign and go back to their constituencies to strengthen the party half-way through the five-year term. In 1963, the Chief Minister of the then Madras State, K. Kamaraj, suggested to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that all senior Congress ministers should resign and take up party work to revitalise the Congress. This was immediately accepted and implemented by Nehru. Sources in the government confirm that the reshuffle is under way and Mr. Reddy is in the process of giving it shape. Consultations with party seniors and leaders are going on and a final list may get the nod shortly, according to a senior government functionary who is in frequent touch with the Chief Minister’s Office. “Initially, the plan was to replace 90% of the ministers. Later, it was decided that there would be a full reshuffle,” the functionary said under the condition of anonymity. The Energy Minister, Balineni Srinivasa Reddy, while speaking to reporters recently, also confirmed that the entire Cabinet would be replaced. The shuffle was expected to take place by October 15, but now it is being planned for January 14, 2022. Strategic move Way ahead of the 2024 polls, this is a strategic move by the party. The YSRCP will naturally have the advantage of promoting its policies and welfare programmes. At a time when the State is staring at delimitation, the senior party leadership’s exposure to the grassroots is likely to give them an opportunity to establish a better connect with the people across regions and age groups and to take the party’s policies, especially the flagship Navaratnalu welfare schemes, to people more effectively. In the proposed delimitation, the 13 districts of A.P. are likely to be divided into 25 or more for administrative convenience and more focused governance. All the ministers and senior leaders in the party will be made responsible for certain constituencies so that they can strengthen the party’s reach in areas where it is not strong through schemes and policies. The Navaratnalu welfare schemes include the YSR Rythu Bharosa scheme (providing Rs. 50,000 assistance to farmers), fee reimbursement for students, Arogyasri (free medical treatment) and Amma Vodi (direct transfer of Rs. 15,000 to mothers who send their children to school). Facing questions This exposure of the leaders will also mean greater accountability. They need to be prepared to face questions on various issues, including on the State capital, State finances, the issue of the Amaravati farmers and land pooling, pay revision of government employees, and Special Category Status. As the party inches closer to the polls, these questions will only get louder. Meanwhile, the Telugu Desam Party, the Jana Sena Party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress are already trying to expose the shortcomings of the YSRCP. The BJP has declared support for the Amaravati farmers and joined their padayatra demanding justice. The shuffle could bring new opportunities for young and aspiring legislators, but it could also lead to discontent among the seniors if there is change in status quo. How the party tackles these challenges and makes use of these opportunities needs to be seen. appaji.r@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/back-to-the-kamaraj-plan/article37816352.ece
03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Births and rights||A Bill that the government of the land intends to make law, cannot be exclusivist at the very outset; and at least, with the time of passage, it is imperative that it loses its biases. It cannot exclude certain categories of citizens from the benefits and rights that the law seeks to confer upon the people of the country. And, that is what the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill, 2020, that was passed in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, has done, by excluding two categories — LGBTQIA+ and single men. Undoubtedly, the time has indeed come for such a Bill; for government intervention to regulate the field of fertility treatments, and by seeking to establish a national registry and registration authority for all clinics and medical professionals in the segment, it will fill a vacuum. The Bill has provisions to protect the rights of the donors, the commissioning couple and the children born out of ART, to grant and withdraw licences for clinics and banks depending on performance factors. It proposes to make it impossible for outlaws to operate within the system and profit from it, while exploiting patients. It also plans to put an end to illegal trafficking in embryos, and mistreatment of the poor coerced by their circumstances into donating eggs or sperm. It is unfathomable that a Bill, so progressive by its very nature, would glaringly exclude members of the LGBTQIA+ community and single men. As citizens, these groups too have the right to exercise reproductive rights. The omission is particularly baffling considering that the legislation has made provisions for single women too, apart from a commissioning heterosexual couple. The Union Health Minister said that several recommendations made by the Parliamentary Standing Committee had been considered. Unfortunately, despite expert recommendations to include both categories, the Committee recommended ‘it would not be appropriate to allow live-in couples and same sex couples to avail the facility of ART’ citing the best interest of the child born through ART. It also recorded that ‘given [the] Indian family structure and social milieu and norms, it will not be very easy to accept a child whose parents are together but not legally married’. While the law would do well to be cognisant of the sentiments of the people, its purpose is also to nudge retrograde social norms out of their freeze-frames towards broader acceptance of differences and preferences. Legislators have also pointed out that the Surrogacy Bill intrinsically connected with the ART Bill was pending in the Rajya Sabha, and that it would only be appropriate that both Bills be considered together before they are passed. The ball is now squarely in the court of the Upper House; legislators can still set right the omissions and introduce the spirit of justice in the letter of the law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/births-and-rights/article37816341.ece
03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Limited gains||If China was severely criticised for keeping the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak that began in November 2019 shrouded in secrecy and for sharing the genetic sequence on a public database only on January 12, 2020, countries that are transparent and quick in sharing vital information are not rewarded but are punished. After the first infection by a new variant — it has 32 mutations in the spike protein alone — was confirmed from a specimen collected on November 9, Botswana and South Africa diligently posted its genetic sequence on the public database, on November 23. Instead, the travel bans now imposed on South Africa and a few other African countries are not only incongruous but can actually be counterproductive. Such rash decisions disincentivise countries from promptly reporting and sharing vital data with huge public health implications, particularly during the pandemic. The demonstration by Botswana and South Africa of their capability to quickly detect new variants through superior surveillance via genomic sequencing needs to be rewarded through enhanced vaccine access to protect Africa and cut the risk of new variants. On November 30, the Netherlands reported that samples collected on November 19 and 23, before South Africa announced its findings and the travel bans went into effect, were of the Omicron variant. While it is unclear whether these people had also visited southern Africa, 14 of the 61 passengers returning from South Africa on November 26 and who tested positive for Omicron showed different strains. This suggests that the people were ‘very probably infected independently... from different sources and in different locations’. Belgium and Germany too have reported the presence of the variant well before South Africa flagged it. Even if the Omicron variant did not emerge in Europe, the presence of the variant before South Africa notified it and the travel bans strongly suggests that the variant was already spreading in some European countries. It also reflects the relatively poor surveillance in place there when compared with the two African countries. This underscores the need to have systems in place that delay or reduce the spread of the new variant through testing prior to or upon arrival or the application of quarantine, as recommended by WHO. An indiscriminate travel ban is no solution. Several countries, including India, have already reported cases of the Omicron variant, said to pose a ‘very high’ global risk. Though disease severity in different categories of people still remains unclear, preliminary evidence suggests that the new variant increases the risk of reinfection and possesses a possible transmission advantage, as seen in the surge in Omicron cases in South Africa. It is time India increases the pace of vaccination and has better adherence to COVID-appropriate behaviour to cut the risk.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/limited-gains/article37816340.ece

If any country thinks that by calling us aggressor it can pressure us to forget our national interests, then that country is living in its own paradise and it is welcome to that.” Mrs. Gandhi was addressing the Congress workers of Delhi who had assembled at her residence this morning to express their solidarity at this time of crisis. Mrs. Gandhi said: “The times have passed when any nation sitting three or four thousand miles away could give orders to Indians on the basis of their colour superiority as they wished.

03 December 2021||COIMBATORE,||Price drop deters sugar exports: ISMA||A fall in the global prices of sugar is deterring mills from signing fresh contracts, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA). Exporters, who had entered into contracts for export of 35 lakh tonne of sugar in the 2021-2022 sugar season with most of these contracts made when the global sugar prices were in the range of 20 to 21 cents per pound of raw sugar, find the current prices of about 18.6 cents unattractive, ISMA said. The mills were likely to enter into further contracts only when world prices increase to about 21 cents per pound, the association added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/price-drop-deters-sugar-exports-isma/article37816710.ece

03 December 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Prashant, Pawan share secret of success||Keeping a clean sheet is a matter of pride for any goalkeeper, but it’s rare to see two goalkeepers joining hands to keep their side’s post safe and contribute in the team’s win. Prashant Chauhan and Pawan, who played alternately to help India beat Belgium 1-0 in the quarterfinals of the men’s hockey Junior World Cup at the Kalinga Stadium here on Wednesday, backed each other well. “Earlier goalkeepers were changed at halftime (if required). Now with one goalkeeper playing a quarter, we think we can play with full focus. When one goes out, he mentally prepares him to do well on the next opportunity. For Belgium, we focused on saving penalty corners,” Prashant, hailing from Uttar Pradesh, told The Hindu on Thursday. Camaraderie Pawan spoke about their camaraderie. “On the field we compete with each other, but off the field we are good friends. It does not matter whether I start or Prashant starts. Our mindset is whatever time one gets he has to focus on the team’s win. We tried to give our best (in the quarterfinals) and hugged each other after the win.” During training sessions, they complement each other. “If Prashant does something wrong, then I point it out. If I make a mistake, then he guides me. Our bonding is good and we discuss each other’s game,” said Uttarakhand lad Pawan. The two also work with defenders. “We motivate each other and focus on our structure and planning (before a match). The goalkeeper does the calling. He watches the whole field and can say when and whom to tackle and which side to block,” said Pawan, looking forward to continuing the fine job in India's forthcoming matches. Both have a common idol, Olympic medallist P.R. Sreejesh. “We have learnt a lot from Sreejesh bhai. In the last camp he told us a lot of things about the game. He is our idol,” said Prashant. “In India he is the idol of every young goalkeeper. “For 21 years he has served the country. We learn a lot as he shares his experience with us,” said Pawan.  Our bonding is good and we discuss each other’s game — Pawan||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/prashant-pawan-share-secret-of-success/article37816331.ece
03 December 2021||MUMBAI,||With Kohli back, India finds itself in a selection muddle||The wet build-up to the second Test in Mumbai may have deprived both India and New Zealand of an ideal preparation, but it hasn’t dampened interest in the high-pressure game. Despite the excitement of the return of Test cricket to the Wankhede Stadium after five years, the day before the deciding Test of the series was deprived of all action. While New Zealand cancelled its training session, a group of India cricketers practised at Mumbai Cricket Association’s indoor academy at Bandra-Kurla Complex. In the afternoon, just before a half-hour downpour sent the groundstaff into yet another frenzy, both captains and coaches drove down at the stadium and had a close look at the pitch. India captain Virat Kohli, head coach Rahul Dravid, bowling coach Paras Mhambrey and batting coach Vikram Rathour were involved in an intense discussion with BCCI chief curator Ashish Bhowmick. Tricky decision Importantly, India’s think-tank will have its task cut out to finalise its playing combination. More than choosing between Mohammed Siraj and Ishant Sharma or Wriddhiman Saha and K.S. Bharat, the trickiest decision will be whether to leave Shreyas Iyer out as Kohli is set to return to the side. Had it not been for Kohli’s decision to rest from the first Test, Shreyas wouldn’t have become India’s Test cap No. 303. With the Mumbai batter having marked the occasion by becoming the first batter to score a hundred and a fifty on debut, it will be difficult to leave him out. With Ajinkya Rahane, Cheteshwar Pujara and Kohli himself failing to score runs consistently in the last couple of years, India will be tempted to keep Shreyas in the side. In that case, it will be interesting to see if opener Mayank Agarwal is left out, with either Pujara or the wicketkeeper being converted into a stop-gap opener. Not only did the Andhra batter impressed with his glovework as substitute in Kanpur but he is a regular top-order batter in domestic cricket. While India has too many muddles to resolve, New Zealand appear to be mulling a solitary change. Captain Kane Williamson will be tempted to give left-arm pacer Neil Wagner a go in place of a spinner (William Somerville). Red soil, coupled with overcast skies for the first half of the game, would definitely be an incentive for the Kiwis to field three pacers.  The teams (from):   India: Virat Kohli (Capt.), Ajinkya Rahane (Vice-capt.), Mayank Agarwal, Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara, Shreyas Iyer, Suryakumar Yadav, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), K.S. Bharat (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, R. Ashwin, Axar Patel, Jayant Yadav, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna.   New Zealand: Kane Williamson (Capt.), Will Young, Tom Latham, Ross Taylor, Tom Blundell (wk), Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, Ajaz Patel, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner, William Somerville, Tim Southee, Neil Wagner and Kyle Jamieson.   Umpires: Nitin Menon & Anil Chaudhary; Third umpire: Virender Sharma. Match Referee: Javagal Srinath.

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||A decisive game seems round the corner||Although the deadlock continues after five draws into the World chess championship title-match, Ian Nepomniachtchi seems to be gaining a psychological edge over Magnus Carlsen. In Wednesday’s fifth game, Carlsen was on the defensive from the opening and eventually escaped with a draw. Nepo was left regretting his choice of move on the 20th turn. This could encourage Nepo to be more proactive in the coming games. Gaining rating points So far, Nepo has not appeared intimidated by the champion at any stage. The Russian looks very well-prepared for the Norwegian favourite and willing to test him on various counts. In fact, with every draw, Nepo gains a rating point while Carlsen loses one. “It’s becoming clearer and clearer that it’s going to be hard for either of us to break through,” said Carlsen after the fifth game. Over the next three days, Carlsen will play twice with white pieces and that could end the ongoing deadlock before the next rest day on Monday, before the ninth round.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-decisive-game-seems-round-the-corner/article37816325.ece
03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Lewandowski was the No. 1’||Reiterating his reservations on Lionel Messi being preferred over Bayern Munich star Robert Lewandowski for the Ballon d’Or award, German great Lothar Matthaus said the latter should at least be considered for the next FIFA World Player of the Year. “Lewandowski was the best player in 2021 but we have to respect the decision of the people who gave Messi the Ballon d’Or. We have to congratulate Messi in all fairness but, for me, it was a wrong decision. A Messi fan “I am a fan of Messi and he was the best player in the last 15 years. But this year Lewandowski was the No. 1 for me in Europe and the world,” said Matthaus at an interaction with select media, hosted by Sony Ten2, ahead of the Bundesliga Der Klassiker between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund on December 4. “Next year, when FIFA selects the world player of the year, Lewandowski should win because what he has contributed to football is incomparable. He was the complete player. He not only scored goals as a striker, but also took a lot of additional responsibilities in both attack and defence,” said Matthaus. Will emerge stronger The legendary German felt that though the pandemic caused a lot of damage to football, the sport will emerge stronger. “Let’s hope that we can live a normal life soon. The sport will always be determined by how we live our lives and the pandemic has altered the way we see it now. I am trying to be positive about everything. “I believe the political leaders and the medical professionals will be able to contribute positively and ensure football is able to overcome the adverse effects of the pandemic,” said Matthaus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/lewandowski-was-the-no-1/article37816333.ece
03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Chennaiyin eyes a hat-trick||Chennaiyin FC will look to make it a hat-trick of wins when it takes on a struggling SC East Bengal in its third Indian Super League match in Vasco da Gama on Friday. The two-time champion is still trying to find its feet under new manager Bozidar Bandovic, but the team has managed to pull off two wins — against Hyderabad FC and NorthEast United FC. Against the Highlanders in the previous match, the team looked better organised than in the opener against HFC and the 2-1 win will give it huge confidence.  Speaking ahead of the match, Bandovic said, “We have a chance now to make three wins in a row. We need to be better, quicker and need to have good decisions. We had a very good start and that is good for our confidence.” East Bengal, on the other hand, has had a torrid start to its campaign with two losses and a draw.  What would be more worrying for the is the fact that it has been weak defensively, conceding 10 goals so far. In its last fixture, it lost 4-6 to Odisha FC after a 0-3 defeat to ATK Mohun Bagan. In the opening match, it played out a 1-1 draw against Jamshedpur FC. Despite the setbacks, East Bengal coach Jose Manuel Diaz looked at the positives after the last game saying, “The fact that we have started scoring goals is a big positive. It is an indication of the fact that the attacking line-up has started clicking together. “But in football, it is a matter of balance. We need to focus on rectifying our mistakes and backing ourselves to win the first match,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chennaiyin-fc-will-look-to-sustain-the-momentum/article37816787.ece
03 December 2021||Brisbane,||Warner thrives on criticism, according to Finch||David Warner may be a polarising figure, but the aggressive opening batsman is rarely boring and his heroics for Australia at the Twenty20 World Cup signalled he is back at his explosive best. Now 35, Warner boasts an average just shy of 50 from his 86 Tests, with his swashbuckling presence able to turn a game. Unfinished business An attacking left-hander, Warner will feel he has unfinished business after a miserable Ashes on English soil in 2019 where he tallied just 95 runs at a meagre 9.5. Stuart Broad was his nemesis, dismissing him seven times. He has scored 4,551 of his 7,311 Test runs at home, smacking 18 centuries at an average of 63.20 from his 45 Tests, plundering a highest score of 335. Warner made a modest debut in Brisbane 10 years ago but then carried his bat with a career-defining century in his second game at Hobart to signal his arrival. He went on to establish himself as one of the best all-format openers in the world, before it all came crashing down and his reputation was trashed. Warner was cast as the villain in the ‘Sandpaper-gate’ ball-tampering scandal against South Africa in 2018. Warner served a 12-month ban before being called up again, and promptly picked up where he left off, enjoying a prolific one-day World Cup before his poor Ashes series in 2019 that again had the critics writing him off. But in typical fashion, he bounced back emphatically by scoring an epic unbeaten 335 against Pakistan in Adelaide later that year. World Cup exploits Another lean spell this year cost him his place on his Indian Premier League team, but once more he proved the doubters wrong with his T20 World Cup exploits. Aaron Finch, skipper of Australia’s triumphant T20 team, said Warner thrived on criticism. “Can’t believe people wrote him off,” he said. “That’s when he plays his best cricket. It was almost like poking the bear.”  Can’t believe people wrote him (Warner) off. That’s when he plays his best cricket — Finch   Warner has scored 4,551 of his 7,311 Test runs at home, smacking 18 centuries at 63.20 from his 45 Tests||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/warner-thrives-on-criticism-according-to-finch/article37816337.ece

03 December 2021||Brisbane,||Ashes rivalry raises the stakes, says Woakes||England pace bowler Chris Woakes says the racism and sexting scandals that have sidetracked the England and Australian cricket camps ahead of the Ashes are personal matters that should not be part of on-field banter during the series. England arrived in Australia as Azeem Rafiq detailed allegations of institutional racism he experienced at English captain Joe Root’s Yorkshire. Wicketkeeper Tim Paine then quit as Australia captain before taking a leave of absence after a sexting scandal surfaced. Woakes, an all-rounder who is fighting for a spot in the side to play in the first of five Tests beginning here on December 8, said the Ashes rivalry naturally raised the stakes. But he said to use either issue as on-field banter, or sledging, would be out of line. Personal issues “I think what’s happened in both camps, a lot of the issues are personal and cricket is played best when that sort of stuff is left to the side and we let the skills do the talking,” he said on Thursday. “Whatever goes on on the field, goes on the field, and the Ashes raises that rivalry. “But in my experience, playing in three Ashes series, it’s not overstepped the line once when I’ve been around. “I’m sure the cricket will be hard fought, as it always is, and will be good to watch.” England’s squad had some unexpected time in the middle on Thursday at Brisbane’s Ian Healy Oval, which was due to host the tour match against the England Lions from Tuesday. But consistent rain washed out the first two days of play, and just 29 overs were possible in last week’s three-day tour match, also in Brisbane. But the skies cleared and James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Ben Stokes finally got a chance to bowl in a match scenario, Stokes taking two for 31 and the opening bowlers going wicketless as the Lions finished the day on 226 for four.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ashes-rivalry-raises-the-stakes-says-woakes/article37816339.ece

03 December 2021||Nassau (Bahamas),||We should be able to play where we want: McIlroy||Four-time Major winner and PGA Tour Player Advisory Council chairman Rory McIlroy believes that golfers should be allowed to compete in the Saudi International in February. The Saudi International, which moved from the European Tour to the Asian Tour, has enticed several high-profile names like Bryson DeChambeau, Sergio Garcia and Phil Mickelson to sign up. The PGA Tour and European Tour, however, has yet to grant permission. The tournament is backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, and offers considerable prize money. “We (golfers) are independent contractors, and we should be able to play where we want. So I think the Tour should grant releases. It’s an Asian Tour event that has official golf world rankings,” McIlroy said at a media interaction on the sidelines of the Hero World Challenge here on Wednesday. At a pre-event press conference, Tiger Woods threw his weight behind the PGA Tour. Fantastic job “I’m supporting the PGA Tour. I understand that some of the comparisons are very similar to when Arnold (Palmer) and Jack (Nicklaus) broke off from the PGA of America to start the Tour. I don’t see it that way. I think the Tour has done a fantastic job,” Woods said. American and two-time Major winner Collin Morikawa explained that he would like to keep his options open. “I’m 24, and I’m keeping all eyes and ears open. The PGA Tour has been the focal point of my entire career. But at the end of the day, all we’re trying to do is grow the game. How do we create this outlet that is not just for a U.S. market, but for the global market?,” Morikawa said.

03 December 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Upbeat India vs resilient Germany||Keeping its defence intact had been the primary task for India against Belgium, similarly resisting the German raiders until the last second will be number one priority in the semifinals of the men’s hockey Junior World Cup at the Kalinga Stadium on Friday. The way Germany fought back, scoring the equaliser in the final seconds of its quarterfinal against Spain before going on to win the penalty shootout speaks of the six-time champion’s resilience. India chief coach Graham Reid pointed out the young Germans’ strength. “You never rule Germany out, whatever the situation. They have proven that over the years,” said Reid about the opponent which has 10 podium finishes in 11 appearances.  Players like Sanjay and Yashdeep Siwach did well to marshal the men at the back against Belgium. They will look forward to continuing their good work. The last line of defence, goalkeepers Prashant and Pawan, blunted Belgium’s moves and would love to have another clean sheet against the Germans. The midfield, led by captain Vivek Sagar Prasad, would be eager to facilitate fluid movement and the alert forwards to try and make the most of any opportunity. India’s robust drag-flicking department also must be eager to contribute in the quest for a spot in a second consecutive final.  The results:   Ninth-12th places: South Africa vs Pakistan 3-3 (Shootout: South Africa bt Pakistan 4-1); 13th-16th: Canada bt USA 4-0; Chile bt Egypt 1-0 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/upbeat-india-vs-resilient-germany/article37816652.ece
03 December 2021||Kochi,||Feels like winning a Grammy: Anju||Life was a big struggle for young Shaili Singh at her home in Jhansi a few years ago. She was raised by her mother, a single parent and a tailor, and every day seemed to bring a new set of problems. But once Anju Bobby George and her husband Robert Bobby George brought the long jumper under their wing, there came about a wonderful transformation. Shaili is now a confident 17-year-old, an under-20 World championship silver medallist who, Anju believes, can go on to win an Olympic medal. Big surprise It is this sort of work, of empowering young girls and guiding them to a bright future that saw World Athletics reward Anju with its Woman-of-the-Year Award on Wednesday. “It’s a big surprise. It’s like winning a Grammy Award or a FIFA world award,” Anju, the country’s lone World Championships medallist (long jump bronze, Paris 2003) and the first Indian to receive the World Athletics award, told The Hindu on Thursday. “More than all my achievements, what matters is what we are giving back to society... keeping the cycle going, to produce future champions. And this is Bobby’s achievement too. More than half, because he is the backbone, allowing me to do all these things even now. When Bobby made me a World Championship medallist, he was a one-man army but now, together, we are developing many athletes (at her Anju Bobby Centre of Excellence, Bengaluru). And it’s not just that we are making champions, it’s all-round development and community development also.” And, Anju, the mentor at her academy where Bobby George is the chief coach, said: “My work is more about developing women athletes, I want to encourage more women to come forward, take up sport and give back to society and make it a sort of culture,” said Anju, senior vice-president of the Athletics Federation of India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/feels-like-winning-a-grammy-anju/article37816657.ece
03 December 2021||BENGALURU,||Akanksha stuns Sathwika, in last eight||Qualifier Akanksha Nitture beat eighth seed Sathwika Sama 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 to reach the quarterfinals of the $15,000 KSLTA ITF World Tennis Tour women’s tennis tournament at the KSLTA courts here on Thursday. In a match that lasted a little over than two hours, Akansha fell behind twice in the first set, but recovered in time to reel off four games in a row from 2-4 down to take the opener. The second set played out like the first had with the players trading breaks early on. However, it was Sathwika’s turn to go on a run of four straight games from 2-2 and she restored parity at one set all. Comeback When Sathwika won the first two games of the third it seemed all over for Akanksha, but the 18-year-old responded in fine fashion, reeling off six straight games to clinch the match. Elsewhere, top seed Rutuja Bhosale quelled the challenge of wild card Reshma Murari 6-3, 6-3 while third seed Sowjanya Bavisetty outplayed Soha Sadiq 6-2, 6-2. Pranjala Yadapalli, seeded fourth, breezed past wild card Yubarani Banerjee 6-3, 6-3.

03 December 2021||JEDDAH,||Hamilton cannot afford to take any risks||Lewis Hamilton will bid to keep alive his hopes of a historic eighth Formula One world title at the inaugural Saudi Arabian GP this weekend, powered by the new engine that aided his remarkable triumph in Brazil. After consecutive victories in Sao Paulo and Qatar, Mercedes’ defending champion seeks to complete a hat-trick, or see championship leader Max Verstappen suffer a setback, on the streets of the high-speed Jeddah Corniche Circuit. If he succeeds and trims the Red Bull driver’s eight-point advantage to just one, or even zero, in Sunday’s race, the title will be decided by a final winner-takes-all showdown in Abu Dhabi on December 12. But Hamilton knows it is a perilous challenge and that he cannot afford to take any risks. Verstappen will take the title on Sunday if he wins and Hamilton finishes outside the top six. “You just have to be very careful — more cautious than ever before,” said Hamilton, stressing the importance of avoiding an accident. “You have to be ready to do whatever you can to avoid a collision even if it means leaving the track,” he told Germany’s Auto Motor Und Sport . “After all, you want to finish the race. If you are too stubborn and defend your position, you will crash.”  The Briton and Verstappen have collided twice already this year, at Silverstone and Monza, and had several near-misses in a season filled with incidents and arguments. The challenging track appears likely to favour Hamilton’s Mercedes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hamilton-cannot-afford-to-take-any-risks/article37816327.ece
03 December 2021||New Delhi,||Daruvala opens up on the road ahead||Indian racer Jehan Daruvala feels 2022 could be the make or break year for his childhood dream of becoming a Formula 1 driver. The 23-year-old from Mumbai is two rounds away from completing his second season in Formula 2, a stepping stone to Formula 1. Jehan said he might have to look beyond Formula 1 if he doesn’t reach that pinnacle in 2023. “It’s a hard situation to be in, but you know realistically if it’s not 2023, it’s very difficult after that. “I’ve had two good weekends (in F2), so that will help me (in contention) in terms of being on the market for a good seat and sort of keeping my F2 seat for next year. I hope to get more clarity over that soon,” said Jehan in an interaction. He will be racing this weekend in Saudi Arabia after a two-month break. Rookie Oscar Piastri is leading the championship. Asked if a third season in Formula 2 can negatively impact his chances of reaching Formula 1, Jehan said: “I think honestly in Formula 2, there have been a few sensational rookies like Oscar, Charles, Lando (Norris), George but once you are in your second year or third year, you know the difference is a lot less than it is from your first year to a second year. “You already have had a year of experience so it doesn’t make too much difference if you’re in your second or third year. If I do end up doing Formula 2 next season, it is again going to be a very hard competitive season,” said Jehan.  Jehan has not yet explored racing in other series.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/daruvala-opens-up-on-the-road-ahead/article37816335.ece
03 December 2021||Brisbane,||Carey replaces Paine as Australia ’keeper||Alex Carey was on Thursday confirmed as Australia’s wicketkeeper for the first two Ashes Tests against England after scandal-hit former skipper Tim Paine stepped down. The 30-year-old has played limited-overs cricket for Australia and stood in as the one-day skipper in the West Indies this year, but is yet to feature in a Test. That will change in Brisbane next week after he was added to the 15-man squad. “He is an excellent cricketer and a fine individual who will bring many great strengths into the team,” said chief selector George Bailey While Carey was overlooked for Australia’s T20 squad that won the World Cup last month, with Inglis preferred, it meant plenty of domestic red-ball cricket for him in recent weeks.  The Australia squad: Pat Cummins (Capt.) Alex Carey, Cameron Green, Marcus Harris, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Michael Neser, Jhye Richardson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Swepson and David Warner .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/carey-replaces-paine-as-test-keeper/article37816717.ece
03 December 2021||MUMBAI,||Changes in team are combination-based: Kohli||India captain Virat Kohli has preferred to keep the team combination close to his chest, especially with regard to who will make way for him in the second Test. “You have to obviously understand the situation of where the team is placed. You have to understand where individuals stand at certain stages during the course of a long season. So you have to obviously communicate well,” Kohli said on Thursday. “You have to speak to the individuals and approach them in a way where you explain things to them properly. Mostly it has been combination-based whenever we have done changes in the past. It is not a difficult thing to do when there is collective trust and belief in the group that we are working towards the same vision.” India will have to make the call on whether Kohli comes in for Ajinkya Rahane or Cheteshwar Pujara, both of whom have had mediocre returns for a long time. Stressing that changes in the team are done by “prioritising the team” and “taking care of individuals” simultaneously, Kohli reiterated the tendency to back tried and trusted performers. “We have backed the set of players that have done the job for the Indian team the last five-six years. We maintain and continue to maintain they are the integral part of the larger scheme of things, of the core group of the Indian Test team,” Kohli said. Having failed to score a hundred for two years, Kohli worked with former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar here for almost a week. “It was just to stay in the rhythm of playing red-ball cricket. The idea was to get repetition and volume, which is important in Test cricket. It is just about getting into the mould of switching in-between formats, something that I have always tried to do,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/changes-in-team-are-combination-based-kohli/article37816443.ece

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||A modern take||The year 2021 is ending on a good note for music composer-turned-actor GV Prakash. While Bachelor hits screens this Friday, his Jail releases next week. For a musician who is an accidental actor — debuting in a film titled Darling in 2015 — Prakash has travelled quite a distance. He is more serious about the craft now, and is looking to learn. “After my debut film, I did a string of projects that focussed on comedy. Bala’s Naachiyar (2018)  broke that mould — in terms of body language, look and acting techniques. Sarvam Thala Mayam and Sivappu Manjal Pachai followed that, and I was lucky to get opportunities to work in good roles.”  Bachelor and Jail are worthy follow-ups to a string of serious subjects that he has been taking of late. “I think I’m getting better with every film, be it acting or music composition. That’s the aim with every project I take up.” With Bachelor , he is trying to provide a peek into a toxic relationship between a boy and a girl. The phrase ‘Lust has become more dominant than love’ shows up in the trailer of this film, directed by Sathish Selvakumar and produced by G Dillibabu. “This is not a jaali (happy) film. It is a serious subject and a study on a man-woman relationship and how it breaks down into a messy affair. It will be a modern take on toxic relationships,” says Prakash, whose co-star in the film is Divyabharathi. He plays a character called Darling in the film that also stars Munishkanth and Bhagavathi Perumal, and Prakash says that it was very different to who he is in real life. “I’m very thuru thuru (restless) by nature, but the character I play is very laidback and doesn’t bat an eyelid even if the world around him collapses. If you ask him a question, he takes around 30 seconds to answer. This presented a lot of opportunities as an actor; I learnt how to use my eyes, and how to make ‘stays’ while performing. Jail , on the other hand, has me as Karuna, who is a pickpocket and a cunning thief.” Looking back, Prakash considers Naachiyar his coming-of-age film and one of the biggest highlights in his career. “Till then, I did not believe I had it in me to physically change myself for a role. Director Bala, who I consider one of my gurus, believed that I could do it. Similarly, Baba Bhaskar (choreographer-director) made me dance when I thought I didn’t have it in me,” says Prakash, whose recent favourites include watching performances of Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen and checking out acting masterclasses from Natalie Portman. Though acting is on top of his mind now, music is not too far away either. GV Prakash’s recent outings as a composer includes biggies like Soorarai Potru and Thalaivi ; he has other exciting projects lined up. So, what’s his secret to cracking a hit tune? “The more simple a tune is, the further it will reach. This doesn’t mean usual; there is a thin line between usual and simple, and as composers, we need to reach that, and hope audiences like that.” Up next, he promises that he has a “stunning line-up of projects”. Apart from his two current releases, Prakash also has Selfie and Idimuzhakkam coming up. “To build this bank, I needed time to refine and evaluate myself, just like how I had to when I went through a low as a composer. After my debut musical outing Veyyil , I had a string of lows, before Aayirathil Oruvan picked things up. Subsequently, there was a lull before Aadukalam came along. It has been a graph, with ups and downs. But all that matters, at the end of the day, is your willingness to learn.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-modern-take/article37816610.ece
03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||A serving of food history||It is close to lunch when we reach Thanjavur. Just the right time to visit India’s first Food Museum, which promises to whet visitors’ appetites with the history of what we serve on our plates. The museum has been established by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) on the ground floor of its regional office, in collaboration with Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum, Bengaluru. Built at a cost of Rs. 1.1 crore, the 1,860 square feet museum uses technology like projection mapping, touch screens, proximity sensors, and radio frequency identification (RFID). Lesser-known history The choice of location is significant, since Thanjavur is also the birthplace of the FCI, with its first office opening here on January 14, 1965. Our visit begins with a seven-minute video shown on a projector wall, to learn about how humans went from being hunter-gatherers to food producers. As the film reveals, the manipulation and cultivation of certain plants by human beings around 10,000 years ago, when the effects of the Ice Age receded and temperate climate ensued, led to the domestication of these strains, sowing the seeds of agriculture as we know it today. A display in the adjoining space shows the evolution of granaries across the world. With the help of a sliding electronic reader, one can look up granaries built by the Romans, the mud rhombus of Niger, and even the gender-specific earthen structures in Mali. Closer home, the display talks about the granaries found in the temple complex of Srirangam, in the Badami fort and the Indus Valley. A section on pests shows the perils posed by borer insects that can hollow out grains during storage. The study of crop origins done by Russian botanist and geneticist Nikolai Vavilov (1887-1943) in the 1920s is explained in some detail in a dedicated display area, followed by an interactive map that shows the major grains, fruits and vegetables grown in India. Young visitors will have fun placing model ‘sacks’ of pulses fitted with RFID chips on a reader to see their characteristics pop up on the big screen. This is followed by a section on healthy diet, and an interactive food chart of India, where visitors can click on a State and watch recipe videos of two signature dishes from there. You can also find a life-size replica of a Public Distribution System (PDS) ration shop. A quick walk to an adjoining annexe shows us the journey of the grain, from the field to the procurement centres, and includes a scaled down replica of a silo bin. The dioramas are beautifully detailed, right down to the number plates of trucks and the bulge in the sacks of grain. Having spent so much time looking at food-related displays, visitors may be a bit disappointed to note that there is no restaurant on the premises to provide a tasty trimming to the tour.  The Food Museum is located at Nirmala Nagar, Thanjavur. Open Monday through Saturday, from 11am to 5pm.

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Twelve months, 12 tales||“Bolt was screaming in the middle of the road at 3 am,” Akshayaa recalls seeing her pet for the first time. It must have been difficult to spot the little black puppy in the predawn darkness. But his continuous screaming made Akshayaa send her brother to check on him and bring him home. It was not safe to leave him in the streets. Akshayaa already had two adopted indie dogs. So, her family did not intend to keep the newly rescued one with them. They reached out to someone who wanted a dog. But he was busy with the construction of his house. Which meant Akshayaa had to foster the pup for three months. “Within that time, he became the sweetest and the most energetic boy of the house,” says Akshayaa. Because of his rapid runs and relentless energy, they named him Bolt. “We got to know all of his characteristics and habits. When the time came, we couldn’t give him away. He had already become ours.” This story, featured for August in the Pawsome People Project’s charity calendar for 2022 takes a bittersweet turn. “Unfortunately, during the first lockdown, when he was two, he passed away from distemper. We want to keep him in our memories through his picture in this calendar,” says Akshayaa. Pawsome People Project’s second annual charity calendar has 12 such heart-warming stories — one for each month — of puppies and their pet parents. The A6-sized calendar with photos of the adopted dogs also comes with a small wooden stand. Pawsome People Project, started in 2019, has over 600 volunteers across five cities. In Coimbatore, they have collaborated with the Humane Animal Society for rescue and sterilisation activities.  To purchase the calendar, priced Rs. 300, visit pages.razorpay.com/calendar2022.

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Look out! Elephants crossing||On an inky black night, an elephant sets out to cross a railway track along a forest path. She has no idea of the train hurtling at a speed of over 80 km/hr towards her. The loco pilot, eyes on the nothingness ahead, suddenly notices lights along the track. The alarms in his head go off and he slows the train down. The lights mean only one thing: elephant movement on the tracks. He presses the horn several times and the elephant disappears into the forest long before she sees the train. This is an imaginary scenario, one that will hopefully play out in the near future. The three elephants — a tuskless male ( makhna ), a female, and a calf — that were run over by a Chennai-bound train on November 26 near Walayar in Coimbatore did not have such a system in place to save them. M Abraham Antony, a Coimbatore-based conservation photographer, rushed to the spot as soon as he heard of the accident. “I spoke to people who lived nearby who recalled what happened,” he says. “The calf was playful and positioned itself on the track. The makhna stood next to it and the mother was trying to get the baby to move.” How can such tragedies be averted? “A lot is in the hands of the loco pilot,” points out M Ananda Kumar, a scientist at Nature Conservation Foundation, a wildlife research and conservation trust based in Mysore. “He has to be sensitised about the areas he drives through and remember to slow down at stretches along elephant habitats,” he adds. Reducing the speed of a train which has multiple bogies attached to it might not be an easy task, given that it travels across multiple landscapes and elevations. A solution is to employ sensors that trigger lights along train tracks. “Loco pilots respond involuntarily to lights,” points out Ananda. “A system in which lights warn them of elephant movement will help them slow down and will possibly mitigate elephant deaths on tracks,” he says, adding, “The Railways and Forest Department should work with local NGOs and people to come up with such a system.” Ananda Kumar suggests that orange lights, for instance, be used for the purpose, in case red and green interrupt the railways’ signalling system. “We can have a one kilometre buffer for the loco pilot to get an intimation,” says Ananda. “We have engineers willing to cooperate to work on this sensor-based monitoring system that has the potential to save lives,” he explains, adding, “We cannot drive away elephants, but we can effectively use technology to reduce deaths on railway tracks. All that is needed is the right frame of mind to find a solution to the issue.” Two years ago, a project on similar lines was attempted at Rajaji National Park. Says Bivash Pandav, Director, Bombay Natural History Society: “The Wildlife Institute of India and Central Scientific Instruments Organisation carried out a pilot project deploying seismic sensors to warn loco pilots of elephant movement on railway tracks.” The study was successful, he points out. “The next phase of the project, that is, on how to transmit this signal to the loco pilot, is yet to be carried out,” he explains. Ideally, says Bivash, roads and railway lines should not cut through elephant habitats. But the already existing ones cannot be undone, and measures to reduce man-animal conflict are the need of the hour. Alongside such technology, he feels that a strong team should monitor elephant movement at sensitive areas. Meanwhile in Coimbatore, rail fences at stretches along the track between Kanjikode and Madukkarai to prevent elephant crossing, clearing of vegetation for better visibility of loco pilots, construction of elephant ramps to facilitate safer movement, are on the cards.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/look-out-elephants-crossing/article37816630.ece
03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||A senior citizen takes off||Thirty thousand feet above the ground, bored and hungry, if you are tucking into a cup of hot biryani or upma , you have Radha Daga to thank. This 79-year-old from Chennai started her ready-to-eat food business about a decade ago. Her brand, Triguni Eze Eats, is now available on IndiGo and Air Asia India flights, on Amazon and retail stores across the country, and in Singapore and Malaysia. “I don’t think like an entrepreneur. They look at generating revenues and profit and loss. I got into my business without thinking whether it will make money,” says Radha with a smile. While her current business came out of her love for cooking, she had got into her first business to help women. She set up her first business of textile import in 1987, in Chennai. “It was also started to create employment for women. It gave me pleasure to train people and to see that they were improving and living better, dressing better and eating better,” she says. By 2009, Radha was determined to get into the food business. On a holiday with her husband, in the US she stumbled upon a magazine that had an advertisement about ready-to-eat pasta. All one had to do was add hot water. The idea stuck with her. On her return to India, she thought: How about Cup-o-idli? She bought a dehydrating machine and found a chef who had worked with a flight kitchen. Together, they started working on idlis. But after months of trial and error, they realised some of the idlis were not hydrating properly with hot water. Radha gave up on the idlis and tried other combinations. The lemon rice and biryani were instant hits and set the company soaring, literally and figuratively. Ready-to-eat tamarind rice and upma followed. “The food is cooked the way normal food is prepared, and then it goes through a process [for dehydration and preservation] that I can’t disclose,” laughs Radha. Around that time, a representative of IndiGo airlines came across Triguni Eze Eats’ biryani in a cup and was excited to see it is ready to eat just by adding hot water — eight minutes is all it took. In 2012, IndiGo expressed interest in Radha’s product for their in-flight meals, but wanted her to work on the packaging to make it convenient for the crew. The airline is now her biggest client, buying 85% of her total production. Triguni Eze Eats produces their products as per orders, as they are particular about shelf life. “We have the capacity to pack 16,000 to 18,000 tubs a day. Before the first lockdown we were dispatching 13,000 tubs a day between the airline and the domestic market,” she says.  Upma , dal chawal , rajma chawal and biryani are the hot favourites. Upma and biryani are produced every day. Finding clients on land Last September, as lockdowns eased, she turned her focus on trains. Her new line has pongal sambar, moong dal khichdi and masala upma , priced at Rs. 85 for 230 grams (and 250 grams after rehydration). Meanwhile, other experiments are constantly on at the Triguni Foods factory in Thiruverkadu. “When I started this business at the age of 69, I did not want any debts,” says Radha. Things were going smooth till the demonetisation happened in 2016. It took time to recover. She had just managed to get back on the saddle, when the pandemic and lockdown hit last year. With air travel almost nil, and people staying at home and cooking themselves, her ready-to-eat meals were not on retail customers’ shopping lists. “For most people, the priority was ordering groceries, fruits and vegetables.” This added to the setback. “Pre-pandemic (2019-2020) our turnover was 16 crore. February and March 2020 were negative. 2020-2021 we closed at around 5 crore because both airline and markets picked up only after December 2020.” But since November 15, things are getting back on track. “I am dispatching one lakh tubs a week now. These go to IRCTC”, airlines, and are also in demand by travellers, and students,” says Radha. The reason she believes is the convenience and the fact that this is the closest thing to home food. Radha is now upbeat about the future, especially because she believes, “I have a good product.”  We have the capacity to pack 16,000 to 18,000 tubs a day.

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Skylab’: Director Vishvak Khanderao on how a fictional story emerged from incidents in Karimnagar in 1979||Vishvak Khandero, the debut writer-director of the Telugu film Skylab , grew up in Telangana’s Karimnagar. As a child, he would come across people named Skylab Reddy or Skylab Raju and his curiosity was piqued. He learnt from his elders of the looming fear of NASA’s space station Skylab crashing in the region in mid-July 1979. Decades later, he wrote a fictional comedy-drama set in Bandalingampally village, with the Skylab events as the backdrop. The film Skylab , scheduled to release in theatres on December 4, is co-produced by Nithya Menen. The ensemble cast includes Satya Dev, Rahul Ramakrishna, Vishnu Oi, Tulasi and Subbaraya Sharma, and Nithya Menen. Vishvak, 30, completed writing Skylab in 2016 and collaborated with his peers from the LV Prasad Film & TV Academy, Chennai. “In film school, I used to write dramas and thrillers. For my first feature, I was looking for a personal story that will have a wide appeal. I remembered my elders talking about Skylab and began research.” Skylab is falling The space station, which was expected to crash in the ocean south of Cape Town, South Africa, changed course and its debris was strewn across western Australia in July 1979. However, in the weeks preceding the crash, residents of Karimnagar and Nizamabad lived in fear of the space station crashing in their vicinity. Some took refuge in homes of their kith and kin in other cities. A few sold their homes and land at throwaway prices and left the region. According to reports, a near lockdown situation prevailed: “A few people vowed to name their children after Skylab if they survived the crash. Reports state that insurance to the tune of 36 crore was sold during the time,” says Vishvak. He describes the film as a comedy that has been treated like a musical. He and cinematographer Aditya Javvadi arrived at a cooler colour palette, moving away from the traditional reddish browns associated with Telangana. “I chose my grandmother’s village Bandalingampally for the story since it has a funny ring to it. The main characters are eccentric and the story not only explores what happens when the news of Skylab’s crash breaks out, but also the human psyche,” he says. Pitch a dream Through producer Prithvi Pinnamaraju, Vishvak pitched the story to Nithya Menen. During an elaborate narration that included research notes and a typewriter-themed musical composition (music by Prashanth Vihari) for her character of a small-town journalist, the actor asked Vishvak if he had found a producer who would stand by his vision. She also chipped in as co-producer. Formal training in cinema helped Vishvak learn the craft as well as find his direction. “I would watch everything from mainstream masala films to Mani Ratnam films, as well as films made by Krzysztof Kieślowski and other masters. I needed to find out what kind of stories I wanted to tell. Film school helped me in that process.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/skylab-director-vishvak-khanderao-on-how-a-fictional-story-emerged-from-incidents-in-karimnagar-in-1979/article37816611.ece
03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Sunny side up||When she is not shooting or winning global acclaim for her enviable body of work over the last two decades, Shefali Shah loves cooking and feeding her family and social circle. She loves being a host and also likes designing spaces. So when she thought of starting a hospitality business, she saw it as a cumulative opportunity to monetise from what she had been doing for free and out of her own liking. It gave birth to a buffet called Jalsa, launched last month in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. “I look at life as a celebration and that doesn’t necessarily mean going to a restaurant. Even at home, something needs to make you happy on a daily basis. That is where Jalsa comes from,” says Shefali Shah, while on her way back to a hotel in Maharashtra, where she is currently shooting. Shefali’s Instagram is filled with photos of her doing up the 7,000-odd sqft place, painting the walls and cooking some of her favourite food. From the prints, fabrics to cutlery, everything was chosen with careful precision; how much of a passionate venture is Jalsa? “Passion is an understatement,” she says with a laugh, “It is something I got obsessed with over time. I could have gotten a designer but you also got to keep budgets in mind. The more time I spent there I knew what I wanted the place to look like.” Whenever Shefali hosted an event, she always turned to her sister Neha Bassi who has been in the hospitality business for two decades. It was a “no-brainer” for her to collaborate with the sister. “Neha and her husband, Deepak, have been prolific whether it comes to food, service or presentation. So, it was a given that I wanted her,” says Shefali, adding that they offer not just quality food but an experience you would take home. The slogan for Jalsa, says Shefali, is “come, chill and be”. The menu was curated with that in mind... to cover an entire spectrum of customers from nine to 99. Jalsa offers a hodgepodge of Indian and international cuisines with 50-60 varieties, starting from kamrat , kachakeri to pastas and pizzas. The signature food is the nani wali dal , which is what Shefali’s children call their grandmother’s masala -free dal . Ultimately, Jalsa is all about fun dining. It offers a range of activities for customers, like palm reading, applying henna, pottery and dancing to garba . “By the end of the evening, I saw someone in their 70s, letting their hair down and dancing to garba and also joined the teenagers for a flash mob,” she says, explaining why she wanted Jalsa to be more of an experience.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/sunny-side-up/article37816606.ece
03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Game, set and match||For young boys and girls in North Chennai, football is more than just a game. “It is a tool for empowerment,” says Sukumar Thangaraj, a PhD scholar at the Department of Journalism & Communication, University of Madras. This tool, says the 29-year-old, ought to be used well. “There are so many football clubs in the area,” he says, speaking from his experience of extensive field research. “Some streets in Vyasarpadi have two to three clubs, affiliated to different political parties,” says Sukumar, adding that he wants to bring them together, and equip them with better understanding of the heft the game carries in their lives. “Players need to know of not just the job opportunities the game can offer; they need to ask tough questions, criticise structures that hamper their opportunities; understand the politics of the game,” he adds. With this in mind, Sukumar formed the Blacktown football club in August this year. The club will promote the game in North Chennai by providing a platform for players to not just play, but think as well. “As our first step, we adopted R Yamini, a Vyasarpadi football player who is in Class X,” explains Sukumar. With help from the Official Chelsea Football fans club (Tirupur), he managed to buy her a football kit last month, and hopes to pool in funds for her school fees. Plans are also afoot to create awareness on the game at Government schools by involving coaches such as N Thangaraj who founded the Slum Children Sports Talent and Education Development Society (SCSTEDS) in 1997. “He makes an hour of free tuitions compulsory if children are to play at their artificial turf,” says Sukumar. “This way, children develop discipline. And if they are to play for the State or district, they have to go to school or college,” he explains, adding that he also hopes to incorporate European football structures that he follows. While SCSTEDS is doing a lot of work in terms of encouraging children to play, its Corporation-constructed turf does not even have a changing room, points out Sukumar. “There is so much that has to change,” he says, “Right from inculcating confidence in children from the region to compete with those from outside.” Another of their small successes is helping get the winners of the 23rd Senior Women’s National Football Championship (2017- 2018), the recognition they deserve. “Jenisha Rani, media manager of Super Machans, one of the official fans clubs of Chennaiyin FC, also a friend’s friend, tweeted about the win,” he says. Soon, after several retweets by fans such as him, it reached Tamil Nadu’s Youth Welfare and Sports Development Minister Siva V Meyyanathan and the Government sanctioned Rs. 1.38 lakh per player.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/game-set-and-match/article37816615.ece
03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Add that crunch||“Hang in there, learn new skills, take the plunge,” says Ranjana Singhal of Cafe Totaram about her lessons learnt during the pandemic while dealing with upheavals in the food industry. She enters the e-commerce space with the launch of Snackwala, a range of seven North Indian savouries that can be bought online on her website www.cafetotaram.com “At 52, I am learning the nuances of aggressive social media marketing,” laughs Ranjana and offers me a sample of shakkarpara or toshe , a sweet roll. It is mildly sweet and the taste and texture reminds one of the South Indian badusha. “This sweet is a staple at North Indian weddings. They gift boxes of toshe along with wedding invites to friends and family. When I tasted an authentic toshe at a family wedding in Tiruppur, I tracked down the homepreneur and roped her in.” Ranjana calls herself a catalyst. “I identify talent, give them a platform, and as well as leverage my brand. If there is someone, for example, who makes the best hand-made murukku, I am ready to collaborate. I am working with another person who makes florentines.” Ranjana, who has been in the industry for two decades with two successful restaurants That’s Y and On The Go, says with Snackwala, she is taking baby steps in the online business. “It is a calculated risk. I wanted something niche and not compete with the bigger players. A product that has long shelf life, meets nutritional requirements, is freshly made, and packed beautifully. And, traditional North Indian savouries was an easy bet as I come from there.” Right now, Snackwala offers seven products including the laccha mathris , a layered crisp savoury bursting withajwainflavour that I enjoy with hot masala chai. There is also a sweet version, the milk mathri that comes with a hint of nutmeg and works as a dessert. And, an in-house special, the piri piri mathri , where the crispies are tossed in piri piri powder and mixed herbs. “I am working with our food technologists to try flavours like wasabi and cheese,” she explains. There arejeeracookies, dry fruitchivdaand Cafe Totaram’s delightful brookies, a happy marriage of cookies and brownies. The products are packed in food grade tins that come from Puducherry, and pouch packs that come with stickers of the product details. “For weddings, the stickers can be customised with photos of the bride and groom. I also want to use my doodling work, another skill which I picked up during the pandemic, to good use on the stickers. People can also order bespoke gift hampers online for any occasion. We customise it. I am reaching out to social media influencers to visit us and post their reviews out there. It’s been overwhelming. ” As the initial technical glitches have been ironed out, they are ready to go online from today. “The learning has been hands-on, even something like how to pack the products in master cartons complete with bubble bags.” What next? “Sell besan burfis online... and kick-start another new journey of learning.”  You can order snacks online at www.cafetotaram.com or Whats App 9360381511.

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||When Italian meets Japanese||How about a classic Italian risotto made with native sticky black rice or an umami pasta with miso, served fresh in Coimbatore? “It’s a great fusion of Italian and Japanese flavours and tastes,” describes Siddharth Sethi, one of the founders of The Cloud Kitchen Project (@cloudkitchenproject), a community first cloud kitchen based in RS Puram. Three friends, Pavithraa Priya, Dhiren Khturia and Siddharth, who share a common passion for food, came together to start this venture and offer an intimate culinary experience for patrons as well as themselves. The trio is a part of a growing tribe that is thriving in the delivery and takeaway space with novel business ideas. The domestic cloud kitchens market is expected to grow from $400 million in 2019 to $2 billion by 2024, as per a report by RedSeer Management Consulting. Cloud kitchens, called ghost or dark kitchens that serve only food deliveries, are leading from the front to bring about this change. Unlike brick-and-mortar restaurants, cloud kitchens do not have a dine-in facility. They take orders via apps — in-house or Zomato or Swiggy — and operate single or multiple food brands. Dee’s Cookhaus (@deescookhaus), located at Ram Nagar, offers Thai, Indonesian, Italian, and Sri Lankan gourmet food for lunch and dinner. Started by Deepika Kumaran in September last year, it has added a sub brand Crumble and Cookies for gourmet cookies. “With restrictions in dining, the cloud kitchen peaked during the pandemic. I converted the terrace of my house into a kitchen.” While pursuing her MBA in London, Deepika worked part time at an Indo-Mexican restaurant there. “The exposure and research helped me curate an international menu. People here are game to try Thai, Chinese, sushi or anything new. We are planning to introduce Turkish chicken kebabs, falafel wraps, and African jollof rice too.” While Siddharth and Pavithraa have graduated in Hospitality from ITC School in Manipal, Dhiren is a passionate cook. They have jointly done a few projects on consultancy earlier. Adds Pavithra, “People here always wanted something new but didn’t have access to. We have never done a South Indian menu till now and every week our experimental food is a sell out.” At Cloud Kitchen Project, every dish has a story behind it, they add. The team has so far executed more than 100 orders over a span of 35 weekend menus. “We get inspiration from our travel experiences and enhance it like the umami pasta or something shared by our employees who are from across India. One of our chefs is from a village nearKolkata where they slice down brinjals, coat them withbesan, fry like bhajiyas. Later, they roast onions directly on the flame, chop them, add mustard oil, lemon, coriander, and mix the brinjal pakoras . You will see this on our menu soon,” explains Siddharth. They come out with a new menu every Wednesday on Instagram and deliver dinner orders on weekends. Personal touch Networking and community is priority. “You cannot place an order without chatting with one of the founders. To enhance the experience, we came up with a brunch menu where the QR code on the brunch box opens a list of music that they can listen to in the background while they enjoy food.” Their Instagram page is buzzing with behind-the-scenes videos of what goes on in the 2,000 sq.ft kitchen. Says Siddharth, adding, “We want to build a community; a friendly space for restaurants, small businesses, vendors, farmers, and organic players to grow and help each other.” Along with new players, restaurant owners like William Fan and Wilson Fan, who have run China Valley and Ninhao restaurants for over two decades, ventured aggressively into the online deliveries space during the pandemic. Their Wills Cloud Kitchen doles out manchow soup, lippen chicken, chilli garlic rice, Thai basil noodles, sea food platter, the works. “We wanted to keep the business afloat and the staff engaged. We cannot depend only on food aggregators. We roped in local delivery guys too. People can set up a cloud kitchen with a budget between Rs. 2 lakh and Rs. 15 lakh. A clean, hygienic kitchen space is a pre-requisite. And, passion.” Agrees Lalitha Gowtham, founder and admin of Kovai Foodies, an online forum that tracks food trends across the globe. It has over 20,000 members. “Though cloud kitchens have been around, large and small players like homemakers see a booming business opportunity now.” The bigger picture Ranjana Singhal, who has been in the industry for two decades, says food aggregators play an important role, especially when you have to meet orders from multiple locations. She had to shut down two of her cloud kitchens while the existing one offers parathas, sandwiches, pizzas and pastas. “Finger foods like tikkas and burgers, and maybe biryani work well, especially among youngsters. With stringent FSSAI norms, there is also a reality check among hoe chefs.” The Cloud Kitchen Project has added a sub brand Van Dough Pizzas (inspired by Van Gogh!) that makes artisanal pizzas. “One thing we really miss is serving people, watching them react to our food, and the hustle and bustle of a packed dining hall,” says Dhiren, adding, “Dishes, flavour profiles, cuisines that work well become a separate brand. Like Van Dough, there will be many more. We also want to act as a platform for restaurants to help gauge the market, experiment with menus and help them build a brand. Currently, trial runs are on for a shawarma brand in Chennai.”    A growing tribe is thriving in the takeaway space with novel ideas||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/when-italian-meets-japanese/article37816645.ece

If you are lucky, you could catch a glimpse of forest birds like blue-capped rockthrush, resident flycatchers and maybe the migratory Indian pita that comes all the way from the Himalayas. “Every week, we have been visiting the lakes where we recorded migratory sandpipers, ducks and other resident birds like the purple swamphen. This week, we wanted to trek the hills to see forest birds,” says R Selvaraj, founder of CNS. Every year, between September and October, one can witness movement of birds in large numbers signifying the start of migration. While the shorebirds like waders and ducks, and raptors come from Siberia and Russia, birds like the European flycatcher, brown-breasted flycatcher, and barn swallow come from Europe.  “In the city, one can easily spot golden orioles and barn swallows often perched on electric lines,” adds Selvaraj. If you want to join them, reach Lawley Road Junction at 6.15 am on Sunday (December 5).  For details, call : 98422-61279. There will be two hours of birding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/birding-at-marudhamalai/article37816634.ece

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||It’s showtime||In a labyrinth of narrowing streets in T Nagar populated with small vendors, budget-friendly stores and textile businesses, lies a small but self-sufficient pocket of land where cinema once thrived. For anyone driving past T Nagar or taking a bus at the depot, it was tough to overlook the tall, welcoming film posters on the sideways. Located in the heart of the city, Krishnaveni Theatre was not just another old theatre in the ever-changing landscape, but the last surviving remnant of a bygone era. It is where some of our biggest superstars’ films — MGR’s Aayirathil Oruvan (1965), Rajinikanth’s Adutha Varisu (1983), Amitabh Bachchan’s Deewar (1975), Kamal’s Avvai Shanmugi (1996), Ajith’s Amarkalam (1999) and Vikram’s Sethu (1999) — have had an enviable run at the box office. Fresh start Yet, as they say in film lingo, the first half was good and the second half... not-so-much. Poor maintenance and a lacklustre effort to rebuild and recoup contributed to the theatre going to ruins in what was a cut-throat business. It resulted in a wake-up call and three years of renovation, which began in 2018. Rebooted as Krishnaveni Cinemas, it was reopened for business on Deepavali with Rajinikanth’s Annaatthe .  The transformation of Krishnaveni Theatre to Krishnaveni Cinemas at a time when single-screen theatres across the country are closing operations is, of course, inspiring. R.M. Somasundaram, the theatre’s current owner, says, “We have had this property for more than 50 years without proper maintenance. When we started the renovation process, we did not want to compromise on anything... we wanted to revive the business.” Krishnaveni Cinemas now boasts a new facade. The auditorium has an upgraded projector and sound system, with a capacity of 490 seats. We catch projectionist K.M. Kannan (who has worked with Krishnaveni for 32 years) at work during the interval of Sabhaapathy . Had we caught him a few decades ago, he would not have found time to chat; from setting up spools to changing film reels before and after the interval, his under-appreciated work was art itself. Thanks to today’s laser projection, all he needs to do is tap a button. “In those days, we studied for a year to get a licence to operate a film projector. Can you imagine all this was done by one person, the projectionist?” A colourful history For a theatre to have survived the various socio-politico-cultural changes in T Nagar over 75 years, Krishnaveni and people like Kannan are embers of the past. However, little is known and documented about its origin. According to its current owner, the theatre was constructed in 1946 and was run by Andhra Pradesh-based Krishnaveni. In 1968, S.M. Ramanathan Chettiar purchased the property from Kamala Theatre owner V.N. Chidambaram Chettiar. Since then, it has been manned by Ramanathan and his sister’s family. Coming from a family of yarn merchants, Ramanathan Chettiar was not a ‘movie’ person: he saw the theatre as an additional channel to monetise. Even at the height of business, profits were few, says Somasundaram. “Because my father didn’t come from a film background, he couldn’t adapt to the changes of the times. Plus, we didn’t put too much effort in providing theatrical experience then,” he says, adding, “now is the time to see profits, now that we have renovated it.” With an ageing building and fading paint, Krishnaveni Theatre was drifting away from collective memory. It hit a low point when the theatre started screening adult films and B-grade cinema. There were other complications as people began misusing the property. “I thought we shouldn’t encourage such behaviour, it was our name that was spoiled,” Somasundaram says. “There was a lot of interest in buying this property too. But we wanted to keep the family business afloat.” After his father’s demise in 2013, Somasundaram, an Agriculture graduate who is in the synthetic yarn business, took over. The renovation is both an image turnover and an attempt to recover lost business; distributors were still wary until Somasundaram convinced them of the new look. While Annaatthe and Sabhaapathy may not have drawn eyeballs, film events such as the recent Maanaadu audio launch ensured visibility among the film circuit. Somasundaram acknowledges the long road ahead. “The first step is to bring back the old charm. Right now, the goal is to make our presence felt.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/its-showtime/article37817098.ece
03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Behind bars, at home||House parties over restobars. Intimate gatherings over heaving dance floors, and an elevated home bar experience over over-priced cocktails at a restaurant. As life slowly crawls back to a new normal, parties at home are replacing gatherings at local bars. And as hosts cater to these new parameters, curated catering menus and home bar experiences have become the order of the day. Bartenders who were forced to go solo after food and beverage establishments were shut down due to pandemic restrictions, have found freelance bartending a liberating career detour. In Chennai, where bars recently opened their doors, after a protracted closure, bartenders have found new avenues to augment their incomes. Praveen Mohan, who worked at a bar in the IT corridor of the city, has taken on house parties since 2020, sometimes on the beach front, some at spacious apartments, where hosts wanted a restobar experience, but in a safer space. “In the beginning it was tough, but then our whole industry went through this churning, so we just soldiered on. I taught classes at a local bartending institute in T Nagar, did some flair bartending during the week and waited for the parties to pick up,” says Praveen. Back on their feet Post July 2021, parties at beach houses and other venues along East Coast Road and Puducherry have been keeping the city’s bartenders busy. Nalla Samy, from the Chennai Institute of Bartending, says his schedule has been packed since mid 2021. “Before the pandemic we took on at least 60 events per month and now that has shrunk to half that number. Events are smaller, with just 20 people and all safety precautions in place. Being a freelance bartender is slowly paying dividends again,” he says. On the West coast, Vasundhara Vats, who designs masterclass cocktail workshops for small parties, says the freelance life chose her even before 2020. “I lived in Mumbai for a bit, where I worked at Soho House, and then moved to Goa. When you’re working six nights a week till 2 a.m. at a bar, it doesn’t allow for any meaningful interactions with friends. You don’t get to enjoy the sunlight, brunches and everything else that really appealed to me. I had the luxury of quitting a full-time bartending career so I would work on my own terms,” she says. While Goa is the perennial party destination in the country, “monsoon months bring little work”, says Vats, who now caters to small parties at villas, where she curates DIY cocktail experiences, in a State blessed with a bouquet of fresh, floral and fruity ingredients. Her drinks are served with fresh mixers — syrups with lavender and chamomile, rose lemonade and floral tonics. “I decide my menu based on what I can find at Mapusa market — usually some luscious mulberry, passion fruit, and plenty of cucumber, which I think is the most underrated addition to a drink,” says Vats Home-grown spirits Abhirup Bhattacharyya, seasoned bartender-turned-brand ambassador for Maka Zai, a home-grown rum brand based out of Goa, says drinking habits have changed since 2020. “A large number of people have started mixing at home. This was mainly because of the pandemic, but it is slowly becoming part of a lifestyle,” he says, adding that they now want a refined drinking experience, with sophisticated cocktails fashioned from homegrown spirits. The gin resurgence in India, riding high on brands like Hapusa, Greater Than and Jaisalmer, among others, is pushing bartenders to experiment with their menus. Pierson Fernandes, school director, European Bartender School, Goa, describes their butterfly pea flower-infused gin, which on meeting citrus turns from blue to purple. “It’s a big hit with guests at house parties,” he says, adding that “Vodka has faded into the background, whisky sours are a hit, and the rums are used for mojitos.” Taking cocktails up a notch with homemade shrubs and syrups from scratch, and using substitutes like honey or jaggery instead of refined sugar, are par for the course for Sourav Singh who runs his bartending business in Kolkata, after stints across Delhi. As hosts look to offer their guests a customised experience at home, or a lavish suite at a hotel, the brief is simple — flair bartending meets a mindful approach to mixing drinks. Sourav prides himself over his zero waste operation. “These days we make a lot of Old Fashioned, using orange garnishes. As a result I have so much left over orange pulp, with which I make a drink — Houston we have a problem, where marmalade is mixed with Bourbon, citrus and topped with wheat beer.” From banquet halls, the party has now moved to penthouses. “I make sure the bartenders are dressed well for the occasion. We even tailor different sets of aprons and accessories to suit the ambience of a party,” says Sourav, adding that his staff comprises certified bartenders with over three years of experience at bars across big metros. Across Tier 1 cities, junior bartenders charge anywhere between Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 4,000 for a night. They bring their own garnishes, shrubs and syrups prepared from scratch, while glassware and other mixers are charged on actuals. Senior mixologists and flair bartenders command over Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 15,000 depending on the number of guests at a party and the kind of cocktails on the menu. The hosts always provide the alcohol. Sandeep Varma, founder and CEO, Institute of Bar Operations and Management, who has been in the business for over two decades in the Delhi-NCR region, says the pandemic was a wake-up call. “Suddenly, the big money events were few and far between. We had to take the virtual route and conduct cocktail workshops.” His bartending course has found willing takers across professions. “Some hotel management students do a bartending course and can take up a job as a full-time bartender or start their own business with a certification. But we found people from other backgrounds eager to become bartenders, so they could moonlight at house parties after a 9-5 job,” Varma says. In Chennai as well, professionals are looking at bartending classes to make money on the side, while learning a cool new skill. “My student bartenders — IT engineers — can make around Rs. 15,000 a month with a few events,” says Nalla Samy, explaining how quickly the market is expanding. He adds, “Also, it’s a change of scene from their day jobs!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/behind-bars-at-home/article37817099.ece
03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Game, set and match||For young boys and girls in North Chennai, football is more than just a game. “It is a tool for empowerment,” says Sukumar Thangaraj, a PhD scholar at the Department of Journalism & Communication, University of Madras. This tool, says the 29-year-old, ought to be used well. “There are so many football clubs in the area,” he says, speaking from his experience of extensive field research. “Some streets in Vyasarpadi have two to three clubs, affiliated to different political parties,” says Sukumar, adding that he wants to bring them together, and equip them with better understanding of the heft the game carries in their lives. “Players need to know of not just the job opportunities the game can offer; they need to ask tough questions, criticise structures that hamper their opportunities; understand the politics of the game,” he adds. With this in mind, Sukumar formed the Blacktown Football Club in August this year. The club will promote the game in North Chennai by providing a platform for players to not just play, but think as well. “As our first step, we adopted R. Yamini, a Vyasarpadi football player who is in Class X,” says Sukumar. With help from the Official Chelsea Football fans club (Tirupur), he managed to buy her a football kit last month, and hopes to pool in funds for her school fees. Plans are also afoot to create awareness of the game at Government schools by involving coaches such as N. Thangaraj who founded the Slum Children Sports Talent and Education Development Society (SCSTEDS) in 1997. “He makes an hour of free tuitions compulsory if children are to play at their artificial turf,” says Sukumar. “This way, children develop discipline. And if they are to play for the State or district, they have to go to school or college,” he says, adding that he also hopes to incorporate European football structures that he follows.

When Vineet conveyed the good news to his parents, they showered him with praise. “Please make mom and dad give me some presents,” Vineet said to himself. Then, staring at his parents, he chanted the magic mantra four times. “You are working so hard. I’m happy that you are taking your academics so seriously. Take these gift vouchers that my brother gifted me,” said his mother, giving him an envelope. “Buy whatever you want. You have made us so proud,” his father smiled. “You can take the car tomorrow to the mall.” “Thank you dad and mom,” Vineet hugged his parents. “You are the best.” Shopping or homework? The next morning, after Vineet finished his breakfast, he rushed into his room to change for his shopping trip. Seeing the books piled haphazardly on his desk, he groaned. The teachers had given his class a lot of weekend homework. If he completed it, he would have no time to visit the mall. “Now what do I do?” he thought. Hearing the sound of laughter from his sister Richa’s room, he peeped in. She was laughing at something along with her friends. Vineet had an idea. He walked into the room, with all his books in his arms, chanting the magic mantra under his breath. “You are wasting time watching a movie, why don’t you do something useful,” Vineet told them. “What do you want us to do?” one girl asked. “Help me with my assignment,” Vineet said, dropping his Biology, Geography and English assignments before the girls. Richa and her friends stared at him. Vineet chanted the mantra again. The expression on their faces changed. Slowly, Richa extended her hand and pulled the Biology assignment towards her. The other two girls completed his Geography and English assignments. A good time Vineet sat in his father’s car, humming a tune, as it sped over the smooth roads. “Now, while I shop, Richa didi and her friends will complete my assignments.” After eating two ice-creams in the mall, Vineet went to the gaming centre and spent two hours. After shopping for an hour, he returned home. The girls had completed all his assignments. And that too neater than him. They had even made notes for the book he was supposed to read in the weekend.  To be continued   If he completed it, he would have no time to visit the mall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/vineets-magic-mantra-a-substitute-is-found/article37817263.ece
03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||A midnight stroll||The tourist season in the little hill town had its pros and cons. For Moorthy and his ilk, it meant more business, as the restaurant he worked in was always full. But, on the downside, it also meant a lot of work. This Friday did not seem any different. Except that more people were coming in and the small lobby was filled with people waiting to be seated. Lunch was over only by 4.00 p.m. and then preparations began for dinner. The people, tired and irascible, came in after a long hard day of sightseeing and walking. The climate in the Nilgiris was unpredictable and so most of the visitors were either wet or cold. Heading home When the last customer had left, Moorthy and the other waiters heaved a sigh of relief. It was close to midnight when they finished up and cleaned the restaurant, set the tables for the next day, and wound up their work. They came out, exchanged funny anecdotes about the day and got on their motorcycles eager to get into their warm beds. As Moorthy started up, he felt the cold breeze against his face. He shivered as he zipped up his jacket and put on his woollen cap before he put on his helmet. A grey mist was swirling up from the valley. “I must get home before the mist gets thicker and obscures visibility,” he thought. He zoomed through the dark, quiet streets. There was not a soul in sight. The moon stayed hidden behind a cloud and the cold wind whipped his face and he shivered. A figure in white As he approached the park, he saw a figure of a man clothed in white walking ahead. “Poor man, I suppose his vehicle broke down and he has to walk home,” thought Moorthy. “Let me offer him a lift.” He came closer and when he was alongside he asked, “Sir, would you like a lift?” The man however did not answer, instead looked steadily ahead and walked on giving the impression he had not heard. The man’s face seemed obscured in the luminescent grey of the mist. Not wishing to hang around Moorthy accelerated and zoomed off. All he could think of was the warmth of his house and the comfort of his bed. He turned a corner and, to his surprise, up ahead he saw the same man. A chill went down his spine. He slowed his bike and looked fully into the man’s face. To his utter surprise, he found that the face was ill-defined and hazy. His eyes alone glowed…a fiery red, like live coals. He had no feet, instead glided forward barely touching the ground  There was not a soul in sight. The moon stayed hidden behind a cloud...||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/a-midnight-stroll/article37817271.ece
03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Magdu and her mirror||Magdu had a question for her mirror. “Mirror, mirror, on the wall, am I beautiful at all?” The mirror stared back at her; silent, nervous, glum. That morning at her school (Saligao Scholars), Miss Ezilda had announced that she would soon select children for this year’s play: The Beautiful Princess of Hearts . Magdu longed to be the Beautiful Princess. Ideas of beauty But what did one actually need, to be ‘beautiful?’ She should first make sure… Grandma was oiling her silvery hair on their balcao (porch in many Goan houses). “Grandma, what’s ‘beautiful’?” “O-ho, Magdu, all your questions … Hair that’s long. Thick. Shiny!” Dressing her tresses Magdu spotted a broom in a corner. She pulled out and tied a bunch of gleaming bristles to her hair. Ufff! Her head felt heavy. But what if Grandma were wrong? Mama was busy at her sewing machine, singing “I’ve got a brand-new dress, I’m gonna look my best.” “Mama, what’s beautiful?” “Hair!” (Phew.) “Short, bouncy hair!” declared her mother. Uh-oh! So to be safe, Magdu cut a few bristles on her head in half. They stuck out at odd angles, the rest trailing behind. “Beautiful, I’ve found… is small, cuddly, round,” crooned Mama. Round? Was she round enough? She spied a bowl of mangoes. Magdu stuffed them down her belly till they filled her out. Now she had a squishy mango-ringed tummy. Ooh! They felt cold. And her tummy felt as heavy as her head. Was this beautiful enough? Ramu had come to help his father bring down coconuts from the trees in their garden. He’d been watching, puzzled. “Tcha. You can’t fool the mirror,” he said. What did he know? “Ey Kaku,” she called out to Ramu’s father whose legs were hugging the tree trunk, “What’s beautiful?” “Strong and slender!” Oops. Round or slender? Unsure, she removed half the mangoes. Some were beginning to ooze. Yuck. “Add colours,” advised Ramu. “Bright-bright colours.” From Mama’s cupboard tumbled out pattern books and thread, buttons and ribbons. Magdu twisted ribbons down her bristly hair. Orange. Purple. Red. They tickled! One last check … Papa was trimming his moustache. “Papa, what’s beautiful?” “Dark and dashing.” Uhhh-Ohhh! Colourful or dark? Couldn’t people make up their minds? She kept on the ribbons, but darkened her face with Mama’s kohl stick. Her cheeks itched. “Tall and dark, you can make your mark,” said Papa to his reflection. Tall? Hadn’t Mama said small? Confused, Magdu clambered onto her mother’s high-heels. Ow! Her head, stomach and heels hurt…but she felt ready to ask her question. What did she see? She stumbled back to her room, calling “Mirror, mirror…” Then she came face to face with her bristly-feathery-mangoey- tottery reflection. “Ha-haa.” She laughed until the tummy-mangoes rolled out and she rolled on the floor with them. “Look,” said Ramu, picking up ribbons to make a cockerel’s comb and tail. “Kukudukoooo.” “My turn,” said Magdu, holding up a mango-nose and making her ‘funny face’. “I’m a clown.” Coconuts and ribbons, bristles and buttons... a treasure trove of props lay strewn about. Magdu tried them out, spinning around; a new ‘face’ for the mirror with every turn. “I’m a parrot,” she said. “Can you become a pirate?” What fun! They chuckled and squealed. Everyone came running to see what the commotion was about. “Magdu, look!” cried Mama pointing to the mirror. When Magdu looked, and pulled new ‘faces’, she saw she could be whoever she chose to be. Why worry about the play? She — Magdu — could act out any role in style. When everyone else looked at her reflection, here’s what they saw. The mirror was glowing. It smiled back at Magdu. Sunny, sassy, strong. It was… “Beautiful!” they chorused.  “The Beautiful Princess of Hearts.” Magdu longed to be the Beautiful Princess.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/magdu-and-her-mirror/article37817294.ece
03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Flight of a maple seed||Hanuman and Nala are hanging out together and having a chat.  Hanuman: Nala, last night I dreamt about a strange kind of flying machine.  Nala: Interesting! Tell me more…  Hanuman: It had some rotating blades, moved upward but not like a rocket.  Nala: Ah... I got it! Come with me... Nala takes Hanuman to a maple plant and points to its seed.  Nala: Did the flying machine look like this?  Hanuman: Yes, but upside down. I might have seen these seeds earlier. May be that’s why I had this dream. But how can any machine fly like the one in my dream?  Nala: It can! It is called the aerial screw or helicopter mechanism.  Hanuman: What is that?  Nala: To know about this, we need to look into future. My dad Vishvakarma’s book can help us. It can take us to a technology any time in the future or past and help us access the fourth dimension time.  Hanuman: What is that?  Nala: I’ll explain that later. Now, come on, let’s travel to 1480; a time when Leonardo da Vinci, the famous polymath lived.  Hanuman: What does polymath mean?  Nala: It means the person knows a lot about many subjects and can combine the knowledge.  Hanuman: Oh!  Nala: da Vinci was an artist, architect, engineer and mathematician. He made drawings of various flying machines, one of which is famously called the aerial screw. See this...  Hanuman: Oh! This actually looks like an inverted screw but made of cloth!  Nala: When you use a screw on wood or a wall, the metal pierces throw the solid object and holds tights. But, to fly, the object needs to be light and hold on to the air. That is why lightweight materials are used. Nala then turns to 1939 in the book and points to the world’s first commercial helicopter.  Hanuman (jumping with excitement): This is the flying machine I saw in my dream!  Nala: So what you saw was the first vertical flying aerodyne machine, made by Igor Sikorsky, the father of modern commercial helicopters.  Hanuman: But it looks different from da Vinci’s model?  Nala: da Vinci’s model is conceptually correct but, in reality, it is heavy. A fan’s blades titled at an angle of 5-10 degrees will do same job as that of a screw.  Hanuman: Oh!  Nala: Do you want to make one and see for yourself?  Hanuman: Of course! Using maple seeds?  Nala: Ha ha! No! Using paper.  (See the Paper Helicopter instructions)   Hanuman: Before we start, tell me, why are maple seeds in this shape?  Nala: These are called maple helicopter seeds or winged seeds because the seeds are attached to the wings (leaves). When the wind blows, the seeds fly far away from the tree so that they can spread out and grow in newer areas. After making the paper helicopter, Hanuman wonders what to do with it...  Nala: Throw it up. When Hanuman does that, it spins like a helicopter and falls down.  Hanuman: Wow! It works like an aerial screw!  Nala: You know what, in the future, almost every house will have this aerial screw inside their house.  Hanuman: A helicopter in every room? Nala points to another page in the book.  Nala: It’s called the ceiling fan. It’s an aerial screw attached to the ceiling. So, instead of flying away, it pushes the air down.  Hanuman: The concept is the same but the application is different.  Nala: So, now let me explain about the fourth dimension...  Hanuman: No, not now! I want to play with my helicopter. Hanuman plays with his toy without realising that this idea would help him save a life sometime in the future.

Whena stone and a piece of paper fall from the same height, which will hit the ground first? The stone, of course! But that is not the case in a vacuum. A vacuum is a space in which there is no matter — air particles. This means there is no resistance to the falling objects. When two objects — be it a spoon and a car — fall from the same same height, at the same location, the only force acting on them is gravity, so they will always have the same speed.  If humansevolved from monkeys, why aren’t the monkeys evolving into humans any more?  Modernchimps have been around for longer than modern humans. If we evolved from the monkeys why are they still around? It’s because monkeys and humans share a common ancestor from whom both species evolved around 25 million years ago. This finding has been supported by fossil record and DNA analysis. This means, our last common ancestor is someone like a great-greatgrandmother who had only two living descendants, both of whom went on different evolutionary paths.

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||A rare amalgam||Natya Tarangini, the dance school of veteran Kuchipudi dancers Raja-Radha and Kaushalya Reddy, celebrated the 25th year of its Parampara festival. To mark the silver jubilee, the annual festival of music and dance that celebrates the guru-sishya parampara featured a unique music and dance jugalbandi by Pt. Madhup Mudgal and his daughters, Sawani and Arushi Mudgal. The Mudgal Parivar Parampara was mirrored through an imaginatively conceived repertoire comprising musical forms such as Dhrupad, Khayal, Thumri, and Tarana and their poetic interpretation through Odissi. Born to Pt. Vinay Chandra Maudgalya, the multifaceted Madhup Mudgal, musician, musicologist, composer, writer, founder principal of Delhi’s Gandharva Mahavidyalaya, and founder-director of the Gandharva Choir, grew up with music all around him. His two daughters have had the same sort of upbringing Rich in melody The evening began with the melodious strains of raag Multani along with the invocatory shloka ‘Varnamam, artha-sanghanam rasanam chhandasam api’, sung by Pt. Madhup Mudgal in Dhrupad Ang Alap, and Arushi opening by dancing to ‘Gam ganpataye namah’ and the virutham-like Kavitta. The following Dhrupad composition ‘Jai ganapati gananam’, set to Chautal of 12 beats cycle, enhanced the rhythmic syllables of the mridang.  The two abhinaya pieces in Brajbhasha, choreographed and presented by Arushi were Dwar and Shyama, composed by Pt. Madhup Mudgal and Sawani respectively. Dwar had interesting dialogue between Radha and Krishna based on Shlesh and Vakrokti where the same word conveyed different meanings. Dwar was followed by Shyama, where after the blissful moments of union the Swadheenpatika Radha playfully exhorts Krishna to reverse roles with the Yaman bandish of Kunvar Shyam “Shyam tori bansuri nek bajaun”. The complete merging of Radha with her beloved depicted through ‘Shyam Shyam ratat pyaari, aap hi Shyam bhai’ was delightful. The Hindol tarana composed by Pt. Madhup Mudgal and performed by all three collectively, was the perfect choice for ‘Aikya’ (oneness), the concluding piece. Accompanied by a set of competent musicians — Srinivas Satpathi (flute), Kharak Singh (pakhawaj), Gurbhej Singh (tabla), Chetan Nigam (harmonium), Kushal Sharma (tanpura and vocal support), the Mudgals explored the state of oneness through abstract music and movement. The tarana moved from slow to medium to fast tempo with avirbhav and tirobhav of other raags. The visual poetry etched delicately by Arushi dancing to the graceful tarana by Madhup and Sawani gradually reached a crescendo where music and dance became one, leaving the audience spellbound.  The Delhi-based author   writes on classical arts.

03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Finding his voice||It was a life-changing moment for Hindustani musician Rumi Harish when he met transgender activist and writer A. Revathi. She asked him what he did for a living and he told her he was a classical vocalist. When Rumi found that Revathi had heard classical music only on Doordarshan during state mournings, he spoke about Pt. Bhimsen Joshi and rendered a bandish for her. Rumi narrates this experience during the dramatic reading of a play titled Journey from A to E and More for reFrame, an initiative that aims to disseminate artistic efforts that respond to contemporary challenges. Interspersed with strikingly diverse lines ranging from Amir Khusro’s poems to L.R. Eswari film songs, the play explores Rumi Harish’s musical journey along with his experiences as a queer transgender man. The online play also focuses on how years of musical training shaped Rumi’s life and principles. He makes a pertinent point about classical music — while pitch is definite, microtones are indefinite and variant. He recalls the words of eminent Hindustani musician Pt. Dinkar Kaikini, who felt that a heightened sense of awareness is necessary to recognise the microtones between two swars. Rumi construes this awareness as being sensitive and conscious, not only in music, but also in one’s choices, work and ethics. Rumi is, after all, one of the few classical musicians who is actively involved in creating awareness about gender and sexuality. He credits R. Sunil Mohan, his friend and associate of two decades, for helping him with the playscript. A fellow trans man, Sunil has been instrumental in making Rumi write about his experiences, in addition to working with him tirelessly on crisis intervention and exploratory studies on sexual minorities. Although Rumi learnt music from many gurus such as Pt. Yeshwanth Bua Joshi, Pt. D.S. Garud and Pt. Indhudhar Nirody, his lessons from Late Pt. Ramarao Naik left a lasting impression. Pt. Ramarao, under whom Rumi trained for 17 years, would narrate stories that critically examined hierarchies in art, deriving inspiration from people from different walks of life. Rumi recalls how Ramarao admired the rich vocal textures of street vendors who use their voices constnatly but without strain. He credits Ramarao for encouraging him to sing anywhere — from garbage segregation centres to sex workers’ settlements. When asked to explain this approach, Rumi quotes Sunil: “While raags are built with ascending and descending swars, they are all situated next to each other on a harmonium. In a world with vertical stratification, horizontal vision and imagination is a revolution”. Rumi regards his mother Kanaka Murthy as a great influence. Kanaka, who passed away recently, was a well-known sculptor of temple iconography. Despite facing hurdles as a woman temple sculptor, she won many awards including the Karnataka government’s Rajyotsava Award. Rumi remembers her as a force to be reckoned with, especially when it came to shattering gender norms. “She wore pants, rode horses, and fell in love with stones and statues!” he says. Rumi was 47 when he opted for gender-affirming surgery (commonly known as medical transition). His entire family was against it, but Kanaka stood by him. Quoting a Allama Prabhu vachana, ‘Bayalu bayalene’, which says the pre-requisite for self-realisation is staying true to oneself, Rumi feels that ‘coming out’ for a transgender person is merely a social formality. Memorable performance Rumi believes caste and gender conditioning play a great role in how classical musicians are expected to perform and present themselves. By the time he was 35, he had started wearing gender-neutral clothes. Although Rumi has performed at several venues across the world from the age of 12, one performance in Bengaluru is etched in his memory. “It was in remembrance of Gangubai Hangal. I had sung the raags Purya, Khamaj and Kamod. One music ‘connoisseur’ approached me and said that my music was fantastic but it would have been better if I had worn a sari. Women musicians are expected to sing with minimal gesticulation and comport themselves in a subdued way, attired in traditional silk saris and gold jewellery.” Rumi finds the voices of vocalists like Zohrabai Agrewali and Mallikarjun Mansur fascinating and was constantly in search of his own voice. Until his teacher Ramarao Naik told him his voice was whoever he was. The process of medical transition is difficult for transgender people; for trans men, a lot of anxiety is associated with the cracking of the voice and the subsequent change in pitch. With medical transition opening up new avenues for his voice and art, Rumi’s search resumes, for a strong trans voice uninfluenced by gender conditioning. As Rumi’s guru, Pt. Sudhindra Bhaumik works with him to accommodate the changes in his vocal pitch. Rumi too has been experimenting with genres as well as music direction for films. He also works closely with theatre personalities and writes plays.  Rumi will be performing Journey from A to E and More online on December 11 at Reel Desires, Chennai International Queer Film Festival, organised by Goethe-Institut, Chennai with NGO partners.   The writer is a rasika of   classical music and dance and also plays the veena.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/finding-his-voice/article37816605.ece
03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||Art and the environment||Strong concept, seamless music, skilful lighting, and well-choreographed movements, every aspect of Praveen Kumar’s new production ‘Rtu - Vismurti’ (Seasons Forgotten), commissioned and presented by Colorado Fine Arts Association, was brilliantly woven together. The work focused on the contemporary issue of climate change and its effects on human lives through Kalidasa’s masterpiece Rtusamhara, where the seasons are used as metaphor to express human emotions and portray flora and fauna. The production travels across time by presenting scenes from a bygone era and from the present. And in the process talks about the damage we have done to the environment. The music synchronised beautifully with the hand gestures. For instance, the dancer opened each finger to a swara to depict a lotus in full bloom, bees hovered to the sound of the morsing, and birds flew to the melody of the flute. R. Raghuram’s musical score enhanced the visual experience in full. “Once I zeroed in on the idea, the musicians and I had several sessions of discussion before we arrived at what worked best for each sequence. The whole process was extremely enjoyable,” said Praveen. Besides the lyrics chosen from Rtusamhara , additional script and composition were by Arjun Bhardwaj. Praveen also made good use of the digital platform, interpolating images of the poet writing or questioning the elements with dance movements in the same frame. “Unlike a physical performance, you need to think of the perfect angles, close-ups, editing, juxtaposing images, and more. So you have to work in close association with the cameraperson and editor (Arjunjith). T.Nagaraj’s lighting design highlighted the mood of the sequences. Well-imagined poses The nritta segments were marked by clarity, grace and well-imagined poses. The musical ensemble was led by R. Raghuram, whose bhava-filled singing was engrossing. On the flute was Mahesh Swamy and on the mridangam and morsing was Lingaraj. Hemalatha was on the cymbals. ‘Rtu - Vismurti’ was an engaging performance that stood out for its visual imagery, but the subject of climate change and its impact needs to be handled in a more dramatic manner, and that’s one reason why it didn’t quite strike a chord emotionally.  The Chennai-based reviewer writes on classical dance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/art-and-the-environment/article37816598.ece
03 December 2021||December 03 2021 00:00 IST,||A record of L-P’s journey||It’s very difficult to review a book that takes so many pages to say so little. And that too about musicians who created music that still swirls around in our memories like the aroma of mulled wine. The book is titled Music by Laxmikant-Pyarelal, so one expects some new insight, a heightened understanding of what inspired their unending fount of melodies, in film after film, decade after decade. L-P, as they are popularly known, outdid every other composer of Hindi film music in the sheer number of hits they produced. But the book mainly spends itself on a litany of their songs. Every chapter has a lineup of movie titles and songs, the hurdles, the breakthroughs, then the period when the musicians came into their own. Sure, there are some nuggets. For instance, we learn that the boys, Pyarelal (son of Pt. Ramprasad Sharma) and Laxmikant, avid student of the violin, were friends, who played at lunch time when working for the then popular composer C. Ramachandra. We get glimpses of the boys eating vada pav together in the studio canteen... then, nothing. These maddening dropoffs continue. Blockbuster hits After their initial struggle, the duo delivered two blockbuster hits. First was Parasmani , whose refreshing music was more successful than the film, followed by Dosti . The music-makers had arrived. But there is no subsequent analysis of their career. There is a mention of how Lata Mangeshkar recognised the young Lakshmikant’s talent and recommended him to music directors. There is also actor Jeetendra talking about the huge contribution L-P made to his career. There is reason to believe that author Rajiv Vijaykar was on more than nodding terms with the composers; he mentions interviews and meetings; but we gain nothing from that fact. Instead, he leans heavily on presenting the names of every film the hit duo made music for. The one advantage is that as the text drags on, these memorable numbers play in the minds of the readers. It’s great to revisit compositions such as ‘Bade miya deewane’ from Shagrid , ‘Ek pyar ka nagma hai’ from Shor, and ‘Ram Kare’ from Milan . We are also reminded of how some of songs like ‘Mast baharon ka main aashiq’, ‘Tumse aye haseena’ and ‘Baar baar yeh din aaye’ became a rage. The duo’s music for Rishi Kapoor’s debut Bobby helped revive R.K. Films. Each reader will have his or her own L-P favourites. The sheer variety of the output and its consistent high quality cannot be denied, but the book, even as it mines these musical gems, fails to explore what made these songs so successful. Vijaykar touches on L-P’s individual style of working, and why unlike other duos it’s difficult to make out who would have created which number. This underlines the perfect synchrony of thought and energy they enjoyed. So it comes as a surprise to learn that there was a brief period when they fell out, but again, the details are absent. An important chapter on the enduring relationship between lyricist Anand Bakshi and L-P doesn’t delve into the collaboration. Sadly, the book is a case of information overload with little style or substance. Vijaykar’s text ends half way through the book. The rest is a compilation of interviews with those who have worked with L-P or have known them. There are some stories here, but even they have to be mined out. And one wishes there were more. The Mumbai-based writer is former editor of Femina and consulting editor, Penguin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/a-record-of-l-ps-journey/article37816589.ece
