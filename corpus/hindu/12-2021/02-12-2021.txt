02 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Omicron scare grounds international flight plan||The Union Government on Wednesday cited concerns over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and indefinitely postponed the full resumption of scheduled international flights from December 15. This means international flights will continue to operate on a smaller scale and only with 31 countries with which India has air bubble agreements. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation said, “In view of the evolving global scenario with the emergence of new variant of concern, the situation is being watched closely in consultation with all the stakeholders and an appropriate decision indicating the effective date of resumption of scheduled commercial international passenger services shall be notified in due course.” The Union Health Ministry said six COVID-19 positive cases were reported from 11 international flights from “at-risk” countries on Wednesday — the first day of stricter testing norms kicking in. This includes four passengers who arrived in Delhi. The Maharashtra Government has issued strict guidelines for international passengers, requiring all those arriving from “at-risk” countries from December 3 to undergo mandatory institutional quarantine for a week. The State also said that all international passengers must compulsorily undergo an RT-PCR test on arrival, and domestic passengers headed to the State must be allowed to board a flight only if they carry a negative RT-PCR test report with them. Following this, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to the State Government to “align orders” with the guidelines issued by the Union Health Ministry to ensure their uniform implementation across all the States.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/international-flights-take-off-plan-on-hold/article37799372.ece
02 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||GST collections surge in November||Gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections hit Rs. 1,31,526 crore in November, the second highest since it was implemented in July 2017, and the second month in a row that collections have crossed Rs. 1.3 lakh crore. The revenues for November were 25% higher than that in the corresponding month last year and 27% over the pre-pandemic levels of 2019-20. Economists, however, said the November collections, reflecting transactions undertaken in October, were underwhelming in the context of the record generation of e-way bills during October. Tax collections from import of goods were 43% higher, while revenues from domestic transactions, including import of services, were 20% higher than the respective collections in November 2020. The Union Finance Ministry also revised downwards GST collections for the first three months of 2021-22, starting with the record revenues of April that were originally reported as Rs. 1,41,384 crore. As per the data shared on Wednesday, those collections have now been pared by Rs. 1,676 crore to Rs. 1,39,708 crore. Similarly, the collections for May were revised by Rs. 4,888 crore to Rs. 97,821 from the Rs. 1,02,709 crore reported earlier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gst-collections-surge-in-november/article37799375.ece

Taking a potshot at the Congress, Ms. Banerjee said she, along with others, “is ready to fight against the BJP, but she cannot do anything if someone is not willing to fight”. Ms. Banerjee, who is on a three-day visit to Maharashtra, met Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar at the latter’s residence in Mumbai. Speaking after the meeting, Ms. Banerjee said, “I believe that a strong alternative needs to be raised against the fascism growing in the country. It cannot be done alone. Whoever is stronger, wherever, should do it. Sharad ji is the senior-most leader with whom I have worked and that’s why I have come to hold discussions with him.” The Trinamool chief had met Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut on Tuesday. Mr. Pawar was, however, more cautious in his reply on whether the Congress would be dropped from a united front against the BJP. “There is no question of omitting anyone. We are talking about taking everyone along. Whoever is ready to work hard and ready to join hands with others will be taken along,” he said. Asked about the UPA and whether Mr. Pawar should lead it, Ms. Banerjee retorted: “Which UPA are you talking about?” “There is no UPA,” she added. Mr. Pawar, explaining the reason behind the meeting , said they discussed national politics and the need to form a strong alternative front. “ Her intention is to set up a collective leadership platform by bringing like-minded people to provide strong alternative to the BJP. This platform should be established before 2024 elections..,” Mr. Pawar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/there-is-no-upa-now-says-mamata/article37799255.ece
02 December 2021||New Delhi,||Why should we apologise, ask 12 MPs||The impasse between the Opposition and the Government over the suspension of 12 MPs from the Rajya Sabha continued as neither side was willing to concede any ground. The Government wants the “errant” MPs to apologise unconditionally on the floor of the House. On the first day of the sit-in at the Mahatma Gandhi statue on Parliament premises, the MPs said it was for the Government to apologise for undermining parliamentary democracy. The Rajya Sabha saw four adjournments on Wednesday, each time after Opposition leader Mallikarjun Kharge sought to raise the suspension issue. The Opposition parties held another round of meeting at Mr. Kharge’s residence in the evening to discuss the strategy ahead. The Trinamool was invited, but kept away. According to sources, the suspended MPs will continue their protest and simultaneously, the issue will be raised in the House. Congress MP Syed Naseer Hussain said, “What should we say sorry for? Parliament is meant to raise the issues concerning the people of the country. Parliament is meant for debate, discussion and dialogue. Do you think we need to apologise to the Government for asking questions?” The leaders said the suspension would help the Government to bring in more controversial Bills. Suspended CPI(M) Rajya Sabha floor leader Elamaram Kareem said the BJP Government found itself in a tough spot with many of its erstwhile allies and supporting parties deserting them. “Now the Opposition strength is less. That was deliberately done and has eased some of BJP’s pressure and now they can bring Bills and get them passed easily,” he added. “The way the Leader of Opposition is disregarded, to put it mildly, by the Chair is unprecedented,” Congress MP Jairam Ramesh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-should-we-apologise-ask-12-mps/article37799283.ece
02 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Tighter curbs prove costly for flyers||As stricter testing norms at airports for international arrivals kicked in from Wednesday, passengers from “at-risk” countries had to brace for massive queues, long waiting time for test results and missed connecting flights. Their only way out was to pay for the expensive Rapid PCR test that cost up to Rs. 4,500 — nearly nine times the regular test. “I reached Delhi on Wednesday morning from Spain via Amsterdam. The Delhi airport was in complete mayhem. I had booked an RT-PCR test online, but I still had to stand in a long queue at the airport and then I was told that I would have to wait up to 48 hours for the test result,” a young woman passenger told The Hindu . She ultimately opted for the Rapid PCR test for which results take about an hour and ended up paying Rs. 3,900. Yet, it took her two hours to complete various formalities and exit the airport. “What a money-making racket. If the report can be delivered in one hour, why six hours for others,” she asked. According to the latest guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, all passengers arriving from “at-risk” countries have to undergo an RT-PCR test on arrival and have to wait for the report before exiting the airport and catching a connecting flight. Most airports offer passengers RT-PCR tests and Rapid PCR tests. While the former costs Rs. 500 a test, the latter costs Rs. 3,000 at the Bengaluru airport, Rs. 3,900 at the Delhi airport and Rs. 4,500 in the Mumbai airport. The waiting time for the former is up to six hours, which can get extended if there is a rush, and the latter up to a hour and a half. But the chaotic scenes awaiting international passengers, particularly those from “at-risk” countries, mean most are forced to dig deep into their pockets. On Wednesday morning, the number of passengers who undertook the costlier test at the Delhi airport was four times of those who opted for the cheaper test. “A total of 1,013 passengers from four “at-risk” flights successfully completed arrival formalities due to the availability of the Rapid PCR test along with the RT-PCR test. A total of 792 passengers decided to take the Rapid PCR test and 221 opted for the RT-PCR test,” said the Delhi airport in a tweet. Lack of social distancing There were also concerns about lack of social distancing and missed connections. “I arrived this morning from London and it was a scary and anxious stay at the airport. All they are concerned about is RT-PCR [tests] and absolutely no compliance to general rules like social distancing and ensuring everyone wears a mask. Horrifying,” said Prachi Saraswat on Twitter. “Flying with KLM from Copenhagen to Kolkata with 5.5 hours gap between arriving in Delhi at 1:10 a.m. and departing at 6:30 a.m. With current RT-PCR rule who is going to help me board the connecting flight?” wrote traveller Sravasti on the microblogging site.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tighter-curbs-prove-costly-to-travellers/article37799295.ece

While electrocution claimed the lives of 741 elephants, train hits led to the death of 186 pachyderms, followed by poaching (169) and poisoning (64), a document accessed from the Ministry through the Right to Information (RTI) Act revealed. Karnataka and Odisha lost 133 elephants each to electrocution during the period and Assam reported 129 deaths. Among elephant casualties due to train hits, Assam stood first with 62 deaths, followed by West Bengal at 57. A total of 169 elephants were killed by poachers in the 10 years and Odisha reported the highest of 49, followed by Kerala 23. Assam reported the highest number of elephants poisoned, 32, and Odisha stood second with 15. The Ministry said in the document that India had a total of 29,964 wild elephants as per an estimate done in 2017. The southern region comprising Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra accounted for the highest population — 14,612 elephants. RTI activist R. Pandiyaraja of Tenkasi district in Tamil Nadu, who accessed the details in May, said the Centre and the States together had a greater responsibility in protecting elephants, a keystone species, and their habitats. A Permanent Coordination Committee has been constituted between the Ministry of Railways and the MoEFCC for preventing elephant deaths due to train hits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/1160-elephants-killed-in-a-decade/article37799252.ece
02 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||More data on jabs for children sought||The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has sought additional information on administration of Covaxin for children. Previously, the interim phase 2 and 3 clinical trial data of Covaxin on healthy volunteers aged two to 18 submitted by Bharat Biotech was deliberated at a meeting of the Subject Expert Committee. The committee recommended the grant of market authorisation for this age group for Restricted Use in Emergency Situation, subject to various conditions, said Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Bharati Pawar, in reply to a question in Parliament on use of Covaxin for children. The statement comes close on the heels of a study conducted between March 2020 and July 2021 and published recently in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine . The study said that school-age children with asthma and previous hospital admission and two or more courses of oral corticosteroids were markedly at increased risk of COVID-19 hospital admission and should be considered on priority for vaccination. The national incident cohort study was done in children aged five to 17, who were included in the linked dataset of Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance. “These findings can be used for informed deliberations on prioritising COVID-19 vaccination for children. Consideration needs to be given to extending the offer of vaccination to younger children also,” noted the study. The Global Asthma Report 2018 estimated that 6% of Indian children have asthma. Some estimates suggest that the total number of asthma patients in India could be in the range of 1.5-2 crore. On booster doses Ms. Pawar said that while there were countries which were providing booster doses, “in India, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation and National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 are deliberating and considering scientific evidence related to dose schedule of vaccines as well as the need and justification for booster dose”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/more-data-on-jabs-for-children-sought/article37799301.ece

Sainik School, Lucknow, and the National Defence Academy, Khadakvasla, he received his first Master’s degree from the University of Madras during the Staff Course at Defence Services Staff College, Wellington, where he was also awarded the Scudder Medal. He earned a Master’s degree in global security from Cranfield University, U.K., in 2005. “He is among the very few Commanding-in-Chiefs who have been bestowed with the unparalleled honour and unique distinction of heading both operational commands of the Navy,” a Navy statement said on Wednesday. All four of his operational commands have been of ships based in Mumbai — INS Veer (missile vessel), INS Vindhyagiri (frigate), INS Trishul (guided missile frigate) and INS Viraat (aircraft carrier), according to the Navy. He was promoted to the rank of Rear-Admiral in 2012 and Vice-Admiral in 2015. Vice-Admiral Dasgupta was the Chief of Staff, Eastern Naval Command, since June 2020. He was commissioned into the Navy in 1985 and is a specialist in navigation and direction. He is a recipient of the Ati Vishisht Seva Medal and the Vishisht Seva Medal for distinguished service.

A ceremonial parade, consisting of 16 platoons, including four armed platoons, and a 50-men “Guard of Honour” was held at the naval base, Kochi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/navy-sees-changes-in-the-top-deck/article37799293.ece
02 December 2021||New Delhi,||Winter in northern India to be warmer than normal: IMD||Winter in northern India will unlikely be harsh with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting “normal to above normal” minimum temperatures for December-February. These elevated temperatures are likely to be prevalent not only in northwest India but also south and northeast India and parts of the Himalayan foothills. The IMD, however, did not provide by how many degrees, on average, would temperatures be elevated. Overall, winter temperatures have been on the rise. The IMD which started issuing winter forecasts in 2016 , except for 2017, had forecast warm winters for all years since then. Warm winters, experts say, are a sign of global warming. India on an average is 0.5 degree Celsius warmer than 50 years ago. Colour code regions IMD officials said that from this year they had a “new forecasting system” in which they would no longer give the actual expected temperature deviation but only colour code regions indicating if they were normal, above or below normal. “Above normal would mean more than half the standard deviation of a region’s temperature,” said D.S. Pai, who heads the IMD’s climate division in Pune. He said that because all regions had different normal temperatures, it would not be feasible to provide individual temperature deviations. Cloud cover, said Mr. Pai, was one of the key factors influencing minimum temperatures as they influenced how the ground heated up. “This doesn’t however mean there won’t be cold waves.” Maximum temperatures were likely to be “below normal” over most parts of the country except over some parts of northwest India and most parts of northeast India, where normal to above normal Winter rains over south Peninsular India, particularly Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal, coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam, Rayalaseema, Kerala and Mahe and south interior Karnataka, are most likely to be above normal (more than 132% of the Long Period Average. Low-pressure area Currently the Andaman Sea is seeing a cyclone precursor, called a low-pressure area. The IMD has forecast it to intensify into a cyclone, called Jawad, by December 3 that is likely to approach the Andhra Pradesh and Odisha coasts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/winter-in-northern-india-to-be-warmer-than-normal-imd/article37799248.ece

Appearing before a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said trial court had used the evidence collected by the SIT to reach its conclusions on the guilt of the accused persons. Previously, the SIT had maintained that it had done an impeccable job of the investigation. The SIT was countering allegations made by Zakia Jafri, the widow of Congress leader Ehsan Jafri who was killed by a mob, of its “collaboration” with conspirators. Ms. Jafri alleged a larger conspiracy behind the riots. The SIT had filed a closure report in February 2012. It had given a clean chit to Narendra Modi, the current Prime Minister, and 63 others, saying there was “no prosecutable evidence” against them. A ‘protest petition’ filed by Ms. Jafri was dismissed by the Magistrate. The Gujarat High Court too had refused to entertain Ms. Jafri.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/got-convictions-in-all-godhra-cases-sit/article37799258.ece

02 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||We were never fence sitters: TRS||Telangana Rashtra Samithi MP Keshava Rao on Wednesday dismissed suggestions that joining an Opposition grouping in Parliament headed by the Congress indicates that his party is veering around to the view that its principle Opposition in Telangana, a State the party governs, is the BJP and not the Congress. The TRS has, in the past, voted with the NDA bloc headed by the BJP on various Bills and kept a distance from Opposition groupings but had a bitter face off with the BJP during the Huzurabad byelection won by the latter. Speaking to The Hindu , however, Mr. Rao insisted that his party had always been “in the opposition to the BJP”. “This is a nonsensical statement. The BJP, which won one seat yesterday has only three seats in a House of 120 members while the TRS has 105 MLAs. The BJP had to forfeit deposit in the elections they fought against us. The TRS is in Opposition and has always been. We have been against the BJP,” he said. Wrong perception On questions on the party changing its consistent fence-sitter policy on Bills in Parliament, he said, “The TRS never sat on the fence, it is a wrong perception and it should go. This is a perception created by the media because we supported a few Bills. Supporting Bills in national interest does not make us a BJP ally,” the MP said. Mr. Rao also sought to clarify that the TRS’s participation in the Opposition protest should not be taken as their changing stance towards the Congress. “It is wrong to say I attended a meeting chaired by Rahul Gandhi. I only attended an Opposition meeting.” Ideological alternative The BJP on its part acknowledges that its role as an Opposition in Telangana has always existed as an “ideological alternative” to the TRS but that, yes, the party is “yet to grow”. Former national general secretary of the BJP P. Muralidhar Rao said, in his comment, “The BJP is an ideological alternative to the TRS. We view the TRS as an ideological extension of the Congress. The TRS support of Bills is not support for the BJP but on complimentary issues. The BJP feels that it is the only party that has the potential to become an alternative to the TRS, but we are yet to grow.” As the TRS continued to protest in Parliament against the Central Government on Wednesday on issues related to farmers and paddy procurement in the State, while not based on numbers currently, there appears to have been some change in the chemistry between the TRS and the BJP, with the former visibly less sanguine about the latter’s electoral chances in the state of Telangana.  Supporting Bills in national interest does not make us a BJP ally. We have always been against the BJP Keshava Rao Rajya Sabha member||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/we-were-never-fence-sitters-trs/article37799278.ece
02 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Demand for MSP guarantee, ex gratia||Issues related to compensation for families of those who lost their lives in the year-long protests by farmers against the three Central farm laws, a legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farmers, arrest of activists under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) as well as a call for bringing in a uniform civil code dominated Zero Hour in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, the first day that such mentions could be made in the current session. Congress leader Manish Tewari said the Government should provide Rs. 5 crore as compensation to each of the families of the farmers who died during the agitation and accept the other demands of the tillers, including a legal guarantee of MSP for certain crops. Speaking in the Lok Sabha during the Zero Hour, the MP from Punjab’s Anandpur Sahib said it was because of the historic farmers’ movement that the three “black farm laws” had been taken back. “I would like to demand that a list of those farmers [who died in the agitation] be prepared and their families given Rs. 5 crore compensation each. The farmers’ demand of [legal guarantee for] MSP and other demands should be met. The Government should do justice to them,” he said. Hanuman Beniwal of the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party demanded that the cases filed against farmers during the agitation be taken back. All these demands have been consistently made by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha over the past few months even after the Government repealed the three laws related to agriculture and contract farming. Detention of students Kunwar Danish Ali of the BSP raised the issue of some students of universities such as Jamia Millia Islamia in detention under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and demanded that they be released. Earlier, he sought to raise the issue of MSP guarantee but the Chair asked him to stick to the issue he had given notice for. “Especially, students of Jamia Millia Islamia, Jawaharlal Nehru University and Aligarh Muslim University, who did much to raise awareness and shed light on important issues, have been put in jail misusing the UAPA. These students should be released from jail immediately,” he said. Nishikant Dubey of the BJP, raising the issue of uniform civil code, referred to the Allahabad High Court asking the Centre last month to consider setting up a panel for implementing the mandate of Article 44 of the Constitution, which speaks about a uniform civil code for the citizens throughout the territory of India. “Even after 75 years of Independence, we have not been able to bring in a uniform civil code. I urge the Government to soon bring a law for that,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/demand-for-msp-guarantee-ex-gratia/article37799275.ece
02 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC pushes for council on judicial infrastructure||The Supreme Court on Wednesday orally said courts cannot wait on the whims and fancies of the Government, but need a proper mechanism for funding the development of judicial infrastructure. A Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud gave Additional Solicitor General K.M. Natraj three weeks to consult with the Government and come back with a “line of thinking” on the issue. “Why cannot you think of constituting a sort of council on judicial infrastructure? We are least interested in retaining control of the council. The benefit of having a senior judge or Chief Justice on it would be that they are in the know of things. The composition can be of the Union Minister for Law and Justice, the Secretary, Finance, etc. The States can also be represented,” the Bench told the law officer. Funds disbursement The court said the Centre should meet with the finance and law Secretaries of the States to know the status of disbursement of funds for the judiciary in each State. Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana has been vocal in pushing the proposal for establishing the National Judicial Infrastructure Corporation to uniformly improve judicial facilities and access to justice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-pushes-for-council-on-judicial-infrastructure/article37799296.ece

In his letter, MoHFW Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the Maharashtra Government’s order were in divergence with the Ministry’s SOPs and guidelines. “I would, therefore, urge you to align orders issued by the State with the Guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health. I would also advise that such modified orders of the State Government are given wide publicity to obviate any inconvenience to travellers,” he noted. Maharashtra, in an order on November 30, said there would be mandatory RT-PCR testing of all international travellers at the Mumbai airport, irrespective of the country of origin. It also made announced a mandatory 14-day home quarantine for all international passengers, despite being tested negative upon arrival. RT-PCR tests were also made compulsory for passengers planning to undertake connecting flights after disembarking in Mumbai and further travel was subject to a negative RT-PCR test result.

I suppose I am seen as a new variant of the virus now," he added in his tweet. “They have been cancelled for two reasons. Firstly, we didn’t get special permission to seat 45 people in a venue that can seat more. Secondly, threats have been made to shut down the venue if I were to perform there. I guess this is also part of the COVID protocol and new guidelines. I suppose I am seen as a new variant of the virus now,” Mr. Kamra said in a tweet. However, in the case of Mr. Kamra’s shows, scheduled from December 1-19, the police have not issued any letter to either the venue owners or the organisers, and there is no clarity as to why the shows were cancelled. A group of “local residents” held protests in front of the venue Artkhoj in J.P. Nagar on Tuesday objecting to Mr. Kamra performing there and the police rushed to the spot and dispersed the crowds, said Srinath Mahadev Joshi, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South). “The venue owner has cancelled the shows and we had nothing to do with it. Since it is an indoor programme, they need not take our permission,” he said. “We are not in a position to comment on the matter any further,” a representative of Artkhoj told The Hindu . A senior police official said the identity of the protesters was not clear. “The venue has come up in a residential area violating norms, and there have been protests against commercialisation earlier too,” an official said, adding that the “residents” objected to a “controversial comedian using filthy language performing in their locality.” Kjeld Shresth, a city-based comic scheduled to perform with Mr. Kamra on December 4 at the venue, said he was at a loss of words and heartbroken. “ This will have a chilling effect on the comics and they will think twice before making a joke,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bengaluru-shows-nixed-says-kunal-kamra/article37799250.ece
02 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||CBSE exam question on 2002 riots causes stir||A question in the Class 12 Board examination of the CBSE on sociology on Wednesday has created a stir. “The unprecedented scale and spread of anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat in 2002 took place under which Government?” asked question no. 23 in the sociology paper. The choices offered to students were: “(a) Congress (b) BJP (c) Democratic (d) Republican.” “A question has been asked in today’s Class 12 sociology Term 1 exam which is inappropriate and in violation of the CBSE guidelines for external subject experts for setting question papers. The CBSE acknowledges the error made and will take strict action against the responsible persons,” said a statement on the CBSE’s Twitter handle. Several teachers said the question was within the syllabus. In the textbook “Indian Society”, a chapter on “The challenges of cultural diversity” includes a section on communalism. “To the extent that Governments can be held responsible for communal riots, no Government or ruling party can claim to be blameless in this regard,” says a paragraph on page 134 of the text approved by the NCERT. “In fact, the two most traumatic contemporary instances of communal violence occurred under each of the major political parties. The anti-Sikh riots of Delhi in 1984 took place under a Congress regime. The unprecedented scale and spread of anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat in 2002 took place under a BJP Government.” Another teacher who has previously set questions for the CBSE agreed that the question was within the syllabus, but noted that the Board’s guidelines for examination papers were more restrictive. “Ensure that the questions should be class-neutral, religion-neutral, not touching the controversial, social, political, critical issues under the prevailing conditions in the country,” say the guidelines seen by The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/question-on-2002-riots-leads-to-debate/article37799263.ece
02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||GST collections record a surge in November||Revenues from domestic transactions, including import of services, were 20% higher. The Union Finance Ministry also revised downwards GST collections for the first three months of 2021-22, starting with the record revenues of April that were originally reported as Rs. 1,41,384 crore. As per the data shared on Wednesday, those collections have now been pared by Rs. 1,676 crore to Rs. 1,39,708 crore. Similarly, the collections for May were revised by Rs. 4,888 crore to Rs. 97,821 from the Rs. 1,02,709 crore reported earlier. The June tally of Rs. 92,849 crore was only revised lower by Rs. 49 crore. In all, the total GST revenues for the year so far have been revised lower by about Rs. 6,600 crore. Official sources said, these revisions did not constitute a reduction in revenues and were necessitated by extended return filing dates during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emphasising that November’s GST kitty was second only to the collections this April, the Ministry sought to differentiate the significance of the former by stressing that April’s collections related to year-end revenues. Similarly, October’s Rs. 1.3 lakh crore collection also included the impact of returns required to be filed quarterly, it noted, to assert that the November revenues were “very much in line with the trend in economic recovery”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gst-collections-record-a-surge-in-november/article37799256.ece

Vadane, who remanded her in police custody for 10 days. On November 22, the public prosecutor filed a report seeking extension of the period for investigation. On November 26, she filed for bail under the Code of Criminal Procedure as the 90-day period from the date of her arrest and production before the magistrate had expired. Judge Vadane, however, extended the period of detention by 90 days. Advocates Yug Chaudhry and Payoshi Roy, appearing for Ms. Bharadwaj, filed for default bail on the ground that Judge Vadane was not competent to extend the detention by 90 days and for taking cognisance of the offences as he was not a designated special judge under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act. The advocates argued that none of the judges was appointed special judge by the Central Government. The second ground was that Ms. Bharadwaj had the right to be released on default bail and ought to have been released on January 25, 2019, as the chargesheet was filed only on February 21, 2019. The other co-accused filed a common plea for quashing and setting aside the September 5, 2019, order by additional sessions judge Ravindra Pande. They were represented by advocates Sudeep Pasbola and Barun Kumar, who contended that Judge Pande had no jurisdiction to take cognisance, since the case was not committed by a magistrate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bombay-hc-grants-sudha-bharadwaj-bail/article37799268.ece

Following this, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to the State Government to “align orders” with the guidelines issued by the Union Health Ministry to ensure their uniform implementation across all the States. Mr. Bhushan said the Maharashtra order was in divergence with the Ministry’s SOPs. These guidelines require only passengers from “at-risk” countries to undergo the RT-PCR test, and ask for institutional quarantine only if someone tests positive. Those who test negative have to undergo home quarantine for seven days and take a test on the eight day. The Ministry of Civil Aviation clarified that passengers transiting through “at-risk” countries, but with their journey originating from a non “at-risk” country would be exempted from RT-PCR test on arrival. Europe and 10 countries are on the Health Ministry’s “at-risk” countries for which there are stricter testing norms.

02 December 2021||New Delhi,||Bill to regulate IVF clinics passed in Lok Sabha||The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill, 2020, that proposes the establishment of a national registry and registration authority for all clinics and medical professionals serving in the field. Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, while moving the Bill for passage, said several suggestions of the Standing Committee have been considered by the Government to improve the legislation. The Bill seeks to regulate and supervise Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) clinics and ART banks, prevent misuse, adopt safe and ethical practice and so on. “Many such ART clinics have been running without regulation. A need was felt for regulation of such clinics as there are implications on health of those who undertake the procedure,” Mr. Mandaviya told the House. Opening the debate, Congress’s Karti Chidambaram said this law is Victorian as it does not include lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender people (LGBTQ) or single men for exercising the right. He also urged the Government to consider supporting poor childless parents to take ART’s help.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bill-to-regulate-ivf-clinics-passed-in-lok-sabha/article37799279.ece
02 December 2021||New Delhi,||‘Ensure code of ethics is followed on social media’||Observing that social media platforms have placed journalism in the hands of citizens, a Parliamentary panel on Wednesday asked the Government to ensure a code of ethics is followed in the digital media space while preserving the right to freedom of expression. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Communications and Information Technology in its 27th report on ‘Ethical Standards in Media Coverage’, presented in Parliament, impressed upon the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) “to ensure that adequate consultations take place with all stakeholders” and that monitoring of digital media may be exercised while fully preserving the right to freedom of expression. The panel observed that social media platforms, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Twitter, have placed journalism in the hands of the citizens. Citizens use their personal recording devices including cellphones to capture events and post them on the Internet, it noted. OTT platforms The panel also considered the issue of unregulated content made available through online and OTT (over the top) platforms “which had hitherto escaped any architecture of regulation”. “During the COVID pandemic, more and more people have resorted to these platforms due to closure of cinema halls. The committee is conscious that the information and content portrayed on such platforms can impact viewers, including minor children,” it said. “At the same time, the committee acknowledges that OTT platforms offer freedom to the individual user to decide what to watch, a freedom that should not be abridged by the heavy hand of Government,” the panel said. Referring to the latest ‘The Information Technology (Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021’ notified in February this year, the panel said it hoped that the new rules and guidelines would go a “long way in ensuring transparency and accountability for social media platforms with a robust oversight mechanism by the government.” It also hoped that the MIB along with the Ministry of Electronics and Information and Technology will work in tandem to ensure that the code for ethics is followed by digital media also. The report said that any regulation must have checks and balances to ensure that it is neither misused nor violative of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ensure-code-of-ethics-is-followed-on-social-media/article37799349.ece

With this move, India has started the procedure for taking over the G20 presidency next year. Troika refers to the top grouping within the G20 that consists of the current, previous and the incoming presidencies — Indonesia, Italy and India. “India will assume the G20 presidency on December 1, 2022 from Indonesia, and will convene the G20 Leaders’ Summit for the first time in India in 2023,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. Italy hosted the G20 summit during October 30-31 that was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi where India had raised the issue of Afghanistan’s future following the takeover by the Taliban. Indonesia took over the G20 presidency on Wednesday. In the coming months, Indonesia will hold rounds of discussion at various levels among the members of the G20 before convening the G20 Leaders’ Summit scheduled for October 30-31, 2022. Next year’s summit will be organised along the overall theme of “Recover Together, Recover Stronger”. “As a Troika member, India will work closely with Indonesia and Italy to ensure consistency and continuity of the G20’s agenda,” the Ministry of External Affairs said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-joins-g20s-troika-with-indonesia-and-italy/article37799352.ece
02 December 2021||New Delhi,||Curriculum must include wisdom of Vedas: panel||School textbooks should incorporate the “ancient wisdom, knowledge and teachings about life and society from the Vedas and other great Indian texts”, according to a parliamentary panel on education. History textbooks should also give greater importance to unknown freedom fighters, women heroes, the empires of the Deccan and the history of the northeastern region, and the Sikh and Maratha communities, added the panel. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth and Sports submitted its report on reforms in the content and design of school textbooks to the Rajya Sabha on November 30. The panel held consultations with a wide range of stakeholders, including the State and Central institutions responsible for drafting textbooks and curricula, as well as education experts and civil society representatives. A major chunk of the panel’s final observations related to history textbooks. “The committee during its interaction noted that many of the historical figures and freedom fighters of [the] Indian freedom struggle have been portrayed in an incorrect manner as offenders. Therefore, the committee is of the view that wrong portrayal of our heroes of freedom struggle should be corrected and they should be given due respect in our history textbooks,” it said. The panel recommended that the Education Ministry set up a monitoring mechanism to ensure that all privately published books, especially history books, which were recommended for supplementary reading were in consonance with the structure and content of the texts published by NCERT. Arguing that school textbooks “do not give adequate coverage to some of the great Indian empires like that of Vikramaditya, Cholas, Chalukyas, Vijayanagara, Gondwana or that of Travancore and Ahoms of the northeast”, the panel recommended an overhaul of history-writing guidelines to give equal weightage to various eras.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/curriculum-must-include-wisdom-of-vedas-panel/article37799299.ece
02 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre seeks names for MSP committee||Moving forward on the Prime Minister’s promise to set up a committee to discuss minimum support prices (MSP) for crops among other issues, the Centre has informally asked protesting farm unions to suggest five names to be part of the panel. However, the leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a joint platform of the unions, say no formal written communication has yet been received. The move came a day after Parliament repealed the three contentious farm reform laws as had been demanded by the protesting unions. Their other key demand is for a legal guarantee that all farmers will receive remunerative prices, one and a half times the comprehensive cost of production, for all their crops. On November 19, the Prime Minister said a committee would be formed “to promote zero budgeting based agriculture, to change crop pattern as per the changing needs of the country and to make MSP more effective and transparent”, with representatives from State and Central Governments, farmers, agricultural scientists and economists. “SKM confirms that there was a telephone call from the Government of India to a Punjab farmer union leader, wherein the Government wanted five names to be suggested from SKM's side for a committee,” said the SKM core committee, in a late night statement on Tuesday. “However, we have received no written communication and no details are available so far about what this committee is about, its mandate or Terms of Reference. In the absence of such details, it would be premature to comment on this issue,” it added. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has argued that the farmers’ demand on MSP would be fulfilled by the formation of the committee, and urged protesters to go home. The unions have said they will wait to take a decision on their future course of action on December 4.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-asked-to-name-msp-panel-members/article37799265.ece

It said, a commission would be constituted in the next few days for collecting data regarding the political reservation to be provided to the OBCs. Appearing before the first Division Bench of Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu, senior counsel Vijay Narayan, representing the Union Territory, said the government would make an application before the Supreme Court within a week seeking six more months to conduct the local body polls. Stating that the delay in constitution of the commission was because of the procedures involved in getting Presidential nod through the Administrator (Lieutenant Governor), he said, the government would request the commission to submit a report within two months and thereafter conduct the local body elections with due representation for OBCs.  ‘Unconstitutional’ The submissions were made during the hearing of three writ petitions filed in the court challenging the government’s previous decision to conduct the local body polls by reserving wards only for the scheduled castes and not for the scheduled tribes and the OBCs. Senior counsel P. Wilson and A.R.L. Sundaresan termed the decision unconstitutional. When the judges pointed out that the elections could not be deferred indefinitely when the Supreme Court had ordered conduct of the local body polls in the Union Territory at the earliest, the petitioners chose to withdraw their cases and approach the apex court with their plea to ensure reservations for scheduled tribes and OBCs. Accepting their plea, the Bench granted them liberty to approach the Supreme Court and extended an already existing interim stay on the conduct of the local body polls for a further period of two weeks to enable the petitioners to approach the apex court in the meantime and get their cases listed for hearing.  The government will request the commission to submit a report within two months and thereafter conduct the local body elections with due representation for OBCs||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/committed-to-reserving-seats-for-obcs-in-local-body-elections/article37799630.ece
02 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Give complete information on all waterbodies within a week: HC||The Madras High Court on Wednesday directed the State Chief Secretary to file within a week a complete list of waterbodies in every district, the number of waterbodies being encroached, the number of encroachments evicted, the number of encroachments yet to be evicted and the time frame within which all encroachments would be removed. Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu issued the direction after Additional Advocate General J. Ravindran submitted a status report, filed by the Public Works Department Secretary on behalf of the Chief Secretary, providing the details of waterbody encroachments with respect to only nine districts. Not satisfied with the submission, the judges ordered that details pertaining to all 38 districts should be submitted in the court by December 8. They warned that the court would be left with no option but to summon the officials concerned if the details are not submitted within the stipulated time. They also pointed out that the information had been sought as early as on January 28, 2019. A Division Bench of Justice K.K. Sasidharan (since retired) and Justice Audikesavalu had ordered the consolidation of data on waterbodies across the State and submission of a detailed report. The court had taken serious note of encroachment of waterbodies occurring unabatedly in spite of several court orders having been passed in the last 15 years. Referring to all the orders passed since 2005 and the enactment of the Tamil Nadu Protection of Tanks and Eviction of Encroachment Act of 2007, the judges said the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), in the report for the year ending in March 2017, had highlighted that the 2007 Act had failed to protect the waterbodies from encroachments. Fix boundaries According to the CAG, the first step towards preventing encroachments was to fix the boundaries of all waterbodies in the State through a survey. However, no such survey had been done by the Water Resources Department. Only after fixing the boundaries could officials evict the existing encroachments and keep vigil to prevent future encroachments. The CAG had also pointed out that 49% of the total objectionable encroachments in the State were on waterbodies, and yet, there were inherent limitations to the 2017 Act as it did not cover encroachments on smaller irrigation tanks and ooranis (natural springs). Hence, it had been recommended to include rivers, streams, tanks and ooranis , too, under the law. ‘Note shortcomings’ After taking note of the report, the High Court had, in January 2019, directed the Chief Secretary to take note of the shortcomings pointed out by the CAG and file an ‘action taken’ report in the court. He was further directed to collate data on all waterbodies in the State by calling for details from the Collectors, and submit it before the Registrar (Judicial). Though nearly two years had elapsed since then, the complete data had not been submitted in the court, the Acting Chief Justice said. He observed that the officials should, in the normal course, not be given any more time to file the report. Yet, as a last chance, he directed the government to ensure that the details were submitted within a week.  The court would be left with no option but to summon the officials concerned if the details are not submitted within the stipulated time||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/give-complete-information-on-all-waterbodies-within-a-week-hc/article37799473.ece

02 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Reservation of 105 Chennai wards for women challenged||The Madras High Court on Wednesday agreed to hear on Thursday a writ petition, which insisted that the reservation for women candidates in elections to urban local bodies should not exceed 50% of the wards in every Municipal Corporation. The litigant said granting reservation beyond 50% was unconstitutional and amounted to discrimination against men. Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu accepted a request made by senior counsel S. Prabakaran for an early hearing of the case, since local body polls to the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) could be announced anytime. He said the litigant had insisted upon a stay on the conduct of the election until the disposal of his case, seeking parity for men. The petitioner, R. Parthiban of West Mambalam, said provisions relating to the reservation for women candidates originally provided one-third of the seats to them. But in 2016, the laws were amended to the effect that not less than 50% of the seats should be reserved for women in the elections to the post of ward councillor. Observing that the phrase “not less than 50%” should not be construed to mean that reservation for women can be provided even beyond 50%, to the disadvantage of and discrimination against men, the petitioner said the fears had come true, as 105 of the 200 wards in the GCC had now been reserved for women. Providing a break-up of the number of wards that had been reserved for various categories, the petitioner said 89 had been reserved for women (general), 16 for the Scheduled Castes (women) and 16 for the Scheduled Castes (general). The rest of the 79 wards had been left open for male candidates from the general category, he said. The petitioner said only 84 wards should be reserved for women (general) candidates and an equal number provided to male candidates in the general category.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/reservation-of-105-chennai-wards-for-women-challenged/article37799499.ece

02 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||PMK revamping its organisation ahead of urban local body polls||The PMK is changing its organisational structure in the run-up to the elections to the urban local bodies. The exercise, which is likely to be completed by this year-end, will empower the district secretaries, putting them in charge of two or three Assembly constituencies. The party has said the posts of State deputy secretary will not exist any more. The changes are meant to ensure that the district secretaries have a direct line of communication with the leadership and to improve the party’s electoral performance. PMK spokesperson K. Balu told The Hindu that the changes would ease the burden on the office-bearers. “The State deputy secretary used to be responsible for too many constituencies, and the arrangement had not worked very well. Now, a district secretary will be responsible for 2-3 constituencies.” ‘Conscious decision’ Sources in the party said a conscious decision was made to put more youths in positions of power and ensure that all communities were fairly represented in the organisation. Mr. Balu said the party had appointed members of all communities, including the Brahmins, to the rank of district secretaries in line with its ideal of proportional representation. “We have put Sriram Iyer in charge of Mandaveli, Mylapore and Triplicane/Chepauk. For us, social justice is about proportional representation of all communities...,” he said. Mr. Sriram said he is one of the eight district secretaries appointed in Chennai. PMK founder S. Ramadoss said the Tamil Nadu Government should pass a law to declare the first day of the month of ‘Thai’ the Tamil New Year. He said the law passed by former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi was repealed by the Jayalalithaa Government in August 2011. BJP State president K. Annamalai said the DMK Government should not change Tamil New Year’s Day. He said people would give a fitting reply to various measures taken by the Government, which were “against the Hindus and the Hindu religion and its practices”.

With the cases of sexual offences against students surfacing recently, the Department has been promoting its helpline number as well as the 1098 ChildLine among students, encouraging them to report any incident of sexual abuse or harassment. School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi has said both the numbers will soon be printed in all textbooks. But some districts have already begun stamping the numbers on the books of the students. “While we usually get 300-400 calls a day, the number can go up to 600 when the admissions begin under the RTE Act as parents call in with questions. Over the last two weeks, however, we have had a significant increase in the number of calls, mostly from parents who ask us about the process of filing a complaint of sexual abuse or harassment and how we plan to handle such complaints,” said Paul Robinson, Operations Head, 14417 Education Information Centre. He said the information centre had not yet received calls from parents or students raising a complaint of child sexual abuse or harassment. “We are, however, prepared to handle such complaints. We have a team of 10 counselling officers who are psychologists; they can speak to people who call in. They now handle calls on exam anxiety and stress, or any issue students may have with parents or teachers,” Mr. Robinson said. The complaints will then be forwarded to the School Education Department, and the Chief Educational Officers concerned will be alerted. Furthermore, there are 14 response officers handing general information to parents and students.

It has also resolved not to construct any new government building on watercourse poromboke land. In a status report filed before Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu, Water Resources Department Secretary Sandeep Saxena said Chief Secretary V. Irai Anbu had presided over a meeting of top officials on November 2 to discuss the issue. The major decisions taken was not to provide power or water connections to new encroachments, not to construct government buildings on watercourse poromboke land, evolve a policy for protecting waterbodies, instruct all Collectors to evict the encroachers and rehabilitate those who were in occupation for long. The submissions were made in response to a public interest litigation petition filed by the non-governmental organisation Arappor Iyakkam for evicting the encroachers from the Chitlapakkam lake in Chennai. The government said it had decided to take up the task of clearing the lake as a pilot project. It said 403 long-time encroachers had been identified in the lake and another 63 in Selaiyur. They would be persuaded to move out and the Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board was requested to allot tenements to them in Perumbakkam, Potheri and Perungalathur. The report said the Greater Chennai Corporation had reported to have undertaken restoration of 210 waterbodies. Rejuvenation and restoration of 146 waterbodies had been completed and 38 more would be restored by March 31, 2022. A biometric survey of 4,061 families requiring rehabilitation was under way. At the meeting, the Municipal Administration and Water Supply Department said 5,178 of the 9,802 identified encroachments in corporations and municipalities had been evicted.

02 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Doctors boycott OPD duty over NEET-PG counselling delay||Several postgraduate medical students, under the banner of Tamil Nadu Resident Doctors’ Association, boycotted outpatient department (OPD) services as a sign of protest over the delay in holding counselling for NEET-PG 2021. As part of the Statewide protest, the resident doctors decided to stay away from OPD services from Wednesday until their demand to conduct counselling was met. In Chennai, the doctors staged demonstrations at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) and the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital. While the NEET-PG was held in September, counselling had not been conducted because of a case in the Supreme Court over the EWS quota. “First, the NEET-PG was postponed and held in September. Now, the counselling has been delayed. This led to washout of an entire academic year for medical students,” said a doctor at the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital. Faced with financial constraints, many aspirants were in a dilemma as to whether to wait for counselling or take up employment. “The next court hearing is scheduled to be held in January. It will take another two or three months [to get a clear picture]. So, the government should conduct counselling on an urgent basis by following the existing reservation structure,” a resident doctor of RGGGH said. The association urged the Centre and the Supreme Court to take note of the grievance of resident doctors and take steps to expedite NEET-PG counselling as well as the admission process and speed up court proceedings. The delay in admission had caused a strain on the existing resident doctors. They said the workload of the existing postgraduate doctors had increased as they were involved in COVID-19 vaccination, flood relief camps and dengue management.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/resident-doctors-boycott-opd-over-neet-pg-counselling-delay/article37799493.ece

A 19 kg cylinder in Chennai, which was Rs. 2,133, now costs Rs. 2,234.50. This comes on the back of State-run oil companies increasing commercial LPG prices by Rs. 266 a cylinder last month. In a statement here, association secretary R. Rajkumar said that hotels were already reeling under the impact of lockdown. “Restaurants were closed and hoteliers were unable to pay salaries. However, no respite was provided from electricity charges or municipal taxes,” he said. With the latest revision, the LPG will account for 31% of production charges in hotels, which was unfair, he said and called for a rollback of increase in the cooking gas prices.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hotels-demand-rollback-of-lpg-price-increase/article37799480.ece

In 2019, the State Government had referred the dispute between the Chennai Managaratchi Ozhiyargal Vizhipunarvu Sangam and the Corporation to the tribunal. The union said its members worked in two shifts — day shift from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and the night shift from 5.30 p.m. to 8 a.m. The union said for the extra hours the Corporation was liable to pay overtime wages. It sought proper maintenance of the rest room and bathroom and supply of purified drinking water.

02 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Five-year-old undergoes liver transplant||A five-year-old boy on ventilator was airlifted to Rela Hospital here from Qatar for an emergency liver transplant recently. The Bangladeshi boy, who doctors said would live for only 72-hours, has been saved. Mohammed was diagnosed with fulminant hepatic failure (a clinical syndrome of acute and severe liver impairment). Tests in Qatar revealed that the liver enzymes, ammonia, and coagulation profile, were drastically deranged but doctors could not ascertain the cause for the rapid and sudden deterioration. As his condition worsened he was put on ventilator support and medication to stabilise his blood pressure. With the support of Bangladeshi government and its embassy in India, the boy was transferred to Rela Hospital. Mohammed’s father donated a part of his liver. The paperwork for the transplant, which normally could take over 10 days, was quickened and the transplant was scheduled for the third day of his arrival in the city. The donor liver retrieval was done robotically to enable early recovery of the father. Mohamed Rela, the liver transplant surgeon, performed the procedure for the boy. “He had an uneventful post-operative period and was discharged on the 10th day post-transplant. Both the donor and the recipient remain well. The meticulous planning by our multi-disciplinary liver transplant team saved the life of the boy. Despite such a rapid and precipitous deterioration in his health, the boy recovered well. This would not have been possible without the emergency transplant,” Dr. Rela said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bangladeshi-boy-undergoes-liver-transplant-in-state/article37799494.ece

02 December 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Problems galore in BU Syndicate election||Election of four persons to the Bharathiar University Syndicate, it appears, is running into problems. In October this year, the University issued a notification to elect four persons to the Syndicate – two from the teachers’ constituency and a like number from the principals’ constituency in the Senate. It had said that November 9 would be the last date for receipt of nomination and November 16 the date for withdrawal of nominations and the election will be held on December 8. Earlier, the University had accepted applications for inclusion of names in the voters’ list for the two constituencies. After the University published the list of candidates in the fray in the teachers’ constituency, it came to light that one of the contestants – D. Gnana Senthil Kumar, a faculty of a self-financed college in Tiruppur district, was not even a voter in the teachers’ constituency.  Clerical error When this was raised with the University authorities, the reply was that Mr. Kumar was very much a voter in the teachers’ constituency and the failure to include his name in the voters’ list was a clerical error. The second, according to sources, was a few persons had approached the University to include names of 22 persons who were either principals or principals in-charge in self-financed colleges but were not in the voters’ list. After the move came to light, the Association of University Teachers objected to it saying inclusion of names after the finalisation of voters’ list, notification of election and finalisation of candidates was illegal. The Association’s State president P. Thirunavukkarasu, in his note to Vice Chancellor P. Kaliraj, said as per election rules, inclusion of names at such a very late stage in election was arbitrary and illegal. The final electoral rolls the University had published on November 8 was final. Objection Sources said one of the four contestants in the fray in the principals’ constituency objected to the inclusion of names in electoral rolls. Vice-Chancellor Mr. Kaliraj said it was true that a move was made to update the rolls. But the University had decided against it because it had had given ample time for updating electoral rolls in both the constituencies. As for the candidature of Mr. Kumar, Mr. Kaliraj said the application for inclusion of his name in voters’ list was submitted well before the deadline.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/problems-galore-in-bu-syndicate-election/article37799519.ece
02 December 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Civic body plans to revive construction of debris recycling plant in Ukkadam||Coimbatore Corporation is working to revive the proposal to build a construction waste and debris recycling plant. The revival comes four years after the Corporation mooted a Rs. 12.50-crore proposal to process 100 tonnes waste a day by building the plant on a 15-acre site in Ukkadam. After floating tender, processing bids and awarding contract to a Chennai-based company, the Corporation could not complete the construction of the plant for several reasons. The Corporation had mooted the proposal under the public-private partnership model, wherein the company winning the bid would also invest in the plant and sell the final product to make money. After four years of trying and giving up the project, the Corporation had revived the project, thanks to the fund it was expected to get under the Swachh Bharat Mission 2.0, said sources. One of the components of the SBM 2.0 was processing construction waste and debris. The Corporation wanted to make use of the opportunity to build the plant, the sources said. To submit a proposal to build the plant to the Central Government, the Corporation was working out the details. It was assessing the construction work going on within the city, zone-wise based on the planning permission the town planning wing issued every month. Of those permissions, the Corporation was specifically looking at those where construction activity included demolition of old buildings as they generated more waste than new construction. The sources also said the Corporation was also exploring the possibility of having more than one construction waste and debris management plant in the city, what with the growth the city saw and the future needs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/civic-body-plans-to-revive-construction-of-debris-recycling-plant-in-ukkadam/article37799518.ece
02 December 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Officials suggest measures to prevent train-elephant collisions||A joint meeting of officials from the Tamil Nadu Forest Department and Palghat Division of the Southern Railway held on Tuesday came out with a list of measures to avert elephants being hit by trains on the two railway lines connecting Tamil Nadu and Kerala via Walayar. Increasing number of field trackers, use of night visions binoculars, drones equipped with thermal sensor and random travel by the Forest Department staff in the locomotives with the consent of Railways were among measures proposed at the meeting. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden Shekhar Kumar Niraj said the meeting was held at Top Slip in the Anamalai Tiger Reserve. The officials discussed short and long term measures to address the issue after three elephants were knocked down by a Chennai-bound train on the ‘A’ line between Walayar and Ettimadai on November 26 night. Mr. Niraj said that possible solutions suggested included increasing the number of field trackers to nearly 25 as against nine now. The Forest Department proposed training programmes to study the animal behaviour, movement pattern and seasonality. The Department suggested a vista clearance of at least 15 metres on both sides of the track. The Department staff shall be provided the timings of all train movements on ‘A’ and ‘B’ lines. They should have immediate communications from the Railways regarding changes in the rail movements. Mr. Niraj said that the meeting explored possibilities of reducing the speed of trains on the two lines to below 35 kmph by adjusting the loads and use of bankers. Railways assured of taking these suggestions to appropriate levels for consideration. The Department has suggested to have a number of go-slow signal lights with different colours before the most likely crossing animal paths and installation of speed detector around them. Monthly sensitisation and awareness programmes with loco pilots and assistants, frequent removal of garbage and food left overs littered along the tracks, direct communication between the forest field trackers and the railways control rooms, setting up designated Forest Department officials for direct communications and multi-level meetings between the Railways and the Forest Department officials were other measures suggested. The meeting decided to explore with the Ministries of Railways and Forest for funds for construction underpasses and vehicle cart roads. The Railways officials insisted upon quicker permission for forest clearance to improve sighting for loco pilots. The Forest Department has requested access to speed details of trains regularly from the Railways. The Railways insisted upon removing illegal electric fences near the railways tracks. The meeting decided to hold a joint field inspection before December 10 to locate sites for additional speed limit boards, ramps for elephant crossing and solar lights along A and B lines.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/officials-suggest-measures-to-prevent-train-elephant-collisions/article37799511.ece

02 December 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||School in Karumbukkadai lacks adequate classrooms||Outside the toilet at the Corporation Elementary School in Karumbukkadai, students wait in queue. For, there are only two toilets – one for boys and girls. There is another toilet for teachers. The students use this one too as there is insufficient number of toilets, say sources. In classrooms too there is shortage of space. But, the teachers are able to manage for now because students turn up in shifts, what with the COVID-19 safety protocol in place, the sources say. The inadequate infrastructure became more apparent after a spike in number of students the school admitted. In the last academic year, there were 128 students. At the beginning of this academic year, around 200 students joined the school, taking the total strength to 315, says Sabina Shamsudeen, a Karumbukkadai resident. Abdul Hakim of Jamaat E Islami Hind says though the demand for more classrooms is justified, the Corporation should heed to the residents’ demand for upgrading the school and building a new one. After class five, students from the area are forced to go to Town Hall, or Raja Street or Kuniamuthur to continue high school education. Girls, in particular, are completely dependent on the Corporation Girls’ Hr. Sec. School on Oppanakara Street. Many parents stop sending girl children to school after Class X. To stop the practice the Corporation should construct a higher secondary school at Pullukadu. And, if it were to offer English medium of education as well then the civic body will see a good response. Teachers in the school say they represented the infrastructure demands to the Corporation authorities in July-August this year. A few officials visited the campus to study the availability of space for constructing new classrooms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/school-in-karumbukkadai-lacks-adequate-classrooms/article37799515.ece

02 December 2021||Madurai/Ramanathapuram,TAMIL NADU||Vaigai water likely to drain into sea||With the flow of water in the Vaigai being on the higher side in Ramanthapuram district and most of the tanks in Vaigai old ayacut, including the Big Tank, having comfortable storage, draining of flood water into the Bay of Bengal has become inevitable. Though the surplus of 7,300 cusecs released from Vaigai dam on Wednesday morning was reduced to 5,000 cusecs in the evening, the heavy rainfall reported in the last two days downstream the dam has added to the water discharged through the river. Peranai in Dindigul district reported 12,000 cusecs of water flow in the morning and Madurai Collector S. Aneesh Sekhar had warned people not to venture into the river and keep the cattle away from the river. “We are getting 2,000 cusecs to 3,000 cusecs of additional flow at Parthibanur regulator more than what was recorded at Viraghanoor dam,” a Public Works Department source said. The flow has been swelling as the river crosses each district with the drainage of all the catchment areas of the river converging into it. “Since this is flood water, regulating the flow has been very difficult and within the short span of time whatever quantum of water could be held at different bed dams and check dams in the tail-end regions have been done. However, since the flow is high and almost all the tanks are full, release of water into the river has become inevitable and more water could flow into the river by Thursday,” an engineer said. Big tank “A good buffer in the Big Tank has to be maintained as a precautionary measure, as more rain is expected under North East monsoon in December too,” he added. Ramanathapuram Collector Shankar Lal Kumawat said that efforts were being made to absorb the maximum water possible in the tanks before it is let to drain into the sea. Water has been diverted through a series of bed dams and held in check dams below Parthibanur regulator to the maximum extent possible. It would recharge groundwater to a significant extent, the engineer said. Besides, even draining of water into the sea will serve the ecological purpose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaigai-water-likely-to-drain-into-bay-of-bengal/article37799627.ece

02 December 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Action plan to eliminate single-use plastics ready in Puducherry||Tax holidays for firms interested in setting up units to manufacture alternatives to single-use plastic items, financial assistance for those looking to sell alternative products, ‘buy back’ schemes, collection centres for plastic waste, reprocessing of plastic waste and creating awareness about the alternatives are among the highlights of an action plan to eliminate plastics in Puducherry. The action plan, prepared by the Department of Science, Technology and Environment and the Puducherry Pollution Control Committee, is based on the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change. The Ministry had suggested the promotion of the manufacture of alternatives to make the ban on plastic items, weighing under 50 microns, a success in the Union Territory. The Department, after conducting field assessments, came to an understanding that locally available materials had the potential to become major alternatives to single-use plastic items. As the cost of the alternative products is higher than that of plastic items, brand advertisements can be used, the report said. Services of self-help groups can be used to make cloth and paper bags and the Department has planned to train SHG members in the processing of leaves for food packaging. Commercial centres that do not use the banned products should be honoured with Green Awards. Consumers too can be encouraged to return plastic and multi-layered plastic wrappers to vendors, by offering incentives. Owners of such brands should print the buy-back cost on the wrappers. The government should encourage the use of plastic waste for road and concrete-paving bricks. Industrial estates, Municipalities and commune panchayats should be encouraged to have at least one waste-processing unit, it said. Refuse-derived fuel plants can be set up on waste disposal sites to process bad-quality plastics and used clothes. The Department will adopt stringent measures to penalise those manufacturing and selling the banned items. Illegal single-use plastic manufacturing units will be traced by local bodies using trade licences and returns submitted by traders to the Commercial Taxes Department, the report added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/action-plan-to-eliminate-single-use-plastics-ready/article37799940.ece

The main objective would be to promote new and innovative business ideas in food processing among the CCI members with technological support from the NIFTEM (formerly Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology) so that the opportunities in the sector could be tapped effectively by new entrepreneurs or existing business/industrial entities. For a three-year period, the institute would take care of education and training, skill development, dissemination of food business knowledge and public-private partnership concept-based programmes while the CCI would help its members strengthen their business network and the key areas of deliverables apart from identifying, acquiring and sharing the best management practices. Addressing the gathering at the MoU signing function held here on Tuesday, Director of NIFTEM-Thanjavur, C.Anandharamakrishnan, said that enormous business opportunities both in domestic and export markets, exist in food processing industry. Listing out the areas in which the institute could provide technological assistance to the CCI members, he exhorted the business community and the budding entrepreneurs to take up new ventures or diversify their activities to tap opportunities that have opened up in the sector due to the change in food habits of consumers. The food industry was the only sector that had not been affected much due to the pandemic, he said and added that the rice export witnessed growth during the pandemic period. C.Anandhan, secretary, CCI, Thanjavur, explained the scope for diversification in the food industry. He urged them to tap the opportunities that were on the anvil in the defence sector-related industries as the Central government had proposed to promote the Tiruchi region as a defence industrial corridor.

02 December 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||Kerala looks at steps to hold vegetable prices down||The State is looking at long-term measures for ensuring adequate supply of vegetables from neighbouring States to keep prices down. Discussions will be held soon with the Agriculture Ministers of southern States in this regard, Mr. Prasad said here on Wednesday. The government is aiming for direct purchases from vegetable farmers in those States by avoiding middlemen. This is designed to be a long-term mechanism rather than a short-term measure to overcome the present price rise, he added. A high-level meeting is scheduled with Tamil Nadu Agriculture department officials on Thursday for sourcing vegetables from Tenkasi district. Kerala will be represented by top officials of the Agriculture department and the Kerala State Horticultural Products Development Corporation (Horticorp), he said. Direct purchase As a market intervention measure, Horticorp is already making direct purchase from Tirunelveli and Mysuru. A collection point will be set up at Tenkasi, from where vegetables would be transported to Kerala. Preliminary discussions were held between Horticorp and Tamil Nadu Agriculture department officials last week. Kerala hopes to retain the collection point as a permanent arrangement. The Agriculture department has assigned four officials eith the task of coordinating the efforts with four southern States, Mr. Prasad said. Bid to avoid middlemen “The government is making all-out efforts to ensure vegetable supplies by avoiding middlemen on a permanent basis. At the same time, the present crisis underscores for farming to be widely popularised in the State to achieve self-sufficiency,” Mr. Prasad said. Within the State, the Agriculture department plans to enter into a tripartite agreement involving vegetable farmers and banks to curb the exploitation of farmers at Vattavada and Kanthallur in Idukki by outside agencies. This arrangement will also guarantee a fair price to the farmers for their produce. The department will arrange collection points, storage facilities and refrigerated trucks under this initiative, the Minister said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kerala-looks-at-steps-to-hold-vegetable-prices-down/article37799310.ece
02 December 2021||Thoothukudi,TAMIL NADU||Residents fume as sewage mixes with stagnant rainwater||With sewage mixing with stagnant rainwater around their houses for more than a week, residents blocked a road and threatened to stage a black flag protest as Chief Minister M. K. Stalin is scheduled to visit the district on Thursday. As knee-deep water is stagnating on the premises of most of the schools, Thoothukudi Collector K. Senthil Raj declared holiday for all schools while colleges functioned as usual on Wednesday. Si.Va. Government Higher Secondary School premises that houses the office of the Chief Educational Officer, was totally inundated. “Most private, government and government-aided schools are facing this problem even though motors are being operated round-the-clock to pump out the water. As groundwater level has risen almost to the surface level, pumping out water does not yield desirable results. So, it will take a few more days to reopen the schools,” said a headmaster. Though the Corporation has deployed around 400 motors to pump out stagnant rainwater and is using earthmovers to dig trenches to drain water into nearby drainage channels, resurfacing rains neutralise all these efforts. Consequently, residents of badly hit areas like Muthammal Colony, Ram Nagar, Rahmath Nagar, Athiparasakthi Nagar, Housing Board Colony, Ambedkar Nagar, Bryant Nagar and Chidambara Nagar have been living in the midst of two-feet-deep water for the past one week. The stagnant rainwater in the Corporation’s common burial ground opposite VOC College causes severe hardship to those who come there with dead bodies. Agitated over the delay in draining the stagnant water, residents of Ram Nagar, Rahmath Nagar and Muthammal Colony, Ram Nagar and Rahmath Nagar blocked vehicular traffic on Ettaiyapuram Highway. After Ministers P. Geetha Jeevan and Anita R. Radhakrishnan, Dr. Senthil Raj, Corporation Commissioner T. Charusree and Superintendent of Police S. Jayakumar, who came to the spot to make arrangements for Chief Minister M.K. Stalin’s visit on Thursday, pacified the protestors with the assurance that sustained efforts would be taken to drain the water. Meanwhile, residents of Velankanni Nagar near Krishnarajapuram North warned that they would hoist black flags in protest against the Corporation’s failure to pump out stagnant rainwater mixed with sewage in their area. “Since the Chief Minister is visiting Thoothukudi, we have decided to stage this protest to attract his attention,” they said. Dr. Senthil Raj assured that he would immediately send a team of Corporation officials to sort out the issue. Rainfall recorded in the district was (in mm): Satankulam 21, Soorangudi 13, Kulasekarapattinam and Kovilpatti 12 each, Thoothukudi 11, Tiruchendur 10, Keezha Arasadi 7, Kayalpattinam, Vaippar and Kazhugumalai 5 each, Kadalkudi 3, Vilathikulam 2, Maniyachi 4 and Ettaiyapuram, Srivaikundam and Ottapidaaram 1 each.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sewage-mixes-with-stagnant-rainwater-in-thoothukudi/article37799840.ece
02 December 2021||Thoothukudi,TAMIL NADU||‘Annual desilting of Puckle Channel will prevent flooding’||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin who is to visit Thoothukudi on Thursday to take a look at the rain-related damages should give clear instructions and freedom to officials to remove within two months all encroachments made across the city in an unbiased manner as a complete drive against illegal structures has not been taken up over the past three decades, say residents. They also prescribe that Puckle Channel that carries sewage into the sea should be desilted properly every year before the onset of northeast monsoon. The serious problems being posed by illegal structures obstructing the free flow of rainwater into drainage channels were first felt in 2018 when Thoothukudi experienced unprecedented flooding. Subsequently, plans were drawn to store rainwater in one area by digging a pond while stormwater drains were built in several places. A decision was taken to remove all encroachments. Though the Corporation started removing the encroachments in every zone on Wednesdays when Jayaseelan was its Commissioner, it was not done in proper manner and abandoned after he was transferred. “Besides badly affecting the smooth movement of vehicles, the encroachments on almost every street of Thoothukudi cause flooding. Instead of finding a lasting solution, the water is pumped out for a few months and the issue is forgotten until the next flooding. So, the Chief Minister should set a deadline to remove all the encroachments in Thoothukudi,” says H. Eugene, a retired VOC Port Trust employee from Bryant Nagar. Moreover, the residents say desilting of Puckle Channel that drains the liquid waste into the sea should be done ahead of every northeast monsoon from its origin near the Food Corporation of India’s godown at Third Mile to Terespuram. Besides constructing Srivaikundam check dam to store surplus water of the Tamirabharani for the benefit of the farmers, British Collector R.K. Puckle also dug the 50-foot-wide mega sewage channel 160 years ago. When encroachers threatened to strangulate the sewage channel, late Chief Minister M. G. Ramachandran relocated them to a new colony in the early 1980s, which is now known as Thalamuthu Nagar. However, the encroachments continued to grow along the bund of Puckle Channel and Thoothukudi municipal administration ignored these illegally built structures when the urban civic body built concrete walls along the channel up to Terespuram. And, the 50-foot-wide channel became only 20 feet wide. “Now, the Corporation is not even properly desilting the 7-km-long channel. Consequently, the city gets inundated for a few months every year. Encroachments are rampant in every street of Thoothuudi,” said A. Placid, an anaesthetist from Poobalarayarpuram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/annual-desilting-of-puckle-channel-will-prevent-flooding/article37799972.ece
02 December 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Concern over prolonged stagnation of rainwater||Prolonged stagnation of water mixed with sewage in several residential colonies in the city has raised fear of outbreak of waterborne diseases. Several parts of the district and the city experienced moderate to heavy rain during the last four weeks except a few days. The current spell of rain that began a day after Deepavali still continues although the intensity of the rain has come down in the last two days. The district recorded many rainy days even before the start of the northeast monsoon in the last week of October. The sub-standard stormwater drain infrastructure of the city that used to get exposed even for a day’s heavy downpour has come under severe strain due to the extended spell of rain since the first week of November. The heavy flow of water in the Koraiyar, the Ariyar and the Kudamuriti caused water inundation in several residential colonies in Edamalaipattipudur, Pirattyur on Tiruchi-Dindigul road, Tiruchi-Vayalur road, Tiruchi-Kuzhumani road and Woraiyur. According to sources, more than 50 residential colonies, mostly situated along the banks of Kudamuriti, have been affected by water inundation for more than two weeks. About 1,000 houses have been partially submerged with water. Fathima Nagar, Beschi Nagar, Linga Nagar, Murugan Nagar, Adhi Nagar, Shanta Sheela Nagar, Ganapathy Nagar, M.M. Nagar and Washermen colony were among the worst hit. The residents of the affected areas undergo severe hardship due to waterlogging. They find it extremely difficult to get essentials for their day-to-day living. People living in low-lying areas and along the banks of the Kudamuriti and the Ariyar are not alone in their suffering. Water stagnation has been reported in almost all residential colonies on Vayalur Road, Wireless Road and Edamalaipattipudur. Most of the vacant sites are stagnated. What is posing grave concern to the residents is the stagnation of water mixed with sewage. The domestic waste discharged from the households in the areas uncovered by the underground drainage network gets mixed with the stagnated water at many places. The faulty underground network is adding to the woes of residents. It has ultimately raised concern among the people over outbreak of waterborne diseases. Vacant sites and inundated colonies have become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. “Houses in my area are partially submerged with sewage-mixed water. We sleep on the bund of the Kudamuriti. With no protection, we undergo the onslaught of mosquito bites,” says S. Subramani of Shanta Sheela Nagar. “Many people in my locality are down with fever for the last few days. It could be due to prolonged water stagnation,” says Selvan of Srinivasa Nagar. Collector S. Sivarasu said that water stagnation in some areas had been an area of concern. Water had been receding fast in several areas. It might take a few days in some areas. He had instructed the Corporation officials to drop oil balls in water stagnated areas. Once oil balls were dropped, they would spread over the water surface to form a filament. It would cut off the oxygen supply to the larvae beneath. The exercise would prevent mosquitoes from laying eggs, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/concern-over-prolonged-stagnation-of-rainwater/article37799601.ece
02 December 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Screening of passengers begins at airport||A team from the health department was deputed to test international passengers arriving in the city as per the revised guidelines of the Centre to test visitors from ‘at risk’ countries in view of identification of a new COVID-19 variant - Omicron. On Wednesday, around 300 passengers were tested and none reported positive on arrival, official sources said. Testing of patients from South Africa, China, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, Mauritius, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Israel and European countries including the U.K. was compulsory on arrival, irrespective of their vaccination status. Flights from Singapore arrived regularly at the airport and the patients were tested. An official said that whether the patient was carrying a negative RT-PCR test certificate or not, post-arrival testing would be conducted. They can leave the airport premises only after the test results are indicated. A team would be present at the airport here to conduct the test round the clock. A separate room has been allotted to conduct the tests and retain patients until the test results arrive. ‘We are conducting Rapid-PCR tests, which would provide results in four hours. Once the results are provided, subject to it, the patient will be asked to go to a hospital where they will undergo treatment or asked to undergo home quarantine, the official said. For patients who test positive, the sample would be sent for genomic testing to identify the variant. Those who test negative must undergo home quarantine for seven days. Another COVID-19 test would be taken on the eighth day following which they must self-monitor. Travellers from other countries would be tested, the official said, as they have been instructed to take random samples. The authorities would monitor passengers who arrived from other countries but had transit points in the ‘at risk’ countries earlier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/screening-of-passengers-begins-at-airport/article37799609.ece

02 December 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Normalcy returns in Tenkasi, Tirunelveli as rain relents||Normalcy is gradually returning as the heavy downpour which was pounding Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts has relented. As there was no rain in Tirunelveli district, schools that remained closed since November 25 afternoon, reopened on Wednesday. However, a holiday was declared for Kallanai Corporation Girls’ Higher Secondary School as knee-deep rainwater was stagnating in front of the school and also on the school campus. On Wednesday, L. Dhaya, 36, of Kattaampuli near Palamadai was washed away in a wild stream near the village. The body was retrieved later. Sources in the Public Works Department and the Department of Rural Development said almost all the rain-fed tanks in the district were either overflowing or about to reach the maximum storage level after the heavy rains in the district on November 17 and 25. All systemised tanks were brimming with water. “Since the rain-fed tanks are also having decent storage of water now, it will phenomenally improve the groundwater table. In other words, the recent rains have ensured good water level in wells too. With the water now available in the systemised and rain-fed tanks and also in the wells, farming operation will get extended even after ‘pisanam’ paddy season. So, farmers will go in for advance ‘kar’ or summer paddy cultivation this year,” said Joint Director of Agriculture Gajendra Pandian.  Rain subsided in Tenkasi district too on Wednesday. Barring the catchment areas of the five reservoirs in the district, all other areas experienced only drizzle while it was a sunny day in Tenkasi. The three-day-long flood in all the waterfalls in Courtallam, especially Main Falls, Five Falls and Old Courtallam Falls, subsided on Wednesday as no rain was reported along the Western Ghats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/normalcy-returns-in-tenkasi-tirunelveli-as-rain-relents/article37799968.ece

02 December 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Awareness key to prevent deaths due to manual scavenging: NCSK chairman||Creating awareness among conservancy workers regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act is key to prevent deaths due to manual scavenging, said Chairman of National Commission for Safai Karamcharis (NCSK) M. Venkatesan here on Wednesday. He visited Tiruppur following the deaths of three persons due to asphyxiation inside an effluent tank of a private dyeing unit that occurred on November 14. Speaking to reporters after inspecting the unit in Veerapandi, he said that the district administration and the police must conduct awareness programmes for conservancy workers and others being engaged to clean sewers and septic tanks once in three months. Warning In addition, the district administration must warn all the owners of dyeing units that no person should be engaged to clean effluent or septic tanks and the authorities concerned must monitor that only machines are being used for cleaning, Mr. Venkatesan said. Apart from imitating action against the owner of such dyeing units, officials who failed to conduct regular inspections must also be subjected to strict action, the NCSK chairman said. On November 14, Vadivel (32), a daily wage labourer who was engaged illegally to clean the effluent tank of the dyeing unit at Veerapandi within Tiruppur City Police limits, died after inhaling noxious fumes. Two of the unit’s employees manager Dinesh Pandian (28) and fitter Rajendran (55), who entered the tank to rescue Vadivel, had also died. The Veerapandi police arrested the unit’s owner Dhanalakshmi on the same day. Out of Rs. 8.25 lakh solatium under the SC/ST Act, the district administration has provided around Rs. 4 lakh each to the kin of the two deceased who belonged to a Scheduled Caste and will disburse the remaining amount soon, Mr. Venkatesan said. Along with District Collector S. Vineeth, he visited the residence of the deceased on Wednesday evening. Mr. Venkatesan will chair a review meeting at the District Collectorate in Tiruppur on Thursday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/awareness-key-to-prevent-deaths-due-to-manual-scavenging-ncsk-chairman/article37799540.ece
02 December 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Residents want footpaths in Ketti Palada||Residents of Siva Senthoor Nagar in Ketti Palada near Coonoor have demanded footpaths leading to their settlement where over a 100 families reside. The families, primarily daily wage workers, involved in work in carrot farms, carrot cleaning machines and tea estates, said the local panchayat had failed to provide basic facilities to their settlement, such as proper street lighting and walking paths into the settlement. “As a result, there are only mud paths between the houses, which get very slippery during the rain and are a hazard for the residents, especially senior citizens,” said R. Hariharan, a resident of Ketti Palada. Local residents said they had submitted petitions to various local authorities requesting the construction of a walking path into the residential colony. However, no action had been taken so far. “Some houses don’t have running water. So, many residents have to carry heavy loads of water from nearby public taps and tanks back to the settlement,” said R. Kumaran, another resident. Such are the issues faced by residents that people needing emergency medical care too need to walk along the hazardous mud paths to the main road. On Tuesday, a person passed away from the village due to natural causes. More than six residents had to carry the body to get to the main road from where it was taken to a crematorium. “We hope that the district administration will take notice of the problems faced by people every day and take steps to make their lives easier,” said Mr. Hariharan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-want-footpaths-in-ketti-palada/article37799530.ece

02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||AIADMK decides to retain dual leadership||Wednesday’s decision marked the return of the mode of election for the general secretary which was in effect when M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa were at the helm. The executive decided that the election for the two posts be held through a single vote. It also decided that the condition for the new mode of election was beyond any amendment. Mr. Panneerselvam, Mr. Palaniswami and deputy coordinators K.P. Munusamy and R. Vaithilingam were among those present at the meeting. Out of 270 members, 258 took part at the meeting. All the changes were incorporated in a resolution, which was passed by the executive. They will have to be ratified by the general council. Interim chairman Earlier, Tamilmagan Hussain, secretary of the MGR Mandrams and former chairperson of the Wakf Board, was appointed interim chairman of the presidium. The post fell vacant after the death of E. Madhusudanan four months ago. Mr. Hussain’s appointment took place, almost 12 hours after the party expelled former Ramanathapuram MP A. Anwhar Raajhaa. A senior functionary felt that the change in the mode of election would strengthen the hands of Mr. Panneerselvam as the possibility of his getting removed through a majority of the general council members was eliminated. It also signalled that no section of the party could use the general council to elect anyone for the post of coordinator or co-coordinator. A perusal of the data on the number of persons who had filed affidavits before the Election Commission in 2017 at the time of the split reveals that the strength of the group in which Mr. Palaniswami was originally present was 1,912 out of 2,128, as on March 2017. Six months later, after Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselvam came together, there were 1,877 members on their side. Sources explain that since then, there have been restructuring of the party units, increasing the number of general council members by around 1,000. Another office-bearer, not concurring with his colleague’s view, said the single vote system meant Mr. Panneerselvam and Mr. Palaniswami would continue to sail together. “There is every chance of the two getting elected unopposed when the organisational elections take place,” he said. The amendments, he added, had been made because the extension of time, granted by the Election Commission for the inner party elections, would expire by this month-end. ‘Sense of bonhomie’ A former Minister said the takeaway was “a sense of bonhomie” between the coordinator and the co-coordinator. He pointed out that the two leaders recalled how each consoled the other at the time of bereavement in their families. “This should logically lend more cohesion to the party...” Organisation secretary D. Jayakumar said later that the meeting went off peacefully. Justifying the action against Mr. Raajhaa, he said that if the trend of disclosing the details of deliberations held at the party forum was not curbed, everyone would start criticising the party decisions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aiadmk-decides-to-retain-dual-leadership/article37799478.ece

02 December 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Preparations under way for Legislature session in Belagavi||The Belagavi district administration is making a series of preparations for holding the winter session of the Legislature. The State Government has appointed senior KAS officer Suresh Itnal as the special officer for the winter session. Deputy Commissioner R. Venkatesh Kumar has formed several committees to prepare for the session and to supervise logistics. The Chief Minister and other senior members of the Cabinet will stay at the Visvesvaraya Technological University Guest House and the PWD Circuit House. As many as 1,800 rooms have been booked in various lodges, resorts and guesthouses. However, the hoteliers are not happy as the officers have told them that they will be paid room rent based on 2018 rates. “Inflation has hit us hard and we are forced to raise tariff. But the government is not allowing it. This is injustice,” said Harish Kumar Shetty, who runs a hotel. The association of hoteliers has given a memorandum to the government seeking an increase in rates, he added. On Thursday, Speaker Vishveshwar Hegde Kageri and Legislative Council Chairman Basavaraj Hortatti will hold meetings at the Suvarna Soudha to review preparations. On Wednesday, Secretary of the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms P. Hemalatha visited the Suvarna Soudha for a review of the preparations. She visited the chambers of presiding officers, banquet hall, corridors of the ruling and Opposition parties, central hall, canteen, officers cubicles and the security system. She asked officers to ensure that there was no crowding during lunch. Lunch can be started early, she told them. A special team should oversee the implementation of COVID-19 protocol, she said. If RT-PCR test is made mandatory, then officers should have a place and staff ready to conduct tests and to check certificates, she said. She also asked officers to ensure that power supply is not disrupted and internet facilities are seamless. Mr. Venkatesh Kumar, PWD Executive Engineer Sanjiv Kumar Hulkai, Police Commissioner K. Thiyagarajan, Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Darshan H.V. and Dr. Itnal and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/preparations-under-way-for-legislature-session-in-belagavi/article37799657.ece
02 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Testing delays at KIA leave passengers anxious||A delay in getting the COVID-19 test results left many passengers who had flown in to Kempegowda International Airport on Wednesday anxious. With the alert raised with regard to Omicron, a new variant of COVID-19, surveillance activities have been intensified. International passengers are being tested on arrival, even if they possess a negative RT-PCR report. High volume A statement by the Bengaluru International Airport Ltd. (BIAL) stated that a total of 1,228 international passengers had arrived at the airport from at-risk countries on Wednesday (from midnight to 2 p.m.). Owing to a high volume of passengers who had to undergo RT-PCR testing, the service provider who operates the laboratory at the airport experienced some delays in processing test results. A spokesperson from BIAL also stated that a delay in one of the flights also contributed to the delay. Due to the influx of passengers, the service provider’s system crashed briefly. “We have ramped up arrangements for testing,” the spokesperson added. Since late last year, a round-the-clock testing centre has been functioning at the KIA. Usually, the results of Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) is ready within an hour and the regular RT-PCR test result takes around five to six hours. Passengers are made to wait at the lounge until the results are declared. “In the coming days, the laboratory will be scaling up operations to cater to the increasing volume. We have made adequate seating arrangements for passengers to wait for RT-PCR results. Our teams have been extending all support to the COVID-19 testing laboratory and State government. We have been constantly working closely with all airlines and other stakeholders to minimise inconvenience to passengers,” the BIAL statement added. Meanwhile, the Health and Family Welfare Services has posted officials round-the-clock to monitor and supervise the surveillance activities at the airport, ensure necessary arrangements are made for passengers to comply with COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. That apart, the officials will also monitor collection of information on arrivals, testing protocols, status of the testing laboratory, besidessending positive samples of travellers from at-risk countries for genome sequencing and shift them immediately to the designated health care facility.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/testing-delays-at-kia-leave-passengers-anxious/article37799443.ece

Sudhakar has ruled out the possibility of withdrawing government benefits or levying penalties for people who have not taken a vaccine against COVID-19. He was reacting to the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) recommending withdrawal of government benefits, such as ration, pension, electricity and water supply, domestic gas cylinder and petrol or diesel, for people who have not been vaccinated. “Experts have made this recommendation. But we cannot implement this as it will bring a bad name to the government. Instead we will motivate people to come forward and get vaccinated as it is in their own interest,” he said on December 1. “Health personnel are going door-to-door in rural areas under the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ programme to motivate people to get vaccinated against COVID-19,” he said. However, the government is likely to issue an order making two-dose vaccination mandatory for use of public amenities, including Namma Metro services and buses, hotels, shopping complexes, malls and other public facilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/karnataka-rules-out-penalties-on-those-who-have-not-taken-covid-19-vaccine/article37799446.ece

One of them is to restrict entry of unvaccinated persons to parks, theatres, malls and other public places, and testing at least 10% students in schools every month.

The State Government has increased the fees in Government engineering colleges for the 2021-22 academic year by Rs. 10,000 from the previous academic year. According to a note issued by the Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA), Rs. 10,000 has been added as ‘other fees’. Overall, students will be paying Rs. 33,810 now. Sources in the Higher Education Department said that colleges were allowed to hike the fees by Rs. 10,000 to upgrade their infrastructure. “For several years, the fees in Government engineering colleges were not hiked. Engineering colleges had to wait for funds from the Government if they had to upgrade their infrastructure. As a result of this, many Government engineering colleges had obsolete laboratories and dilapidated classrooms,” a source in the department said, justifying the hike. Incidentally, the fees for Government quota and private quota seats in private engineering colleges were not hiked this year. Students and student organisations have questioned the hike in fees in Government colleges during the pandemic. “Majority of students from middle class families who have toiled hard will be eyeing seats in Government engineering colleges through the CET counselling. Even a marginal hike in fees will may professional education out of their reach,” said Shreyas S., an engineering seat aspirant. Many students were taken by surprise as the notification was issued only on Tuesday after the first round of seat allotment was done. Sithara H. M, Bengaluru district president, All India Democratic Students' Organisation (AIDSO) said due to the pandemic, many students in rural areas have given up their dreams of higher education. “Many students in rural communities, whose families’ livelihood depends on agriculture, are affected a lot due to heavy rains. Moreover, the additional fees has been announced during a crisis at the last moment, which has shocked students. ” Amaresh Kadagada, State President, Students Federation of India said that they had convened a meeting on Thursday in this regard. “If the fee hike is not rolled back, we will protest and stay put in front of the Higher Education Minister’s residence,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/engineering-fee-in-govt-colleges-hiked/article37799436.ece

02 December 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||State Bank choc-a-bloc as buses, other vehicles jostle for space||Hasty implementation of the Clock Tower-Clock Tower circular one-way has left the Central Business District, particularly the State Bank area, choc-a-bloc as city buses are back at their earlier place as bus operators say that the space inside State Bank terminal does not have any amenities. While many operators feel the one-way rule was not at all required for the existing traffic volume, they feel the administration at least could have waited till all the Smart City works in the Central Business District were completed before enforcing the one-way rule. Consequently, all city buses line up on Maidan Road near State Bank while private vehicles and autorickshaws are forced to move on the one-way from A.B. Shetty Circle even as they jostle for space to inch forward. Amenities Dakshina Kannada Bus Operators Association president Jayasheela Adyanthaya told The Hindu on Wednesday that the space earmarked for city buses inside the terminal did not have any facility, including shelters for passengers, rest rooms and even bitumen/concrete surface. Hence, the association has requested the district administration to allow city buses to operate from their earlier location till the Mangaluru City Corporation or Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. (MSCL) provide the necessary arrangements. Mr. Adyanthaya said that the ideal plan is that the left lane of the Maidan Road, from Clock Tower (Mini Vidhana Soudha) till Lady Goschen Hospital via State Bank should have been earmarked for movement of city buses. Entering the State Bank terminal by taking a right turn just after Rao and Rao Circle, leaving the terminal at the next exit and joining the left lane thereafter has become a hassle for the bus crew in the midst of all other vehicles that move on the one-way, he said. ‘Not developed’ Association’s immediate past-president Dilraj Alva said that though operators were opposed to the one-way rule, they heeded to the district administration when it said that the measure would ensure seamless vehicular movement. Despite abundant space inside the terminal after the tempo stand was moved out, it was not developed as a city bus terminal, Mr. Alva regretted. Mr. Adyanthaya said that the administration should have allowed movement of smaller vehicles from A.B. Shetty Circle towards Mini Vidhana Soudha on the present one-way so as to reduce traffic volumes in the State Bank area. Steps taken Corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar said that the space inside the terminal was being developed and city buses would move in shortly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-bank-choc-a-bloc-as-buses-other-vehicles-jostle-for-space/article37799858.ece

02 December 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Chamundi Hills landslip: Call to convert road into trekking path||A technical committee of the Institution of Engineers, Mysuru local centre, has suggested that the road leading to Nandi at Chamundi Hills which witnessed repeated landslips during the recent rains, should be closed to vehicles and instead be converted to a trekking path. The committee members visited the site of landslips on November 19 and collected data and saw vulnerable sections of the road. The report, with technical details explaining the cause of the landslip and providing options on what could be done, was submitted to Deputy Commissioner Bagadi Gautham on Wednesday. While one option was to repair the road, which would cost nearly Rs. 30 crore, the members said the stretch will require heavy and repeated expenditure for maintenance and repairs and there would be no guarantee of its continuing to provide motorable communication from the view point to Nandi statue. Another option was to abandon the linking road for traffic as there was an alternative road to Nandi besides the steps. The damaged 1.4 km of road could be converted to a trekking path which provides a good view of Mysuru, according to the experts. This will also result in considerable savings, the report said. The committee comprised S.G. Sudhir Vombatkere, M. Lakshman, B.S. Prabahakara, H.S. Suresh Babu, H. Kishore Chandra, and M.K. Nanjaiah. The report said the link road from the view point to Nandi statue, where the landslips took place, was constructed in 1903. A 20m stretch of the road collapsed in September 2019 and it was repaired by constructing a retaining wall and filling earth behind it. But there were landslips on October 10, November 4, and November 18. The spot visit indicated that other sectors of the road showed signs of distress and attributed it to incessant rains and the inability of the longitudinal-cross drainage system to handle the volume of water. The report cautioned that hill slopes devoid of trees and undergrowth cover would be prone to saturation-erosion failure than forested slopes. In case the authorities preferred to repair the road, the committee cautioned that climate change induced heavy rainfall with increasing frequency and high intensity is expected to increase and may create a situation of saturation-erosion-slope failure and avalanches in hilly terrains. Even mild seismic tremors will aggravate the instability of the hill slopes which are already weakened by saturation and erosion. Apart from calling for closing the roads to traffic and developing it to a trekking path, the committee said the savings can be utilised to take up slope protection measures and preserve the environment of Chamundi Hills.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/chamundi-hills-landslip-call-to-convert-road-into-trekking-path/article37799879.ece

Police protection The officials who reached the place with police protection in the morning were met with strong protests. The agitators demanded a change in the alignment of the SilverLine project, a semi-high-speed rail project to link Kasaragod in the north to Thiruvananthapuram in the south, by avoiding wetland and paddy fields in the area. The protesters clashed with the police after they tried to prevent the officials from carrying out the inspection. The police arrested a number of the agitators but who were later released on bail. Despite the protests, the officials were able to complete the job. Residents in a number of grama panchayats in Mavelikara and Chengannur taluks have recently formed action councils and launched agitations against the SilverLine project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tension-as-protesters-block-k-rail-survey/article37799804.ece

The number of doses administered this Wednesday is over 20% more than last Wednesday’s coverage. With a total of 9,23,690 doses administered till 7.30 p.m, the total number of doses touched 7,54,00383. Of these, 4,50,61,519 are first doses and 3,03,38,864 are second doses. Omicron scare The State that had crossed seven crore doses on November 20 administered over 54 lakh doses in the last 10 days. In fact, there has been a rise in the number of people turning up at vaccination centres to get inoculated in the last six days following the Omicron scare. Since November 25 when 2,69,776 doses were administered, a total of 30,69,119 (including today’s numbers) have been administered in the last one week. “After today’s coverage, we still have about 39.5 lakh people who are due for the second dose. We have also extended the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign till December end wherein our health workers will visit door to door to motivate people and get them to the vaccination centres for the jab. This campaign has so far received a good response,” said Arundathi Chandrashekar, State Mission Director, National Health Mission. Hoping more people will turn up during the ‘lasika utsava’ campaign, the Health Department had fixed a target of inoculating 30 lakh people on Wednesday. “We are hopeful of crossing over 10 lakh by the end of the day today,” she said. With a target population of 4.89 crore, the State has a task of administering a total of 9.78 crore doses (first and second doses included). With 7.54 crore doses administered till date, the State has achieved a cumulative coverage of 77%. The challenge is to administer the remaining 2.24 crore doses. By the end of Wednesday, the State had a stock of 72 lakh doses. Seventh place The State is now in the seventh position in the country after Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Gujarat. On September 17, during the mega vaccination drive that coincided with the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the State had achieved a milestone with the total number of vaccinations crossing five crore. It took over 75 days for it to administer another 2.5 two crore doses. The State has been conducting special vaccination camps every Wednesday with a target to administer 10 lakh doses. However, with not many people coming forward to get jabbed, the State has been able to administer around five to six lakh doses only every Wednesday. COVID-19 vaccination was rolled out on January 16 for healthcare workers followed by frontline workers in the first and second phases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/673-of-eligible-population-in-karnataka-fully-vaccinated/article37799453.ece

According to the post-blossom estimation of the Coffee Board, the total production of coffee in the State during the 2021-22 fiscal is 70,570 tonne, including 59,320 tonne from Wayanad, 8,550 tonne from Idukki district, and 2,700 tonne from Nelliampathy in Palakkad district. But the growers said that the production might decline by more than 20% this season owing to the untimely rainfall pattern. “Usually, we start our harvest by the first week of November, but we could not even start it by the end of the month owing to the untimely rain,” said Ali Ibran, a coffee grower at Mananthavady in the district. Rampant berry drop owing to the rain in the past one month is the major concern of growers. “Nearly 15% to 20% of ripened beans on my plantation fell due to the rain,” Mr. Ibran, who is also a director board member of the Wayanad Coffee Growers’ Association (WCGA), said. Many regions such as Mananthavady got poor rainfall during the blooming stage of coffee, hence, the setting of coffee berries as also very low, he said. The WCGA has estimated the loss at Rs. 56 crore in Wayanad district alone. The Coffee Board has suggested preparation of parchment coffee and pulping the berries during the rainy days as a better option, but such facilities were far from the reach of small growers, said A. Chandran, a small-scale coffee grower at Pampadumpara in Idukki district. Though the State Government had announced a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs. 90 for a kg of Robusta raw cherry in its 2021 budget, the agencies tasked with the purpose was yet to procure a single kilogram of coffee so far, Prasanth Rajesh, president, WCGA, said. Shortage of workers The dearth of workers, especially women, was a matter of concern of farmers in the district after the COVID-19 outbreak. The inflow of labourers from Gundlupet and Coorg of Karnataka during the coffee harvesting season also decreased considerably this year owing to the pandemic, Mr. Rajesh said. If the services of the workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme were extended to farming works such as coffee plucking, it would be of great help for the farming community, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/coffee-growers-cup-of-woes-brims-over/article37799724.ece

The Bench comprising Justice A.K Jayasankaran Nambiar and Justice Gopinath P. also directed the Corporation to file a report regarding the measures taken by it in three weeks. The Corporation submitted that steps were afoot for the construction of a new building replete with all facilities for carrying out ABC (animal birth control) procedures and the structure would be in place within a period of three months. The new facility was being planned since the existing one at Pettah and Vandithadam were deemed inadequate. Steps had already been taken to alleviate the condition of dogs housed in the kennels in the facility by laying floor mats, apart from ensuring that there was no overcrowding in doghouses, it said. The Bench also directed the Corporation to seek the assistance of established animal welfare groups functioning within the area, preferably those registered with the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), for the welfare of community dogs.

The detailed assessment carried out by the Regional Directorate (South) of the CPCB stated that the now defunct Edayar Zinc Ltd. (formerly Binani Zinc Ltd.) was responsible for causing the contamination. The remediation work may be executed by the industry as per the detailed project report prepared by the Central board, it said. The report has been filed before the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal, which had issued orders earlier to ascertain the source of contamination of Edayattuchal and Chakkarachal paddy fields. Samples were taken by the research team from 115 soil boreholes, 11 monitoring wells, nine sediment boreholes, and 15 open wells. Heavy metals that include zinc, iron, cadmium and chromium in soil were exceeding the screening criteria, mainly within the southern portion of the Edayattuchal and Chakkarachal paddy fields. No soil impact is identified within the residential area adjacent to the paddy fields, it said. Heavy metals were identified in groundwater exceeding the screening criteria and localised within the boundaries of the paddy fields. The jarosite storage facilities located within the northern portion of the industry remain the primary source of contamination. The secondary potential sources include the groundwater contaminated due to leaching from primary sources, contaminated soil and sediments in flooded/marshy zones and contaminants distributed owing to flooding. Quoting local residents, the report said that unauthorised discharge of effluents was through a drain on the southern extreme side of the Edayattuchal paddy fields. Discharge of effluents was also reported within the Chakkarachal paddy fields. Surface water discharge was observed on the southern portion of Edayattuchal, originating from the industrial area. The exact origin of the effluent discharge was not traced, it said. The company authorities had earlier requested the tribunal to fix the liability only on the basis of proper evidence as they were not the only industry in the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/heavy-metals-contaminating-edayar-paddy-fields-finds-study/article37799764.ece

A.B. Babu, a member of the committee, wrote to Ernakulam District Collector Jafer Malik, who heads the monitoring committee, that the decision was in violation of the guidelines issued by the Kerala High Court and the Supreme Court. Mr. Babu also said that the decision amounted to contempt of court. A meeting of the Elephant Monitoring Committee, which was chaired by the District Collector on November 22, had decided not to allow the request of the elephant owners to increase the number of elephants to be paraded in the festival. The High Court and the Supreme Court had ordered that the district Elephant Monitoring Committee was the sole agency which could decide on all matters related to parading of elephants. However, it was learnt that the Collector had issued permission for parading 11 elephants. The decision amounted to contempt of court as it was not ratified by the monitoring committee, he said. However, the Collector maintained that the decision to allow the parading of 11 elephants was taken by him as entrusted by the committee. The Thripunithura temple had permission to parade 15 elephants. The temple authorities, who were earlier permitted to parade seven elephants, had approached him for increasing the number of animals to 15 citing customary practices. The fact that some of the temples in the State were permitted to parade increased number of elephants during the current festival period was also considered, said Mr. Malik. Though the demand was for parading 15 elephants, the Thripunithura temple was allowed to parade 11 elephants, considering the improved COVID situation, temple rituals and other aspects, he said.

02 December 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Crackdown to rid the city of child beggary||The district Childline Advisory Board (CAB) has decided to crack the whip on child begging by conducting at least two special drives every month. The decision comes in the wake of rising child begging cases since the pandemic. Three children, including a toddler, found used for begging by their sister were rescued by the Childline authorities from the Edappally metro station recently. The action was undertaken on the direction of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and the children, originally from Rajasthan, were moved to a shelter home. “That operation had an almost immediate impact as the number of child begging cases dropped dramatically, leaving us with the impression that an organised and interconnected network is involved behind child begging. They seem to have sent the message across to lie low for the moment in the wake of the rescue mission. The hotels frequented and the mode of transport, including metro, used by handlers of child beggars also point to the presence of an organised network,” said Harikrishna S., Ernakulam Centre Coordinator, Childline. Childline receives, on average, around 30 alerts of child begging from the public in a month. Rescuing children is often tough as the handlers take to heel with them through busy junctions with little regard for their safety at the first sign of a potential crackdown. “KPCC Junction, Marine Drive, Vyttila and Edappally Junctions and Kaloor are places where child begging is rampant. Often children are found to be from States like Rajasthan, Odisha, Assam, and Tamil Nadu. The risk of unattended children getting caught in traffic and knocked down by motorists also remain high,” said Arun Thankachan, Childline district coordinator. The sale of articles is often a ruse for using children for begging. A middleman who used to procure these from Delhi and offered them for sale along junctions were tracked down and warned by the authorities recently. “Children from other States rescued from begging are moved to shelters temporarily and are then transferred to their home States through the respective CWC if they have relatives back there. In the case where their parents are also here, they would be restored with them. But where the immediate family is found to be extremely vulnerable, the children will be either kept in the care of shelter homes or given away in foster care with the consent of biological parents in view of their best interests,” said Bitty Joseph, Chairperson, CWC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/crackdown-to-rid-the-city-of-child-beggary/article37799755.ece
02 December 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Man-missing case: probe team seeks more time||The police on Wednesday informed the Kerala High Court that the investigation team is not in a position to rule out the role of CPI(M) internal political disputes at Thottappally in the missing of Sajeevan, a CPI(M) worker, even as they sought more time to trace the missing party member. The submission was made by the police when a habeas corpus petition filed by the wife of Sajeevan seeking a directive to the police to trace and produce her husband came up for hearing. In a statement, the police submitted that Sajeevan was found missing on the previous day of the branch committee election at Poothoppu. During the investigation, it was learnt that certain factional elements were working in connection with the CPI(M) branch committee election. In fact, all the branch secretaries and branch members of the local committee were interrogated. More people had to be interrogated. An in-depth investigation was being conducted by the police team. The police said Sajeevan was a supporter of the ongoing protest against mineral sand transportation from the Thottappally estuary by the Kerala Minerals nad Metals Limited (KMML) and he acted as satyagrahi a day. He had no rivals in local politics or in the community or from the fishing field. Sajeevan was seen in the CCTV camera outside the harbour areas at 1.08 p.m. on September 29 walking southwards along the panchayat road. People living in the area testified that he had moved towards the northern side of the sea mouth. Nobody had reported having seen him coming back. Auto driver Besides, an autorickshaw driver told the police that he had picked Sajeevan from Puthennnad on the National Highway and dropped him at the Thottappaly spillway south junction at 1.30 p.m. However, nobody saw Sanjeevan coming and getting down from the autorickshaw, the police said. The police had recorded the statements of 108 persons so far and many call detail record had been analysed. Moreover, more persons had to be questioned.

BIS stipulation The Bureau of Indian Standards has stipulated that all gold jewellers should provide the unique identification number for the jewellery they sell to ensure that customers got the gold of the stipulated purity as per international standards. Idukki has been exempted because there are no hallmarking facilities in the district. Seven States, including those in the North-East of India and Union Territories are exempted from the hallmarking stipulation, said sources in the Gold and Silver Merchants’ Association of India. They said that though punitive action could be initiated against gold jewellery selling products without hallmarking from December 1, sales had not been affected. S. Abdul Nazar, director, All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council, said that the gold market had been a little dull in Kerala after the Onam season, but the yellow metal continued to be a safe haven for investors, who have helped the market keep a steady pace over the recent months. There are around 15,000 gold jewellers in the State, of whom around 7,000 have taken GST licences and around 5,300 have taken BIS registration, Mr. Nazar said. Around 1.14 lakh jewellers across India had taken the BIS registration, he said. Though only those outlets recording a business turnover of over Rs. 40 lakh per year need to take a GST licence, they are all required to sell only products with unique identification numbers. Mr. Nazar said there were several issues that remained unresolved. For instance, he said, gold ornaments below the weight of two grams need not have unique identification numbers. However, it still remained a question whether a pair of ear-rings weighing 1.5 grams each should be treated separately or as a pair weighing three grams. Five lakh workers It is estimated that there are around five lakh workers in the gold jewellery segment in Kerala, including manufacturers, retailers, artisans and around eight lakh families dependent on the segment for their livelihood directly and indirectly. The total gold business is estimated to be Rs. 50,000 crore annually in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/unique-identification-for-gold-jewellery-comes-into-effect/article37799726.ece

The remediation of contaminated soil has to be handled by excavation and off-site disposal in a common hazardous treatment, storage and disposal facility. The cost for excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soil at Edayattuchal and Chakkarachal with stabilisation is estimated at Rs. 12.9 crore. Around 6.9 cubic metres of contaminated soil has to be excavated from all the affected areas (excluding the jarosite pond). About 20 lakh cubic metres of groundwater has to be treated as per the estimates by the board. It can be done using the pump and treated along with ex-situ treatment with pressure and sand filter or activated carbon filter. Around 8.5 lakh tonnes of jarosite have been placed in the three ponds, which were not constructed properly to prevent migration of contaminants. The waste has to be excavated and transferred to the existing pond. This pond has to be capped, besides initiating a long-term operation and monitoring effort. The estimated cost for remediation of the contaminated sites in Edayar is about Rs. 47.8 crore. The CPCB has informed the tribunal that the remediation work may be executed by Edayar Zinc Ltd. under the supervision of the State Pollution Control Board. The State board could also engage any competent consultant to monitor and verify the works, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/elaborate-process-mooted-to-carry-out-remediation-works/article37799762.ece

The civic authorities of Kochi have decided to give time for the street vendors, who are yet to apply for the licence, till December 5 to submit their applications. Earlier, the Town Vending Committee had cleared the applications of 1,989 persons and issued licences. Incidentally, the Kerala High Court had last month asked the Kochi Corporation to permit only licensed vendors to carry out street vending within the limits of the corporation from December 1. The court asked also asked the local body to complete the issuance of the identity cards and certificates of vending before November 30. The court had also instructed the street vendors who had not obtained the licences to approach the Town Vending Committee.  According to a civic administrator, the process of vetting the applications and finalising the list and the identification of the vending zones got stuck in the model code of conduct that came into force following the announcement of the bypoll to the Gandhi Nagar division of the Kochi Corporation. It may require some more time for the local body to implement the programme. The civic body is keen on implementing the programme by evolving a consensus among various stakeholders. The vendors need to be shifted to the zones identified for the purpose, he said. Meanwhile, the draft list of vending zones identified by an agency engaged by the corporation is understood to have evoked a sharp response. There were objections regarding some of the zones, which were primarily identified.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/licensing-of-street-vendors-may-be-delayed/article37799753.ece

While the first FIR against the institute was registered on October 9 on a petition by Vijesh P.M. of Chengamanad, the other two were registered on November 27 after the petitioners, Muhammad Aslam of Alangad and Prince Varghese of Idukki, got them endorsed by the Kalamassery First Class Judicial Magistrate through criminal miscellaneous petitions (CMPs). A similar FIR has been registered against the Thrissur branch of the institute at the Chalissery police station in Palakkad based on a CMP filed by Shamsudheen P. All the petitioners had claimed to have paid between Rs. 1.25 lakh and Rs. 1.35 lakh for the 52-day programme offering seven certification courses, including the ones recognised by authorised agencies in India and abroad. The allegations levelled against the institute included not conducting the course nor issuing the certificates on time besides issuing forged certificates. “Instead of issuing authentic certificates by the authority concerned, we were issued forged certificates. Besides, a multiple choice question exam was held arbitrarily after which even the question papers were taken away and results were given over WhatsApp. Candidates were deliberately made to fail and extra fees were collected for reappearance,” said Mr. Vijesh, a fitness trainer who joined the course in April. Allegation denied However, Sandeep R. Menon, executive director of IBIS Academy, dubbed the petitions as a vicious and instigated campaign by a Kannur-based lobby. “We have all the necessary accreditations and are authorised to issue certificates. The same bunch of people are filing petitions against us in different places. Some of them wanted to be issued certificates without clearing the exams and we didn’t budge,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/three-firs-against-fitness-institute-on-cheating-forgery-charge/article37799760.ece

The city police have reportedly come across incriminating videos and pictures suggesting that he had been leading a debauched life. He is found to have participated in parties where he used or abused drugs. “We have identified different locations within the district and outside where he has used drugs. We have alerted the police stations concerned to gather evidence and register cases under the NDPS Act,” said C.H. Nagaraju, District Police Chief (Kochi City). Asked whether Syju was into dealing in drugs as well, Mr. Nagaraju said it needed to be investigated. “Since he has been found in the company of so many different groups, logic suggests that he was either the supplier or the common link,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/syju-may-be-slapped-with-multiple-cases/article37799759.ece

The year 2020 offered no solace, but by then they could identify some visible changes in the estuarine ecosystem. And today, their worst fears have come true as the fluctuations in hydrographic parameters have affected the spawning season of yellow clams ( Paphia malabarica ). Normally, the annual three-month ban on harvest begins in December, but inconsistent salinity and surface temperature has forced the Fisheries department to push it to January. No stock left “In earlier times we could spot huge numbers of pea-sized bivalves during November-December. But this year we stopped collecting clams some two months ago as there was hardly any stock left. The clam collectors and women engaged in allied activities have been in total distress after the floods of 2018. Everything including the depth and current has changed over the years due to unscientific interventions and climate change. At present we have hit the rock bottom,” says Prasannan, clam collector. The decision to move the ban has been taken by the Clam Governing Council that manages the Marine Stewardship Council-certified fishery. “For the last three years we are experiencing a change in the intensity and pattern of rain. Usually the waterbody will achieve the salinity level required for spawning by November, but this year the situation is different. It's for the first time we are changing the ban period,” says K.Suhair, Deputy Director, Fisheries Department. As part of efforts to replenish the stock and protect the livelihood of clam collectors, the Fisheries Department had set up sanctuaries in Ashtamudi and at present there is no seed to carry out relaying or collect the broodstock. “Whether the ban should be pushed permanently to January or February will be decided after further studies by various expert bodies including the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI),” Mr. Suhair says. Apart from erratic rain and freshwater influx, sedimentation is also posing a huge challenge to the larval settlement. Replenished “Right now our clam beds are nearly empty. After the ban ends in April, the stocks may get replenished due to the long six-month window. The Fisheries Department has also promised to procure seeds from Vizhinjam hatchery and relay them in Ashtamudi. At present we are pinning our hopes on that,” adds Prasannan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/clam-collectors-a-worried-lot/article37799797.ece

Resource persons representing the Tourism Department and various professional institutions will lend a hand to the DTPC to proceed with the project. The proposal for training comes in the wake of homestay operators and other local tourism facility owners hosting a large numbers of international and domestic tourists during peak seasons. The department hopes that grooming such entrepreneurs by sharing with them latest trends in the field will evoke a very favourable response from tourists and fetch its direct benefits to entrepreneurs. The training programmes, which are expected to begin in December, mainly aim at entrepreneurs who own rated homestays or service apartments registered with the DTPC. Those who manage heritage homes or facilitate tent camps in villages can also take advantage of the proposed training sessions. Tourism Department officials say owners of homestays, heritage homes and service villas have great opportunities in the Responsible Tourism sector with a lot of aids and welfare packages. At the same time, experienced entrepreneurs say they want a simplified guideline for the registration and rating of village tourism facilities. They also fear that the tie-up with any government body will drag them to tax burdens. Many of them point out that the existing formalities to secure star rating for homestays are “unbearable” for small-scale investors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/dtpc-to-impart-training-to-operators-of-tourism-facilities/article37799735.ece

The coordination committee, a forum of leaders of various Muslim organisations, met here the other day under the initiative of the Indian Union Muslim League. . CPI(M) flays move The CPI(M) State secretariat in a statement in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday took strong exception to the decision to use mosques as platforms for ‘anti-government campaign’. Warning that the decision would create tension as believers hold different political loyalties, the statement alleged that the IUML was exploiting religious sentiments to avert the educated Muslim youths getting closer to the CPI(M). The Congress and other parties in the United Democratic Front should express their views on the move to use mosques for anti-government campaign. In a Facebook post, K.T. Jaleel, Minister in the previous Pinarayi Vijayan Cabinet, has also deplored the call. He said the Sunni faction led by Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musaliyar distanced itself from the call because the move was motivated by political hostility. Even the president of the Samastha faction of Sunnis Jifri Muthukoya Thangal and general secretary Alikutty Musaliyar had not attended the meeting held in Kozhikode, he added. “They [IUML leaders] should realise that mosques are not offices of the IUML,” Dr. Jaleel said warning that the IUML’s move should endanger religious harmony in the State. IUML stance Meanwhile, IUML State general secretary P.M.A. Salam clarified that the decision to hold awareness programme in mosques was not taken by the IUML. Reacting to the criticism against the decision, he said it was taken by the leadership of various Muslim organisations to express their protest against the move to entrust Waqf Board postings to the PSC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-for-campaign-in-mosques-triggers-row/article37799820.ece
02 December 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Unauthorised tattooing continues to flourish despite ban||The State Government’s bid to regulate unauthorised and unhealthy tattooing in public places seems to have not hit the target. People not trained in tattooing continue to do the job using unhygienic needles, exposing their clients to serious infectious diseases. It was on April 29 this year that the Health and Family Welfare Department issued an order making a licence mandatory for those engaged in tattooing. It was pointed out that unauthorised tattooing was prevalent on temple premises and festival grounds, and in street corners and shops. The order had said that “because of the use of the same needle that is not disinfected and the same ink on many people, there is a chance of infection and serious illnesses that could also spread among others.” The order quoted a report of the Director of Health Services that said there was a possibility of allergic reactions, swelling where the needle is injected, skin tuberculosis, and cancer. Hepatitis B, Hepatitis V, HIV and tetanus may spread because of the use of unhygienic needles and syringes, the report said. Magician Shiju Manohar Kottiyam, on whose complaint the government had issued the order, claimed that no attempt had been made to enforce it. The order said that only licensed agencies would be allowed to engage in tattooing. The ink used should be approved by the Drugs Control Authority. Those who did the job should wear gloves and remove it after the job. Sealed packets The needles and the tubes containing ink should be in disposable or sealed labelled packet. All non-disposable equipment should be disinfected. Those who do the job should take Hep-B vaccine and the body part should be thoroughly cleaned before and after. Cleanliness should be ensured at the place where tattooing is done. Local bodies were asked to set up a committee comprising their secretary, medical officer, health supervisor or health inspector, food inspector, district drug analyst, and an officer from the Pollution Control Board to issue licences. But many officials are blissfully unaware of this order itself. Licence Untrained people are still seen engaged in tattooing in street corners and some major beaches. Rarely are steps taken to inspect if the tattooing shops have the required licence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/unauthorised-tattooing-continues-to-flourish-despite-ban/article37799738.ece

There is only limited medical staff, and some of them are not getting their salaries on time as well. Adding to this is the lack of safety of the existing building. Sources said soil erosion was posing a severe threat and heavy rain could damage the whole structure. The State Government converted the Government District Hospital at Mananthavady into a medical college hospital in February. Posting orders for the staff were issued in September. A three-storey building of the nursing college was given away for academic purpose. Sources, however, said the offices were yet to get proper infrastructure, including desktop computers. Some staff were yet to be given identity cards. Though there are six posts of professors, only two or three professors are working. Twenty-one associate professor posts have been sanctioned but there are none in those posts. Though there are 28 posts of assistant professors, only five have been posted. Of them, two are working elsewhere as per some official arrangement. Only eight of the 27 posts of senior resident doctors have been filled. The sources said because of the lack of facilities, the hospital was not even taking baby steps to become a full-fledged medical college hospital. The surgery department is left with only the head of the department and three senior resident doctors. There are no anaesthetists in the operation theatre now though the district hospital has staff in that category. There is inordinate delay in the release of staff salaries and some others have not got it too. According to sources, the staff bills of permanent staff have now been cleared by the Finance Department, but those of contract staff such as resident doctors are still pending. Some of the staff, who wished not to be quoted, claimed that medical personnel posted in Wayanad were reluctant to work there because of the lack of facilities. Officials, however, claimed that most of the issues had been conveyed to the Health Minister at a recent meeting. Instructions had been issued to resolve them one by one.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-government-mch-in-wayanad-crying-for-attention/article37799721.ece

For entrepreneur Harrison Albert, who has been working in Dubai since 1996, the UAE has been a land of opportunities for expatriates. “The dramatic transformation of the nation shows its leadership with vision,” he said, adding that perhaps no nation offered such safety and security to its residents. A proud owner of the recently introduced golden visa and the first licensed Ayurveda practitioner in the UAE, Shyam Viswanathan felt that Dubai was home to multicultural ethnicity. “About 30% of the population in that country are Indians. It is the most welcoming place in the world and embraces Indian heritage, sciences and culture. Indian professionals, skilled workers, and investors have huge opportunities to grow in the UAE,” Dr. Viswanathan said. Mohammed Hashim, who is associated with book publishing, said opportunities were available in the UAE to those with aspirations and goals. “I came here to relieve myself from staying afloat at home to sailing happily. My dream has come true,” he said. India-born Australian citizen Balu Bhasker, who is the chief of Care Critical Services at Fakeeh University Hospital, said he was amazed at the way the UAE dealt with the pandemic with proper planning and an early vaccination programme and the way the country got back on its feet. “Which nation would have held an IPL, a world cup, and an EXPO during a pandemic smoothly and successfully?” Dr. Bhasker asked. Rajesh Chankoor, who works with a petroleum company, felt that the UAE offered a true globalisation concept valuing its culture and respecting those of others. “The permission for the construction of a temple in Abu Dhabi is a classic example of secularism,” he said. Business consultant Santosh Raj said when everyone wrote the UAE off, it bounced back stronger after the world financial debacle in the first decade of the century. “The pandemic has been dealt with efficiently, and the country set an example for the rest of the world to follow.” Ainel Aloysius, who has been working in the automobile sector in Dubai for the past 27 years, said the emirate was a gateway to all continents. “It has been able to tap the potential of the tourism sector. As part of this strategy, the UAE government has issued long-term residence and visit visas to all nationals.” M.R. Rajesh, a lawyer, said the UAE was a unique fusion of heritage and modernism. “It is a window to the ever-widening opportunities and a safe place to live.” IT expert Suresh Kumar said every Indian who went to the UAE had a neatly packaged dream that involved a good job with growth prospects, building a house back home, bettering the financial state of the family, and then returning to retire in comfort.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nris-have-fond-memories-as-uae-celebrates-golden-jubilee/article37799728.ece

This is against the backdrop of a randomised controlled feasibility study that showed the medicine to be ineffective on people infected with SARS-CoV-2. The study was published in the peer-reviewed international journal Homeopathy in September. The authors are Gitanjali Talele, Shashikant Vaidhya, Abhay Chowdhary, Paul Herscu, and Rajesh Shah. The study meant to explore the efficacy of selected homeopathic medicines as a preventive measure for developing COVID-19. The six-group, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled prophylaxis study was conducted in a COVID-19 exposed population at a quarantine facility in Mumbai. Each group received one of the following: Arsenicum Album 30 C, Bryonia Alba 30 C, a combination (Arsenicum Album 30 C, Bryonia Alba 30 c, Gelsemium Sempervirens 30 C, and Influenzinum 30 C), coronavirus nosode CVN01 30 C, Camphora 1M, or a placebo. Those who were given Arsenicum Album did not show any efficacy, the study said. Arif Hussain Theruvath, a former homeopathy consultant, said there was a dearth of quality studies to prove the efficacy of homeopathy. All of the quality studies done so far around the world have clearly shown it does not work. “The Homeopathy department in Kerala now must foray for fresh scientific evidence to support their programme of supplying the tablet among schoolchildren,” he said. Functionaries of the Campaign Against Pseudo Science Using Law and Ethics, aligned to the Kerala Sasthra Sahitya Parishad, said the study had proved that Arsenicum Album had only a placebo effect.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/activists-flag-study-urge-govt-to-rethink-on-homeo-tablets/article37799730.ece

Radhakrishna Pillai, Assistant Professor, Department of Life Sciences. T.M. Vasudevan, president, CUTA, said in a statement on Wednesday that it was part of an ongoing effort by the university administration to harass faculty members who did not subscribe to the left-leaning teachers’ organisation or the CPI(M). Claiming that Mr. Pillai was an outstanding researcher and teacher with rich international experience, he said the suspension should not be dealt with lightly, as the former was close to retirement. “Usually, suspension is a provision invoked in cases of criminal misconduct where the continuation of the teacher hinders the process of an ongoing inquiry or causes serious problems to a section of the campus community. There is no such issue here,” Mr. Vasudevan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cuta-condemns-teachers-suspension/article37799731.ece

Minister for Welfare of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes K. Radhakrishnan, who had visited Attappady to study the ground situation, convened a top-level ministerial meeting to mitigate the woes of the tribespeople. Finance Minister K.N.

The government would modernise the hospital’s paediatric ICU and the special wing for women and children. Ms. George said the Health Department would examine the functioning of public health centres at Attappady. A special team of doctors have visited the hospital. The government has also rushed a state-of-the-art ambulance to Attappady. Tribes’ food preference Mr. Anil said the government would ensure door-to-door delivery of provisions and food kits. It would supply food material preferred by tribal families. Mr. Balagopal said the government would sanction funds for Attappady tribal development and allied schemes. The Excise department would carry out awareness campaigns against alcohol abuse and provide de-addiction treatment to those who desire so. Self-sufficiency Mr. Radhakrishnan said Accredited Social Health Activists, Scheduled Tribe Promoters and elected members of local government institutions would work in tandem for tribal welfare. The State aimed at making the people of Attappady self-sufficient. The meeting also decided to recruit local persons as government officials in the region. Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had slammed the government “turning a blind eye” to the travails of the Attappady tribal population. Oppn. leaders’ visit Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president K. Sudhakaran, and BJP State president K. Surendran had visited Attappady in the wake of the death of two infants.

Replying to a question raised by Adoor Prakash, he said the work on the Angamali-Kalady and Kalady-Perumbavoor stretches could not be taken forward due to these reasons. This had delayed the project and thus increased the cost estimate from Rs. 550 crore in 1997 to Rs. 2,815 crore in 2017. The Minister said Kerala had agreed to share the cost of the project with Railways in 2015, only to back out a year later. “The State government in January 2021 conveyed its decision to share 50% of the project cost through the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board, subject to the condition that the operation and maintenance of the track be done by Railways while the stations along the route will be developed by a special purpose vehicle (SPV) in the PPP (public-private participation) mode and the net revenue realised by the SPV would be shared equally between the State government and Ministry of Railways.” Final decision The Minister said a final decision on the project would be taken only after receiving the revised estimate of the complete project and not in parts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sabari-rail-lacks-state-support-says-centre/article37799826.ece

Vijayaraghavan has said the Congress and the BJP in the State have cast themselves in the role of anti-development retrogrades by blindly opposing the State’s semi high-speed Silverline railway project. Speaking at a meet-the-press organised by the Thiruvananthapuram Press Club on the occasion of the LDF completing six months in power on Wednesday, Mr. Vijayaraghavan said the Opposition parties were trying to retard the State’s progress. The SilverLine was a greenfield project that would drastically reduce the travel time between Thiruvananthapuram and Kasaragod to less than four hours. It would decongest roads, open up the State’s verdant hinterlands for development and reduce Kerala’s carbon footprint. The LDF had moved ahead with acquiring land for the SilverLine. The Government would adequately compensate those displaced by the project. Those who stirred resistance against laying down the GAIL pipeline and six laning of the National Highway had failed. People were happy to make sacrifices for development, he said. Kerala was already years behind other regions in essential infrastructure development. It was required to keep pace with the world. The Silverline would soon become a reality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cpim-congress-and-bjp-anti-development/article37799989.ece

Work on them would kick off soon, the Minister said, expressing hope that the finished works would bring laurels for Malayalam cinema. Multi-stage process The screenplays were selected through a multi-stage process. Entries invited through newspaper ads were scrutinised by a panel of noted scriptwriters. Shortlisted candidates from both categories were then invited to attend separate screenplay workshops. They were required to submit treatment notes, which were assessed by a panel headed by director Dr. Biju. The final scripts were assessed by a jury headed by John Paul. The State government had launched the initiative in 2019-20 for women directors as part of making the film industry more gender-inclusive. Nishiddho (Forbidden) , the winning entry last year, written and directed by Tara Ramanujan, has received invitations from various film festivals in India and abroad, said Mr. Cherian.

The Minister said the project was intended to enhance coconut production at a given region. ‘An emotion’ “Coconut palm is an emotion for Malayalis. Understanding the potential of virgin coconut oil, Kudumbashree members should start coconut oil units. Only on achieving self-sufficiency in vegetable production could price rise be prevented,” he said.

02 December 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||1,653 teachers promoted as heads of institutions||The General Education Department has temporarily promoted 1,653 primary teachers as heads of institutions. The promotion that has been caught in a legal tangle will be subject to the Supreme Court’s final judgment. The decision has been taken following the Advocate General’s legal opinion. With schools reopening after more than a year-and-a-half in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the department was keen on avoiding any hurdles in connection with their functioning, and decided to go ahead with the promotion. Over 1,000 vacancies Once the promotions are effected, more than 1,000 vacancies will arise. Appointment can be made to these through the Kerala Public Service Commission, a statement from the office of the General Education Minister said. As many as 540 vacancies had been reported, and the remaining are expected to be reported in the coming days. Relaxations were being allowed in the stipulation that teachers who had completed 50 years of age should pass departmental tests for promotion as lower and upper primary and high school headmaster or headmistress. When the State rules for the Right to Education Act, 2009, were being framed, it was stipulated that departmental tests have to be cleared for appointment as headmaster/mistress. As the RTE Act was applicable only for primary education, this stipulation was applicable only to LP and UP headmaster postings. However, those who had completed 50 years of age were being promoted as before. This was challenged in the Kerala Administrative Tribunal (KAT), and the government passed a few orders in this regard. As per the last order, teachers who had completed 50 years would be exempted from departmental tests for three years beginning February 22, 2019. Order challenged This order, though, was stayed by the High Court. It directed that those who had not cleared departmental tests not be considered for primary headmaster/mistress promotion. Teachers who had completed 50 years and had been promoted challenged this in the Supreme Court. The court ordered that status quo be maintained. The court’s final order is awaited.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/1653-teachers-promoted-as-heads-of-institutions/article37799993.ece

And, in cases where the infection is transmitted from a woman to her newborn child, the burden of shame and guilt become insurmountable for the parents. On World AIDS Day, Gerardo Alvarez Uría, doctor and director of RDT Hospital for Infectious Diseases (HID) stresses the need to address this problem. The theme of this year “End inequalities. End AIDS” is aimed at WHO and its partner organisations highlighting the need for a special focus on reaching out to people left behind. “HIV in India is a family disease. Usually, the husband migrates to another place for work and has extramarital relations without protection, and thus infects the wife, and she eventually transmits it to the newborn (vertical transmission). That´s why the number of HIV-positive children in India is relatively higher compared to other countries,” says Mr. Gerardo Alvarez Uría. At the Rural Development Trust(RDT) Hospital at Bathalapalli in Anantapur, doctors have striven to lower the rate of vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child. Out of 1,120 HIV-positive mothers who went into labour at this hospital since 2011, the rate of vertical transmission has been 2%. “The shame and guilt of having transmitted the disease to their children accompany the parents for the rest of their lives. It does not matter how many times you counsel them that it is not their fault. Everyone around them blames them for it, and the situation is especially challenging when their children become teenagers,” he observes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/need-to-end-stigma-around-hiv-patients-rdt-chief/article37799908.ece

The posts are now held by former Chief Ministers O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami respectively. Until now, members of the general council alone had been permitted to take part in the process. This came about after the general council, in September 2017, approved an amendment to the Rule 20, which dealt with the post of general secretary. The party had also decided then to create the posts of coordinator and co-coordinator in place of the general secretary. Wednesday’s decision marked the return of the mode of election for the general secretary which was in effect when M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa were at the helm. The executive, which met for about 90 minutes at the party headquarters, decided that the election for the two posts be held through a single vote. It also decided that the condition for the new mode of election was beyond any amendment. Mr. Panneerselvam, Mr. Palaniswami and deputy coordinators K.P. Munusamy and R. Vaithilingam were among those present at the meeting. Out of 270 members, 258 took part at the meeting. All the changes were incorporated in a resolution, which was passed by the executive. They would have to be ratified by the general council, which was expected to meet shortly.

02 December 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||TSRTC fare hike inevitable, says Minister||Citing a survey that gathered public opinion on fare hike, Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar and Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) Managing Director V.C. Sajjanar downplayed the imminent increase in ticket prices, and said that only a minority of respondents raised concerns. Proposals on the fare hike would be sent to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who would take a decision on the issue, they said. TSRTC officials, including Mr Kumar and Chairman Bajireddy Goverdhan, pointed out the inevitability of the hike, and blamed the pandemic, and hike in fuel prices for the decision. The Transport Minister said that the daily diesel consumption is approximately 6.8 lakh litres per day and the per litre fuel cost has risen over 27% from a time when prices were Rs. 68.29 per litre, on account of the Centre hiking prices frequently. The fare hike, Mr Kumar said, would give the loss making transport juggernaut a much needed breather, and can realise around Rs. 680 crore. “We are slowly moving towards normalcy,” Mr Kumar said. “The loss came down to Rs. 600 crore and will go down further in the next few years,” he added. Bus fares, Mr Kumar said, were increased in 2019, but did not have the desired effect due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdown. The second wave too took a toll on the TSRTC. As was reported in these columns, the TSRTC officials and Mr Kumar reiterated that a hike of 25 paise per kilometre for Palle Velugu and City ordinary, and 30 paisa per kilometre for Metro Express, Metro Deluxe, Super Luxury and others has been proposed. Once the proposal is cleared, it is likely that that the new Pallevelugu fare will be marginally higher than present fare for Express buses. Meanwhile, Mr Goverdhan said that as many as 633 buses are to be scrapped, while another 1,400 are not in good condition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tsrtc-fare-hike-inevitable-say-minister-managing-director/article37799714.ece

02 December 2021||Kalaburagi,ANDHRA PRADESH||In Karnataka, egg distribution begins in school mid-day meals||Seven districts in north Karnataka started distribution of eggs in mid-day meals on Wednesday, amid protests by a few Lingayat organisations demanding the reversal of the government’s decision aimed at improving nutrition levels in the backward districts. Support for the decision on inclusion of eggs also came from several quarters. Many leaders representing various communities and organisations insisted that the Government stick to its decision. Some even warned of a State-wide agitation and legal battle if the government stepped back. A few organisations in Bidar, including the Republican Party of India (RPI), Dalita Vidyarthi Parishat, Ramabhai Bhajna Team, Janwadi Mahila Sanghatan and Gonda Vidyarthi Sanghatane submitted a memorandum to the Bidar Deputy Commissioner demanding that the government stay firm on its decision. Some Lingayat organisations, including the Rashtriya Basava Dal, had opposed the government’s decision. However, S.M. Jamadar, secretary of the Jagatika Lingayat Mahasabha, said they had no problem as long as an alternative vegetarian item was given to children. “Since the government has given a vegetarian alternative [banana] to egg, it is perfectly alright. It provides children with an opportunity to choose from various options,” Mr. Jamadar said. Pandit Aradhya swami, head of the Sanehalli branch of Sirigere mutt, said diet was a personal choice. Rubbishing the opposition to egg in mid-day meal, Vishwaradhya Satyampete, a Lingayat scholar, said the Vachana Movement in the 12th century could be widespread because it had involved all the oppressed and marginalised communities respecting their diets. C.S. Dwarakanath, former Chairman of the Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes, demanded inclusion of meat in the midday meal along with eggs to fight malnutrition among children. “Majority of children are suffering from anaemia caused by Vitamin B12 deficiency, which can be corrected with meat intake. The government cannot deprive the majority of children of their right to nutritious food of their choice just because a few people don’t like it,” Mr. Dwarakanath said. The government had issued a circular in October directing the local authorities to include egg and banana in midday meals in schools in seven backward districts — Bidar, Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Raichur, Koppal, Ballari (and Vijayanagara) and Vijayapura — that reported rampant malnutrition among children. Children who don’t eat eggs have the option of bananas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/in-karnataka-egg-distribution-begins-in-school-mid-day-meals/article37799304.ece
02 December 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cardinal sabotaging Vatican dispensation, says laity forum||Almaya Munnettam, supported by a large number of priests and lay people in the Ernakulam-Angamalay Major Archdiocese of the Syro-Malabar Church calling for more transparency in church administration, has said Major Archbishop Cardinal George Alencherry and his supporters are trying to sabotage the dispensation given by the Vatican to the major archdiocese to maintain the status quo on the way the Holy Mass is celebrated. Though a unified system of celebrating the Mass was to come into effect on November 28, the first Sunday of Advent, Irinjalakkuda diocese, Ernakulam-Angamaly Archdiocese, Faridabad, and Delhi dioceses were exempted from the purview of the synodal decision taken in August this year. The Congregation for Oriental Churches intervened and directed that the local heads of dioceses could exempt dioceses from the decision of the synod in a time of crisis. The unified system of Mass involves the celebrant facing the congregation during the first half of the Mass and then turning away from the congregation during the consecration and rest of the Mass. However, some priests and laity in the dioceses such as Ernakulam-Angamaly, Irinjalakkuda, Thrissur, and Thamarassery are learnt to have demanded continuing with the present system of the celebrant facing the congregation throughout the Mass, though only the first two dioceses have been given the dispensation by the local ordinary. A senior priest of the Ernakulam-Angamaly Archdiocese said Pope Francis had emphasised unity over uniformity. The dispensation provided under Canon 1538 is meant to avoid any disruption in unity. He expressed apprehension that the Chaldean lobby was trying to sabotage the dispensation according to Canon 1538 given by local bishops with the knowledge of the Congregation for Oriental Churches and impose uniformity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cardinal-sabotaging-vatican-dispensation-says-laity-forum/article37799315.ece
02 December 2021||KOCHI,ANDHRA PRADESH||HC upholds conviction of Kerala priest||The Kerala High Court on Wednesday confirmed the conviction awarded by the Thalassery special court to Robin Mathew Vadakkumcheril, former vicar of St. Sebastian Church, Kottiyoor, for raping a minor girl. The court also upheld his conviction under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The court, however, reduced the sentence of 20-year rigorous imprisonment given by the POCSO Special Court to 10 years. Justice R. Narayana Pisharady passed the verdict while disposing of an appeal filed by the former priest against the special court judgement. Fine upheld Reducing the sentence, the court observed that Section 42 of the POCSO Act provided that where an offence punishable under the Act and also under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code, the offender shall be liable to the maximum punishment of the two. The offence under Section 5 read with Section 6 of the POCSO Act, before amendment by Act 25 of 2019, was punishable with a minimum sentence of rigorous imprisonment for 10 years, whereas the punishment for Section 376 was seven years. The court also upheld the fine of Rs. 1,00,000 imposed on the accused. The accused was convicted by the Special Court as it found that he had sexual intercourse with the girl who was then aged below 18 years. The High Court, however, ‘altered’ the conviction for the offence under Section 376 (2)(f) of the IPC to Section 376 (1) of IPC (rape). The court noted that Section 376(2)(f) was invoked when a person in a position of trust raped a woman. There was an attempt by the survivor’s family to hush up the case and save the former priest. The survivor had stated to the police that it was her own father who had raped her and he was the father of her child.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rape-of-minor-hc-upholds-conviction-of-ex-priest/article37799311.ece

Tension gripped Marupur for over an hour as farmers, led by Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti convenor A.Siva Reddy, staged a road blockade stir on the Marupur-Podalakur road in protest against denial of accommodation allegedly at the behest of ruling YSR Congress Party and removal of vehicles carrying religious symbols of particular minority communities by the police.

02 December 2021||New Delhi,ANDHRA PRADESH||AIADMK MPs stall debate on Dam Safety Bill in Rajya Sabha||The Dam Safety Bill 2021 was moved in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday but the debate could not be held because of disruptions from the Opposition parties. BJP’s ally AIADMK has decided to oppose the Bill whenever it comes up for debate. This Bill was approved by the Lok Sabha in the Monsoon session. There was a view among the Opposition parties that this Bill must be sent to a select committee, because of its wider implication. The Government, however, is in no mood to concede to the demand. On Tuesday, the Government had deferred a debate on the Bill because of the Opposition walkout. The House was adjourned twice on Wednesday because of the protests and the Bill could not be taken up for debate. AIADMK floor leader for Rajya Sabha A. Navaneethakrishnan said that the Bill will affect Tamil Nadu’s ownership over its dams located in other States. Former Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa too had conveyed her objections to certain aspects of the draft Bill. “We strongly oppose this Bill and it has to go.” The point of contention are four dams — Mullaperiyar, Parambikulam, Thunakkadavu and Peruvaripallam — located in Kerala but owned, operated and maintained by the Tamil Nadu Government. The Bill provides for a National Committee on Dam Safety whose functions include evolving policies and recommending regulations regarding dam safety standards. “The national dam safety authority will have the final word: this is a violation of the federal principles,” Mr. Navaneethakrishnan said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/aiadmk-mps-stall-debate-on-dam-safety-bill-in-rajya-sabha/article37799321.ece
02 December 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Centre has only put a comma to agriculture reforms, not full stop’||A day after the repeal of the controversial farm laws, Tobacco Board Chairman Y. Raghunadha Babu on Wednesday asserted that the Union Government would ally the misapprehensions of the farmers before coming up with a comprehensive legislation to give a push to the reforms in the agriculture sector. “We will convince the agriculturists on the urgent need for reforms in the farm sector and the new laws to ensure a fair deal for the farmers,” Mr. Raghunadha Babu told the media here. He ruled out putting a break to the reforms in the agriculture sector. “We have only put a comma and not a full stop,” the BJP leader asserted. “New pieces of legislation will definitely be taken up after evolving a broad consensus and a comprehensive debate among the stakeholders,” he made it clear. The Tobacco Board, in the wake of opposition from a section of the farmers to contract farming, would take the initiative to document the best farm practices adopted at the grassroots level to convince the global players of the quality of the produce so that the farmers got the best price for their produce, he said. Farm mechanisation The Tobacco Board would promote farm mechanisation in the wake of acute labour shortage and barn modernisation in a big way. It would encourage the farmers who had gone for loose leaf barns during last year to set up at least 25 such barns for curing of flue-cured tobacco during the rabi to help the growers to remain competitive in the global market, Mr. Raghunadha Babu said. The Tobacco Board chief, who visited the rain-affected farms in the southern light soil (SLS) and the southern black soil (SBS) regions, promised hand-holding for the farmers to go for re-plantation and gap filling to produce the targeted 74.23 million kg. He said the global demand for leaf could be expected to go up this year after the COVID-induced slump in the previous two cropping seasons, and wanted the farmers to grow the crop in full extent in the wake of the exporters picking up the previous years’ stocks with the traders now. One-third of the planted tobacco in about 21,400 hectares had been damaged following incessant rain in the last 20 days, according to Tobacco Board sources. Tobacco seedlings had also been damaged in the wake of unabated rains. ‘Slash GST’ Meanwhile, members of the Tobacco Dealers’ Association, led by its president P. Venkatesan, urged the Centre to reduce the GST from 28% to 5% on packed tobacco on par with leaf, as packaging was done only to preserve the leaf. They wanted the Centre to exclude tobacco from the negative list for them to get liberal funding from the banks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/centre-has-only-put-a-comma-to-agriculture-reforms-not-full-stop/article37799926.ece

He was speaking at a meeting organised jointly by the District AIDS Control Organisation, Nehru Yuva Kendra, District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) and Dhatri Foundation and Indian Red Cross Society at the Zilla Parishad meeting hall on Wednesday. Addressing the participants, the Joint Collector said that it was found that people in the 15-49 age group were being affected more by HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). He suggested periodic awareness programmes for students of schools and colleges on the subject. The services of ‘Kala jathas’ and transgenders could be utilised to create awareness among the public, he said.

Initially, the PM Palem police suspected that they could have been run over by an unidentified vehicle, but a deeper investigation revealed that the youth had rammed into a lorry and were not wearing helmets. In another case, on November 14, a 22-year old woman and her mother died in an accident on BRTS Road at Arilova. Traffic police found that the woman riding the two-wheeler was wearing an uncertified helmet. The woman had also not fastened the clip of the helmet, due to which she sustained severe head injuries after the helmet came off on impact, said Inspector of Traffic (East Sub-division) Ch. Shanmukha Rao. A series of similar incidents prompted the traffic police to renew their campaign on helmet usage. They have begun holding awareness camps at schools, colleges and public places in the last couple of days and are urging motorists to not use helmets that lack ISO certification. “The usage of helmets has definitely increased in the city over the years. We rarely see someone not wearing a helmet on NH-16, except some youth. However, several motorists are using uncertified helmets. People must ensure that the helmet covers not only the head but the entire face, and the clip must be fastened so that the helmet does not come off on impact,” said Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Ch. Adinarayana. The main target is to sensitise youth, especially college students. People must wear helmets even on local roads and not just on highways, the ADCP reiterated. Special drive Police initiated a special drive against no-helmet driving on November 30. In a single day, fines were imposed against as many as 1,818 persons for not wearing a helmet. Out of these, 345 ‘No-Helmet’ cases were booked under Gajuwaka police station limits, while 158 cases were booked under Dwaraka police station limits. These apart, 11 dangerous driving cases and 33 drunken driving cases were booked. A few days ago, the city task force conducted a special drive on overspeeding at Beach Road, where they seized seven motorcycles. Several youth were counselled by the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fasten-your-helmet-strap-so-that-it-does-not-come-off-on-impact-adcp/article37800018.ece

02 December 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||AIIEA slams suspension of Rajya Sabha members||The All India Insurance Employees Association (AllEA) has condemned the suspension of 12 members of the Rajya Sabha for the entire winter session of Parliament. The action is in violation of all democratic and parliamentary procedures, AIIEA general secretary Shreekanth Mishraa alleged. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Mr. Mishraa noted that the 12 MPs were suspended on the allegation that they had disrespected the Chair and behaved in an unruly manner. “The suspended members, along with the entire Opposition, were protesting against the manner in which the Centre was trying to railroad the General Insurance Business Nationalisation Act (Amendment) Bill, and were demanding that the Bill be referred to a Parliamentary Committee for a detailed study of its impact on the national economy. The entire nation watched live how the government brought the Marshals to suppress the protest and pushed the Bill through without any discussion on such an important Bill,” Mr. Mishraa said. The public sector insurance industry has played a key role in national development. The Standing Committee on Finance recognised the importance of this sector when it scrutinised the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill and recommended that the government hold 51% equity in State-owned General Insurance Companies. This recommendation was accepted and subsequently, the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill was approved by Parliament, he said. On August 11, 2021, the government wanted to break this commitment given to Parliament by bringing an amendment to reduce its holding to below 51%. Mr. Mishraa alleged that this was done to enable privatisation of the entire public sector general insurance industry. The AIIEA said it was grateful to the MPs for ‘bringing into national focus the disaster of privatisation of public sector insurance companies and support their struggle against the undemocratic and unjust action’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/aiiea-slams-suspension-of-rajya-sabha-members/article37800022.ece

In view of the threat of the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron, random checks are being carried out at the airport though there are no specific guidelines from the Union Government. “It was initially thought that the Vizag-Singapore SilkAir flight would be revived from December 15. But, it is likely to be deferred in view of the threat posed by the new variant,” airport Director K. Srinivasa Rao said on Wednesday. Though the Government of India had originally planned to allow scheduled international flights from December 15, the decision was deferred in view of the threat posed by Omicron, Mr. Rao said quoting official information. Apart from thermal screening and collecting the mobile numbers, details of the passengers would also be taken, Mr. Rao said, and added that passengers would have to undergo full-fledged testing as per the guidelines of the Government of India once the operation of scheduled international flights was permitted. Guidelines for foreign travellers Meanwhile, the Government of India had issued guidelines for international travellers coming to India with effect from December 1, and these included mandatory submission of self-declaration form and uploading negative RT-PCR report before boarding the flight. Travellers coming from countries listed as ‘high-risk’ should undergo RT-PCR test on arrival. If they test negative, they should be under home quarantine for seven days and undergo a re-test on the eighth day. If they test negative again, they should be under self health monitoring for the next 7 days. If they test positive on re-test, or test positive on arrival, they have to send their sample for genomic testing, get admitted in isolation ward, undergo treatment as per protocol, and get discharged at the discretion of the treating physician.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/omicron-threat-random-checks-being-done-at-vizag-airport/article37799914.ece

02 December 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Maoists expel Kobad Ghandy for ‘anti-party activities’||The banned CPI (Maoist) has expelled its Polit Bureau member and former member of the Central Committee Kobad Ghandy for “indulging in anti-party activities and abandoning the Maoist ideology.” This was announced by party’s spokesperson Abhay through a letter dated November 27. The party accused Ghandy of projecting the Maoist movement in bad light in the book, ‘Fractured Freedom - A Prison Memoir’, he had penned after his release from prison in 2019. Ghandy was arrested in New Delhi in 2009 and released in 2019. He had spent a major part of his prison term at the Visakhapatnam Central Jail. Ghandy (70) was expelled for abandoning the key tenets of ‘Marxism - Leninism - Maoist ideology’ and adopting the bourgeois philosophy of ‘idealism, happiness and spiritualism’, the party said in the letter. It also said that a fitting reply would be given to all the comments and observations Ghandy had made in the book shortly. Born in an affluent Parsi family in Mumbai, Ghandy, a qualified finance professional, who had a brief stint in a multi-national company, joined the movement in late 1970s. In 1981, he was made a member of the Central Committee of the CPI(Marxist-Leninist) People’s War, which had been founded by Kondapalli Seetharamaiah. He had played a key role in the merger of the People’s War and the Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCCI) to form the CPI (Maoist) in September 2004. He was in-charge of the party’s English propaganda cell. He had reportedly participated in a meeting in 2005 with the Nepalese Maoist leader, Prachanda. Ghandy was wrong in saying that the movement had failed in reaching its target, and there was no happiness and freedom in the Marxist way of life, Abhay said. He also accused Ghandy of siding with the ruling class by not explaining the ‘MLM philosophy’ in right perspective. “Ghandy had neither contacted us after his release from jail nor discussed with us the contents of the book. This by itself violates the principles of the party. It is wrong to level allegations against the party, after being part of it for over 40 years,” Abhay said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/maoists-expel-kobad-ghandy-for-anti-party-activities/article37799702.ece

A member of the International AIDS Society, Dr. Surya Rao spoke to The Hindu on the occasion of World AIDS Day which is observed on December 1. “Research done across the country points to the fact that promiscuity among youth and indulgence in unprotected sex under the influence of alcohol or drugs is on the rise. And this is a worrying factor, as the combination of alcohol and drugs leading to unprotected sex is supplemented by the free flow of pornography,” he said.

02 December 2021||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Curtains likely to fall for good at many theatres||Many movie theatres are likely to wind up their operations soon as there is a widening gulf between their income and the expenditure incurred on maintaining the theatres. Exhibitors say that the State government’s decision to reduce ticket rates and restrict the number of shows would have a bigger impact on theaters compared to filmmakers. Each ticket was priced Rs. 150 at multiplexes but it is now being restricted to Rs. 100. With the impact of OTT platforms, the occupancy ratio has already come down in theaters. If the occupancy ratio is below 50%, the theatres may not be able to meet the expenditure with the reduction in ticket rates. The maintenance cost is said to be around Rs. 4 lakh for each theatre which provides employment to nearly 40 persons. Many theatre owners have opted to take up other business activities after struggling to stay afloat. Four theatres have already closed down in the Fort City due to skyrcoketing maintenance costs. The famous Minerva Theatre on GT Road and New Poorna Theatre adjacent to Vizianagaram Municipal Corporation stopped screening of movies. Venkatalakshmi, Rajya Lakshmi and a few other theatres were converted into function halls. Earlier, there were 14 theatres in the town, but now there are only eight. To meet the expectations of the audience, the remaining theatre owners had invested huge amounts of money to renovate the facilities. However, with the pandemic rearing its head, they are at their wits’ end regarding their course of action. Vizianagaram Cine Exhibitors Association president Narayanam Srinivas told The Hindu that it is unlikely for theatres to survive in the current scenario. “As many as 40 theatres in B and C centres of the district are likely to be closed very soon as the ticket prices are very low in those places. The government should look into the grievances of the theatre owners since reduction in prices would lead to further unemployment. The government will also incur losses with a proportionate drop in collection of taxes,” he said. Exhibitors in the district are expected to meet Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Ministers concerned to explain their grievances. Around 800 employees and workers at theatres are likely to lose their jobs with the imminent closure of theatres, according to AITUC Vizianagaram district secretary Bugata Suribabu. “The government should have given orders to control prices at canteens as the rates are exorbitant and more than the price of tickets. The government which wanted to settle scores with a few Telugu film personalities is doing injustice to the staff of theatres,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/it-is-curtains-for-many-cinema-theatres/article37799916.ece

The DGP, along with the Additional DGP, Grey Hounds, K Srinivas Reddy, CRPF Additional DGP Rashmi Shukla, and a host of other senior police officials made a surprise visit to the base camp at Chennapuram, an interior village in Charla mandal of Telangana’s Bhadrachalam Agency on Wednesday. The top brass of the State police arrived in a helicopter from Mulugu district, where he visited the District Police Training Centre at Jakaram in the tribal majority district, late in the afternoon, sources said. The State police chief carried out a review of the anti-Maoist operations during his visit to the border areas of Bhadrachalam Agency, a day ahead of the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) week slated to be observed by the outlawed outfit from December 2 to 8. During the DGP’s visit, the police made tight security arrangements in the border areas straddling the forests along Chhattisgarh’s Maoist stronghold of south Bastar division. The DGP later held a review meeting with police officials of the three border districts – Mulugu, Bhadradri-Kothagudem and Jayashankar Bhupalpally at the ITC guest house at Sarapaka near Bhadrachalam. Speaking to mediapersons after the meeting, Mr Reddy said Maoists movement had not been noticed anywhere in the State in the past one year. “The state committee leaders of the banned outfit are taking shelter in neighbouring Chhattisgarh and the Telangana state police are ever vigilant to prevent their entry into the State,” he asserted. Adequate focus had been laid on providing training for capacity building and catering to the requirements of the police force.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/dgp-vows-to-keep-maoists-at-bay/article37799703.ece

The procedure was the first such to be done at a government health facility in Telangana. Doctors said lung transplantation is rarely conducted at any government facility in the country. The organ was harvested from a 47-year-old woman from Secunderabad. Cost factor Transplantation costs Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 1 crore depending on the medical services a patient requires. The 19-year-old recipient did not have to pay money for the procedure at NIMS. It was funded — around Rs. 12 lakh — under Aarogyasri Health Scheme.  NIMS unit head at Cardiothoracic Surgery department, Amaresh Rao Malempati said patients who undergo lung transplantation may require extensive dialysis and ECMO support, bronchoscopy and secretions in lungs have to be cleared. They also need immunosuppressive medicines apart from constant monitoring of the condition to know if the body is rejecting the organ. All this makes up for Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 1 crore. In this case, the girl, who suffered from a congenital lung condition, had been consulting doctors and was on oxygen support at home. However, when she started to feel breathless, she was admitted to NIMS around mid-September. After finding suitable lungs, the transplantation was taken up. She will be under observation for two weeks or more, depending on her progress. Awaiting organs In-charge of Jeevandan, cadaver transplantation programme, G. Swarnalatha said around 50 more patients across the State are awaiting lung transplantation. Some of them would undergo the procedure at corporate hospitals. Heart transplant patient A 30-year-old man, who had undergone heart transplantation at NIMS on September this year, has been discharged and is in good health. The heart was harvested from a 34-year-old Telangana police constable who was declared brain-dead. Prior to his case, the last transplant was performed at NIMS in 2018.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/nims-first-govt-facility-in-state-to-perform-lung-transplantation/article37799684.ece
02 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Junior docs boycott OP services||Junior doctors across Telangana boycotted out-patient medical services from Wednesday demanding NEET-PG counselling to be expedited. The protest, which was started at all government hospitals, will continue for two more days. The boycott was launched expressing solidarity with a call given by the Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA) and Resident Doctors’ Associations in other States. Usually, counselling is held in May or June. However, it is not conducted yet this year. MBBS and PG students come under the umbrella term of junior doctors. At hospitals, apart from senior doctors and health staff, medical services are offered by junior doctors. The junior doctors said that aspirants of Post Graduate courses who had qualified for counselling were awaiting the process. They expressed apprehensions that aspirants might lose an academic year if the counselling was not held soon. “Now, the burden of medical services at hospitals is on second and third year PG students (resident doctors). The third year students will have their final examinations in a few months. They will get busy with the preparations and that means the burden will fall on second year students,” said general secretary of TJUDA Dr. N. Karthik, adding that this could be the situation across the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/junior-docs-boycott-op-services/article37799693.ece

He posted several screen shots of government’s response to issues inside and outside the Parliament saying it has no data. Mr. Rao further said the government’s “No Data” answers included ‘No data of healthcare staff who died’, ‘No data of MSMEs closed due to COVID-19’, ‘No Data on Migrant workers’ deaths’, ‘No data on job loss during pandemic’, ‘No data on beneficiaries of Rs. 20 lakh crore package’ and ‘No data of farmers’ deaths in farm law protest.’ Meanwhile, the TRS members in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha continued disrupting the sessions holding protests with placards and slogans on farmers issues.

However, he has cautioned people to follow MVVT — mask, vaccination, ventilation and testing — without fail and stay alert for another three months. Dr. Reddy spoke after receiving J. Eashwari Bai Memorial Award 2021 during a programme at Ravindra Bharathi on Wednesday. The programme was organised by department of Language and Culture, and Eashwari Bai Memorial Trust headed by former minister J. Geeta Reddy. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan was the chief guest on the occasion. “Last year, by June-July, coronavirus started spreading far and wide. Everyone was getting sick, coming to hospitals and dying. Many doctors worked like warriors and about 2,000 across India have died while treating patients in the last two years,” said Dr. Reddy, terming it a war situation where soldiers were without weapons. Explaining about treatment, he said that doctors got confidence after getting medicines and felt that it could be over by February. However, the country faced the deadly second wave and doctors had never before seen such a pathetic situation. He said that by producing and administering vaccination to 123 crore people, India has achieved a record. “In the last one week, we have been hearing about Omicron. There are talks about travel ban and lockdown. This is six times more infectious than Delta. The infection will be very mild with throat pain and muscle ache. People are recovering in two to three days,” said Dr. Reddy. Ms Soundararajan urged people to get vaccinated at the earliest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/aig-hospitals-chairman-allays-fear-on-omicron/article37799682.ece

The Collectorate should ensure effective coordination with Panchayat Raj, Municipal Administration, Education and other departments to achieve the target. The Cabinet sub-committee headed by Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao met here on Wednesday to review the progress achieved under the vaccination drive launched by the government. The committee discussed the steps that should be taken to check the possible incidence of Omicron, described as a ‘variant of concern’ by the WHO. Participating in a video conference with Collectors and district health officials, members of the Cabinet panel informed them that the State Cabinet, which met recently, had a thorough discussion on Omicron and vaccination drive. It was accordingly resolved to take steps to check the occurrence of Omicron through vaccination and ensure that people followed COVID-appropriate behaviour. They said the State was among the top in vaccination drive which was being taken up in coordination with Panchayat Raj and Municipal Administration departments. Collectors should prepare action plans at different levels covering habitations, wards, sub-centres, municipalities and mandals for achieving cent per cent vaccination. Health Minister T. Harish Rao informed the participants that steps had been initiated to strengthen the public health infrastructure at the field level. As part of this, the Collectors should take steps like upgradation of area hospitals, setting up of radiology and pathology labs besides providing space and infrastructure required for RT-PCR centres. Medical colleges At the same time, efforts should be intensified to complete the construction of new medical colleges and augment bed strength in the associated hospitals. Mr. Rama Rao wanted the Collectors to be cautious about the false information being circulated on social media platforms. Efforts should be made to disseminate information released by the Health department and Chief Secretary’s office from time to time to create awareness among the people. Concern over confusion He expressed concern over the confusion being created through rumours on social media and said providing timely information to people on the developments was the only way to tackle this. There was no cause of concern relating to Omicron variant as of now and people should follow COVID-appropriate behaviour to check the spread of the infection. Mr. Rama Rao directed the officials concerned to revive the State-level command control centre and ensure that it functioned on 24x7 basis for disseminating the developments to the people on timely basis. At the same time, the Health department officials should work on a mission mode to achieve the targets set for 100% vaccination. Education Minister Sabita Indra Reddy briefed the participants about the steps taken to check occurrence of COVID-19 in schools, colleges and hostels including operation of special vaccination centres.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ensure-100-vaccination-by-month-end-collectors-told/article37799690.ece
02 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Revenue through registration and stamps department rises||The upsurge in revenue through registration and stamps department continued in November with the department registering over Rs. 1,100 crore revenue through land transactions. Of the total revenue generated during the month, transactions of agricultural properties amounted close to Rs. 150 crore and the remaining Rs. 950 crore was generated through non-agricultural properties. Areas under the jurisdiction of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority continue to post impressive revenues accounting to around 60 per cent of the transactions reported during the month. The significant increase in the land related transactions can be seen from the fact that the department raised revenue of Rs. 43 crore on Wednesday alone. The department’s revenue so far during the current financial year crossed transactions of agricultural properties amounted close to Rs. 150 crore 7,000 crore, more than 80 per cent of the Rs. 8,000 crore projected till November in the current year’s budget. Market values Impressive run of registrations is continuing in spite of the hike in registration fee and stamp duties as well as revision of market values a couple of months ago. “Currently we are registering revenues of above Rs. 1,000 crore every month. This is almost double the revenue earned before the revision of market values increase in the charges,” a senior official told The Hindu . Given the momentum witnessed in the land sales after the restrictions of COVID-19 pandemic were eased, the department was likely to achieve the target of Rs. 12,500 crore set for it during the current fiscal. The department suffered a setback during the previous fiscal achieving around 65 per cent of the Rs. 10,000 crore target set for the year. The department, however, revived itself since lifting of restrictions from April this year registering Rs. 716 crore revenue and the trend is continuing since then but for May when it dropped to Rs. 234 crore due to closure of sub-registrar offices on account of the COVID-19 pandemic second wave.  Currently we are registering revenues of above Rs. 1,000 crore every month.

02 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Agriculture dept. plans for huge crop diversification in lieu of paddy||The Agriculture department has drawn up plans for a huge diversification to wean away farmers from paddy and migrate them to other crops after the government has refused to buy paddy cultivated in the rabi, whose sowings otherwise would have commenced this week. According to the plans, the proposed potential for maize was 12 lakh acres against 4.66 lakh acres in rabi last year. Bengal gram and groundnut was fixed at 10 lakh acres each against their actual sown area of 3.54 lakh and 2.77 lakh acres respectively. Similarly, the potential for sesamum (last year 57,488 acres), green gram (35,514), black gram (48,659) and jowar (1.19 lakh) was put at 1.50 lakh acres each. Coriander was planned on one lakh acres against nil last year and castor at two lakh acres against 2,470 acres last year. Sunflower with three lakh acres (18,826) and safflower (7,590) with one lakh acres were the other targeted crops. Vegetables and other crops were expected over 3.95 lakh acres and orchard crops over 6.11 lakh acres against 1.51 lakh acres and 5.72 lakh acres respectively. Though the department did not fix the anticipated paddy area, it was expected that farmers might still go for it in 25 to 30 lakh acres to meet their commitments with seed companies and rice mills with which they tied up, and for self- consumption. It was also said that suggested crops were never sown in such a big way in the past but whether the farmers will accept it was a big question in the minds of officials. Moreover, the sowing period for crops like bengal gram, groundnut, jowar, coriander, castor and safflower was over. The department has planned a special campaign appealing to farmers not to go for cultivation of paddy and instead suggesting them to take up the above crops. Paddy was cultivated over 52.78 lakh acres against a normal of 31 lakh acres in rabi last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/agriculture-dept-plans-for-huge-crop-diversification-in-lieu-of-paddy/article37799705.ece
02 December 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Congress urges Governor to visit market yards||Telangana Congress has represented to Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan to personally visit the threshing yards and paddy farmers and procurement centres to see for herself the pathetic plight of farmers emerging out of State government’s failure to procure paddy. A delegation of the Congress party leaders comprising of Manthani MLA D. Sreedhar Babu, Munugode MLA Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy, former MP V. Hanmantha Rao, Kisan cell leaders M Kodanda Reddy and Anvesh Reddy met the Governor and submitted a memorandum seeking her intervention and direction to the State government. The representation said that proper facilities be created at every village and ensure that paddy is immediately procured with MSP, including the paddy that has germinated due to untimely rains, without penalising farmers on the pretext of high moisture content. The leaders also asked the Governor to direct the State government to come up with comprehensive policy on rabi cropping pattern. In the case of alternate crops, the government must come up with incentive schemes like the Chhattisgarh government that provided Rs. 9,000 per acre of incentive to farmers growing millets. If MSP is declared for alternate crops during Rabi, farmers are likely to shift from paddy. The government must come to the rescue of the farmers who were already battered with the pandemic by strengthening rice distribution through Public Distribution System (PDS). They also wanted that the government to procure and convert paddy into rice and directly arrange for sales through Coop Market Federations, Rythu Samanvaya Vedika and other means, at affordable prices to consumers. Later, speaking to reporters Mr. Sreedhar Babu and Rajgopal Reddy said Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao created paddy crisis to cover up the humiliating defeat in Huzurabad bypoll. Due to this confusion, middlemen and private traders are exploiting farmers and compelling them to sell their paddy at Rs. 1,200 - Rs. 1,300 per quintal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/congress-urges-governor-to-visit-market-yards/article37799708.ece
02 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Genome sequencing being done at three labs in TS||You may have heard about role of genome sequencing in detecting Omicron, the new variant of concern, but do you know how long it takes to receive results of the sequencing? Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao says it usually takes three days. The sequencing is performed at a network of labs which come under Indian SARS-COV-2 Genomics Sequencing Consortium (INSACOG). Three labs in Telangana are part of the consortium — Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, and Gandhi Medical College. Dr Srinivasa Rao says the sequencing is done only at these three laboratories. The reports are then sent to the Central government, which declares the results. He added that Omicron has been not detected in the State or elsewhere in the country. “If any case with the variant is detected, the State and Central governments will inform people through media,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/genome-sequencing-being-done-at-3-labs/article37799689.ece

02 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Scientists studying gene mutations to check rare diseases||Scientists at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting & Diagnostics (CDFD) here are screening specific population groups in identified areas ailing from peculiar genetic diseases to check for the mutations to prevent them from moving into the next generation. Senior scientist and CDFD director K. Thangaraj on Wednesday said if the genetic mutation response is found in these groups during the ongoing study it will help in taking up counselling the populations concerned and halt the progression into the next generation. This is akin to what the Ashkenazi Jews have been successfully doing for the last few decades through community testing at the school level itself. “When the adults consent to marry, their genetic sequences are compared and either they are advised against marriage or told to keep checking for the genetic disease when pregnant. The Jews have eliminated some diseases through this process, so hopefully we too can do the same here,” he told an online gathering during the course of his presentation on ‘Human origin, health and disease’ organised by National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI). Dr. Thangaraj stated that initially Ancestral South Indians (migrating straight from Africa and Ancestral North Indians hailing from Europe through Africa, gave rise to many populations independently and during the last 2,000-4,000 years ‘admixing’ between these two founding populations of the country, gave rise to many diverse population groups. “Genetically we are more homogenous, yet with every single population with a unique genetic affinity,” said the geneticist, adding that recessive genetic diseases increases in population in endogamous marriages with the abnormal chromosome having a chance to appear in the next generation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/scientists-studying-gene-mutations-to-check-rare-diseases/article37799954.ece

The main objective of the project, however, is to ensure uninterrupted working of the passenger reservation ticketing system undeterred by natural disaster, equipment failure etc., as the recovery process and cloud centre relies on storage, replication of data and computer processing. When the main servers go down, the centre helps to retrieve the data to facilitate smooth and uninterrupted working of passenger ticketing system until the server is fixed. The infrastructure being made available can help it become a centre of excellence for Indian Railways, and tie up with prestigious institutes, said SCR General Manager Gajanan Mallya on Wednesday. Mr. Mallya had earlier inspected the Data Centre at Passenger Reservation Complex, Secunderabad, before checking the progress of the new site. At present, the data recovery centre at passenger reservation complex is providing back up for Unreserved Ticketing System, Passenger Reservation System and Electronic Procurement System applications across Indian Railways network. He was given a brief presentation on the upcoming project. In the present scenario of digitalisation, there is an urgent need for cloud storage and alternate data recovery centres and Hyderabad is suited for the data recovery centre as it is less prone to natural calamities, he pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/data-recovery-cloud-data-centre-for-railways-at-moula-ali-soon/article37799956.ece

Limbadri on Wednesday told Osmania University College of Engineering (UCE) authorities to create a helpline for students on issues like COVID vaccination. Addressing a gathering at the orientation programme for the new batch of first year students of the college, he said that such a helpline should come to the rescue of students some of whom have missed out on vaccination. The TSCHE chairman also made it clear that there should not be an iota of tolerance in case of ragging by seniors. He suggested them to approach any of the professors if they come across instances of ragging. “The body language of the new students here suggests that they are determined to achieve new heights and bring laurels not only to the institution but to their respective families,” he said. Osmania University vice-chancellor and professor D. Ravinder said that “reform, transform and perform” should be the strategy of students to reach their cherished goals. While college principal Sriram Venkatesh listed out the facilities the prestigious institution was extending to students, vice-principal Vidya Sagar cautioned students to adhere to the “minimum attendance rules”. He said that attempts to join long term coaching programmes aiming at other higher institutes of learning by not attending classes would land students in a dicey situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/call-for-helpline-on-jabs/article37799694.ece

In a letter addressed to Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, the organisation has emphasised the need for a new GHMC Act. “The present Act is a voluminous document of about 1,000 pages, and contains many provisions that are redundant now,” the letter mentioned and said that the State government is not acting upon its commitment on preparation of a new Act. FGG also pointed out the double taxation property owners in the city are put to, by being made to pay both property tax and water cess. As per the GHMC Act, property tax contains a general tax, a water tax, a drainage tax, a lighting tax and a conservancy tax, and hence, the water board charging separately amounts to double taxation, the letter pointed out and sought merger of water board with GHMC. Despite the recommendation of the Finance Commission for transfer of 11% of State budget to local bodies, it is not being done. “While potholed roads and choked nalas are crying for attention, the government, bypassing GHMC, is going for construction of flyovers,” the letter said, and asked for release of funds, and for GHMC to be allowed to function as an institution of self-governance sans interference from government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fgg-seeks-structural-reforms-in-ghmc/article37799695.ece

02 December 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Cong. for presenting united face in Punjab||As the chaos in the Congress party’s Punjab unit refuses to show any signs of abatement, the central leadership on Wednesday has reportedly conveyed to the State leadership to stay united ahead of the Assembly elections, due in early 2022. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi summoned Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, State president Navjot Singh Sidhu, former party president Sunil Jakhar and in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Choudhary for talks. Insiders said the fresh trouble in the unit has been over the process of rejigging the organisational structure. Mr. Sidhu has reportedly sent a list of district presidents to the “high command” but there are several senior leaders who have expressed reservation over the process of preparing the list. Mr. Jakhar expressed displeasure over the process of change adopted by Mr. Sidhu. In a veiled attack, Mr. Jakhar tweeted a few days ago, “Your monkey, your circus” I follow this dictum — neither suggest anything nor interfere in other’s ‘show’!”. Sources said Mr. Gandhi met Mr. Jakhar and separately met Mr. Channi, Mr. Sidhu and Mr. Choudhary. A message has been conveyed that party leaders have to present a united face, said sources. The party, which is fighting to retain power in Punjab, has been struggling to set its house in order even after the high command cornered Capt. Amarinder Singh into resigning from the post of Chief Minister. However, the situation seems to have hardly improved. Mr. Sidhu has been attacking his own Government on many issues on public platforms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cong-for-presenting-united-face-in-punjab/article37799578.ece
02 December 2021||CHANDIGARH,||In a jolt to Akali Dal, DSGMC chief joins BJP||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader and president of the Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee Manjinder Singh Sirsa on Wednesday joined the Bharatiya Janata Party, after quitting from his post. Before joining the BJP, Mr. Sirsa announced his resignation on Twitter. “With gratitude to all office-bearers, members, staff & people who worked with me; I am resigning from Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee as president. I will not contest upcoming DSGMC internal elections. My commitment to serve my community, humanity & nation remains same!” he said in a Tweet. ‘Will benefit BJP’ Mr. Sirsa is considered to be close to the ‘Badal’ family in Punjab and his joining the BJP is being seen as a jolt to the SAD ahead of the Assembly polls in Punjab, due in early 2022. Mr. Sirsa joined the BJP in the presence of Union Ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. Mr. Shekhawat, the BJP’s in-charge for the Punjab polls, said he was confident that Mr. Sirsa’s entry will benefit the party in the polls. Mr. Sirsa said there are several issues of Sikh community that have been ignored for the last over 70 years. “I have joined the BJP with the sole aim that all such issues shall be seen resolving very soon,” he said. Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma said Mr. Sirsa’s move has ensured that the BJP will get a huge majority. The SAD described Mr. Sirsa’s decision as an attempt by the enemies of the “Khalsa Panth” to achieve through conspiracies what they cannot achieve with the will of the Sikhs. “This is the continuation of Indira Gandhi tactics against Sikh quom and one more direct assault on the religious sovereignty of Khalsa Panth through the misuse of governmental might and the registration of false cases. Sikh Panth accepts this challenge and will meet it head on,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/in-a-jolt-to-akali-dal-dsgmc-chief-joins-bjp/article37799577.ece
02 December 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Cong.-AAP squabble over Punjab’s education system||Ahead of the Assembly elections in Punjab, the ruling Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party were on Wednesday involved in a sharp exchange of words on the ‘education system’ in the State. Punjab Education Minister Pargat Singh accused the Delhi Government of resorting to lies about the so-called successful education system being run by the Aam Aadmi Party. “If you have such a ‘wonderful’ system, then why are the posts of principals and vice-principals lying vacant in 760 and 479 schools respectively, besides having a shortage of 41% non-teaching staff in Delhi schools?” asked Mr. Singh. Mr. Singh described Delhi’s education system as “a bubble of water”, saying the comparison of Punjab with Delhi was totally unfounded. “Punjab is an agrarian State whereas Delhi is a municipal city so the comparison between these two was wrong. Imparting quality education in border areas has always been a challenge. On the basis of circumstances of both States, the comparison is illogical,” he added. Mr. Singh said Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia’s visit to a school’s store in Punjab was an act of AAP’s vested political interest. “I never expected such low and cheap political tactics from Mr. Sisodia. I believe in healthy discussion and fruitful debate,” said the Minister. Earlier in the day, Mr. Sisodia visited a primary school at Makrauna Kalan in Chamkaur Sahib. Mr. Sisodia said the teacher told him that the school did not even have a drinking water facility and the staff had to bring water from nearby gurdwara. Mr. Sisodia said in such a situation, if the Punjab Government calls itself number one in the education system, then it is messing with the future of the students.  If you have such a ‘wonderful’ system, then why are the posts of principals and vice-principals lying vacant ?

02 December 2021||Ghaziabad,||Asked to return PhD degree for praising PM, says AMU student||An Aligarh Muslim University student alleged that he has been asked to return his PhD degree for correction because he praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The university administration, however, called the allegations “baseless and unsubstantiated”. Danish Rahim said he was awarded a PhD degree in Linguistics in March. ‘Right-wing supporter’ “In December 2020, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the university, I praised him in the electronic media for taking everybody along. Before my viva voce, the Chairman called me and said I should not have given such a byte and it seems I support the right-wing. I took it lightly and attended the viva and received the degree. After the COVID wave, in August, I received a letter from the controller that there was an error and that my doctorate degree needs to be rectified to Language for Advertising, Marketing and Media (LAMM),” said Dr. Rahim, wondering how could such a mistake happen in a Central University. Bid to justify mistake Dr. Rahim has already approached the Allahabad High Court. He told The Hindu that in a bid to justify the mistake, the university has asked another student to return her degree. “She was awarded the degree in November 2020. She has also approached the court.” In August, he applied for the post of assistant professor but his application was not accepted because he has a PhD in LAMM, he said. “When a university that is imparting doctorate degree in LAMM is not accepting a candidate who has a PhD in the subject, why would any other university accept my candidature? The department doesn’t have any faculty with a PhD in LAMM. During M.A, we were taught by teachers who had PhD in linguistics. It seems like a ploy to scuttle my job prospects,” he said. A university spokesperson said Dr. Rahim did his masters and doctorate in LAMM under the Linguistics Department. “However, due to a typographical error and oversight, he was erroneously issued a PhD in Linguistics. He will be issued a doctorate degree in LAMM,” he said. Defamation case Describing the allegations false, Professor Warsi said he had never met Dr. Rahim in his office or elsewhere. In a university release, he said, Dr. Rahim was trying to divert attention. “I have sought legal opinion and will proceed with a defamation case against him.” Sources said the case was sub judice but Dr. Rahim still chose to raise it when the National Assessment and Accreditation Council team is on the campus. A student, requesting anonymity, said Dr. Rahim’s allegations might be baseless but it has brought some real concerns to light. “It is true that some students try to enter linguistics department through LAMM. But why will somebody spend three to four years doing PhD when he is not eligible to teach the subject or appear in NET/JRF test?”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/asked-to-return-phd-degree-for-praising-pm-says-amu-student/article37799576.ece

He urged the Government not to spread rumours and try to divide the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM). It seemed the Government wanted the agitation to end without talking to farmers across the table. “The Government should make it clear if Delhi’s doors are closed for farmers. If that is the case, can farmers shut their doors on the Government,” he asked. When the movement was inching towards its conclusion, “the Government shouldn’t indulge in jalsaazi [forgery]”. “We are ready to talk across the table. The SKM was, is, and will be there,” he stated. The last card in the hand of the Government was to break the unity of the umbrella body of farmers’ unions. “We are meeting on December 4 to decide the future course,” he remarked. The movement was in its final round and farmers should be prepared for it and reach the morchas in large numbers. “A rumour is being spread that farmers are returning home after the farm laws have been repealed in Parliament. I want to clarify that farmers continue to camp at the Delhi borders as only one issue has been resolved,” he observed. Mr. Tikait alleged that a section of the media was trying to spread misinformation that the demand for law on MSP was new.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/dont-try-to-divide-skm-rakesh-tikait/article37799569.ece

The circular had asked all Superintendents of Police and other unit in-charges to ensure a scrupulous compliance with the Act. Mr. Ponnuchami said a trend had been witnessed during the recent years for construction of places of worship with public participation in police stations and office complexes on the pretext of faith. “There is no provision for such construction in the building plans drafted and approved for the police offices,” he said. Act of 1954 A Division Bench of the High Court, comprising Chief Justice Akil Kureshi and Justice Rekha Borana, ruled that as long as the Act of 1954 stood, no petitioner could raise any objection to the Government authority issuing a circular that the provisions of the Act be implemented. The court rejected the petitioner’s plea to include Government institutions and State bodies in the definition of “public places” under the Act. “As is well settled through a series of judgments, no direction can be issued to the legislature to frame a law in a particular manner,” said the Bench. ‘Upheld State’s right’ The People’s Union for Civil Liberties-Rajasthan said the judgment had correctly upheld the right of the State to maintain public places as secular places. “The insidious agenda of the petitioner was to legitimise the conversion of public places like police stations into places which offer worship to deities from one religion alone,” PUCL State president Kavita Srivastava said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/pil-on-order-to-ban-temples-in-police-stations-dismissed/article37799568.ece
02 December 2021||LUCKNOW,||Sugar mill managers booked for cheating farmers in U.P.||The managers of a sugar mill in Uttar Pradesh’s cane-rich Lakhimpur Kheri district have been booked for criminal conspiracy, cheating and criminal breach of trust for not paying dues of over Rs. 266 crore to sugarcane farmers. The mill was accused of “financial exploitation” of farmers, fraud and fuelling “discontent” among farmers by not paying them their dues pending for a year. The FIR was registered against three officials of Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar Limited mill in Palia under Sections 120B, 420 and 406 of the IPC and Sections 3 and 7 of The Essential Commodities Act. A spokesperson for the Cane Department confirmed that an FIR had been lodged and further action would be taken as per the laws governing the supply and purchase of sugarcane. The FIR lodged on the complaint of Rajesh Kumar Singh, Special Secretary of the Cane Department (Palia), names three persons — manager of the mill (adhyasee) Pradeep Salar, finance manager Manoj Kumar Mishra and general manager sugarcane Sunil Kumar Dhingra. According to the FIR, the mill had started the “crushing” work for the last season on November 11, 2020. Till March 25, 2021 it purchased 120.60 lakh quintals valued at Rs. 387.1 crore as per the recommended Government rate. However, it paid only Rs. 120.99 crore and despite sending it several notices, the mill deliberately did not pay the dues, said Mr. Singh in his complaint. Farmers have been staging a dharna demanding their dues, due to which the mill has not been able to operate for the 2021-2022 crushing season. Strict instructions On November 26, Commissioner of Cane and Sugar, Sanjay R. Bhoosreddy, had said strict instructions had been given to the mills for speedy cane price payment for the current crushing season. The farmers had already been paid Rs. 553.26 crore against the due price of Rs. 510.20 crore for 2021-2022, which is Rs. 43.06 crore more than the due, Mr. Bhoosreddy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sugar-mill-managers-booked-for-cheating-farmers-in-up/article37799895.ece

02 December 2021||New Delhi,||Petrol gets cheaper by Rs. 8 per litre in Delhi as Govt. cuts VAT||The Delhi Government on Wednesday brought down the Value Added Tax (VAT) on petrol to 19.4% from 30%. As a result, petrol will be cheaper by Rs. 8 per litre in the city. The decision was taken at a Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. The new rate will come into effect on Thursday, according to an official notification. “Today we made petrol very cheap in Delhi. VAT rate has been reduced from 30% to 19.4%. Petrol and diesel have become cheaper in Delhi as compared to other cities of NCR. I hope this step will give relief to the people of Delhi from inflation,” Mr. Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi. But there was no announcement of a cut in VAT on diesel. “The diesel price in Delhi is already the cheapest in NCR at Rs. 86.67 per litre, while the rates in Noida and Gurugram are Rs. 87.01 and Rs. 87.11 per litre respectively,” a Government statement said. Last year, the Delhi Government had increased the VAT on petrol from 27% to 30%. Welfare of farmers The BJP and the Congress hit out at the Delhi Government for not reducing the VAT on diesel and said that the step to bring down VAT on petrol had come late. Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri demanded that Mr. Kejriwal reduce VAT on diesel, considering the welfare of farmers and public transport operators. “VAT on diesel in Delhi is the highest compared to other States. This proves that Mr. Kejriwal is anti-farmer because transporters and farmers use only diesel to run their trucks and tractors,” Mr. Bidhuri said. He said that a reduction in VAT on diesel would also help lower the prices of vegetables and other essential items, which would directly benefit the public. Delhi Congress president Ch. Anil Kumar said that the persistent protests by his party forced Mr. Kejriwal to bring down VAT on petrol. “But unless VAT on diesel is also reduced, Delhiites will continue to suffer because of the soaring prices of essential commodities.” The frequent hike in the prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas had wrecked the lives of the people as it had a cascading effect on the costs of all essential commodities, Mr. Kumar said. “Mr. Kejriwal tried to delay reducing VAT on fuel as long as possible and now has made a half-hearted effort by lowering it only on petrol,” the Congress leader said. Both parties said that they will force the Government to reduce VAT on diesel as well if the CM does not do it immediately.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/petrol-gets-cheaper-by-rs-8-per-litre-in-delhi-as-govt-cuts-vat/article37799553.ece
02 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Never thought I’d be a hate crime victim’||Resting on a bed at his modest house in south Delhi’s Zakir Nagar, 62-year-old Kazeem Ahmad Sherwani still trembles while recalling the incident when he was allegedly waylaid, thrashed and looted by four persons in Noida earlier this year. “I had read about incidents of hate crimes against Muslims but never thought I would be a victim one day... They (accused) brutally thrashed me and broke my nose with a screwdriver... I still experience body pain due to the incident,” Mr. Sherwani, who runs a ration shop, told The Hindu . On July 4, Mr. Sherwani, on his way to Aligarh to attend a nephew’s wedding, was waiting for a bus at Noida’s Sector 37 bus stand around 8 p.m. when a van, carrying four persons, stopped and offered him a lift. “I tried to get into the empty seat in the middle row but they signalled me to move to the back row where two persons were already sitting,” he said. Soon, Mr. Sherwani said he started feeling anxious and wanted to get out of the vehicle. “They looked suspicious so I asked them to let me out of the vehicle but suddenly one of the guys shut all the windows and they started assaulting me... they pulled my beard, snatched all the cash I had and started abusing my religion,” Mr. Sherwani recalled. Held captive After being held captive in the van for 15 minutes, Mr. Sherwani was dumped at an unknown spot. “They left me stranded in the middle of nowhere... I could not understand anything as I was heavily injured and bleeding,” he said. He was rescued by a passerby and taken to the Noida Sector 37 police station where he claimed that police officers asked for his basic information but “refused to get him medical help and get his MLC (medicolegal case) done”. Thereafter, Mr. Sherwani was taken to his niece, who is a doctor, and treated for his injuries. Mr. Sherwani claimed that police officers, despite visiting his house, refused to take his written complaint and said he was “politicising a non-issue”. He has now moved the Supreme Court, asking for action against the “erring officers” and seeking compensation for victims of hate crime. When contacted, a senior police officer from Noida Sector 37 police station refused to comment on the case. “Before the incident, I used to travel alone everywhere but now I am scared to go out as my attire might attract undue attention ,” Mr. Sherwani lamented. “Even though the incident has left me traumatised, I will continue to wear a skullcap as it is a sign of my religion and I consider it supreme... I will wear it even if I get killed,” he said. Mr. Sherwani said his neighbours have stood by him after the incident and he hopes the Supreme Court will give him justice. “Moving a petition was the only option I had and I am sure the judiciary will punish the perpetrators who had targeted me simply because I am a Muslim.” A Division Bench of the apex court has tagged his petition with other writ petitions dealing with hate crimes and will hear the matter on December 3.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/never-thought-id-be-a-hate-crime-victim/article37799561.ece
02 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Central Vista project of national importance’||The Government said on Wednesday that the Central Vista project is of “national importance” and work on it is continuing, even as a construction ban reimposed by the Supreme Court is in place in the Capital. The Urban Affairs Ministry, in its affidavit, assured the Supreme Court that the project to build a new Parliament building and Central Vista avenues “do not cause any pollution”. A Special Bench led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana had reimposed the ban on November 24 as a drastic interim measure. However, on November 29, senior advocate Vikas Singh, for petitioner Aditya Dubey, had informed the court that the Central Vista project was going ahead “full steam” in spite of the ban. The court had then directed the Centre to come clean on whether it was engaged in any construction activities in the Capital. The Bench is scheduled to hear the case on December 2. In its affidavit, the Centre explained that the construction activities it had undertaken are in two parts — “the new Parliament building and the Central Vista avenues, which are projects of national importance, and Metro Rail, railways, airports, ISBTs, etc”. The Ministry said the project complies with the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules and “each and every condition which is out to ensure that it does not cause pollution”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/central-vista-project-of-national-importance/article37799556.ece

02 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre attempting to create a rift, says SKM||On a day of continuing informal discussions between a section of farm union leaders and Central officials, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha accused the Government of attempting to divide their movement by relying on back channels rather than reviving the formal dialogue process. Moving forward on the Prime Minister’s promise to set up a committee to discuss Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops among other issues, officials from the Agriculture and Home Ministries have reached out telephonically to multiple leaders, including members of the SKM core committee. They have asked for five names to represent farmers’ interests on the panel. Some leaders said calls had also been received from Intelligence officials. The Punjab and Haryana unions held separate meetings on Wednesday, where this issue was discussed, but reiterated that they would defer to the SKM for a final decision at its December 4 meeting. Awaits communication The SKM condemned attempts “to divide protesting farmers by not re-initiating formal dialogue and not responding formally to the letter sent by it reminding the Government about the pending demands,” adding that the platform is awaiting formal written communication on the committee’s mandate and terms of reference. On Monday, Parliament repealed the three contentious farm reform laws as had been demanded by the protesting unions, shifting the focus to their other key demand for a legal guarantee that all farmers will receive MSP of one and a half times the comprehensive cost of production for all their crops. On November 19, the PM said a committee would be formed “to promote zero budgeting based agriculture, to change crop pattern as per the changing needs of the country and to make MSP more effective and transparent”, with representatives from State and Central Governments, farmers, agricultural scientists and economists. “We need a committee specifically for drafting a law on MSP. But if you want to add in zero budget agriculture and crop diversity and all sorts of other issues, this committee will become a joke. We have had past experience of such committees,” said Yudhvir Singh, general secretary of the Tikait faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, who is also an SKM core committee member. “The committee must be given powers, so that the Government is bound to implement its decisions. Otherwise, it will be an eyewash.” Several union leaders said an indicator of the Government’s interest in dialogue would be its response to their demands regarding cases filed against protesters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/centre-attempting-to-create-a-rift-says-skm/article37799572.ece
02 December 2021||New Delhi,||Allot common symbol to Chandra Shekhar Aazad’s party: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the Election Commission to allot a common election symbol to Chandra Shekhar Aazad’s political party for the upcoming Assembly elections in five States. Justice Prateek Jalan directed the EC to facilitate the process after it said that it had no objection to granting a common symbol to the Bhim Army chief for his ‘Azad Samaj Party (Kanshi Ram)’ as long as a common symbol is available in all five States and the already allotted common symbol for three States is surrendered. “The Commission will inform the petitioner of the symbols which are available in each of the five States and the petitioner may opt for any of those and it may be allotted to him. The Election Commission is directed to facilitate this process,” said the judge who was hearing Mr. Aazad’s petition seeking a common election symbol for his political outfit. “Make sure that he gets a common symbol, whatever it is... Whatever you find is available in all five States, give it to him,” the court told the EC. “Tell your client no fussing about which symbol it is,” the judge told the counsel for the petitioner. The petitioner’s lawyer said that in terms of an earlier order asking him to approach the EC for the grant of a common symbol, applications were made by him but no action was taken by the authorities. Poll panel’s reply Advocate Sidhant Kumar, representing the EC, stated that pursuant to the applications, the petitioner has been allotted a common symbol ‘helicopter’ for three States — Punjab, Goa and Manipur. He added that while the application for Uttar Pradesh was rejected for being premature, the symbol sought was also not available for Uttarakhand. The petitioner’s lawyer asserted that there was no preference for any particular symbol and any common symbol may be allotted for the petitioner’s political party. Considering that the petitioner was seeking “any” common symbol for his political party, the court asked the EC to inform him about the symbols available in the five States and facilitate the process after fresh applications are made.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/allot-common-symbol-to-aazads-party-delhi-hc/article37799565.ece
02 December 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi Govt. notice to CPWD on ban violation||The Delhi Government on Wednesday issued a notice to the Central Public Works Department for allegedly violating the construction ban, imposed due to high pollution levels, for the Central Vista project, authorities said. After inspecting the Central Vista site, Environment Minister Gopal Rai said: “We were repeatedly getting calls that despite the ban, construction activities were on in full swing at the Central Vista site. We came here today for an inspection and saw what all work was in progress at the site despite the ban on construction and demolition activities in Delhi. Keeping this violation in mind, we are issuing a notice to the CPWD, asking them on what basis and on whose orders are they still operating.” Mr. Rai said there was also a “blatant violation” of the anti-dust pollution guidelines at the Central Vista and the Government will issue another notice for it. “This will be done to ensure that all the guidelines and norms to keep dust pollution under control are followed. On the basis of their response, we will take further action. The CPWD and authorities concerned are expected to respond by tomorrow (Thursday),” he said. From November 1-23, when air pollution had spiked in the city, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee imposed a fine of Rs. 50 lakh on different polluting activities, as per official data. The highest number of inspections — 1,411— were done at construction sites. The air quality of the city was ‘very poor’ on Wednesday and is likely to remain in the same level on Thursday. The AQI was recorded at 370 on Wednesday. Speed of local surface level winds is expected to pick up from Friday and the AQI is likely to improve sightly, said Government-run monitoring agency SAFAR.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-govt-notice-to-cpwd-on-ban-violation/article37799557.ece
02 December 2021||New Delhi,||HC pulls up civic bodies on rising dengue cases||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday pulled up the municipal corporations for their failure to control the spread of dengue, which has doubled this year in the national capital. “This is a sorry state of affairs in the national capital. It is a disillusion. There is a complete paralysis in civic administration as no one is bothered about the deaths. The officials are living with the attitude that since there is a large population, the disease will come and go,” a Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said. The High Court said the authorities have become so populist in their approach that they are scared of doing anything that will lose them votes. “If only elections were fought and won or lost on real issues, we would have a different city... Today they are being fought on what is free,” it said. The court appointed an amicus curiae to assist it in the mosquito matter, including in diseases like dengue, malaria, and chikungunya, and sent the case before the Chief Justice, which is also dealing with another suo motu petition on the infestation of mosquito breeding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/hc-pulls-up-civic-bodies-on-rising-dengue-cases/article37799549.ece

02 December 2021||New Delhi,||Draft NCR regional plan to be published for feedback||The draft regional plan-2041 for the National Capital Region (NCR) that would reduce the size of the region while promoting vertical growth is likely to be published for feedback this month, a senior Government official said on Wednesday. A version of the draft plan was approved by the NCR Planning Board at its meeting on October 12. In a statement that day, the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry had said that the plan would be notified by March 2022. While some changes had been made since then, the regional plan 2041 would lead to the shrinking of the NCR and promotion of vertical development, as the initial draft had proposed, the official said. While the NCRPB had decided to include “natural zones” and areas where Central and State laws and judicial orders would regulate development in the plan, the exact definition and features of these areas are likely to be added to the draft that will be published soon, according to officials. The draft plan had proposed transit-oriented development along all major transport corridors, allowing a higher floor-area ratio, mixed land-use in the older parts of cities and vertical development. All major cities of the NCR would be connected with each other by 30-minute train rides and the boundaries of the NCR would be connected to Delhi by 30-minute mass transit rail. On the boundary of the NCR, the draft plan had proposed limiting the NCR to a 100 km radius from Rajghat, plus 1-km corridor on either side of connecting expressways, national highways, State highways and regional rapid transit system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/draft-ncr-regional-plan-to-be-published-for-feedback/article37799559.ece

Chairing a high-level meeting in view of the likely formation of a cyclone, Chief Secretary Suresh Chandra Mohapatra directed coastal District Collectors to keep the multipurpose cyclone shelter ready and take stock of availability of dry food. “Farmers should be advised to harvest ripened paddy or vegetables and stock them in safer place,” he said. Special Relief Commissioner P.K. Jena informed that 108 units of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force and National Disaster Response Force and 200 fire service teams would be positioned ahead of the cyclone hitting the coast. Since India Meteorological Department warned of heavy rain on December 4, civic bodies have been directed to keep pumps ready so that water could be discharged easily in the event of water-logging. A 24-hour control room would start functioning to coordinate rescue and relief operations. DCs have been provided eight-point check-list to deal with any emergency situation. The list includes compliance of COVID-19 protocols in cyclone shelters, shifting of pregnant women to the nearest health centres, arrangement of food for children and deployment of ASHA and Anganwadi workers at cyclone shelters.

02 December 2021||Geneva,||Vulnerable should put off travel: WHO||The WHO said on Tuesday that those not fully vaccinated against COVID-19, including people over 60 years of age, who are also vulnerable to the disease should put off travel to areas with community transmission. The World Health Organization also said blanket travel bans would not stop the spread of the Omicron variant. The new COVID-19 variant of concern, which the WHO says poses a “very high” risk globally, has prompted many countries to shut borders. “Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread, and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods,” the WHO said in a travel advice statement on Omicron. “In addition, they can adversely impact global health efforts during a pandemic by disincentivising countries to report and share epidemiological and sequencing data.” First reported to the WHO less than a week ago after being detected in southern Africa earlier this month, Omicron has already appeared in several countries. The WHO noted the increasing number of governments introducing travel measures, including temporarily banning arrivals from countries where the variant has been found. The WHO said that as of Sunday, 56 countries were reportedly implementing travel measures aimed at potentially delaying the importation of the new variant. “Persons who have not been fully vaccinated or do not have proof of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and are at increased risk of developing severe disease and dying, including people 60 years of age or older or those with comorbidities that present increased risk of severe COVID-19 (e.g. heart disease, cancer and diabetes) should be advised to postpone travel to areas with community transmission,” the said. Elsewhere, the WHO advised countries to apply an “evidence-informed and risk-based approach” when implementing travel measures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/vulnerable-should-put-off-travel-who/article37799246.ece
02 December 2021||Brussels,||EU plans €300 billion infra fund to counter China’s BRI||The European Commission announced on Wednesday a plan to mobilise €300 billion ($340 billion) in public and private infrastructure investment around the world, a move seen as a response to China’s Belt and Road strategy. “Global Gateway will aim at mobilising investments of up to 300 billion euros between 2021 and 2027... bringing together resources of the EU, member states, European financial institutions and national development finance institutions,” a commission document said. Global Gateway The Global Gateway plan does not mention China’s rival and longer-standing international infrastructure strategy by name — but EU chief Ursula von der Leyen called it a “roadmap for major investment in infrastructure development around the world.” The money to be made available will not come from EU and member state coffers, and the plan will need funding from international institutions and from the private sector if it is to get anywhere near its target. China launched its global investment strategy known as Belt and Road, a flagship project of President Xi Jinping, in 2013. Beijing has said it had invested $139.8 billion by 2020, including $22.5 billion last year alone. Officially, it aims to develop land and sea infrastructure to better connect China to Asia, Europe and Africa for trade and development, and it has found many partners around the world. The West, however, sees it as a tool for China to influence poorer countries. They criticise Beijing for inciting emerging economies to take on too much debt, and allege the secretive tender process is prone to corruption. China argues that it respects its partners’ sovereignty while providing loans that benefit joint projects, while critics say Beijing’s contractual terms ignore abuses of human, labour and environmental rights. The EU strategy is an offshoot of a plan by G7 countries to offer developing countries an alternative to Belt and Road Initiative, presented in June at the industrial powers’ summit in Cornwall.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/eu-plans-300-billion-infra-fund-to-counter-chinas-bri/article37799238.ece

At the start of the pandemic, the brothers soared to new heights of popularity: Andrew Cuomo earned praise for his frank daily briefings as the coronavirus ravaged New York, and their live exchanges on CNN were peppered with banter. But after months of battling claims that he had harassed about a dozen women including former staffers, Andrew Cuomo resigned from office in August. “The New York Attorney General’s office released transcripts and exhibits on Monday that shed new light on Chris Cuomo’s involvement in his brother’s defence,” a CNN spokesperson said. “The documents raise serious questions.” The spokesperson said while CNN had “understood his need to put family first and job second” in aiding Mr. Andrew, it said the transcripts “point to a greater level of involvement in his brother’s efforts than we previously knew.” “As a result, we have suspended Chris indefinitely, pending further evaluation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/cnn-suspends-chris-cuomo-for-helping-brother-andrew/article37799236.ece

The Afghans also called for an end to blacklists and sanctions in meetings led by Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Tom West, the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan. It was the second round of talks between the two sides in Qatar since the U.S. exit. “The two delegations discussed political, economic, human, health, education and security issues as well as providing necessary banking and cash facilities,” tweeted Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi. “The Afghan delegation assured the U.S. side of security and urged that Afghanistan’s frozen money should be released unconditionally, blacklists and sanctions must end and human issues be separated from political ones.” Washington seized nearly $9.5 billion in assets belonging to the Afghan central bank. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank also suspended activities in Afghanistan, withholding aid as well as $340 million in new reserves.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taliban-urge-us-to-release-frozen-funds/article37799242.ece
02 December 2021||Sydney,||China is trying to drive Australia to its knees: U.S.||U.S. President Joe Biden’s top Pacific envoy on Wednesday accused China of trying to “drive Australia to its knees” through a barrage of sanctions that amounted to “economic warfare”. In remarks to the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, veteran diplomat Kurt Campbell lampooned Beijing for strong-arm tactics. Painting China as increasingly bellicose and determined to impose its will overseas, Mr. Campbell said Beijing had engaged in “really dramatic economic warfare — directed against Australia”. Over the last two years, China has introduced a raft of punitive sanctions on Australian goods in a fierce political dispute that has frozen ministerial contacts and plunged relations into the most serious crisis since the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989. “China’s preference would have been to break Australia. To drive Australia to its knees,” said Mr. Campbell, who currently serves as the White House Indo-Pacific coordinator. China has been angered at Australia’s willingness to legislate against overseas influence operations, to bar Huawei from 5G contracts and to call for an independent probe into the origins of the novel coronavirus. Australian barley, coal, copper ores, cotton, hay, logs, rock lobsters, sugar, wine, beef, citrus fruit, grains, table grapes, dairy products and infant formula have all been subject to Chinese sanctions. He said that under President Xi Jinping, China has become “more risk acceptant, more assertive, more determined to basically take steps that other countries would view as coercive”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-is-trying-to-drive-australia-to-its-knees-us/article37799244.ece

02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The TMC is playing T20, AAP a Test match||The political expansion spree by West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Mamata Banerjee is proceeding at breakneck speed. Last week, the TMC ‘swooped down’ on most of the Congress legislative party in Meghalaya, including former Congress Chief Minister Mukul Sangma. The effect was as intended; it created much flutter in political circles over whether an ascendant TMC might soon displace a fast-declining Congress as the principal Opposition party of the country. In terms of vote share Such prognostications need to be tempered with a heavy dose of reality. Even now the Congress is a 20% vote-share party and five times the size of the TMC. At the State level, the vote share of the Congress exceeds 30% in 10 Indian States. It is hard to imagine the TMC coming close to this level of a national presence anytime soon, particularly with its current crop of inductions. Outside the North-east, the entrants comprise a ragtag group of political lightweights — disgruntled local politicians, ageing intellectuals and media-influencing celebrities. This national expansion drive of the TMC is geared towards quickly transforming the party into a national political brand. The objective is to turn Mamata Banerjee from a Bengali leader to a national leader, and thereby the most prominent non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), non-Congress Party contender for the post of Prime Minister. The party has pitched itself squarely to disaffected Congress voters as a much more capable force than the Congress to take on the BJP. But does the expansion strategy of the TMC represent a serious long-term challenge for the Congress? The answer probably lies in the negative. In order to understand this we must look at the different routes a party might take to scale up as a national player, and how the TMC’s peculiar route places limitations on its spread. There have been two traditional routes a party takes to expand its national footprint, none of which is available to the TMC, because of its intrinsic limitations. Social base, ideology The first one is leveraging a committed social base. The Swatantra Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) are good examples of this. The Swatantra Party’s distinct appeal among the land-owning dominant castes repelled by the Congress’s flirtation with socialistic policies (examples being the Rajputs in Rajasthan and the Patidars and Kshatriyas in Gujarat) allowed it to expand rapidly, perhaps becoming the most prominent Opposition party of the 1960s. Similarly, the BSP built its support base among the Jatav Dalits to establish a significant presence across North India, especially Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. The TMC, however, lacks a distinct social base, especially if one views the party from outside West Bengal. Ms. Banerjee’s appeal among women and Muslim voters of Bengal has been nurtured over a period of time with specific welfare benefits targeted at them; hence this appeal might not readily transcend State borders. While her anti-BJP credentials might appeal to many Muslims outside Bengal, these voters would more likely choose the best bet against the BJP in their State rather than plumping for a greenhorn such as the TMC. Another route is through a distinct ideological platform, a path trodden by the Communists and the BJP. Being a centrist umbrella party, the Congress had always been vulnerable to raids on its ideological flanks. The Communists (as well as an assortment of socialist parties) steadily built themselves up by poaching the Congress voter base from the Left; as subsequently the BJP did through appropriation of upper caste Congress voters from the Right. But there is little that is recognisably different that the TMC offers in terms of ideology from the Congress, or indeed other regional parties. All these parties follow a similar brand of centre-left politics along with a commitment to secularism. In fact, in terms of ideology, the Congress retains the important advantage over the TMC of not being hamstrung by a regional/linguistic identity. As far as the BJP voters are concerned, the TMC remains a non-starter owing to its strident anti-BJP anti-Narendra Modi rhetoric. However, these two fundamental constraints — the lack of a social base and a distinct ideological platform — are also shared by the other claimant to the Congress space, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). AAP’s strategy, the NCP Yet, the AAP has been able to fashion for itself a new route to expansion — an alternative model of governance. It is the AAP’s promise of the Delhi model of governance — free public services and clean governance — that is primarily behind its surge in greenfield States. Even though the TMC has also instituted its own share of successful welfare schemes in Bengal, they have not quite crystallised themselves in the public imagination as a novel and attractive model of governance. This is partly the outcome of the TMC’s own national messaging, where it has privileged burnishing its anti-BJP credentials over communicating a positive vision of governance. In contrast, AAP has sought to cultivate a broad buy-in to its model of governance by muting its anti-BJP character. If there is a precedent for Ms. Banerjee’s fast-track route to expansion, it lies in retracing the path taken by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Sharad Pawar, around the turn of the century. This strategy involves three elements. First, the instrument of expansion is the leveraging of financial resources to co-opt regional elites. The TMC’s focus on the North-east is only partly a function of geographical proximity. In Tripura and the Barak valley of Assam, the TMC seeks to build on its Bengali constituency. However, the wider North-east crucially represents the most fertile terrain for the strategy of winning over freewheeling ethnic elites with political patronage, a long-standing pattern in the region. It is not a coincidence that the NCP also found considerable success (outside Maharashtra) only in the North-east. Within five years of its formation, even as its expansion drive was flailing elsewhere, the NCP controlled two dozen MLAs across four different States in the North-east. In terms of leadership Second, the rationale for expansion is not made in terms of policy or ideology, but in terms of leadership. The NCP’s aspiration to be the principal anti-BJP pole in place of the Congress grounded itself in Mr. Pawar’s superior claim over Congress leader Sonia Gandhi to the chair of Prime Minister, who was seen as an inexperienced usurper of foreign origin. Similarly, the TMC claims it has been pushed to take over the national opposition space because a fiery street fighter such as Ms. Banerjee is better suited to the mantle of national leadership than a feckless Rahul Gandhi, Congress leader. Third, the objective of ultimately occupying national leadership is designed to be achieved more through elite politics than popular groundswell. Mr. Pawar’s national aspirations were based on his famed networking abilities across party lines, and not so much on the numerical strength of his party in the Lok Sabha. In this strategy, even a model presence of the party outside the home state, even if caused mainly by defections, is enough to carry its leader to the top office. For the function of the party's national presence here is to build up the credentials of the party leader, and to provide a degree of legitimacy to the elite compromise that eventually makes them the Prime Minister. Similarly, the TMC understands it would be hard put to compete with the Congress’s numbers even if it sweeps Bengal and some tiny pockets of the North-east, its realistic arena of expansion. Therefore, Ms. Banerjee is also banking on an elite compromise should the BJP fall short of the majority mark in 2024. This is why political operatives such as Prashant Kishore and Yashwant Sinha have been duly assigned to maintain a constant line of communication with regional party bosses. The purpose is not so much to forge a pre-election coalition as to nurture a stream of goodwill for Ms. Banerjee across party lines, which might be put to good use in the event of an indecisive mandate. A perspective There are a few downsides to the TMC’s national ambitions. The party seems unusually secure in its home State of Bengal, with a battered BJP and a dormant Left providing little opposition. Projecting Ms. Banerjee as a likely prime ministerial candidate would likely play well in Bengal, only adding to its dominant position in the State. There is a long-standing yearning among Bengalis to see one of their own occupy the top chair. Even to this day, Bengalis ruefully remember Jyoti Basu’s missed opportunity of 1996. However, outside Bengal (and Bengali-speaking areas, the party that is more likely to appropriate the electoral space of the Congress is AAP and not the TMC. In line with its long-term plans, AAP is laying down deeper roots in new States — building up a local leadership in place of engineering defections; crafting State-specific narratives instead of blanket anti-BJPism, and privileging coherent planning over headline-generating manoeuvres. In cricketing parlance, the TMC is playing T20 cricket while AAP is playing a test match. Even as the dazzle of the TMC might cause periodic headaches for the Congress, it is still well placed to see off the TMC challenge much like it did with the NCP. It is the steady encroachment of AAP that the Congress should view as the bigger threat.

02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||A capital functioning from different regions||The Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Repeal Bill, 2021, aiming to repeal the earlier laws that stipulated a three-capitals plan for the State, was passed by the Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) Assembly on November 22, 2021. That the current government would like to introduce a comprehensive, complete, and better Bill afresh is indicative  of its resolve to utilise decentralisation for an inclusive A.P. Decentralised development Andhra Pradesh was bifurcated into A.P. and Telangana under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act of 2014 with the capital, Hyderabad, going to Telangana. Soon after, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs constituted the K.C. Sivaramakrishnan Expert Committee to come up with a strategy for the new capital of A.P. After State-wide public consultations and studies, the committee recommended the trifurcation of primary capital functions. In doing so, it advocated a decentralised model of development as against the 19th century visions of concentrating wealth in select centers to create megacities like Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. The State has three distinct regions with uneven socio-economic development. The Rayalaseema region in the south-west, comprising the Chittoor, Kadapa, Anantapur and Kurnool districts, has dismal development indices. Similarly, the culturally rich Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam to the north-east support vast forest tracts and tribal belts that are deprived of development. In both these areas, deficiency of basic services, inadequate social and physical infrastructure and low employment opportunities pose serious challenges. In contrast, coastal A.P., comprising nine districts, is a better developed region. The regional imbalance is further compounded by a similar spatial imbalance of urban settlements. Locating the capital at Vijayawada would further the asymmetry as historically, such developments have inhibited the aspirations of other urban settlements. The suggested trifurcation provided an opportunity to correct the regional imbalance and redistribute wealth. However, the then A.P. government chose to ignore the recommendations of the committee and selected an area of Vijayawada, which was specifically classified as unsuitable by the committee. The unsuitability was premised on the area being a part of the floodplains of the Krishna River; supporting fertile agricultural land; and having soil that is not conducive for construction. Instead, the government chose to opt for a green field city — Amravati — as its capital, but not without losing out on the opportunity to correct spatial imbalances in regional development and settlement patterns in the State. Decentralised development — spatial and administrative — has been advocated by many committees since the 1950s through the 1980s to be finally enacted as the 73rd and 74th Amendments to the Constitution. The distribution of the capital functions to several locations is one way of decontrolling development. It is neither a new nor a novel idea. Maharashtra, for example, performs its capital functions from Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur. In Madhya Pradesh, while the executive and legislative functions are performed from the capital at Bhopal, the High Court is located at Jabalpur with Circuit Benches at Indore and Gwalior, respectively. Jammu and Srinagar have been performing the capital functions for the State (now Union Territory) of Jammu and Kashmir. While Uttar Pradesh functions from Prayagraj (Allahabad) and Lucknow, Uttarakhand has declared that Gairsen would be its summer capital. South Africa has three capitals: Pretoria (executive); Bloemfontein (judicial); and Cape Town (legislative). None of these functions is in Johannesburg, the largest city in the country. The historically perpetuated regional imbalances in A.P. as well as its elongated shape necessitate a ‘multi-nodal region’. In 2019, the then government revisited the decision on Amravati. It appointed yet another committee with a mandate to suggest a “comprehensive development strategy for all-round balanced development of the state, including the Capital”. The committee’s views were aligned with the earlier committees’ views on decentralising capital functions while also recommending a scaling down of the proposed works at Amravati. Here we would like to draw out the subtle, yet critical, difference between decentralised capitals and decentralising capital functions. While the former assumes three capitals anchored around the functions of the executive, the legislature and the judiciary, the latter connotes one seat of capital — symbolically and physically — with the three functions being performed in different locations. Both the committees have recommended the latter. Embedded within this thinking are the objectives of creating pluralisation of services and/or conduits for services and the attendant dispersal of geographic space, one that responds to regional development needs. The second committee too premised its recommendations on the understanding that the State, while well-endowed with natural resources, showcases regional variations that need corrective measures. An emerging imperative therefore was to trigger development in the Rayalaseema districts as well as the north-eastern belt while simultaneously reducing pressure on the coast. In line with these imperatives, the second committee recommended distributed development and decentralised governance. The already functioning Grama Sachivalayams ensuring administration at the lowest level underpinned this recommendation. Two principles Guiding the decentralising capital functions recommendation were two foundational principles. First, development interventions should derive from the ‘genius’ of the geography rather than externally imposed, contextually blind suggestions. Second, while focusing on infrastructural development, there should be ‘positive constraints’ in order to protect the natural resource base that must be mapped. Deriving from these guiding principles, the committee reiterated the earlier committee’s recommendations of decentralising capital functions (as against three capitals). In the proposed decentralised ‘capital functions’ strategy, the committee recommended that the Amravati-Mangalagiri complex host the Legislative Assembly (winter), Governor’s seat and the Chief Minister’s camp office. The Secretariat was proposed at the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region (VMR), preferably away from the coast and away from Visakhapatnam city, closer to Vizianagram. The High Court was to be located at Kurnool. High Court benches were proposed in the Amaravati–Mangalagiri complex and the VMR. The idea was to trigger a just model of development while taking services to people. The recommendations of both the committees to distribute capital functions predates the pandemic which has exposed the massive inequalities both at the national and State levels and the fallacies of centralising growth. While the pandemic is a reminder that urbanisation must be a balanced, equitable and inclusive process, floods and droughts are a warning against urbanising the floodplains of our rivers. K.T. Ravindran, former Chairman of the Delhi Urban Art Commission, was member of both committees, and Anjali Karol Mohan, visiting faculty, NLSIU, Bangalore, was member of the second committee. Mahavir, Professor and former Dean, SPA, New Delhi, contributed to this article.

02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||In border stand-off, a manufactured refugee crisis||Tensions have flared in Eastern Europe and on the Belarusian-Polish border with thousands of asylum seekers attempting to enter Poland, which constitutes the external border of the European Union (EU). Belarus is accused of permitting visa-free entry to refugees, in particular Kurds, from the war-torn West Asia and encouraging their passage to the EU border. Since the EU’s external border constitutes its only line of defence against unwanted migrants, Poland used water cannon and tear gas to repel the asylum-seekers, and except for the gravely ill, those who breached the border have been pushed back. In freezing conditions, some 15 or more refugees have died. This crisis and escalation of rhetoric between the EU, Poland, Belarus, Russia and Ukraine subserve aspects of the foreign and domestic agendas of all these governments. For Belarus President Aleksander Lukashenko, under sanctions by the EU since last year’s election when he secured a sixth dubious term, this is brinkmanship with both the EU and Russia. Belarus has economic and military alliances with Russia, effectively making it the Russian last frontier against an encroaching North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). While Belarus is entirely dependent on Russia, this does not preclude a client state from proving a difficult partner. North Korea is troublesome for China, Haiti for the United States, and there are other examples nearer home. Mr. Lukashenko even threatened to block the pipeline transporting Russian gas through Belarus to the EU, a threat speedily negated by Moscow. A focus on the EU President Lukashenko denies inviting migrants to Belarus, instead blaming the EU for closing its borders. He seeks to pressure the EU with a scenario akin the 2015 refugee crisis, when the EU gave money and non-financial incentives to Turkey and certain Libyan warlords to restrain the migration exodus. Finding these tactics blocked, he proposed that Germany take in 2,000 refugees while 7,000 others would be repatriated, but this was rejected, and the majority of migrants are refusing to go home. Politicians in West and East Europe accuse Moscow as instigator of the crisis amid claims that Russia is about to invade Ukraine. It defies logic why Russia would stage a crisis with Germany, the destination of the asylum seekers, and invade Ukraine, when procedures are afoot to certify Nord Stream 2, a pipeline to deliver gas to the EU bypassing Ukraine and Belarus. The argument of instigating Russia into reckless action involving Belarus and Ukraine in order to derail Nord Stream 2 makes much more sense, particularly from an American viewpoint. After initially declaring that it saw no evidence of Russian mobilisation, Ukraine changed tack and endorsed NATO claims of an imminent invasion. Russian grievances concern the use of Turkish-built drones in the Donbass breakaway provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, and provocative NATO activities close to its land and sea borders. The 2015 Minsk agreement was designed to end the conflict in Donbass through provincial elections, decentralisation and the restoration of socio-economic relations between Kiev and the breakaway self-styled republics, but there has been no constitutional amendment, no elections, and Donbass is subject to an economic blockade. Moscow has evidently lost hope in Kiev observing the Minsk agreement for substantial regional autonomy. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decree of 2019 allowed Donbass people to claim Russian citizenship, and the latest Kremlin moves to integrate Donbass economically, will turn Ukraine’s east, like Crimea, slowly into a de facto Russian region. Warsaw’s stance Poland seems the unwilling victim of the tactics of Belarus, but the refugee crisis is a godsend for Warsaw when both Poland and the EU are entangled in a bitter dispute over the rule of law after Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal invalidated some provisions of the EU Treaty. Contrary to EU’s principles, Warsaw promotes ‘traditional values’ which include homophobic legislation, LGBT-free zones and a ban on abortions. Poland has imposed a ban on journalists and NGOs within three kilometres of its frontier, and is under criticism from human rights groups and the Council of Europe, but the tension affords Warsaw scope to boost anti-Russian rhetoric and proclaim itself a defender of Europe, despite anti-immigrant tirades being a staple of its far-right politics. The border problem also gives the EU the opportunity to prove its worth to Poland by extending its fulsome support. The larger issue The crisis on the Belarus-Poland border is symptomatic of the wider refugee problem. In recent months the United States has turned away Haitians, Thailand Burmese, India Rohingyas and Afghans. More than 25,000 people arrived in Britain by sea this year, causing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to fulminate against France’s failure to stem the refugees of whom 27 drowned recently. The migrant crisis is not confined to a few countries, has led to wars like the one between India and Pakistan 50 years ago, and requires corrective action at the transnational level. There are now an estimated 26 million refugees in the world and no country has a creditable record on this issue.

02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Errors of judgment||The Allahabad High Court recently held that oral sex with a minor (aged about 10 in this case) is not a case of ‘aggravated penetrative sexual assault’ under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. This is shocking as Section 5(m) of the Act clearly lays down that “whoever commits penetrative sexual assault on a child below twelve years” is said to commit “aggravated penetrative sexual assault”. Section 6 prescribes punishment with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 10 years but may extend to imprisonment for life. Though para 16 of the judgment replicated Sections 3 to 10 of the Act, all verbatim, including Section 5(m), Justice Anil Kumar Ojha, in para 17, concluded that “putting penis into mouth does not fall in the category of aggravated (penetrative) sexual assault or sexual assault”. There seems to be a palpable error of law which must be set right quickly. Protecting children The POCSO was enacted specially to protect children (of any sex) from offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography, realising the fact that a large number of such offences were neither specifically provided for nor adequately penalised. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act reinforces the legislative intent, which was made clear by providing neutral definitions and enhanced punishments for various offences of sexual nature. Though Section 42 on ‘alternate punishment’ was specifically introduced in POCSO to award greater punishment, in case of difference when compared to any other law in force, the Indian Penal Code was also amended to remove anomalies in the quantum of punishment for same or similar offences. Second, there is no ambiguity about the language used in Section 5 of the Act. Recently, the Supreme Court, while dismissing the requirement of skin-to-skin physical contact in cases of sexual assault, held that where the language of a statute was clear, the intention of the legislature was to be gathered from the language used. In the absence of any ambiguity of language used in Section 5 about the definition of ‘aggravated penetrative sexual assault’, there was no reason for the Court to deviate from the law and award lesser punishment. The ‘rule of lenity’, though not discussed in the judgment, had no application in the case. Third, it was not a case where the Court had any discretion to award lesser punishment than the minimum 10 years as prescribed in Section 6 of POCSO. Earlier, the Courts had discretion under Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the IPC to award lesser punishment than the minimum prescribed by recording ‘adequate and specific reasons’. The Supreme Court, in State of Rajasthan v. Vinod Kumar (2012), set aside the High Court order which reduced sentences less than the minimum without recording ‘adequate and special reasons’. However,  this discretion was taken away by amending Section 376 of the IPC in February 2013.  Since the POCSO Act does not provide any discretion in awarding punishment of imprisonment, the High Court was mandated to adhere to the statutory provisions. Decision to be scrutinised Four, the High Court did not deliberate on the reasons for not considering the offence as being of aggravated nature. The age of the victim was recorded as about 10 years and did not fall even under the category of marginal difference from 12 years. The Supreme Court has held that recording of reasons by a judge is not a mere task of formality, but an exercise of judicial accountability and transparency. This makes the decision available for further scrutiny at the touchstone of reason and justice. Five, it was not even a case where the provision of minimum punishment of 10 years imprisonment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault was under challenge for being disproportionate (to the objective of protecting children aged less than 12 years) as compared to the gravity of the offence under Article 14 of the Constitution. When no such test of reasonableness was under scrutiny, the Court fell into error by not considering the offence under the applicable relevant sections. Despite quoting the relevant sections of ‘aggravated penetrative sexual assault’, the High Court overlooked Section 5(m) of POCSO and convicted the accused for ‘penetrative sexual assault’ with lesser punishment. Since monitoring of implementation of the Act is the responsibility of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, the State Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, and the State government, this decision, which appears to be per incuriam, must be challenged so that the accused is not allowed to escape from the clutches of the appropriate sections of the POCSO Act.

02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||A blow to Kerala’s exceptionalism||The COVID-19 death reconciliation exercise in Kerala, taking place since October 22, has been a revelation of sorts. The exercise has added 10,678 more deaths to the State’s official list of COVID-19 fatalities, accounting for 26.7% of the total 39,955 COVID-19 deaths declared so far in the State (as of November 29). This makes Kerala the State with the second-highest COVID-19 toll in India. These are mind-boggling figures, given that the State Death Authorisation Committee has till date received over 26,000 appeals for inclusion of names in the fatality list, of which less than 7,000 have been included after scrutiny. The entire exercise has punched holes in the State’s pandemic narrative of having one of the best containment strategies, as evidenced by a steady and low case fatality rate. Such tales of exceptionalism are always looked at with scepticism by epidemiologists and public health experts. And while the State will be appreciated for undertaking the death reconciliation exercise seriously, the loss of credibility is something that it will find hard to live down. The question being asked is whether the State administration ever saw the true picture of the impact of the pandemic. This is because even when many vigilant public health experts and clinicians pointed out discrepancies in the reporting of deaths, the wide disparities in the case fatality rate between districts, and the need to pay attention to the fact that many patients were dying at home, the State continued to be in denial. Some public health experts point out that for a State which prided itself on the robustness of its health system, its infrastructure, and the efficiency and expertise of its human resources, this attempt to project itself as an exceptional story for short-term political gains was immoral. In perpetuating this myth, the State got sidetracked from the only goal that it should have focused on, which was mortality reduction. There were many things that the State did right during the pandemic – it increased the testing and surveillance facilities, invested in improving hospital infrastructure and ensured that there was no shortfall in oxygen supply. At the peak of the second wave, the State managed to keep transmission levels low so that hospitals were not overwhelmed. But the huge data gaps because of improper death reporting and the government’s refusal to accept that people who were dying in homes or were brought dead to hospitals after apparent ‘recovery’ from COVID-19 were all COVID-19 deaths not just hid the true impact of the pandemic from the public, but also robbed the State of an opportunity to re-examine how COVID-19 care pathways could be improved. As an epidemiologist pointed out, the State has all sorts of data at its disposal. But beyond secondary data analysis, which is excellent, little has been done on the field to rectify the problems identified. The State had identified that over 30% of COVID-19 patients in home isolation were dying at home or in transit due to cumulative delays in hospital admission. Was this knowledge put to good use to reduce mortality? Despite the high vaccination coverage and declining levels of hospitalisation and ICU occupancy, why does the State continue to record an average of 20-30 COVID-19 deaths daily? Are there issues in the quality of care that are not being addressed? Are some of these avoidable deaths? A senior clinician says, “The mortality of severe COVID-19 cases, which are managed by invasive mechanical ventilation in our public hospitals, is nearly 100%, which is unacceptable.” There are only two nurses per shift in ICUs for 20-25 patients, he says, adding that if “more attention was paid to training and developing dedicated critical care teams for ICUs, more lives could have been saved.” maya.c@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-blow-to-keralas-exceptionalism/article37799234.ece
02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Point of disorder||The suspension of 12 Opposition Members of Parliament from the Rajya Sabha for the entire winter session of Parliament, evidently an extreme step by Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu, has turned the spotlight on the use of disruption of proceedings as a parliamentary tactic. The Government and the Opposition should try and work a way out of this situation, but that may not resolve the underlying affliction of perennial conflict between the two sides. A guiding principle of parliamentary proceedings is that the majority, i.e. the Government, will have its way, and the minority, the Opposition, will have its say. This principle has been observed in its violation in India for several years now. As the principal Opposition in the years leading up to 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) so disrupted Parliament that a majority government was rendered dysfunctional for years; since 2014, in power, the BJP has tinkered with parliamentary processes in a way that the Opposition has been pinned down. Bills are passed in a hurry and even amidst din; the scrutiny of Bills by committees and debates are few and far between. Also, the decision to suspend Members for their conduct in the previous monsoon session at the beginning of a new session seems excessively punitive. This is no defence of disruption in general or the behaviour of the particular MPs, but the punishment is only worsening the conflict, and not facilitating debate. Parliament is the platform where the executive is held accountable to the representatives of the people. That is where people’s representatives raise matters of public concern and seek the Government’s attention. The trend of weakening that process in the name of efficiency is not merely undermining the spirit of democracy; it is also landing the Government itself in a difficult spot as the mayhem that followed the hurried passage of three controversial farm laws last year shows. Parliamentary debates should not be viewed as a distraction or waste of time; they are a barometer of public mood and must be respected as such, by both the ruling side and the Opposition. Disruption as a brief, momentary reaction to a situation that demands debate is understandable, but as a sustained strategy, it is self-defeating. The absence of the Opposition will only leave the Government even more unchecked. It was the BJP’s Arun Jaitley who theorised on the legitimacy of disruptions as a parliamentary instrument. It is time to shun that idea. The Government must make amends to restore the function of Parliament by deferring to parliamentary mechanisms, and also through informal channels of communication with the Opposition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/point-of-disorder/article37799005.ece
02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Road to recovery||The latest GDP and GVA estimates from the National Statistical Office have affirmed that the economy is now on the path to recovery after last fiscal’s record contraction. Second quarter gross domestic product expanded 8.4%, rebounding from the year-earlier period’s 7.4% contraction. While the statistical advantage from the base effect surely aided the expansion, the economy appears to have gathered just enough momentum for GDP to post a marginal 0.3% growth even when compared with the second quarter of the pre-pandemic 2019-20 fiscal year. The gross value added figures, which capture the extent of activity across the eight major formal sectors of the real economy, too underscore the improvement, with the July-September 2021 GVA figure of Rs. 32.89-lakh crore registering a 0.5% expansion from the July-September period of 2019. Five of the eight sectors posted growth not just from the year-earlier quarter but also surpassed the pre-COVID-19 performance. Manufacturing, which has the second-largest share of GVA, appears to have regained traction and was the bulwark of GVA, logging a 3.9% expansion from the pre-pandemic second quarter of fiscal 2020. The key employment-providing services categories, however, are yet to fully recover from the pandemic’s devastating impact, and along with construction, another major provider of jobs, lagged pre-pandemic levels by a cumulative Rs. 77,000 crore. With the potential impact of the Omicron variant a big unknown, the outlook here may stay hazy for now. A disaggregated view of the GDP data also reveals areas of concern that could undermine the recovery. Private final consumption expenditure that measures spending on everything from essentials to luxury goods and the entire gamut of services by all consumers, and has the largest share of GDP at 55%, is still treading water. The uncertainty induced by the pandemic, coupled with reduced or lost incomes, continues to depress demand and is mirrored in consumer spending still remaining 3.5% shy of the pre-COVID level. Government consumption spending, which has often been a reliable alternative source of demand with a capacity to serve as a multiplier, is also well below the fiscal 2020 second quarter, possibly by design as the Centre seeks to consolidate its fiscal position. Unless aggregate demand strengthens, the heartening uptick in business investment, as reflected in the 11% year-on-year jump in gross fixed capital formation, could come to naught with capacity additions remaining underutilised and corporate captains yet again tightening their purse strings. Manufacturing PMI data by IHS Markit has another salutary warning: rising input costs could force manufacturers to raise prices adding to the general inflationary pressures in the economy and undermine the recovery. Policy makers need to ramp up demand-supportive measures including increasing government spending to ensure that the recovery sustains and gains traction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/road-to-recovery/article37799006.ece
02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Anti-social activities in Rajasthan||It is not dacoity, robbery, murder or theft which is giving the Rajasthan police a trying time. It is the student and the worker who are turning police officials’ hair permanently grey. In 1966 and 1967, there were only nine and four students’ agitations respectively. These figures jumped to 69 in 1968, 119 in 1969 and 97 in 1970. Similarly, labour agitations, which were limited to below 25 before 1968, jumped to the century mark in 1969 and 1970. Not far behind these two categories of troublemakers are the politicians, whose agitations were below a dozen in 1966 but have now, in the last two years, reached the half-century level. The problem with handling this type of law-breaker is that the police are practically hamstrung because of political implications and have to tread extremely warily. Too often has police action in such cases resulted in judicial enquiries which have embarrassed the police to no small extent. Consequently, in dealing with students, workers or politicians on the rampage, the police tend to be overcautious, which is not at all conducive to the maintenance of law and order. A case in point is the gherao of the Vice-Chancellor of Jodhpur University by students some time ago. The police refused to break the gherao on the plea that such action would aggravate the situation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/anti-social-activities-in-rajasthan/article37799014.ece
02 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Manufacturing PMI signals Nov. output growth at 9-month high||India’s manufacturing sector recorded the strongest production expansion in nine months in November, with the survey-based IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) climbing to 57.6, from October’s 55.9. The November PMI signals the strongest improvement in the health of the manufacturing sector for 10 months, with factory orders rising for a fifth straight month and at the fastest pace since February. The long-run PMI average for India is 53.6 There was a fractional improvement in hiring by goods producers, which marked only the second expansion in jobs over the past 20 months. The survey also suggested that the domestic market drove sales growth as ‘new export orders rose at a slight pace that was weaker than in October’. “The overall level of positive sentiment slipped to a 17-month low,” IHS Markit said. Cost inflation pressures for producers remained ‘intense’, broadly at the same rate as October which had marked a 92-month high. “The key threat to the outlook, in addition to potential new waves of COVID-19, is inflationary pressures,” said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. “For now, companies are absorbing most of the additional cost burdens and lifting output charges only moderately. Should raw material scarcity and shipping issues continue to feed through to purchasing prices, substantial increases in output charges could be seen and demand resilience would be tested,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/manufacturing-pmi-signals-nov-output-growth-at-9-month-high/article37799402.ece
02 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Exports dip widening trade deficit to a record $23.27 bn||India’s merchandise exports slipped below the $30-billion mark for the first time in eight months in November to $29.88 billion, even as imports rose sharply, taking the monthly trade deficit to a fresh high. Imports outpaced exports, jumping 38% from pre-COVID levels compared with the 16% increase in exports, though they moderated slightly month-on-month to $53.1 billion from $55.4 billion in October. The trade deficit widened to a fresh record of $23.27 billion, from $19.9 billion in the previous month. This is almost 83% higher than the November 2019 levels. The previous highest monthly trade deficit of $22.6 billion was recorded in September.   ‘Worrying deficit’ The trade deficit from April to November 2021 is now close to $122 billion, 7.5% over the same period in FY20. The sharp 16% sequential slide in exports led to a flare-up in the trade deficit to a record-high, and the three months since September have now recorded a deficit of $65 billion, which is worrying, said ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar. Imports, she pointed out, had exceeded $50 billion in each of these months. “Holidays in the festive season have substantially dented the momentum in merchandise exports in November, bringing them down to the lowest level of FY22. We are cautiously optimistic that export momentum will revive, although the uncertainty engendered by the Omicron variant poses a concern regarding the immediate outlook,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/exports-dip-widening-trade-deficit-to-a-record-2327-bn/article37799396.ece

However, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors along with Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) posted increases in their respective domestic passenger vehicle wholesales last month. Maruti said total domestic sales declined 18% to 1,17,791 units from a year earlier. “The shortage of electronic components had a minor impact on the production of vehicles during the month,” the carmaker said in a statement. “The shortage primarily affected the production of vehicles sold in the domestic market. The company took all possible measures to minimise the impact.” Similarly, Hyundai Motor India said domestic sales slid 24% to 37,001 units. On the other hand, M&M said domestic passenger vehicle (PV) sales rose 7% to 19,458 units. “Our growth in SUVs continues with an 8% increase in November,” M&M’s CEO - Automotive Division, Veejay Nakra said. “The demand remains strong across our product portfolio of SUVs, pickups, and small commercial vehicles,” he added. Tata Motors said domestic PV sales climbed 38% to 29,778 units. Toyota Kirloskar Motor reported domestic wholesales rose 53% to 13,003 units in November compared with a year earlier.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/maruti-hyundai-wholesales-decline-as-chip-shortage-bites/article37799406.ece

The global economy is now expected to expand by 5.6% this year, down from an earlier forecast of 5.7%, the OECD said in its updated economic outlook which warns that low vaccination areas could create “breeding grounds” for deadlier virus mutations. Its forecast for 2022 remains unchanged at 4.5%, but the report was released only days after Omicron was detected. “We are concerned that the new variant of the virus is further adding to the already high levels of uncertainty and risks, and that could be a threat to the recovery,” OECD chief economist Laurence Boone said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/oecd-cuts-world-growth-outlook-on-omicron-fears/article37799394.ece

India’s exports to China during the April-September 2021 period were $12.26 billion, while imports aggregated to $42.33 billion, according to data given by Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Anupriya Patel in a written reply to the Lok Sabha. She said the imports from China had increased from $60.41 billion in 2014-15 to $65.21 billion in 2020-21, exhibiting an increase of 7.94% over six years. However, the imports were static between 2019-20 and 2020-21, she said. “The government has made sustained efforts to achieve a more balanced trade with China, including bilateral engagements to address the non-tariff barriers on Indian exports to China,” Ms. Patel said. Schemes like the production-linked incentive scheme will help promote domestic manufacturing capacities and attract investments and reduce dependency on imports from China, the Minister said.

02 December 2021||MUMBAI,||Mhambrey happy with Indian bowlers’ effort||New Zealand justified its status of World Test champion by achieving what very few travelling teams have — to bat out the last day of a Test in India. Still, Paras Mhambrey, India’s newly appointed bowling coach, was extremely happy with his bowlers’ effort in the series-opener at Kanpur. “I think we are happy, honestly. If you look at the outcome of the game — yes, we wanted to win the Test match, we were so close. But looking at the wicket, it was not that kind of a surface,” Mhambrey said on Wednesday, two days ahead of the series-decider scheduled to begin at the Wankhede Stadium. “We knew in the (last day) morning that this is not the kind of surface where you turn up and run through a side. We knew it was going to be hard work. Especially there was no bounce, the ball was keeping low. “Unfortunately, a couple of edges didn’t carry. Had that happened, it would have been a different result. “A lot of positive we can take, especially in the effort that we put in. Honestly, I feel we made a game out of it. Picking up 19 wickets on that surface wasn’t easy. But we really took it to the end.” Agonisingly short India fell agonisingly short of picking the last wicket as the first of the two Tests was drawn. While Mhambrey was in a way glad to not be a part of the ‘who will Virat Kohli replace at Wankhede?’ decision-making process, he conceded that Wriddhiman Saha remains uncertain due to his neck sprain. “The physios are in touch constantly with the head coach Rahul (Dravid) and obviously Virat (Kohli) now and as we get closer to the game, we will take a call and see what condition he is in,” Mhambrey said. With Saha having hurt his neck midway through the match, K.S. Bharat, the back-up wicketkeeper, donned gloves on day three and five. “But obviously with whatever he (Saha) has been through, I think (it was a) fabulous effort to bat the way he did. “It was painful, we realise that but he put his hand up and (said) the team wanted it and he delivered it for the team, really happy to see that.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/mhambrey-happy-with-indian-bowlers-effort/article37799340.ece

The host should have easily netted five more goals for it created plenty of chances, with midfielder Arjun Jayaraj doing much of the good work, but messed them all with poor finishing. Lakshadweep is one of the two weaklings in Group-B and nothing went right for the team today. It conceded a penalty soon after the start, was down to 10-men midway through the first half with defender K.K.N. Ubaidulla sent off for bringing down a goal-bound Muhammed Safnad and a little later conceded an own goal. And near the hour mark, its main goalkeeper Shameer Shaik had to be replaced after suffering an injury. Kerala, the favourite to top the group, failed to capitalise on these setbacks and there was a blank 45-minute phase between the third and fourth goals which should be a cause for worry.

02 December 2021||Nassau,||Morikawa favourite in a strong field||The Hero World Challenge, which was cancelled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, makes its return to Albany Golf Club here on Thursday. The $3.5 million prize money golf tournament features a strong field, which includes 14 of the top 20 in the official World Golf Ranking (WGR) list. Tournament host Tiger Woods, who discussed his February car crash at a pre-event press conference here on Tuesday, will not compete in the tournament. American Collin Morikawa, who won the Open Championship (his second major win) earlier this year, starts as a favourite. A title win here could see Morikawa rise to the top spot in the WGR. Rory McIlroy will look to put the disappointment of a sixth-place finish in the recent DP World Tour Championship behind him. The Northern Ireland golfer was primed to finish on top at Dubai, sitting on a one-stroke lead with five holes left in the final round, but a bad break saw him slip down and lose the title to Morikawa. Morikawa makes his maiden appearance at Albany. Patrick Cantlay, who has won the ZOZO Championship, The Memorial, the BMW Championship and the Tour Championship this year, enters full of confidence. Multiple-time winner on the PGA Tour and U.S. Amateur champion, Viktor Hovland, is among the bright young talents in action. English golfer Justin Rose will be keen to arrest his dip in form. Rose, the 2013 US Open champion, is close to falling out of the top-50 in the WGR.

02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Mumbai City proves too hot for ATK MB||Holder Mumbai City FC continued its dominance over last year’s runner-up ATK Mohun Bagan as it downed the latter in a glut of goals in an ISL Season 8 fixture at Fatorda on Wednesday. Mumbai City won 5-1. The Islanders went on the attack right from the start, catching ATK MB by surprise. Vikram Pratap Singh and Bipin Singh’s energy and enthusiasm came to the fore as MCFC went 2-0 up by the 25th minute. Vikram netted the opener in the fourth minute with a rasping grounder that beat ATK MB goalkeeper Amrinder Singh. The ATK MB citadel fell again in the 25th minute as MCFC’s surprise package, Vikram, got an accurate cross from Bipin and doubled the lead. The 19-year-old forward, who graduated from AIFF development side Indian Arrows, was lucky as the officials failed to spot his ‘hand of god’ effort. Replays showed the ball hitting Vikram’s outstretched arm as he made a sliding effort to send the rebound home after his first shot had come off Amrinder. Igor Angulo scored the third in the 38th minute before ATK MB was reduced to 10 in the 46th minute when defender Dipak Tangri was shown the red card. Mourtada Fall nodded home Ahmed Jahouh’s free kick to make it 4-0 before Bipin netted the fifth in the 52nd minute. ATK MB’s David Williams, a substitute late in the second half, scored off a brilliant solo effort to reduce the margin.  The result: ATK Mohun Bagan 1 (Williams 60) lost to Mumbai City FC 5 (Vikram 4 & 25, Angulo 38, Fall 47, Bipin 52).

02 December 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||Tiwari’s strike puts India in the semifinals||India followed the ‘team first’ mantra in letter and spirit to beat a formidable Belgium 1-0 and enter the semifinals of the men’s hockey Junior World Cup at the Kalinga Stadium here on Wednesday. The Indian defence, which had let the team down against France, held tight to play a significant role in the quarterfinal victory. The midfield, led by ‘Player-of-the-match’ Vishnukant Singh, and forward line complemented well to complete a fine performance. India withstood the pressure well in the opening quarter. The home backline, led by Sanjay and Yashdeep Siwach, stayed focused and maintained its structure to deny Belgium an early advantage. Good tackling and timely interception were the other highlights of the host’s solid defending. India’s perseverance in launching counterattacks paid off when it got a penalty-corner in the 20th minute. A beautiful variation, with Sanjay turning the ball to Sharda Nand Tiwari and the latter flicking high into the right corner, resulted in the all-important goal. The atmosphere turned electric, thanks to the few thousand select spectators, and it made a real difference. The home boys grew in confidence to defend heavily. They went into the halftime with a psychological advantage. The home side survived the second and third penalty corner attempts in the final period.

02 December 2021||DOHA,||Al Bayt Stadium opens its doors||With less than a year to go for the 2022 edition of the FIFA World Cup, Qatar on Tuesday threw open the doors of the Al Bayt Stadium on the occasion of the Arab Cup opener between the host nation and Bahrain. The stadium, which will host the opening game of Qatar 2022, pays homage to Middle Eastern hospitality, and has been modelled on the bayt al sha’ar — traditional nomadic tents in the Gulf region. The venue’s lightweight canopies aid its artificial cooling technology to ward off the desert heat. While His Highness the Emir of the State of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, declared the tournament open, FIFA president Gianni Infantino watched the light and sound show during a grand opening ceremony. “Let’s celebrate football and unite the world together,” said Infantino. Located in the northern city of Al Khor, 46km north of Doha, the Al Bayt Stadium has 60,000 seats. It will be the second busiest venue during the showpiece next year, hosting nine matches up to the semifinals. Lusail Stadium, the venue of the final and the only arena yet to be unveiled, will be inaugurated in January.

02 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Bhardwaj, a late starter, makes it big||Ajeet Bhardwaj started competing in the international tennis circuit when he was 55, and is thrilled to own the record for the maximum number of wins by an Indian tennis player in the senior circuit. At 63, he is athletic and light on his feet. He is an optometrist by profession for more than 40 years, a renowned guide on eye care, but there is no better definition of an optimist. Journey begins at 40 “I learnt tennis at the age of 40 at the Vasant Vihar Club to control excessive weight. I started playing international events in 2013. Others had started by 2008. So, I am proud to have 114 wins despite having such a late start,” said Bhardwaj, as he talked about his sports and life journey. After his graduation from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhardwaj worked in Nigeria for eight years. In Lagos, when he was travelling to board a flight for home, his car was waylaid and looted. Two of his friends, an engineer and an architect, died in the firing and he survived with a bullet shattering his right lung and getting stuck in the rib cage. He did well as an optometrist, after a simple start in a basement. He flourished with many branches around the country. One of his patients commented about his enormous gain of weight which drove him to find a sport. He plays tennis for four hours and does physical fitness and yoga for two hours, every day. He has five branches of eye care centre, managed by his son Rahul. He is proud to have won 11 ITF singles titles, the second best behind Nagaraj Revanasiddaiah (17), in the country. Over 300 trophies “I have more than 300 trophies. Two rooms at home are dedicated for the trophies,” he reveals. One of the leading optometrists in the country, he gives lectures in various universities, and has written a book on telemedicine. He was ranked a career-best 99 in 2014. He is eagerly looking forward to getting into the over-65 circuit and become a top-50 player in the world.  I learnt tennis at the age of 40 at the Vasant Vihar Club to control excessive weight.

02 December 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||The Siwachs’ show at the Junior WC||For former India captain and Dronacharya award winner Pritam Rani Siwach and her husband and former player Kuldeep Siwach, watching their son Yashdeep in India colours at the Junior World Cup at home has been a privilege but witnessing the Indian hockey team in action is a bigger attraction. Grooming players Pritam and Kuldeep have groomed several players, including three who were part of the Indian women’s squad which finished fourth at the Tokyo Olympics. The two treat Yashdeep and his sister Kanika, who also plays as a midfielder at the sub-junior level, just like the others who are products of the Pritam Rani Hockey Academy at Sonepat. “All of them are our kids and we don’t differentiate between them. Of course, as a parent, it’s a special joy to see your son playing for the country in a big event at home,” Pritam told The Hindu on Wednesday, watching the action at the Kalinga Stadium along with Kuldeep. “As parents, we shower our love and affection on them. But as coaches we treat all the kids equally. It’s about the larger picture of going on to play for the country and making it proud,” said Kuldeep. The team-first approach is ingrained in Yashdeep as well. “I speak to my parents regularly, but we don’t discuss games from an individual’s point of view. They always speak about how the team played and what we could have done,” said Yashdeep. Pritam revealed that she never hesitated to be strict with her son when required. “Not only do I rebuke Yashdeep when there is a lapse, but I also hit him. We later make up when he says ‘Mummy, you hit me very hard,’” said Pritam. During the matches of the academy, Yashdeep is on Pritam’s team while his sister plays with Kuldeep. Did they ask Yashdeep, a defender, not to be nervous while playing in front of them? “That was not needed as he has done it many times with Kuldeep as coach,” said Pritam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-siwachs-show-at-the-junior-wc/article37799507.ece

In fact, the rain may hamper the return of Test cricket to Wankhede Stadium after five years. With weather unlikely to let teams train at the match venue, both the teams have rescheduled their Thursday’s training sessions at Mumbai Cricket Association’s indoor academy at Bandra-Kurla Complex. The weather forecast is for steady rain for Thursday and Friday and intermittent showers over the weekend.

02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Nepo lets Carlsen off the hook||Ian Nepomniachtichi had every reason to be disappointed after missing a chance to make Magnus Carlsen suffer more than he did in the drawn fifth game of the World chess championship in Dubai on Wednesday. Nepo kept Carlsen on the defensive for 43 moves in their Ruy Lopez game but failed to drive home the advantage after missing the precise continuation on his 20th move. In fact, after Nepo’s position appeared clearly better following the opening phase, Carlsen took almost 20 minutes for his 19th move. Nepo, who analysed the position for over 10 minutes, must have overlooked the potential gain of pushing the lone pawn queenside pawn. Instead, he moved his rook that let Carlsen off the hook. “I was concerned (about the possible pawn-push) because I did consider that move as the main option (for Nepo). But once I saw the rook move, I knew the worse was over. After that, my position was not going to get worse,” said Carlsen. Keeping up the pressure Thereafter, Nepo did keep up the pressure but could not prevent Carlsen from building a fortress around the black king. Once Carlsen managed to trade his passive bishop with Nepo’s active knight, he forced a draw following perpetual checks. A visibly-disappointed Nepo acknowledged that Carlsen defended well.  With the score tied at 2.5-2.5, action resumes on Friday after a day’s rest.  The moves:   Game 5: White - Nepomniactchi; Black - Carlsen: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6.

02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Pleasing, truthful words||Citizens of Ayodhya were delighted at Dasaratha’s decision to celebrate Rama’s coronation soon. The people expressed their approval of the decision by elaborating on Rama’s many auspicious qualities, said Navalpakkam Vasudevachariar in a discourse. Lauding the way Rama addressed people, they said that Rama was a smita bhaashi — He always spoke with a smile on His face. He was a poorva bhashi — He never waited for someone to come and talk to Him. He took the initiative and went out of His way to speak to others. Rama was not interested in unnecessary arguments. And yet, if someone said something unjust, He would be the first to protest. But He would not do this in a harsh manner. His gentility in speech would never be abandoned, even while He pointed out to them the error in their statements. He never made compromises when it came to telling the truth. In His speech He was like Brihaspathi. And those who had had a contrary opinion would go away convinced of the validity of what Rama was saying. Rama spoke the truth, and also spoke without hurting anyone. His speech was gentle. He was well versed in the art of governance, and was quite capable of ruling all the three worlds. His anger was never unjust. He punished only those who deserved to be punished. Everyone would be pleased to have Rama as their king, for He had an abundance of desirable traits. Everyone, young and old, prayed for Rama’s welfare. Dasaratha’s subjects said that Rama deserved to be king. Rama’s eyes were like lotuses, and this showed that He was the Paramatma. In the Bala Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the bard says that when Parasurama was about to fight Rama, he saw the latter’s lotus-like eyes, and realised that he was face to face with Lord Vishnu Himself.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/pleasing-truthful-words/article37799287.ece

02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||It’s showtime||In a labyrinth of narrowing streets in T Nagar populated with small vendors, budget-friendly stores and textile businesses, lay a small but self-sufficient pocket of land where cinema once thrived. For anyone driving past T Nagar or taking a bus at the depot, it was tough to overlook the tall, welcoming film posters on the sideways. Located in the heart of the city, Krishnaveni Theatre was not just another old theatre in the ever-changing landscape, but the last surviving remnant of a bygone era. It is where some of our biggest superstars’ films — MGR’s Aayirathil Oruvan (1965), Rajinikanth’s Adutha Varisu (1983), Amitabh Bachchan’s Deewar (1975), Kamal’s Avvai Shanmugi (1996), Ajith’s Amarkalam (1999) and Vikram’s Sethu (1999) — have had an enviable run at the box office. Yet, as they say in film lingo, the first half was good and the second half... not-so-much. Poor maintenance and a lacklustre effort to rebuild and recoup contributed to the theatre going to ruins in what was a cut-throat business. It resulted in a wakeup call and three years of renovation, which began in 2018. Rebooted as Krishnaveni Cinemas, it was reopened for business on Deepavali with Rajinikanth’s Annaatthe . The transformation of Krishnaveni Theatre to Krishnaveni Cinemas at a time when single-screen theatres across the country are closing operations is, of course, inspiring. Says its current owner RM Somasundaram, “We have had this property for more than 50 years without proper maintenance. When we started the renovation process, we did not want to compromise on anything... we wanted to revive the business.” Krishnaveni Cinemas now boasts a new facade. The auditorium has an upgraded projector and sound system, with a capacity of 490-seats. We catch projectionist KM Kannan (who has worked with Krishnaveni for 32 years) at work during the interval of Sabhaapathy . Had we caught him a few decades ago, he would not have found time to chat; from setting up spools to changing film reels before and after the interval, his under-appreciated work was art itself. Thanks to today’s laser projection, all he needs to do is tap a button. “In those days, we studied for a year to get a licence to operate a film projector. Can you imagine all this was done by one person, the projectionist?” A colourful history For a theatre to have survived the various socio-politico-cultural changes in T Nagar over 75 years, Krishnaveni and people like Kannan are embers of the past. However, little is known and documented about its origin. According to its current owner, the theatre was constructed in 1946 and was run by Andhra Pradesh-based Krishnaveni. In 1968, SM Ramanathan Chettiar purchased the property from Kamala Theatre owner VN Chidambaram Chettiar. Since then, it has been manned by Ramanathan and his sister’s family. Coming from a family of yarn merchants, Ramanathan Chettiar was not a ‘movie’ person: he saw the theatre as an additional channel to monetise. Even at the height of business, profits were few, says Somasundaram. “Because my father didn’t come from a film background, he couldn’t adapt to the changes of the times. Plus, we didn’t put too much effort in providing theatrical experience then,” he says, adding, “Now is the time to see profits, now that we have renovated it.” With an ageing building and fading paint, Krishnaveni Theatre was drifting away from collective memory. It hit a low point when the theatre started screening adult films and B-grade cinema. There were other complications as people began misusing the property. “I thought we shouldn’t encourage such behaviour, it was our name that was spoiled,” Somasundaram says. “There was a lot of interest in buying this property too. But we wanted to keep the family business afloat.” After his father’s demise in 2013, Somasundaram, an Agriculture graduate who is in the synthetic yarn business, took over. The renovation is both an image turnover and an attempt to recover lost business; distributors were still wary until Somasundaram convinced them of the new look. While Annaatthe and Sabhaapathy may not have drawn eyeballs, film events such as the recent Maanaadu audio launch ensured visibility among the film circuit. Somasundaram acknowledges the long road ahead. “The first step is to bring back the old charm. Right now, the goal is to make our presence be felt.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/its-showtime/article37799204.ece
02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Behind bars, at home||House parties over restobars. Intimate gatherings over heaving dance floors, and an elevated home bar experience over over-priced cocktails at a restaurant. As life slowly crawls back to a new normal, parties at home are replacing gatherings at local bars. And as hosts cater to these new parameters, curated catering menus and home bar experiences have become the order of the day. Bartenders who were forced to go solo after food and beverage establishments were shut down due to pandemic restrictions, have found freelance bartending a liberating career detour. In Chennai, where bars recently opened their doors, after a protracted closure, bartenders have found new avenues to augment their incomes. Praveen Mohan, who worked at a bar in the IT corridor of the city, has taken on house parties since 2020, sometimes on the beach front, some at spacious apartments, where hosts wanted a restobar experience, but in a safer space. “In the beginning it was tough, but then our whole industry went through this churning, so we just soldiered on. I taught classes at a local bartending institute in T Nagar, did some flair bartending during the week and waited for the parties to pick up,” says Praveen. Back on their feet Post July 2021, parties at beach houses and other venues along East Coast Road and Puducherry have been keeping the city’s bartenders busy. Nalla Samy, from the Chennai Institute of Bartending, says his schedule has been packed since mid 2021. “Before the pandemic we took on at least 60 events per month and now that has shrunk to half that number. Events are smaller, with just 20 people and all safety precautions in place. Being a freelance bartender is slowly paying dividends again,” he says. On the West coast, Vasundhara Vats, who designs masterclass cocktail workshops for small parties, says the freelance life chose her even before 2020. “I lived in Mumbai for a bit, where I worked at Soho House, and then moved to Goa. When you're working six nights a week till 2am at a bar, it doesn't allow for any meaningful interactions with friends. You don't get to enjoy the sunlight, brunches and everything else that really appealed to me. I had the luxury of quitting a full-time bartending career so I would work on my own terms,” she says. While Goa is the perennial party destination in the country, “monsoon months bring little work,” adds Vats, who now caters to small parties at villas, where she curates D-I-Y cocktail experiences, in a State blessed with a bouquet of fresh, floral and fruity ingredients. Her drinks are served with fresh mixers — syrups with lavender and chamomile, rose lemonade and floral tonics. “I decide my menu based on what I can find at Mapusa market — usually some luscious mulberry, passion fruit, and plenty of cucumber, which I think is the most underrated addition to a drink,” says Vats Homegrown spirits Abhirup Bhattacharyya, seasoned bartender-turned-brand ambassador for Maka Zai, a homegrown rum brand based out of Goa, says drinking habits have changed since 2020. “A large number of people have started mixing at home. This was mainly because of the pandemic, but it is slowly becoming part of a lifestyle,” he says, adding that they now want a refined drinking experience, with sophisticated cocktails fashioned from homegrown spirits. The gin resurgence in India, riding high on brands like Hapusa, Greater Than and Jaisalmer, among others, is pushing bartenders to experiment with their menus. Pierson Fernandes, school director, European Bartender School, Goa describes their butterfly pea flower-infused gin, which on meeting citrus turns from blue to purple. “It’s a big hit with guests at house parties,” he says, adding that “Vodka has faded into the background, whisky sours are a hit, and the rums are used for mojitos.” Taking cocktails up a notch with homemade shrubs and syrups from scratch, and using substitutes like honey or jaggery instead of refined sugar, are par for the course for Sourav Singh who runs his bartending business in Kolkata, after stints across Delhi. As hosts look to offer their guests a customised experience at home, or a lavish suite at a hotel, the brief is simple — flair bartending meets a mindful approach to mixing drinks. Sourav prides himself over his zero waste operation. “These days we make a lot of Old Fashioned, using orange garnishes. As a result I have so much left over orange pulp, with which I make a drink — Houston we have a problem, where marmalade is mixed with Bourbon, citrus and topped with wheat beer.” From banquet halls, the party has now moved to penthouses. “I make sure the bartenders are dressed well for the occasion. We even tailor different sets of aprons and accessories to suit the ambience of a party,” says Sourav, adding that his staff comprises certified bartenders with over three years of experience at bars across big metros. Across Tier 1 cities, junior bartenders charge anywhere between Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 4,000 for a night. They bring their own garnishes, shrubs and syrups prepared from scratch, while glassware and other mixers are charged on actuals. Senior mixologists and flair bartenders command over Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 15,000 depending on the number of guests at a party and the kind of cocktails on the menu. The hosts always provide the alcohol. Sandeep Varma, founder and CEO, Institute of Bar Operations and Management, who has been in the business for over two decades in the Delhi-NCR region says the pandemic was a wake up call. “Suddenly, the big money events were few and far between. We had to take the virtual route and conduct cocktail workshops.” His bartending course has found willing takers across professions. “Some hotel management students do a bartending course and can take up a job as a full time bartender or start their own business with a certification. But we found people from other backgrounds eager to become bartenders, so they could moonlight at house parties after a 9-5 job,” Varma explains. In Chennai as well, professionals are looking at bartending classes to make money on the side, while learning a cool new skill. “My student bartenders — IT engineers — can make around Rs. 15,000 a month with a few events,” says Nalla Samy, explaining how quickly the market is expanding. He adds, “Also, it's a change of scene from their day jobs!”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/behind-bars-at-home/article37799215.ece
02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Smile, you’re on canvas||Hyderabad-based software developer Ravi Malik celebrates occasions by gifting his friends hand-painted portraits. “Portraits make one feel special, they evoke a sense of royalty,” he explains. At Sunil Kumar’s house in Pune, visitors are greeted by a 2x2 feet family portrait. An IT professional, Sunil calls it a ‘wall that exudes positivity during the pandemic’. “Looking at positive things during uncertain times fills us with hope,” he adds. Touch of royalty Portraits conjure up images of royals holding signature poses for many hours, to be painted by famous artists. Today, all you need is a photograph. While family portraits executed in oil on canvas may have been popular many decades ago, they were rapidly replaced by photographs and selfie sticks. But now, after more than a year of battling a pandemic, people seem eager to celebrate their friends and family in a endearingly old-fashioned way: as a result studios, galleries and artists are seeing a rise in commissioned portrait work. Over the last few months, Chennai-based Focus Art Gallery, which offers a customised portrait service, has been seeing a rise in enquiries, from single-digit a month to around 15 with requests for portraits of family, parents or elders who passed away. “Customers never commission their own pictures,” says founder Mayur Shah. Customers send Mayur photographs, along with preferences of the background colour to suit the home or office decor. “Working via photos works best for us, as our four portrait artists live in and outside Chennai,” he says. Solo portraits or that of couples, parents and pets in realistic and super realistic mode range from 18X24 inches to 48 X72 inches and cost anywhere from Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 2.5 lakh. Portraits with a touch of super-realism look like photographs. “Even the reflection in the eyes and hair strands look life like, whereas with realistic portraits one can make out it is a painting,” explains Mayur. Hyderabad’s renowned portrait artist Abdul Lateef Farooqui believes people prefer a portrait over just a framed photograph because “Art can capture the likeness of a soul”. He turned portrait artist when he was 17 and has more than 3,000 portraits — from life and photographs— to his credit. Now the 68-year-old is guest faculty at Jawaharlal Nehru Architecture and Fine Arts University in Hyderabad, where he teaches the nuances of portrait art. Farooqui began by painting from photographs, then picked up live portrait drawing skills. “Meeting the people you are creating portraits of is a delight,” he says, adding that eye contact conveys many emotions, which help him capture the subject’s real persona on canvas. When he draws from a photograph, he starts with a rough sketch, adding natural elements of light and shadow to enhance the image and filling colours. “I read that portrait art is not the mere likeness of the person but the likeness of the soul,” he adds. The animal world Aishwarya Ramachandran has been doing human and pet portraits for five years. The biomedical engineer has been training under well-known artist AV Ilango. “I chose to pursue art full time when I successfully battled cancer 10 years ago; art helped me during the tough times,” she says. As a pet lover, Aishwarya enjoys meticulously painting animals; her subjects are varied and have included a rooster named Karuppaiah. “It was the most graceful looking pet and close to the family” she recalls. When Karuppaiah died, his Sri Lanka-based family commissioned a portrait from her last year.  She says her greatest challenge is working with older photographs, which are often not clear. Her toughest assignment so far has been painting a woman’s portrait from a black and white passport photograph of the ’80s. “It was worn out, so it was quite a challenge to recreate it on canvas. The family was also particular about the jewellery and saree she wore,” she recollects. Aishwarya referred to another group photograph of the woman to understand her skin tone and create a realistic portrait. Bengaluru-based artist Varun N Rao, who creates portraits predominantly from photographs, seeks multiple pictures of the person from various angles for reference. He explains, “Some photographs of people who wear glasses have a glare that hides the eye. Some capture messy hair which is a challenge to paint. Referring to different photos of the same person helps add depth and texture.” Like Aishwarya, he does a ‘little guesswork’ while referring to black and white photographs. “When photographs are not clear, one has to guess the contour lines and paint,” he adds. Varun’s friend once commissioned a portrait of her father-in-law. His reference was a 15-year-old termite-eaten black and white framed photograph that had worn out due to humid Mumbai weather. “She approached me as none of the studios was willing to work on the photograph. She described his skin colour, contours and moles and also gave me her husband’s photograph to refer to... with a bit of guesswork I could finish it,” he recalls. Creating a 40X25 inches acrylic canvas of a father and a daughter is his most cherished memory. He recalls, “The girl’s father was no more and she asked me to create a portrait as if her dad was holding her hands. The girl was in tears when she saw the work.”  Creating opportunity  The three-year-old Hyderabad-based venture handpaintedstories.com, established by Karan Bhangay is a platform for artists to showcase their talent. “The craftsmanship was the same but artists in foreign countries earned more than the artists here. I knew many gifted artists and hoped to bridge the disparity by bringing them all on one platform,” says Karan. Meanwhile, Pune-based PortraitFlip, commissions handmade paintings based on photographs from across the globe. Conceptualised in Vellore Institute of Technology dormitory in 2018, it was inspired by a friend’s futile attempt to gift a handmade painting to his girlfriend in college, shares PortraitFlip CEO Sunny Kumar. “I felt it was an opportunity to tap the industry and market this art in India and abroad,” he says. Having begun with seven artists, the start-up now has 150 artists based in Delhi, Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Assam, Odisha, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan working with oil, colour pencil, watercolour, acrylic, pencil, and charcoal. The paintings are delivered in 12 days. It has recently started a painting movie service wherein clients sitting at home can watch a time-lapse video of the painting process and also share it with others. Says Sunny, “one feels as if one is seated in a gallery and watching the artist work.”  PortraitFlip has recently started a movie service wherein clients sitting at home can watch a time-lapse video of the painting process||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/smile-youre-on-canvas/article37799225.ece
02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||A modern take||The year 2021 is ending on a good note for music composer-turned-actor GV Prakash. While Bachelor hits screens this Friday, his Jail releases next week. For a musician who is an accidental actor — debuting in a film titled Darling in 2015 — Prakash has travelled quite a distance. He is more serious about the craft now, and is looking to learn. “After my debut film, I did a string of projects that focussed on comedy. Bala’s Naachiyar (2018)  broke that mould — in terms of body language, look and acting techniques. Sarvam Thala Mayam and Sivappu Manjal Pachai followed that, and I was lucky to get opportunities to work in good roles.”  Bachelor and Jail are worthy follow-ups to a string of serious subjects that he has been taking of late. “I think I’m getting better with every film, be it acting or music composition. That’s the aim with every project I take up.” With Bachelor , he is trying to provide a peek into a toxic relationship between a boy and a girl. The phrase ‘Lust has become more dominant than love’ shows up in the trailer of this film, directed by Sathish Selvakumar and produced by G Dillibabu. “This is not a jaali (happy) film. It is a serious subject and a study on a man-woman relationship and how it breaks down into a messy affair. It will be a modern take on toxic relationships,” says Prakash, whose co-star in the film is Divyabharathi. He plays a character called Darling in the film that also stars Munishkanth and Bhagavathi Perumal, and Prakash says that it was very different to who he is in real life. “I’m very thuru thuru (restless) by nature, but the character I play is very laidback and doesn’t bat an eyelid even if the world around him collapses. If you ask him a question, he takes around 30 seconds to answer. This presented a lot of opportunities as an actor; I learnt how to use my eyes, and how to make ‘stays’ while performing. Jail , on the other hand, has me as Karuna, who is a pickpocket and a cunning thief.” Looking back, Prakash considers Naachiyar his coming-of-age film and one of the biggest highlights in his career. “Till then, I did not believe I had it in me to physically change myself for a role. Director Bala, who I consider one of my gurus, believed that I could do it. Similarly, Baba Bhaskar (choreographer-director) made me dance when I thought I didn’t have it in me,” says Prakash, whose recent favourites include watching performances of Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen and checking out acting masterclasses from Natalie Portman. Though acting is on top of his mind now, music is not too far away either. GV Prakash’s recent outings as a composer includes biggies like Soorarai Potru and Thalaivi ; he has other exciting projects lined up. So, what’s his secret to cracking a hit tune? “The more simple a tune is, the further it will reach. This doesn’t mean usual; there is a thin line between usual and simple, and as composers, we need to reach that, and hope audiences like that.” Up next, he promises that he has a “stunning line-up of projects”. Apart from his two current releases, Prakash also has Selfie and Idimuzhakkam coming up. “To build this bank, I needed time to refine and evaluate myself, just like how I had to when I went through a low as a composer. After my debut musical outing Veyyil , I had a string of lows, before Aayirathil Oruvan picked things up. Subsequently, there was a lull before Aadukalam came along. It has been a graph, with ups and downs. But all that matters, at the end of the day, is your willingness to learn.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-modern-take/article37799169.ece
02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||A serving of food history||It is close to lunch when we reach Thanjavur. Just the right time to visit India’s first Food Museum, which promises to whet visitors’ appetites with the history of what we serve on our plates. The museum has been established by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) on the ground floor of its regional office, in collaboration with Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum, Bengaluru. Built at a cost of Rs. 1.1 crore, the 1,860 square feet museum uses technology like projection mapping, touch screens, proximity sensors, and radio frequency identification (RFID). The choice of location is significant, since Thanjavur is also the birthplace of the FCI, with its first office opening here on January 14, 1965. Our visit begins with a seven-minute video (available in English and Tamil) shown on a projector wall, to learn about how humans went from being hunter-gatherers to food producers. As the film reveals, the manipulation and cultivation of certain plants by human beings around 10,000 years ago, when the effects of the Ice Age receded and temperate climate ensued, led to the domestication of these strains, sowing the seeds of agriculture as we know it today. A display in the adjoining space shows the evolution of granaries across the world. With the help of a sliding electronic reader, one can look up granaries built by the Romans, the mud rhombus of Niger, and even the gender-specific earthen structures in Mali. Closer home, the display talks about the granaries found in the temple complex of Srirangam, in the Badami fort and the Indus Valley. A section on pests shows the perils posed by borer insects that can hollow out grains during storage. The study of crop origins done by Russian botanist and geneticist Nikolai Vavilov (1887-1943) in the 1920s is explained in some detail in a dedicated display area, followed by an interactive map that shows the major grains, fruits and vegetables grown in India. Young visitors will have fun placing model ‘sacks’ of pulses fitted with RFID chips on a reader to see their characteristics pop up on the big screen. This is followed by a section on healthy diet, and an interactive food chart of India, where visitors can click on a State and watch recipe videos of two signature dishes from there. You can also find a life-size replica of a Public Distribution System (PDS) ration shop. A quick walk to an adjoining annexe shows us the journey of the grain, from the field to the procurement centres, and includes a scaled down replica of a silo bin. The dioramas are beautifully detailed, right down to the number plates of trucks and the bulge in the sacks of grain. Having spent so much time looking at food-related displays, visitors may be a bit disappointed to note that there is no restaurant on the premises to provide a tasty trimming to the tour. But luckily, the multi-cuisine eateries of Thanjavur, the ‘rice bowl of India’, offer many tasty alternatives.  The Food Museum is located at Nirmala Nagar, Pudukottai Road, Thanjavur. Open Monday through Saturday, from 11am to 5pm. Call 0436-2276292.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-serving-of-food-history/article37799229.ece
02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||A senior citizen takes off||Thirty thousand feet above the ground, bored and hungry, if you are tucking into a cup of hot biryani or upma , you have Radha Daga to thank. This 79-year-old from Chennai started her ready-to-eat food business about a decade ago. Her brand, Triguni Eze Eats, is now available on IndiGo and Air Asia India flights, on Amazon and retail stores across the country, and in Singapore and Malaysia. “I don’t think like an entrepreneur. They look at generating revenues and profit and loss. I got into my business without thinking whether it will make money,” says Radha with a smile. While her current business came out of her love for cooking, she had got into her first business to help women. She set up her first business of textile import in 1987, in Chennai. “It was also started to create employment for women. It gave me pleasure to train people and to see that they were improving and living better, dressing better and eating better,” she says. By 2009, Radha was determined to get into the food business. On a holiday with her husband, in the US she stumbled upon a magazine that had an advertisement about ready-to-eat pasta. All one had to do was add hot water. The idea stuck with her. On her return to India, she thought: How about Cup-o-idli? She bought a dehydrating machine and found a chef who had worked with a flight kitchen. Together, they started working on idlis. But after months of trial and error, they realised some of the idlis were not hydrating properly with hot water. Radha gave up on the idlis and tried other combinations. The lemon rice and biryani were instant hits and set the company soaring, literally and figuratively. Ready-to-eat tamarind rice and upma followed. “The food is cooked the way normal food is prepared, and then it goes through a process [for dehydration and preservation] that I can’t disclose,” laughs Radha. Around that time, a representative of IndiGo airlines came across Triguni Eze Eats’ biryani in a cup and was excited to see it is ready to eat just by adding hot water — eight minutes is all it took. In 2012, IndiGo expressed interest in Radha’s product for their in-flight meals, but wanted her to work on the packaging to make it convenient for the crew. The airline is now her biggest client, buying 85% of her total production. Triguni Eze Eats produces their products as per orders, as they are particular about shelf life. “We have the capacity to pack 16,000 to 18,000 tubs a day. Before the first lockdown we were dispatching 13,000 tubs a day between the airline and the domestic market,” she says.  Upma , dal chawal , rajma chawal and biryani are the hot favourites. Upma and biryani are produced every day. Finding clients on land Last September, as lockdowns eased, she turned her focus on trains. Her new line has pongal sambar, moong dal khichdi and masala upma , priced at Rs. 85 for 230 grams (and 250 grams after rehydration). Meanwhile, other experiments are constantly on at the Triguni Foods factory in Thiruverkadu. “When I started this business at the age of 69, I did not want any debts,” says Radha. Things were going smooth till the demonetisation happened in 2016. It took time to recover. She had just managed to get back on the saddle, when the pandemic and lockdown hit last year. With air travel almost nil, and people staying at home and cooking themselves, her ready-to-eat meals were not on retail customers’ shopping lists. “For most people, the priority was ordering groceries, fruits and vegetables.” This added to the setback. “Pre-pandemic (2019-2020) our turnover was 16 crore. February and March 2020 were negative. 2020-2021 we closed at around 5 crore because both airline and markets picked up only after December 2020.” But since November 15, things are getting back on track. “I am dispatching one lakh tubs a week now. These go to IRCTC”, airlines, and are also in demand by travellers, and students,” says Radha. The reason she believes is the convenience and the fact that this is the closest thing to home food. Radha is now upbeat about the future, especially because she believes, “I have a good product.”  We have the capacity to pack 16,000 to 18,000 tubs a day.

02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Skylab’: Director Vishvak Khanderao on how a fictional story emerged from incidents in Karimnagar in 1979||Vishvak Khandero, the debut writer-director of the Telugu film Skylab , grew up in Telangana’s Karimnagar. As a child, he would come across people named Skylab Reddy or Skylab Raju and his curiosity was piqued. He learnt from his elders of the looming fear of NASA’s space station Skylab crashing in the region in mid-July 1979. Decades later, he wrote a fictional comedy-drama set in Bandalingampally village, with the Skylab events as the backdrop. The film Skylab , scheduled to release in theatres on December 4, is co-produced by Nithya Menen. The ensemble cast includes Satya Dev, Rahul Ramakrishna, Vishnu Oi, Tulasi and Subbaraya Sharma, and Nithya Menen. Vishvak, 30, completed writing Skylab in 2016 and collaborated with his peers from the LV Prasad Film & TV Academy, Chennai. “In film school, I used to write dramas and thrillers. For my first feature, I was looking for a personal story that will have a wide appeal. I remembered my elders talking about Skylab and began research.” Skylab is falling The space station, which was expected to crash in the ocean south of Cape Town, South Africa, changed course and its debris was strewn across western Australia in July 1979. However, in the weeks preceding the crash, residents of Karimnagar and Nizamabad lived in fear of the space station crashing in their vicinity. Some took refuge in homes of their kith and kin in other cities. A few sold their homes and land at throwaway prices and left the region. According to reports, a near lockdown situation prevailed: “A few people vowed to name their children after Skylab if they survived the crash. Reports state that insurance to the tune of 36 crore was sold during the time,” says Vishvak. He describes the film as a comedy that has been treated like a musical. He and cinematographer Aditya Javvadi arrived at a cooler colour palette, moving away from the traditional reddish browns associated with Telangana. “I chose my grandmother’s village Bandalingampally for the story since it has a funny ring to it. The main characters are eccentric and the story not only explores what happens when the news of Skylab’s crash breaks out, but also the human psyche,” he says. Pitch a dream Through producer Prithvi Pinnamaraju, Vishvak pitched the story to Nithya Menen. During an elaborate narration that included research notes and a typewriter-themed musical composition (music by Prashanth Vihari) for her character of a small-town journalist, the actor asked Vishvak if he had found a producer who would stand by his vision. She also chipped in as co-producer. Formal training in cinema helped Vishvak learn the craft as well as find his direction. “I would watch everything from mainstream masala films to Mani Ratnam films, as well as films made by Krzysztof Kieślowski and other masters. I needed to find out what kind of stories I wanted to tell. Film school helped me in that process.” The training also helped him shoot the film in sync sound. He and his team would plan even the smallest details before going to the sets. The film went on floors in March 2020 and after the first day of shoot, the lockdown was announced. Vishvak used the lockdown to further fine-tune the script and says the trust his actors had in him kept his morale up: “I never thought I would get such a fine set of actors for my first film. Now, I am eager to see how people respond to Skylab .”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/skylab-director-vishvak-khanderao-on-how-a-fictional-story-emerged-from-incidents-in-karimnagar-in-1979/article37799174.ece
02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Bollywood’s bad men booked||Prem naam hai mera, Prem Chopra   Mogambo khush hua  These lines by the bad men of Bollywood are etched in our memories along with Pushpa, I hate tears ; Mere paas maa hain ; Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahi, namumkin hai — all dialogues uttered by iconic antagonists. They may have suffered a raw deal on screen but Kolkata-born author Balaji Vittal gives Tollywood villains their due in the book Pure Evil - The Bad Men of Bollywood , published by Harper Collins, set to be released tomorrow. “The book is a rogues gallery of those despicable characters whom we couldn’t wait to see beaten to a pulp by the hero. But we cannot deny that a big part of the entertainment was because of these very villains. They sacrificed themselves for the cause of the film’s success,” says Balaji. In the process of collecting material for Pure Evil... , Balaji made a list of films to watch and signed up for OTT channels and purchased dozens of DVDs. “I read up close to 20 books on related topics in addition to archival features, news clippings and write-ups. My haunches ached from hours of hunting for old magazines at those roadside shops in Delhi’s Daryagunj.” Balaji adds that he sought out the actors, scriptwriters and filmmakers “who filled those villain characters with palpability – and travelled to Mumbai to interview them in person”. Determined his book would not be a mere reproduction of published journals, periodicals, or transcripts of interviews with the personalities he had met, Balaji decided to keep the core of Pure Evil... a logical categorisation of various genres of villainy and a cogent argument on the socio-political trigger behind their emergence. “The narrative is an output — and not a reproduction — of the research, topped up with my sensibility of the villains, based on decades of watching Hindi films. I then identified a few iconic villain characters that exemplified each genre.” Belying the myth that villains have been typecast in Hindi films, Balaji says they travelled with contemporary situations. “With India emerging as a market for smuggled gold in the 1960s, we saw villains like the black-marketers and food grain hoarders of the 1950s being replaced with smugglers in the films of the mid-1960s. Directors were quick to track changing scenarios and cast them on screen.” He adds, “No doubt there were a few stereotypes – like the horse-riding Chambal dacoits or the British villains with their heavily accented Hindi. In balance, a few bad men acted as watersheds in the industry — Shakaal the smuggler in Yaadon ki Baaraat , Rahul the obsessed young man in Darr and of course, Gabbar the dacoit in Sholay .”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/bollywoods-bad-men-booked/article37799178.ece
02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Humour and heart||Have you wondered at the role of superheroes in the post-pandemic world? According to Trinh Tran, one of the executive producers of Hawkeye , the fifth show from MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), they are dealing with it in different ways. “Speaking specifically for Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), the struggle is of losing his family and having them back, and the loss of his best friend, Natasha,” says Tran, over a video call from Los Angeles. “The events of Avengers: Endgame has put him in a headspace where he is trying to figure out survivor’s guilt. He is also wondering if he is going to lose his family again. That is his mind-set at the start of the series.” Tran stresses that the six-episode mini-series is different from the ones that have come before. “We were trying to figure out how we can set this particular story apart from all of the other ones that are in the works or have been released such as Wanda Vision, Loki, and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier .” The show, set a year after the events of Avengers Endgame , sees Clint trying to get home for the holidays. Family is the focus of the show, says Tran. “There is the emotional aspect of Clint having lost his family during the five-year blip.” Tran describes the show as a fun adventure between Clint and his protégé and super fan, Kate. “There is humour and heart. It is set in the holidays in New York where we see both characters bond during a mission.” The show explores Hawkeye’s Ronin avatar when he wreaked vengeance on those who survived the blip. “We wanted to explore what it meant for Clint to change from Ronin to Hawkeye.” The Hawkeye story started off as a movie, Tran says. “As we were researching, we realised there was so much rich material in the Matt Fraction and David Aja's Hawkeye comic run. We wondered how we were going to introduce a new character and have enough time to tell their stories. We figured that a six-hour series would explore the character’s backstory.” Hawkeye streams on Disney+ Hotstar in English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/humour-and-heart/article37799171.ece
02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Game, set and match||For young boys and girls in North Chennai, football is more than just a game. “It is a tool for empowerment,” says Sukumar Thangaraj, a PhD scholar at the Department of Journalism & Communication, University of Madras. This tool, says the 29-year-old, ought to be used well. “There are so many football clubs in the area,” he says, speaking from his experience of extensive field research. “Some streets in Vyasarpadi have two to three clubs, affiliated to different political parties,” says Sukumar, adding that he wants to bring them together, and equip them with better understanding of the heft the game carries in their lives. “Players need to know of not just the job opportunities the game can offer; they need to ask tough questions, criticise structures that hamper their opportunities; understand the politics of the game,” he adds. With this in mind, Sukumar formed the Blacktown football club in August this year. The club will promote the game in North Chennai by providing a platform for players to not just play, but think as well. “As our first step, we adopted R Yamini, a Vyasarpadi football player who is in Class X,” explains Sukumar. With help from the Official Chelsea Football fans club (Tirupur), he managed to buy her a football kit last month, and hopes to pool in funds for her school fees. Plans are also afoot to create awareness on the game at Government schools by involving coaches such as N Thangaraj who founded the Slum Children Sports Talent and Education Development Society (SCSTEDS) in 1997. “He makes an hour of free tuitions compulsory if children are to play at their artificial turf,” says Sukumar. “This way, children develop discipline. And if they are to play for the State or district, they have to go to school or college,” he explains, adding that he also hopes to incorporate European football structures that he follows. While SCSTEDS is doing a lot of work in terms of encouraging children to play, its Corporation-constructed turf does not even have a changing room, points out Sukumar. “There is so much that has to change,” he says, “Right from inculcating confidence in children from the region to compete with those from outside.” Another of their small successes is helping get the winners of the 23rd Senior Women’s National Football Championship (2017- 2018), the recognition they deserve. “Jenisha Rani, media manager of Super Machans, one of the official fans clubs of Chennaiyin FC, also a friend’s friend, tweeted about the win,” he says. Soon, after several retweets by fans such as him, it reached Tamil Nadu’s Youth Welfare and Sports Development Minister Siva V Meyyanathan and the Government sanctioned Rs. 1.38 lakh per player.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/game-set-and-match/article37799217.ece
02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Sunny side up||When she is not shooting or winning global acclaim for her enviable body of work over the last two decades, Shefali Shah loves cooking and feeding her family and social circle. She loves being a host and also likes designing spaces. So when she thought of starting a hospitality business, she saw it as a cumulative opportunity to monetise from what she had been doing for free and out of her own liking. It gave birth to a buffet called Jalsa, launched last month in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. “I look at life as a celebration and that doesn’t necessarily mean going to a restaurant. Even at home, something needs to make you happy on a daily basis. That is where Jalsa comes from,” says Shefali Shah, while on her way back to a hotel in Maharashtra, where she is currently shooting. Shefali’s Instagram is filled with photos of her doing up the 7,000-odd sqft place, painting the walls and cooking some of her favourite food. From the prints, fabrics to cutlery, everything was chosen with careful precision; how much of a passionate venture is Jalsa? “Passion is an understatement,” she says with a laugh, “It is something I got obsessed with over time. I could have gotten a designer but you also got to keep budgets in mind. The more time I spent there I knew what I wanted the place to look like.” Whenever Shefali hosted an event, she always turned to her sister Neha Bassi who has been in the hospitality business for two decades. It was a “no-brainer” for her to collaborate with the sister. “Neha and her husband, Deepak, have been prolific whether it comes to food, service or presentation. So, it was a given that I wanted her,” says Shefali, adding that they offer not just quality food but an experience you would take home. The slogan for Jalsa, says Shefali, is “come, chill and be”. The menu was curated with that in mind... to cover an entire spectrum of customers from nine to 99. Jalsa offers a hodgepodge of Indian and international cuisines with 50-60 varieties, starting from kamrat , kachakeri to pastas and pizzas. The signature food is the nani wali dal , which is what Shefali’s children call their grandmother’s masala -free dal . Ultimately, Jalsa is all about fun dining. It offers a range of activities for customers, like palm reading, applying henna, pottery and dancing to garba . “By the end of the evening, I saw someone in their 70s, letting their hair down and dancing to garba and also joined the teenagers for a flash mob,” she says, explaining why she wanted Jalsa to be more of an experience. All said and done, Shefali says she believes in paisa vasool . “The kind of food and experience we offer in that price range, people will be like ‘seriously?’.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/sunny-side-up/article37799220.ece

02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Smile, you’re on canvas||Hyderabad-based software developer Ravi Malik celebrates occasions by gifting his friends hand-painted portraits. “Portraits make one feel special, they evoke a sense of royalty,” he explains. At Sunil Kumar’s house in Pune, visitors are greeted by a 2x2 feet family portrait. An IT professional, Sunil calls it a ‘wall that exudes positivity during the pandemic’. “Looking at positive things during uncertain times fills us with hope,” he adds. Touch of royalty Portraits conjure up images of royals holding signature poses for many hours, to be painted by famous artists. Today, all you need is a photograph. While family portraits executed in oil on canvas may have been popular many decades ago, they were rapidly replaced by photographs and selfie sticks. But now, after more than a year of battling a pandemic, people seem eager to celebrate their friends and family in a endearingly old-fashioned way: as a result studios, galleries and artists are seeing a rise in commissioned portrait work. Over the last few months, Chennai-based Focus Art Gallery, which offers a customised portrait service, has been seeing a rise in enquiries, from single-digit a month to around 15 with requests for portraits of family, parents or elders who passed away. “Customers never commission their own pictures,” says founder Mayur Shah. Customers send Mayur photographs, along with preferences of the background colour to suit the home or office decor. “Working via photos works best for us, as our four portrait artists live in and outside Chennai,” he says. Solo portraits or that of couples, parents and pets in realistic and super realistic mode range from 18x24 inches to 48x72 inches and cost anywhere from Rs. 20,000 to Rs. 2.5 lakh. Portraits with a touch of super-realism look like photographs. “Even the reflection in the eyes and hair strands look life-like, whereas with realistic portraits one can make out it is a painting,” explains Mayur. Hyderabad’s renowned portrait artist Abdul Lateef Farooqui believes people prefer a portrait over just a framed photograph because “Art can capture the likeness of a soul”. He turned portrait artist when he was 17 and has more than 3,000 portraits — from life and photographs— to his credit. Now the 68-year-old is a guest faculty at Jawaharlal Nehru Architecture and Fine Arts University in Hyderabad, where he teaches the nuances of portrait art. Farooqui began by painting from photographs, then picked up live portrait drawing skills. “Meeting the people you are creating portraits of is a delight,” he says, adding that eye contact conveys many emotions, which helps him capture the subject’s real persona on canvas. When he draws from a photograph, he starts with a rough sketch, adding natural elements of light and shadow to enhance the image and filling colours. “I read that portrait art is not the mere likeness of the person but the likeness of the soul,” he adds. The animal world Aishwarya Ramachandran has been doing human and pet portraits for five years. The biomedical engineer has been training under well-known artist AV Ilango. “I chose to pursue art full time when I successfully battled cancer 10 years ago; art helped me during the tough times,” she says. As a pet lover, Aishwarya enjoys meticulously painting animals; her subjects are varied and have included a rooster named Karuppaiah. “It was the most graceful looking pet and close to the family” she recalls. When Karuppaiah died, his Sri Lanka-based family commissioned a portrait from her last year.  She says her greatest challenge is working with older photographs, which are often not clear. Her toughest assignment so far has been painting a woman’s portrait from a black and white passport photograph of the ’80s. “It was worn out, so it was quite a challenge to recreate it on canvas. The family was also particular about the jewellery and saree she wore,” she recollects. Aishwarya referred to another group photograph of the woman to understand her skin tone and create a realistic portrait. Bengaluru-based artist Varun N. Rao, who creates portraits predominantly from photographs, seeks multiple pictures of the person from various angles for reference. He explains, “Some photographs of people who wear glasses have a glare that hides the eye. Some capture messy hair which is a challenge to paint. Referring to different photos of the same person helps add depth and texture.” Like Aishwarya, he does a “little guesswork” while referring to black and white photographs. “When photographs are not clear, one has to guess the contour lines and paint,” he adds. Varun’s friend once commissioned a portrait of her father-in-law. His reference was a 15-year-old termite-eaten black and white framed photograph that had worn out due to humid Mumbai weather. “She approached me as none of the studios was willing to work on the photograph. She described his skin colour, contours and moles and also gave me her husband’s photograph to refer to... with a bit of guesswork I could finish it,” he recalls. Creating a 40x25 inches acrylic canvas of a father and a daughter is his most cherished memory. He says, “The girl’s father was no more and she asked me to create a portrait as if her dad was holding her hands. The girl was in tears when she saw the work.”  Creating opportunity  The three-year-old Hyderabad-based venture, handpaintedstories.com, established by Karan Bhangay is a platform for artists to showcase their talent. “The craftsmanship was the same but artists in foreign countries earned more than the artists here. I knew many gifted artists and hoped to bridge the disparity by bringing them all on one platform,” says Karan. Meanwhile, Pune-based PortraitFlip commissions handmade paintings based on photographs from across the globe. Conceptualised in Vellore Institute of Technology’s dormitory in 2018, it was inspired by a friend’s futile attempt to gift a handmade painting to his girlfriend in college, shares PortraitFlip CEO Sunny Kumar. “I felt it was an opportunity to tap the industry and market this art in India and abroad,” he says. Having begun with seven artists, the start-up now has 150 artists based in Delhi, Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Assam, Odisha, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, working with oil, colour pencil, watercolour, acrylic, pencil, and charcoal. The paintings are delivered in 12 days. It has recently started a painting movie service wherein clients sitting at home can watch a time-lapse video of the painting process and also share it with others. Sunny says, “One feels as if one is seated in a gallery and watching the artist work.”  PortraitFlip has recently started a movie service wherein clients sitting at home can watch a time-lapse video of the painting process||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/smile-youre-on-canvas/article37799768.ece
02 December 2021||December 02 2021 00:00 IST,||A serving of food history||It is close to lunch when we reach Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu. Just the right time to visit India’s first food museum, which promises to whet visitors’ appetites with the history of what we serve on our plates. The museum has been established by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) on the ground floor of its regional office, in collaboration with Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum, Bengaluru. Built at a cost of Rs. 1.1 crore, the 1,860 square feet museum uses technology like projection mapping, touch screens, proximity sensors, and radio frequency identification (RFID). The choice of location is significant, since Thanjavur is also the birthplace of the FCI, with its first office opening here on January 14, 1965. Our visit begins with a seven-minute video (available in English and Tamil) shown on a projector wall, to learn about how humans went from being hunter-gatherers to food producers. As the film reveals, the manipulation and cultivation of certain plants by human beings around 10,000 years ago, when the effects of the Ice Age receded and temperate climate ensued, led to the domestication of these strains, sowing the seeds of agriculture as we know it today. A display in the adjoining space shows the evolution of granaries across the world. With the help of a sliding electronic reader, one can look up granaries built by the Romans, the mud rhombus of Niger, and even the gender-specific earthen structures in Mali. Closer home, the display talks about the granaries found in the temple complex of Srirangam, in the Badami fort and the Indus Valley. A section on pests shows the perils posed by borer insects that can hollow out grains during storage. The study of crop origins done by Russian botanist and geneticist Nikolai Vavilov (1887-1943) in the 1920s is explained in some detail in a dedicated display area, followed by an interactive map that shows the major grains, fruits and vegetables grown in India. Young visitors will have fun placing model ‘sacks’ of pulses fitted with RFID chips on a reader to see their characteristics pop up on the big screen. This is followed by a section on healthy diet, and an interactive food chart of India, where visitors can click on a State and watch recipe videos of two signature dishes from there. You can also find a life-size replica of a public distribution system (PDS) ration shop. A quick walk to an adjoining annexe shows us the journey of the grain, from the field to the procurement centres, and includes a scaled down replica of a silo bin. The dioramas are beautifully detailed, right down to the number plates of trucks and the bulge in the sacks of grain. Having spent so much time looking at food-related displays, visitors may be a bit disappointed to note that there is no restaurant on the premises to provide a tasty trimming to the tour. But luckily, the multi-cuisine eateries of Thanjavur, the ‘rice bowl of India’, offer many tasty alternatives.  The Food Museum is located at Nirmala Nagar, Pudukottai Road, Thanjavur. Open Monday to Saturday, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Call 0436-2276292.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-serving-of-food-history/article37799769.ece

02 December 2021||New Delhi,||Nothing in my speech caused religious animosity: Sharjeel||Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Sharjeel Imam, arrested for allegedly making inflammatory speeches during the anti-CAA and NRC protests, told a Delhi court on Wednesday that there was nothing in his speech that caused religious animosity. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat was hearing a case filed against Mr. Imam for speeches given by him at two universities in 2019, where he allegedly threatened to “cut off” Assam and the rest of the Northeast from India. He was arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and for the alleged offence of sedition under the IPC and has now sought bail as well as discharge in the case. Mr. Imam has also approached the Delhi High Court seeking bail in another sedition case relating to 2019 Jamia violence. During the proceedings, counsel for Imam said, “From the impugned speech, there is nothing which per se causes any kind of religious animosity. We cannot lose sight of the context. What Sharjeel Imam says, in relation to CAA-NRC, is that in much as it affects one community directly, what kind of support is to be elicited from the majority community.” Advocate Tanveer Ahmed Mir added: “If a person is to say in regard to a Government policy which directly affects a community ‘A’ that people of other community ‘B’ should stand with them otherwise they are not supporting you, then we cannot say that part of the speech promotes animosity between two communities.” Cites Allahabad HC order He also apprised the judge about the recent Allahabad High Court order granting bail to Mr. Imam in a sedition case registered against him for a speech he made at Aligarh Muslim University in January 2020. “Rest I leave to the great wisdom of the court,” he told the court and concluded his argument. Following this, ASJ Rawat reserved for December 7 the order on his applications seeking bail and discharge and directed Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad to file detailed written submissions on behalf of the State. In the last hearing, the prosecutor told the court that violent riots took place pursuant to Mr. Imam’s speech. “He tried to create an anarchy by saying that there is no hope left for the Muslim community and that there is no other way left,” Mr. Prasad had said. The alleged inflammatory speeches for which he was arrested were reportedly made at Jamia on December 13, 2019, and at AMU on December 16, 2019. He is in judicial custody since January 2020. Mr. Imam is accused of offences relating to sedition, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, imputations prejudicial to national integration, and public mischief under the IPC, and indulging in unlawful activities under the UAPA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/nothing-in-my-speech-caused-religious-animosity-sharjeel/article37799563.ece
02 December 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Open to alliance with any party: SAD (Sanyukt)||With former Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh all set to fight the 2022 Assembly elections in alliance with the BJP, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt), led by Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, on Wednesday said his party was open to alliance with any party, but for the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). “We are not going to fight alone; we will fight in an alliance. We are open to everybody except for the Congress and the SAD led by Badals. The final decision on the alliance, be it with Capt. Amarinder’s party, the BJP or the Aam Aadmi Party should be out in the next two to three days. I will have a party meeting after which a final decision will be taken,” said Mr. Dhindsa. “As of now, there are no talks with Capt. Amarinder. All options are open,” he added. Mr. Dhindsa’s statement comes after Capt. Amarinder had said that he was willing to fight in alliance with the SAD (Sanyukt), besides the BJP, to defeat the Congress, the AAP and the SAD. Capt. Amarinder had added that his alliance with the BJP would take shape as the controversial farm laws have been repealed. He is expected to meet BJP national president J.P. Nadda on December 4. Notably, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha would also hold a meeting on December 4 “to decide the future course of action”. The SAD (Sanyukt) was formed after the dissolution of the SAD (Taksali), formed by Ranjit Singh Brahmpura, and the SAD (Democratic), launched earlier by Mr. Dhindsa. Mr. Dhindsa and Mr. Brahmpura were expelled from the SAD for revolting against party leadership. Channi’s charge Separately on Wednesday, Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi accused “Captain and Badal family” of being hand-in-glove with the Union Government for ruining Punjab to achieve their personal motives. “Firstly, the Badals implemented the farm laws in the State and then played a leading role in getting the same enforced upon the entire country...they even campaigned in support of these black laws. Ms. Harsimrat didn’t resign on her own but the anger among the people forced her to do so,” he said at a rally in Moga. He also alleged that Capt. Amarinder back-stabbed Punjab and the Punjabis by aligning with the BJP Government and justifying the notification of the Central Government enhancing the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force in Punjab.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/open-to-alliance-with-any-party-sad-sanyukt/article37799580.ece
02 December 2021||Pune,||Unseasonal rain with gusty winds lash Maharashtra||Maharashtra was hit by unseasonal rain on Wednesday with thunderstorms and gusty winds lashing several parts of the State, including Mumbai and Pune. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast light to moderate rain in these areas and in northern Maharashtra and Konkan region on Thursday also. It advised farmers, particularly those cultivating rice, to complete the harvest work and store the produce in safe places. Earlier, the IMD had issued ‘yellow’ alert for Mumbai city, Thane, and Raigad districts along with Pune, Ahmednagar, Satara and Marathwada while an amber alert was issued for Palghar and north Maharashtra including Nashik, Dhule and Nandurbar. “Associated strong winds and presence of moisture will cause thunderstorms and rainfall over north Madhya Maharashtra and Konkan regions till December 2,” said Anupam Kashyapi, head, weather forecasting division, IMD, Pune. Farmers to hit “Grape orchards in Nashik are at a major risk as are the tomato, onion and potato crops. The rice-growing region in the Konkan is likely to be badly afflicted and one may see a rise in crop diseases and pest influx,” said weather expert Ramchandra Sable. Agriculture in the State has been plagued by excess rain in the last three monsoon seasons besides being hit hard by frequent rounds of unseasonal rain since 2019. This year, 436 people lost their lives to rain-related accidents like landslips, floods and inclement weather. More than 17 lakh hectares of cropland have been ravaged owing to heavy rainfall aggravated by cyclonic storms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/unseasonal-rain-with-gusty-winds-lash-maharashtra/article37799778.ece
02 December 2021||AHMEDABAD,||GIFT City emerging as India’s first greenfield city||Around seven km from Gandhinagar, on the banks of the Sabarmati and spread over 886 acres, once a barren land along the river is now emerging as the country’s first greenfield integrated city — a dream project of Narendra Modi when he was Chief Minister of Gujarat. Now operational with more than 200 entities, which have set up their offices where more than 12,000 people are working, the Gujarat International Finance Tec City (GIFT City) is India’s first and only International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) where banks, stock exchanges and financial services firms have set up their global operations. As per the plans, 886 acres will be provided to develop nearly 62 million square feet built-up area constituting 67% commercial, 22% residential and 11% social space. Further, the entire city project has been divided into a multi-service Special Economic Zone (SEZ) spread over 261 acres and exclusive domestic tariff area (DTA) spread over 625 acres. “Thanks to the Central Government’s proactive support to develop the country as a hub of international financial services, the GIFT City has emerged as the preferred location for national and multinational firms,” said Tapan Ray, CEO and MD of the GIFT City and former Secretary, Corporate Affairs in the Government of India. Tax exemptions The Centre has announced a range of tax exemptions for those starting their international operations here. As a result, both the BSE and the NSE have set up their international stock exchanges; 17 banks, including 12 domestic and five international, issued licence to operate, 100-plus broking services, depository clearing operations and over 19 companies have begun operations for non-life reinsurance business. The Centre’s IFSC-related relief measures include tax holiday for capital gains for aircraft leasing companies, tax exemption for aircraft lease rentals paid to foreign lessors, tax incentive for re-locating foreign funds in IFSC and exemption to investment divisions of foreign banks. Since it’s a hub of international financial services, the Singapore Arbitration Centre has also been set up for dispute resolution while the International Bullion Exchange will become functional soon. As more and more companies are joining to set up their businesses and operations in the rapidly developing city, the latest Global Financial Centers Index, London, dated September 2020 has placed the IFSC at GIFT City right at the top among 15 centres globally, which are likely to gain greater significance in the next 24 months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/gift-city-emerging-as-indias-first-greenfield-city/article37799575.ece
02 December 2021||Mumbai,||Don’t remember meeting Anil Deshmukh unofficially: Vaze||Dismissed Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Vaze told a one-member judicial commission on Wednesday that he does “not remember” meeting former Home Minister of Maharashtra, Anil Deshmukh, unofficially. Mr. Vaze, the main accused in the Antilia explosives case was brought before retired justice K.U. Chandiwal from Taloja Central Jail and cross examined by advocate Anita Castellino representing Mr. Deshmukh. She asked Mr. Vaze about procedures for police officials to visit Mantralaya. Mr. Deshmukh, who is lodged at the Arthur Road Jail in a money laundering case against him by the Enforcement Directorate, was also present.
