18 December 2021||New Delhi,||CCI freezes Amazon-Future deal, slaps Rs. 200 crore fine on U.S. firm||The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Friday froze its approval given in November 2019 to Amazon’s investment in a Future Group unit on the grounds that the U.S. e-commerce company had suppressed the scope and full details of its investment while seeking regulatory approval. The antitrust regulator also imposed a penalty of Rs. 200 crore on Amazon for failing to notify the details of its ‘combination’, as required in law. It also imposed a separate penalty of Rs. 2 crore for suppressing the actual scope and purpose of the combination, a term used in competition law for acquisition, merger or amalgamation of two or more enterprises. The Commission had on November 28, 2019, granted approval for Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings’ proposal to acquire 49% in Future Coupons Private Ltd. The CCI decision further roils the legal landscape as Amazon seeks to block the Future Group’s 2020 decision to sell its retail assets to Reliance Industries. Amazon has 60 days to pay the monetary penalty. It has the same period to notify the combination afresh with “true, correct and complete information”. The Commission said it would examine the Amazon-Future deal afresh, “given that the combination is between players who are known in the online marketplace and offline retailing and they have contemplated strategic alignment between their businesses”. Amazon has for months successfully used the terms of its toehold $200 million investment in Future Group in 2019 to block the Indian retailer’s attempt to sell retail assets to Reliance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cci-freezes-amazon-future-deal-slaps-rs-200-crore-fine-on-us-firm/article37982531.ece
18 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Schools to reopen in NCR for Class VI and above||All educational institutions in the National Capital Region (NCR) that have been closed due to poor air quality will be allowed to reopen, the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas said on Friday. Classes will begin immediately for college students and those studying in Class VI and above. Restrictions on construction and demolition activities will continue till further orders but exemptions will be extended to essential projects related to hospitals, nursing homes, healthcare facilities, those pertaining to national security and defence, and projects of national importance. The Commission said it would follow a phased approach towards reopening the construction sector. Reviewing restrictions it had imposed on opening of schools, colleges and educational institutions on December 2, it said school can resume immediately for those studying in Class VI and above. For students up to Class V, physical classes can resume from December 27 factoring in the Air Quality Index (AQI) and the winter vacation schedule. The CAQM in a statement said it had received a large number of representations arguing the necessity to open schools and educational institutions with immediate effect. “Taking into consideration the submissions made and in light of improvement of Air Quality Index of Delhi from ‘Severe’ to ‘Very Poor’ category, the Commission today directed the State Governments of NCR and GNCTD to re-open schools, colleges and educational institutions in a phased manner,” the order read.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/schools-to-reopen-in-ncr-for-class-vi-and-above/article37982685.ece
18 December 2021||ALAPPUZHA,||Repeated bird flu bouts spell doom for duck farmers||It is almost certain that Kuttanadan duck curry would be missing from most Christmas platters as the latest bird flu (H5N1) outbreak in Alappuzha and Kottayam districts has prompted authorities to ban the movement and sale of duck in and around Kuttanad and Upper Kuttanad. While foodies would miss the dish, it is debilitating times for farmers and others involved in duck farming and allied business. The outbreak, fourth in seven years, has put duck farming in Kuttanad at a crossroads. Second in a year The number of duck raisers has dwindled and there are around 1,000 big duck farmers now, while several thousands, such as small farmers owning a few hundred birds, meat traders, and egg sellers, are allied to the sector. With the region seeing frequent outbreaks of avian influenza, many are contemplating abandoning the business. “It is the second time in less than a year that the bird flu has struck my farm. I have suffered a loss of Rs. 20 lakh. The government compensation will not be adequate,” says Binnychan Xavier from Nedumudi. The avian flu reported from six grama panchayats — three each in Alappuzha and Kottayam districts — has directly impacted fewer than 20 farmers. However, it has put the stakeholders in deep trouble with the authorities regulating the trade of meat and eggs of ducks along with chicken and quail. The farmers raise ducks (Chara and Chembally — two local breeds) with an eye on Christmas and Easter seasons. Christmas rearing According to farmers’ associations, between 10 lakh and 15 lakh birds are reared for this Christmas. While the farmers who lost ducks (around 75,000 both culled and dead) to the disease are entitled to a compensation of Rs. 200 for a bird older than two months and Rs. 100 for those less than two months old, the unaffected farmers, prevented from selling the ducks, are in a precarious situation. A farmer gets around Rs. 250 for a 120-day-old duck during Christmas. Voracious eaters “At present, there are 32,000 ducks on my farm. If the ban is not lifted before Christmas, I will suffer huge losses. Ducks are voracious eaters and I can’t keep them at one place beyond a certain period. It is not sustainable to hand-feed the birds,” says Kunjumon Vettikeeruparambu of Nazarath in Nedumudi. Experts say the recurring outbreaks and mass death and culling are a serious threat to the sustainability of duck farming. “Frequent bouts of the avian flu will see the local breeds going extinct. Registration should be made mandatory for farmers. There should be a cap on the number of birds a farmer can raise. An insurance scheme should be introduced for all farmers,” said an official of the Animal Husbandry Department, adding that apart from the Government Duck Farm at Niranam, a second duck farm should be set up far away from Kuttanad to protect the local breeds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/repeated-bird-flu-bouts-spell-doom-for-duck-farmers/article37982808.ece
18 December 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Rs. 9,467.35-cr. investments in 41 PSUs||Industries Minister P. Rajeeve has announced a revamp of the public sector Restructuring and Internal Audit Board (RIAB) to equip it with a project management system with technical experts from various fields for the implementation of the master plans in 41 public sector units (PSUs). Speaking at a press conference here on Friday, he said an estimated Rs. 9,467.35 crore in additional investments is expected in the 41 public sector units with the implementation of 405 projects under the master plan, out of which 175 will be short-term projects, 131 medium-term and 99 long-term projects. The funding will be using the reserve funds of the PSUs, bank loans and the funds allocated by the State government. Around 5,500 new job openings are expected to be created in these institutions with the implementation of the master plan. "To take forward these plans, the PSUs need to be given more autonomy than exists at present. Financial and functional autonomy with accountability will be the policy as far as these institutions are concerned," said Mr. Rajeeve. Seven categories of PSUs The master plans which were prepared recently for the PSUs aimed at protecting them even while making them competitive and profitable and not requiring frequent fund infusions from the government for their survival. "Separate project management teams will be formed for each of the seven categories of PSUs. Each team will have a technical expert from the respective field, a planning and administration expert and a financial expert. Roy Kurian, former Managing Director, Kerala Minerals and Metals Limited (KMML), will coordinate the activities of all the committees. The committees will be visiting each of the PSUs under them as part of the implementation of the master plan," said Mr. Rajeeve.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rs-946735-cr-investments-in-41-psus/article37982813.ece
18 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Avoid non-essential travel, says Centre||More than 100 cases of the Omicron variant of novel coronavirus have been detected across 11 States so far, Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Union Health Ministry, said on Friday, adding that there was “no evidence” to suggest that vaccines were not effective against the variant. Maharashtra has reported 40 Omicron cases — the most in the country. Flagging the rapid spread of the new variant, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) chief Balram Bhargava said at a press conference: “This is the time to avoid non-essential travel, mass gatherings and it is very important to observe low-intensity festivities.” Asked if mRNA vaccines were more effective against the virus, Dr. Bhargava said mRNA vaccines had shown a higher antibody response but a swifter fall, while the vaccines being used in India indicated a more sustained response. On anti-viral COVID-19 pills, he said: “The pills are under discussion; it has been found that these pills need to be given very early, even before the diagnosis of the disease. Scientific data is still not supported in a big way that the pills will be useful at the moment.” Stating that the Omicron variant is now reported in 91 countries in the world, Mr. Agarwal said: “The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that Omicron is spreading faster than the Delta variant in South Africa where Delta circulation is low. It's likely Omicron will outpace the Delta variant where community transmission occurs.” He added that WHO has noted that the overall risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron remains very high for several reasons including risk of potential immune escape against infection and high transmission rates, which could lead to further surges.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/avoid-non-essential-travel-says-centre/article37982569.ece
18 December 2021||NEW DELHI/ CHANDIGARH,||BJP, Amarinder announce alliance for Punjab election||The BJP on Friday announced an alliance with the Punjab Lok Congress, headed by former Congress leader and ex-Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh (retd.), for the upcoming Assembly election. The alliance was announced after a meeting between Union Minister for Jal Shakti and BJP’s Punjab in-charge Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and Capt. Amarinder at the former’s residence in New Delhi. It comes after seven rounds of talks between the two parties. “Today I confirm that the BJP and the Punjab Lok Congress are going to fight the upcoming Punjab Assembly election together. Topics like seat sharing will be discussed later,” Mr. Shekhawat said after the meeting. Capt. Amarinder said, “We (the alliance) are ready and we are going to win this election. The decision on seat sharing will be taken on seat to seat basis, with winnability being the priority. We are 101% sure of winning this election.” Former Akali Dal leader Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa, who broke away from the party to float the Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt), also met Mr. Shekhawat after his meeting with Capt. Amarinder. It is expected that he will be part of this new alliance as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/bjp-amarinder-announce-alliance-for-punjab-election/article37982529.ece
18 December 2021||Bengaluru,||State got nod to use 1,355 ha of forest land for non-forestry purposes in 5 years||In the last five years, Karnataka got approval to use 1,355.25 hectares (ha) of forest land for non-forestry purpose under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Responding to an unstarred question in the Lok Sabha recently, Minister of State in the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Ashwini Kumar Choubey said a total of 82,893.61 ha of forest land has been approved for non-forestry use under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, from April 2016 to March 2021. He further said that 206 proposals involving 4,118.109067 ha area within Protected Areas, including national parks and sanctuaries, have been recommended by the Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife during 2020 and 2021. The State/UT-wise approved areas for use of forest land for non-forestry purpose under the Act for Karnataka showed that it went up from 199.20 ha in 2016-17 to 326.52 ha in 2017-18. After 139.64 ha in 2018-19, it again increased to 390.12 ha in 2019-2020. In 2020-21, it was 299.78 ha. In comparison, neighbouring Kerala had a total approved area of just 9.21 ha and Tamil Nadu 81.91 ha. However, Andhra Pradesh had 2,713.53 ha, Telangana 8209.32 ha, and Maharashtra, 3615.62 ha. Among the States and UTs, Jammu and Kashmir had the least: 1.20 ha, all of which was approved in 2020-21. Madhya Pradesh had the highest, with 19638.41 ha being approved for diversion. Move criticised This massive diversion has been criticised by environmentalists. “Approvals under the Act for non-forestry purposes should be allowed only as a stark exception. However, it is shocking to see that the forest clearances are being given at such a rate,” said wildlife conservationist Giridhar Kulkarni. The Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, which has statutory and constitutional obligations to protect the forests, is giving clearances in the name of ease of doing business, which is really unfortunate, he added. The percentage of Karnataka’s forest area in comparison to its geographical area is admittedly lower than the all-India average, as well as the percentage recommended by the National Forest Policy, which is 33%. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who had this year announced an “environment budget” to compensate the damages caused to the environment along with annual estimations of green areas in the State, had said that Karnataka has 43 lakh hectares of forest, which is 21.5%. T.V. Ramachandra from the Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), said forests in the Western Ghats provide water security to peninsular India, which in turn provides food security. “Naturally, any diversion is going to lead to loss of water and hurt livelihoods of people. Wherever there is native forest, earnings are higher and pollinators are diverse, due to which yield is higher. That means we are threatening food security and water security,” he said. What we need now is natural capital accounting and valuation of ecosystem services, and to think about whether the diversions have better benefit than the ecosystem, he added. “Skewed policies and a colonial mindset are leading to environment degradation. Large scale projects are being pushed in the name of drinking water schemes,” he said. The purpose-wise details of proposals involving 50 ha or more area approved during 2016-17 to 2020-21 for the country showed that irrigation, mining and defence had the highest numbers. Dr. Ramachandra recommended taking advantage of technological advancements to plan projects, as well as looking at the cost people pay for calamities due to improper projects by way of loss of life and property.  Skewed policies and a colonial mindset are leading to environment degradation. Large scale projects are being pushed in the name of drinking water schemes. T.V.

18 December 2021||Bengaluru/Belagavi,||Ramesh Kumar’s remark on rape leads to uproar, apology||The outrage over former Speaker and senior Congress leader K.R. Ramesh Kumar’s frivolous comment on rape in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday compelled him to apologise in the House on Friday and also tweet out regret for his “indifferent and negligent” remarks. Mr. Ramesh Kumar, in response to Speaker Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri expressing helplessness over too many members demanding time to speak on Thursday, had said: “There’s a saying... when rape is inevitable, lie down and enjoy it.” The Speaker had laughed in response, while there was no objection raised by anyone in the House. However, Friday saw people cutting across party barriers taking exception to Mr. Ramesh Kumar’s analogy. While Union Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani, in the Lok Sabha, dared Congress to expel him, criticism came from within his party as well. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi tweeted: “I wholeheartedly condemn the statement made earlier today by Sri. K.R. Ramesh Kumar. It is inexplicable how anyone can ever utter such words, they are indefensible. Rape is a heinous crime. Full stop.” Women MLAs of Karnataka, including those from Congress such as Anjali Nimbalkar and Roopakala Shashidhar, reacted strongly to the former Speaker’s statement. Ms. Nimbalkar demanded that not just the Mr. Ramesh Kumar, but the House should apologise for the remark. However, in the House, Mr. Kageri insisted that issue should not be dragged on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/remark-on-rape-leads-to-uproar-apology/article37982559.ece
18 December 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||State’s medical infra a cause for concern||A three-member Central team, which visited the State earlier in the week, has taken exception to the fact that Kerala has substantially reduced medical infrastructure and human resource to deal with COVID-19. This could backfire if an emergency involving COVID-19 rises again, the team has warned. Sufficient human resource be maintained so that in the event of an emergency, it should be able to call them back on short notice. At a briefing held here on Thursday, the team pointed out that the State had almost totally dispensed with active surveillance and contact tracing. The team told top Health department officials that it needed to prepare the health system in the event of a new wave arising from the Omicron variant. It may be recalled that the active case pool and new cases reported daily had substantially come down after the first wave when the arrival of Delta changed the scenario totally. It said that in districts such as Idukki, where international tourism is thriving, there should be a separate COVID surveillance system for tourists to ensure that they are properly tested, against the background of Omicron. Re-infections The team noted that the State had been reporting a high number of reinfections and breakthrough infections and said that vaccination alone would not help with the prevention of infections. While the mask usage seems to be high in public places, the same was not true when it came to gatherings and meetings or restaurants and warned that these could lead to superspreader events. Infections cannot be reduced unless more stress was laid on COVID-appropriate behaviour. The team had earlier visited Idukki, Wayanad and Kozhikode. It appreciated Wayanad’s system for cluster containment and its good surveillance system among tribal hamlets. The Central team also looked at the online COVID-19 death reporting system and pointed out that the site’s functionality seemed to be affected at the grassroots as those operating the system lacked training.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/states-medical-infra-a-cause-for-concern/article37982809.ece
18 December 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra local body polls on Dec. 21, Jan. 18||In line with the Supreme Court’s December 15 directive on re-notifying seats reserved for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in local body polls, the Maharashtra State Election Commission on Friday said voting for those seats will now be held on January 18. However, polling for the other seats in 106 Nagar Panchayats and the two Zilla Parishads of Bhandara and Gondia will be held as per the previous schedule on December 21, said State Election Commissioner U.P.S. Madan. Counting for all seats, which was initially slated for December 22, has now been deferred to January 19. By-elections to four vacant civic body seats and 7,130 posts in 4,544 Gram Panchayats will be held on December 21. “The seats that were meant for OBCs will now be treated as ‘general category’ seats in accordance with the SC order. Of these, 50% will have to be given to women. We have already issued directions to various Collectors to ensure that reservation is kept for women on seats in the general category,” said K.V. Kurundkar, Secretary to the State Election Commission. The Supreme Court on Wednesday had dismissed a writ petition of the Maharashtra Government seeking that the Centre make public the raw data of the 2011 Socio-Economic Caste Census to enable the State to implement 27% reservation to the OBCs in local body polls. However, the apex court quashed the plea on grounds that the Centre had already submitted that the 2011 data were fraught with mistakes and directed the State Election Commission to re-notify the 27% seats hitherto reserved for OBC category as ‘general category’ seats. M.P. polls halted On Friday, the apex court directed the State Election Commission in Madhya Pradesh as well to stay the election process on local bodies’ seats reserved for OBCs and re-notify such seats for the general category. The Maharashtra SEC’s announcement comes as a setback to the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi Government, which had urged it to defer the local bodies polls until the OBC reservation imbroglio could be resolved. The State Cabinet meeting on Wednesday had passed a resolution as well seeking postponement of the polls. The SC’s Wednesday order has resulted in a blame game between the opposition BJP and the MVA, with the BJP along with OBC leaders in Maharashtra alleging that the ruling alliance’s “delaying tactics” and “inefficiency” cost the OBC community political reservation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/maharashtra-local-body-polls-on-dec-21-jan-18/article37982683.ece
18 December 2021||HYDERABAD,||‘Give women education, they will take care of the country’||She waxed eloquent on how the country needs to respond to women, expressed dispassionate love for her work, revealed how her rage resulted in a book, persuaded women to create their “own tables” and also said that she was “perhaps the best choice to take on Rahul Gandhi in Amethi”. Union Minister of Women and Child Development Smriti Irani was at her simplistic best yet evocatively brilliant in a conversation with the students and the alumni of the Indian School of Business (ISB). Arguing for women empowerment at Solstice 2021, the annual alumni meet, Ms. Irani questioned the stereotype narratives and recalled what Swami Vivekananda had visualised — she said give education to women and she would take care of not only herself but also the nation. Her whole argument was based on the thought process of a male-dominated society and asked for more respect for women. “When women entrepreneurs come up with ideas, don’t run them down. When she asks for maternity leave, don’t sign her death warrant giving an impression that she has to lose the job. Earlier, women had to request for work from home to take care of various responsibilities and they were looked down upon as if they were making some excuse to escape work. The pandemic, however, ensured that it became a male concept as well,” the Minister said. Book born of rage On her debut novel ‘Lal Salaam’, she said it emerged from the rage within her on how negatively the society treats women. The book is based on the Dantewada incident in which 76 CRPF personnel were killed in Chhattisgarh. “What enraged me was the nonchalant attitude of many who strongly believed people joined the security forces knowing they would die — so what, they asked. They come from the poorest of families in the country,” she reminded. The Minister was critical of those siding with the Naxal ideology, saying “here Naxals are besmirching the Indian Constitution and some people were buying the ideology just to prove they were liberals”. She said the book was a fictional account and a translation of her rage within. On what makes women succeed in politics, she asked the women not to dream of being parachuted. “Start from the grassroots and politics comes in various hues — electoral politics, administrative politics and policy politics. Choose your own vertical,” she said, adding that women have to create their own tables and create the atmosphere for people to join their table. Everyone wants to pull the rug from under your feet, she warned. ‘Love yourself’ She had some advice for women and mothers, asking them not to spend their entire lives in raising their children “who would one day walk out in search of their own life”. “So, don’t break but start giving a gift to yourself. Start loving yourself and don’t feel guilty about putting yourself first before the family, at times,” she added. Talking about why she was chosen to take on Rahul Gandhi in Amethi, she smiled and said, “Perhaps, I was the best choice”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/give-women-education-they-will-take-care-of-the-country/article37982785.ece

18 December 2021||New Delhi,||Pegasus: SC stays probe by Bengal panel||The Supreme Court on Friday stayed further proceedings of a commission of inquiry appointed by the Government of West Bengal to look into the allegations of snooping using the Pegasus software. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) N.V. Ramana impleaded the commission, comprising former Supreme Court judge, Justice Madan B. Lokur, and retired Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court, Justice Jyotirmay Bhattacharya. The court issued notice to the panel to be served through its secretary. The order was passed after NGO ‘Global Village Foundation’ Trust made an urgent plea that the commission was going ahead with a “parallel inquiry” into the Pegasus allegations. The Supreme Court had appointed a committee led by retired Supreme Court judge, Justice R.V. Raveendran, in October to “expeditiously” examine the Pegasus snooping reports. West Bengal’s move in July to appoint the commission of inquiry was first heard by the Supreme Court in August. The Supreme Court only issued pre-admission notice to the Centre on August 17 on petitions seeking an independent inquiry into allegations that the Government used the Israeli-based spyware to snoop on journalists, activists, dissenters, Ministers and other citizens.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pegasus-sc-stays-probe-by-bengal-panel/article37982526.ece
18 December 2021||Bengaluru,||TAC recommends universal pass for double vaccinated people||With the State Government making two-dose vaccination mandatory for entry into malls and cinemas in Bengaluru, the State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) has now recommended a universal vaccine pass for fully inoculated citizens. The committee that deliberated on surveillance measures, especially in the wake of growing concern over Omicron, at its 140th meeting held on December 15, has said the system of universal pass for fully vaccinated citizens should initially be introduced in BBMP limits and then extended in a phased manner across the State. “The universal pass can be used for entry into offices, factories, banks, cinemas and auditoria, shopping malls and complexes, airports, gyms, pubs and bars, swimming pools, hotels and restaurants, wedding halls, zoos, parks and even places of worship,” said a TAC member. According to TAC’s report, the Government of Maharashtra has introduced the universal pass for fully vaccinated citizens. “This pass is useful for entry into offices, malls, cinemas, airports, etc. This can be obtained online through https://epassmsdma.mahait.org by typing in the registered cell phone number given while taking the vaccination. An OTP is sent to the registered number and on entering the OTP, the pass-cum-certificate with the beneficiary’s photo can be obtained and printed,” the report stated. “TAC recommends introducing a similar facility in Karnataka, to begin with in the BBMP area and then extending it in a phased manner across the State,” the report said. Sources in the TAC said the online universal pass facility can be linked to CoWIN for double verification. As the pass will also have the photo of the beneficiary, it will be easier for the security staff to verify and check the vaccination status, sources said. On December 3, after India’s first two cases of Omicron were detected in Karnataka and also in the wake of several COVID clusters emerging, the State Government had announced certain preventive measures, including compulsory two-dose vaccination to enter malls, cinemas and for parents of school/collegegoing students. TAC member V. Ravi said the universal e-pass would help in better monitoring of vaccination status of people at the entry points. “Although CoWIN certificate is the proof of vaccination, sometimes it is difficult for the staff to verify every certificate,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tac-recommends-universal-pass-for-double-vaccinated-people/article37982582.ece

The public meeting conducted at Daminedu on the city outskirts on Friday by the farmers on conclusion of their 400-km long ‘Nyayasthanam to Devasthanam’ Padayatra provided the platform for all parties to fault the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy government for taking a ‘U-turn’ on the capital issue. Apart from the main opposition TDP, which has been championing the cause of Amaravati, the BJP, CPI, Congress and Jana Sena Party offered unequivocal support to the farmers and expressed resentment over the three-capital proposal, terming that such a move could make governance go haywire.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/major-parties-bat-for-amaravati-as-capital/article37982524.ece

Eshwarappa has said that the government is committed to providing tapped drinking water to all households in Karnataka by 2024 under the Jal Jeevan Mission. Responding to a question by BJP member N. Ravi Kumar in the Legislative Council on December 17, Mr. Eshwarappa said the government had already provided drinking water to 41.94 lakh households. “For the current year, we had set a target of covering 25.12 lakh houses. So far, we have completed connecting 14 lakh houses. By 2024, we will provide all houses with tapped water,” he said. Responding to another question by Dr. Talawar Sabanna on Panchayat Development Officers (PDOs) not attending to their work, the Minister said the governing had taken measures, including biometric attendance, to ensure officers attend to their work regularly.

18 December 2021||HYDERABAD,||Omicron tally rises to eight in Telangana||At a time when the pandemic seemed to be under control in Telangana, the State has been getting Omicron cases from abroad and its tally went up to eight on Friday. The infected persons came from Kenya (3), Abu Dhabi (2) and Dubai, Sudan and the UK (1 each). Two of them were from `at risk’ countries and six from `not at risk’ countries. One more boy who was on a transit halt at Hyderabad international airport tested positive but the result of genome sequencing was known after he had left for Kolkata. Of the eight infected persons in the State, seven were from in and around Tolichowki in Hyderabad and one woman from Hanamkonda. She tested negative on arrival from the UK but confirmed as positive case by the result of genome sequencing on Thursday evening. Giving these details at a press conference today, Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao said there was no cause for concern at this stage as all positive cases were asymptomatic. There was reason for concern if the infected persons carried symptoms of fever or flu. He, however, warned that Omicron variant had the potential of spreading two to six times faster than COVID-19 with mild symptoms. Dr. Rao explained that screening at Hyderabad airport was stepped up since December 1 after outbreak of Omicron cases were reported . So far, as many as 6,764 passengers from `at risk’ countries were screened. Only two per cent of total passengers in a flight from `not at risk’ countries were tested as per laid down norms. He described Omicron as an offshoot of COVID whose diagnosis and treatment protocols were the same. They carried the same symptoms. The State was well on way to getting rid of COVID in a few months as 97% of the population was vaccinated for first dose and 56 % for the second. Vaccination of 28 lakh people who were due for second dose will be completed by month-end. He rejected imposition of lockdown or other restrictions in view of the latest threat and said the government was fully geared up to meet the situation. Twenty one persons who came in contact with Omicron positive patients were identified and quarantined. The government was trying to fix lower charges for rapid RTPCR tests at the airport in view of complaints that the airport was collecting Rs. 3,400 each.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/omicron-tally-rises-to-eight-in-telangana/article37982764.ece
18 December 2021||TIRUNELVELI,||Three school students killed in wall collapse||Three students were crushed to death and four others injured when a “poorly constructed” wall near the toilets of a government-aided school on S.N. High Road in Tirunelveli collapsed on Friday. The Tirunelveli Junction police arrested school correspondent R.P.J. Selvakumar, headmistress B.V. Persis Gnanaselvi and civil contractor John Kennedy and booked them under Section 304 (2) of the Indian Penal Code (causing the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide). The police said that when the students of the 143-year-old Schaffter Higher Secondary School, administered by the CSI Diocese, went to the toilet during the interval at 11 a.m., one of the three ‘covering walls’ (meant to prevent view from outside) measuring about 6 feet X 5 feet, built at the entrance, collapsed. D. Vishwa Ranjan, a Class VIII student of Keezha Ilanthaikulam near Thatchanallur on the city outskirts, and K. Anbazhagan, a Class IX student from Sathya Nagar close to Narasinganallur near Tirunelveli town, died on the spot. Five others were rushed to the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital, where R. Suthish, a Class VI student from Pazhavoor, succumbed to injuries. S. Sanjay, a Class VIII student from Thatchanallur; M. Esakki Prakash, a Class IX student from Paattapaththu in Tirunelveli town; P. Shaik Abubucker Kithani, a Class XII student from Senthamizh Nagar near Vaagaikulam; and B.

18 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Omicron: avoid unnecessary travel: govt.||More than 100 cases of the Omicron variant of novel coronavirus have been detected across 11 States so far, Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Union Health Ministry, said on Friday, adding that there was “no evidence” to suggest that vaccines were not effective against the variant. Maharashtra has reported 40 Omicron cases — the most in the country. Flagging the rapid spread of the new variant, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) chief Balram Bhargava said at a press conference: “This is the time to avoid non-essential travel, mass gatherings and it is very important to observe low-intensity festivities.” Asked if mRNA vaccines were more effective against the virus, Dr. Bhargava said mRNA vaccines had shown a higher antibody response but a swifter fall, while the vaccines being used in India had indicated a more sustained response. On anti-viral COVID-19 pills, he said: “The pills are under discussion. Scientific data is still not supported in a big way that the pills will be useful at the moment.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/omicron-avoid-unnecessary-travel-govt/article37982527.ece

18 December 2021||New Delhi,||SC stays probe on Pegasus||The Supreme Court on Friday stayed further proceedings of a commission of inquiry appointed by the Government of West Bengal to look into the allegations of snooping using the Pegasus software. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) N.V. Ramana impleaded the commission, comprising former Supreme Court judge, Justice Madan B. Lokur, and retired Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court, Justice Jyotirmay Bhattacharya. The court issued notice to the panel to be served through its secretary. The order was passed after NGO ‘Global Village Foundation’ Trust made an urgent plea that the commission was going ahead with a “parallel inquiry” into the Pegasus allegations. The Supreme Court had appointed a committee led by retired Supreme Court judge, Justice R.V. Raveendran, in October to “expeditiously” examine the Pegasus snooping reports. West Bengal’s move in July to appoint the commission of inquiry was first heard by the Supreme Court in August. The Supreme Court only issued pre-admission notice to the Centre on August 17 on petitions seeking an independent inquiry into allegations that the Government used the Israeli-based spyware to snoop on journalists, activists, dissenters, Ministers and other citizens. In the hearing on August 25, the top court initially wanted to pass a formal order to stop the commission from going ahead with its inquiry when the case was already pending before the court. However, the West Bengal Government, through senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, had given an oral assurance to the court to convey a “message of restraint” to the commission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-stays-probe-by-bengal-commission-on-pegasus/article37982570.ece

18 December 2021||New Delhi,||Raising women’s legal age of marriage to 21 in House agenda||With four sittings of winter session remaining the government has listed eight Bills for the next week, including The Prohibition of Child Marriage (A) Bill, 2021 that seeks to raise the legal age of marriage for women from 18 to 21 years and bringing it at par with men. While the Bill is likely to be introduced on Monday in Rajya Sabha, Minister of State (MoS) for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal, informed Lok Sabha on Friday that it is part of the House’s agenda for the next week. Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), Abdul Wahab, had moved an adjournment motion against the impending bill on Friday, noting that any unilateral move to increase the legal age will have far reaching consequences and called it “an attempt to encroach on Muslim personal law”. Other important Bills on top of the government’s legislative agenda for the next week include the passage of the supplementary demands for grants/Appropriation (No.5) Bill and the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021 that seeks to link the Aadhaar card with the voter identity card. While Rajya Sabha is likely to take up the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Amendment) Bill, 2021, as passed by Lok Sabha, the Mediation Bill, 2021 – seeking to promote and facilitate institutional mediation for resolution of disputes – is likely to be sent to the Standing Committee. Three of the eight Bills — the National Anti-Doping Bill, 2021, the Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Bill, 2021, and the Chartered Accountants, the Cost and Works Accountants and the Company Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 2021 — were introduced in the Lok Sabha on Friday amid constant protests from Opposition members, who were demanding the resignation of Minister of State (MoS) for Home Affairs Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’, for his alleged involvement in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence earlier this year. When the Lok Sabha met at 2 p.m., apart from introduction of the Bills, it also approved changes made to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill by Rajya Sabha through a voice vote and soon after the House was adjourned for the day. Protests erupt Protests over the Lakhimpur Kheri killings had erupted almost as soon as Lok Sabha proceedings started at 11 a.m. but Speaker Om Birla tried running the Question Hour for half an hour. He had also issued a stern warning to Opposition members who were protesting in the Well of the House. “Honorable members, if there is any damage to any Lok Sabha property, then the responsibility lies with the members. I would like make this request to member,” Mr. Birla cautioned the members who were protesting in the Well and around the secretary general’s desk.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/raising-womens-age-limit-for-marriage-to-21-in-house-agenda/article37982230.ece
18 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Ecologists oppose changes to Biological Diversity Act, 2002||Environmentalists have expressed concern over amendments to the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 on the grounds that it prioritises intellectual property and commercial trade at the expense of the Act’s key aim of conserving biological resources. Amendments to the Act were introduced as a Bill in the Lok Sabha by Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav on Thursday. On Friday, Rajya Sabha member Jairam Ramesh, who also chairs the Parliament’s Standing Committee on Science, Technology and Environment, wrote a letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla “protesting” his decision to refer the amended Bill to a select committee when the Bill ought to have been perused by a standing committee that had existing mandate to examine questions of science and environment. The amended Bill was drafted in response to complaints by traditional Indian medicine practitioners, seed sector, and industry and researchers that the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. Compliance Burden The bill was enacted for conservation of biological diversity and ensure fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the use of biological resources with indigenous and local communities, imposed a heavy “compliance burden” and made it hard to conduct collaborative research and investments and simplify patent application processes. The text of the Bill also says that it proposes to “widen the scope of levying access and benefit sharing with local communities and for further conservation of biological resources.” The Bill seeks to exempt registered AYUSH medical practitioners and people accessing codified traditional knowledge, among others, from giving prior intimation to State biodiversity boards for accessing biological resources for certain purposes. A statement from the Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment (LIFE) said the Bill would “undo all the efforts made in the last few years to implement the Biological Diversity Act.” There was not a “single provision in the proposed amendment to protect, conserve or increase the stake of local communities in the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity.” LIFE said the amendments were done to “solely benefit” the AYUSH Ministry. The Bill in the current form would pave the way for “bio piracy” and would mean AYUSH manufacturing companies would no longer need to take approvals and thus defeat the purpose for which the Act was created in the first place.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ecologists-oppose-changes-to-biological-diversity-act-2002/article37982250.ece
18 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||France ready to supply more Rafale jets||France is ready to answer any additional needs or requests that could be made by India for additional Rafale fighter jets, including for its indigenous aircraft carrier, French Minister for Armed Forces Florence Parly said on Friday. On the Indo-Pacific, she observed that they wanted to preserve it as an open and inclusive area and free from any “coercion” and based on compliance with international law and multilateralism. “We know that aircraft carrier will soon be delivered and aircraft are needed. So we are open and ready to provide any other Rafale if this is India’s decision,” Ms. Parly stated at the Ananta Aspen Centre on the possibility of purchase of more Rafales by India. Her comments come as indigenous aircraft carrier Vikrant , which is undergoing sea trials, is set to be commissioned next year and in the backdrop of the Navy’s tender to procure carrier based fighter jets. Ms. Parly is in Delhi for the third bilateral defence dialogue with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. A wide range of bilateral, regional, defence and defence industrial cooperation issues were discussed in the annual meeting and the Ministers reviewed the existing military-to-military cooperation, which has increased in spite of pandemic challenges, a Defence Ministry statement said after the talks. “Defence industrial cooperation was discussed with focus on future collaborations and co-production between the two countries,” it added. The two Ministers expressed commitment to working together to “enhance cooperation in bilateral, regional and multilateral forums,” the statement noted. Ms. Parly also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. This is the first interaction between the two Defence Ministers since Australia, U.K and U.S. announced the AUKUS tripartite arrangement. Defence dialogue She said: “Indo-Pacific is a very wide area and the political focus is more on the eastern part of this large area due to the tensions in relations with China. But Indo-Pacific is also made of the Indian Ocean. And there is no doubt that India is the centre of this area. France is an Indo-Pacific nation…” She noted, “There are also many tensions in the Indian Ocean especially in the eastern part of Africa. It is our joint responsibility that we can contribute to ease up the tensions.” She pointed out that China was a partner to fight climate change and also in trade and commerce. “We see that China is getting more and more aggressive in the region, and it is even more specific when it comes to the China Sea. France and India share the same views on something which is key, on the international maritime law.” Ms. Parly also laid emphasis on preserving access to global commons such as cyber, space, maritime and air domains. “We can see that these are areas of strategic competition and we must ensure that they do not become the new far west.” Ms. Parly said they have great ambition for the EU, including in the field of defence. They planned to adopt a “Strategic Compass”, the first defence ‘White Paper’ of the EU. “The Indo-Pacific region will also be on our agenda.” The contract for 36 Rafale fighter jets for the Indian Air Force (IAF) is on schedule and on the verge of being completed. Ms. Parly was earlier in India in September 2020 for the induction ceremony of the first five Rafales into the IAF. “Since then, a total of 33 Rafale jets have been delivered to India, all perfectly on schedule despite the disruptions of the pandemic,” a French Embassy statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/france-says-it-is-ready-to-provide-more-rafale-jets/article37982235.ece
18 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Kovind inaugurates Kalibari temple in Dhaka||President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday inaugurated a famous Hindu temple in Dhaka that was destroyed by Pakistani forces in 1971. He declared that the revived shrine represents the “spiritual and cultural” bonds between India and Bangladesh. Addressing the Indian community in Dhaka after inaugurating the new Ramna Kalibari, Mr. Kovind said the relationship between India and Bangladesh is marked by shared language, culture and kinship. “I pay tribute to the enormous sacrifices made by the people of Bangladesh to achieve freedom from tyranny. We salute your indomitable courage in fighting against the formidable odds and standing up against injustice,” Mr. Kovind said in his speech. At the Ramna temple, President Kovind was welcomed by the Bangladesh Deputy Minister of Religious Affairs, Faridul Haq Khan. He inaugurated the main temple, a guest house, a deep tube-well and the main entry gate. Built by India The plaque unveiled by President Kovind stated that the construction of these sections had been done by the Government of India. The original Ramna Kalibari was built during the medieval era and was famous for its tall structure. In 1929, the temple complex acquired an additional building for the devotees of the famous saint Anandamayee, who later became Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s spiritual advisor. Golden jubilee The inauguration of the reconstructed Ramna Kalibari coincided with the 50th anniversary of the victory of Bangladesh and India in the Liberation War, which also marks the golden jubilee of the bilateral relations between the two sides. Former Information Minister of Bangladesh Hasanul Haq Inu said the Government of Bangladesh had been providing “all possible assistance for the day-to-day running” of the new Ramna Kalibari.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kovind-inaugurates-landmark-kalibari-temple-in-bangladesh/article37982221.ece
18 December 2021||Chennai,||Chopper crash: Coonoor VAO recalls fateful day||The weather condition in Coonoor at the time of the Indian Air Force (IAF) Mi-17V5 helicopter crash in which Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and 13 others died on December 8 was intermittently misty, the complainant in the police case and Village Administrative Officer Arul Rathna told The Hindu . Asked about the visibility in the area, she said the weather was off and on misty, and visibility would change every now and then on the fateful day. Going by eyewitness accounts and what Ms. Rathna said, about a dozen youth from a village abutting the helicopter crash site and some volunteers at Coonoor in the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu risked their lives to rescue those on the chopper that was engulfed by flames. Little did they know that Gen. Rawat, his wife Madhulika Rawat and other senior defence officers were on board the ill-fated helicopter. While some poured buckets of water on the rising flames that emanated from an explosion, others reached out to the victims trapped in the mangled remains of the helicopter. “They did not know who Gen. Bipin Rawat was…they just went ahead braving the intensifying fire to help the passengers. Some even suffered injuries in the rescue work,” Ms. Rathna said. Ms. Rathna gave in writing to the Upper Coonoor police that she saw the helicopter on fire and some passengers lying dead, after which a case under Section 174 (unnatural death) of the Criminal Procedure Code was registered. “The villagers were the first to respond, followed by medical teams and army personnel. By the time I reached the crash site, two bodies were being carried away…I don’t know if Gen Rawat was among them. We stood a little away as the helicopter exploded. We were scared…,” Ms. Rathna explained. Asked whether Gen. Rawat was seen alive and if he had identified himself to one of the rescuers, Ms. Rathna said she could not identify the Chief of Defence Staff. “Though some are saying that the victims cried for help in Tamil, I don’t think the passengers knew [to speak] Tamil,” she said. The VAO said she had recommended the names of the brave villagers to the authorities concerned for the 2022 Republic Day honours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/chopper-crash-coonoor-vao-recalls-fateful-day/article37982239.ece

18 December 2021||New Delhi,||Elders’ sitting lasted only for 19 minutes||On the persuasion of the Opposition, Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu on Friday held an informal meeting of the ruling party and the Opposition in an attempt to resolve the stalemate over the suspension of 12 House members. But the talks were inconclusive. The meeting, held before the House was convened for the day, was attended by Leader of House Piyush Goyal, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi and his deputy, V. Muraleedharan. Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge and Congress Chief Whip Jairam Ramesh represented the Opposition. Mr. Naidu, according to sources, urged the two sides to work together to end the deadlock. But with both remaining adamant on their stated positions, no solution was forthcoming. The House functioned for 19 minutes. Adjourning the House for the day, Mr. Naidu said, “I had a talk with the Leader of House and also some senior members of the Opposition. I would like to appeal to each one of you to please arrive at some consensus to see to it that the House functions normally. In order to facilitate discussion among yourselves, I am adjourning the House.” Speaking to The Hindu later, Mr. Kharge said, “Conversation cannot happen in the middle of a disorder. Whenever we try to speak of our MPs or raise crucial issues like Lakhimpur Kheri, where protesting farmers were deliberately mowed down, the treasury benches shouts us out. Leader of the House says his piece but we are not given time to rebut him.” Mock Parliament The suspended MPs, together with their other colleagues at the site where they have been staging a sit-in for the last 17-days, held a ‘Jan Sansad’ (mock Parliament). “We don’t have permission to go inside Parliament, so we are organising it outside. Nobody can stop the people’s Parliament,” suspended TMC member Dola Sen said. CPI(M) Elamaram Kareem was the Chairman. Congress MPs Ripun Bora and Akhilesh Prasad Singh were the Leader of House and Parliamentary Affairs Minister respectively. The chair meant for the Prime Minister was kept vacant with Mr. Modi’s mask.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amid-stalemate-rajya-sabha-functions-only-for-19-minutes/article37982227.ece
18 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Helicopters of 3 Services see 15 accidents in last five years||Two Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopters have crash-landed since August last and there were 15 accidents involving helicopters of the three Services in the last five years, the government said in a written reply in Parliament on Friday. Of the 15, there were three accidents involving the M-17V5, including the chopper that crashed last week in Tamil Nadu killing Chief of Defence Staff Gen. Bipin Rawat, his wife and 12 others. Seven accidents each were of the Army and the IAF and one involving the Navy. Since 2008, India has purchased 151 Mi-17V5s in several batches for the IAF, Home Ministry and VVIP transport. These were inducted between 2011 and 2016 and the IAF currently has around 131 Mi-17V5 helicopters in service. Crash into dam On the crash of the Army’s Rudra weaponised Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) in the Ranjeet Sagar dam in which both the pilots were killed, Minister of State for Defence Ajay Bhatt said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha that there was no restriction on the helicopter flying over water. “However, low flying over water needs specific authorisation. A court of Inquiry [CoI] has been ordered to investigate the crash,” the reply stated. Lt. Col. A.S. Bath and Capt. Jayant Joshi lost their lives in the crash on August 03, 2021. To a question if pilots were not given specialised training required to fly over water, Mr. Bhatt stated that the training had been structured to meet the operational requirements. “However, operations over large expanse of water are restricted and generally a fraction of the total overall flying,” the reply said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/15-helicopter-accidents-among-3-services-in-last-five-years/article37982233.ece

He was virtually addressing the All-India Mayors’ Conference in Varanasi. Inaugurating the conference, which was attended by Mayors from across the country as well as Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, Mr. Modi reiterated his earlier statement that development of Varanasi could be the road map of the country. He referred to the recent developments in the city, including the inauguration of the Kashi Vishwanath corridor on Monday. Mr. Modi pointed out that most Indian cities had developed in a traditional way and in the modern era, the antiquity of the cities was equally important.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/destroying-existing-structures-not-the-way-pm-tells-mayors/article37982247.ece
18 December 2021||Mumbai,||Rona Wilson’s phone hacked by Pegasus: forensic report||A report released by U.S. forensic investigation firm Arsenal Consultancy on Friday has revealed that activist Rona Wilson’s cell phone was attacked by the Pegasus spyware 49 different times and was successful in infecting his phone before his arrest on June 6, 2018, for alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence case. Arsenal Consultancy, the Boston-based forensic firm assisting in the case and Amnesty Tech Security Lab, have confirmed Mr. Wilson’s phone was attacked multiple times by the spyware. The report mentions “49 different instances of Pegasus attack and sometimes of successful infection on Mr. Wilson’s iPhone between July 5, 2017 and April 10, 2018. Mr. Wilson’s computer had been hacked by the NetWire Remote Access Trojan (RAT) between June 13, 2016 and April 17, 2018 — covering the same period — to plant incriminating files on his computer. The same had been done to the computer of another accused Surendra Gadling. Arsenal also confirmed that neither Mr. Wilson nor Mr. Gadling had ever opened the incriminating files in question.” Following the report, the People’s Union for Civil Liberties in a statement said: “Simple due diligence after these reports should have compelled the NIA to re-examine the devices of those it has accused of terrible crimes... Ordinary anti-virus software can detect NetWire malware, and Amnesty International Security Lab has documented how to identify Pegasus attacks... If the NIA does not even care to investigate these aspects, how can it claim its actions are legitimate?"||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rona-wilsons-iphone-hacked-by-pegasus-forensic-report/article37982255.ece
18 December 2021||Mumbai,||NIA report on Varavara Rao says his condition is normal||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) submitted a one-page report on 82-year-old Varavara Rao’s medical condition before the Bombay High Court on Friday, stating that he was normal. Mr. Rao, an accused in the Bhima-Koregaon violence case, is currently on medical bail and is residing in Mumbai with his wife. He has urged the court to allow him to return home to Telangana. He was granted interim medical bail for six months on February 22, 2021, and has filed for an extension. NIA counsel Sandesh Patil submitted the medical report to a division bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and S.V. Kotwal. When Senior advocate Anand Grover, representing Mr. Rao, sought reasons for the one-page report, the court interrupted and said the report is from a hospital (Nanavati Hospital) of Mr. Grover’s choice. As per a medical test conducted on September 9, Mr. Rao is suspected to have early stage of Parkinson’s Disease along with other medical ailments. On November 29, the same bench had directed the probe agency to conduct fresh medical tests and submit the reports which do not have medical jargon. The plea goes on to list Mr. Rao’s health condition by saying he takes 13 medicines daily for neurological problems, cholesterol, blood pressure, prostate, acidity, gastroesophageal reflux, constipation, cardiac issues and pain relief. He has also been suffering from constant headaches and needs constant supervision, the plea said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nia-report-on-varavara-rao-says-his-condition-is-normal/article37982257.ece

MPs over ‘rape remark’||In the midst of protests by the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, demanding the sacking of the Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra Teni over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani accused the Opposition of not allowing a debate on nutritional issues related to women and children, and pointed to a controversial remark on rape made by Congress MLA from Karnataka, Ramesh Kumar. As the Lok Sabha convened on Friday morning, Opposition MPs rushed to the Well of the House with placards, and shouted slogans demanding Mr. Mishra’s sacking over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident. Ms. Irani, who was taking questions related to her Ministry during Question Hour at this time, called out Opposition MPs over their protest. She said that they needed to look to their own legislators who made unseemly remarks on women, before speaking of justice for women and children. Mr. Ramesh, a former Speaker of the Karnataka Assembly, on Thursday had made a controversial remark pertaining to rape and women on the floor of that House. The House did not continue for much longer after that and was adjourned for the day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/smriti-irani-flays-cong-mps-over-rape-remark/article37982516.ece

The action has been taken on the basis of a charge-sheet filed against the accused persons by the National Investigation Agency under various provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Arms Act, and the Indian Penal Code. The properties worth Rs. 7.65 crore belong to Alemla Jamir, wife of Phunthing Shimrang (the self-styled former ‘army chief’ of NSCN-IM), her brother-in-law Massasosang Ao, and others. The assets include funds parked in 17 bank accounts, three fixed deposits and a residential property purchased by Ms. Jamir in her name at R.K. Puram in Delhi. According to the ED, the accused persons had created a network for terrorising businessmen and disrupting their operations with the intention to extort money from them. The bank accounts were being operated by Ms. Jamir and her associates under different names for collecting, layering and laundering of the proceeds of the alleged crimes. The funds were also used to give out loans to business entities and charge exorbitant rates of interest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ed-attaches-assets-of-nscn-im-members/article37982515.ece
18 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||VHP hails Saudi Arabia’s ban on Tablighi Jamaat||The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has pressed for a ban on the Tablighi Jamaat. Its working president Alok Kumar called the Jamaat “a manufacturing hub of radical Islamic terror” and “a host and patron of global terrorism.” Saudi Arabia recently banned the Tablighi Jamaat for following new texts not permitted under the Wahabbi way of Islam. In a statement, Mr. Kumar said his organisation welcomed Saudi Arabia’s decision with open hands. He linked the Jamaat to several terror strikes across the world and in India, including the Godhra incident in Gujarat and the murder of Swami Shraddhanand. The Jamaat was in the eye of a storm with regard to COVID-19 protocols in April last year, but no criminal act has been proven against the organisation in this context. The VHP presented a four-part demand to the Centre with regard to the Jamaat: a complete ban on “Tablighis, Tablighi Jamaat and Ijtima” in the country; sealing of the building of Nizamuddin Markaz and bank accounts associated with it; “plug’’ their economic resources; and a crackdown by the authorities on the Deoband and the Popular Front of India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vhp-hails-saudi-arabias-ban-on-tablighi-jamaat/article37982253.ece

18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Avoid non-essential travel, says Centre||More than 100 cases of the Omicron variant of novel coronavirus have been detected across 11 States so far, Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Union Health Ministry, said on Friday, adding that there was “no evidence” to suggest that vaccines were not effective against the variant. Maharashtra has reported 40 Omicron cases — the most in the country. Flagging the rapid spread of the new variant, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) chief Balram Bhargava said at a press conference: “This is the time to avoid non-essential travel, mass gatherings and it is very important to observe low-intensity festivities.” Asked if mRNA vaccines were more effective against the virus, Dr. Bhargava said mRNA vaccines had shown a higher antibody response but a swifter fall, while the vaccines being used in India had indicated a more sustained response. On anti-viral COVID-19 pills, he said: “The pills are under discussion; it has been found that these pills need to be given very early, even before the diagnosis of the disease. Scientific data is still not supported in a big way that the pills will be useful at the moment.” Stating that the Omicron variant is now reported in 91 countries in the world, Mr. Agarwal said: “The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that Omicron is spreading faster than the Delta variant in South Africa where Delta circulation is low,” he said. “It's likely Omicron will outpace the Delta variant where community transmission occurs,” he added. He added that WHO has noted that the overall risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron remains very high for several reasons including risk of potential immune escape against infection and high transmission rates, which could lead to further surges. He added that as per the WHO, Omicron is spreading at a rate not seen with any previous variant. “WHO is concerned that people are dismissing Omicron as mild and has said that the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems,” he said. Vaccine priority India is now administering vaccines at the highest rate in the world and that the daily rate of doses administered is 4.8 times the rate in the U.S. and 12.5 times the rate in the UK, Mr. Agrawal said at a press conference. Mr. Agrawal added that India’s priority is to provide two dose vaccine coverage to the maximum number of people as soon as possible. As per data released by the Health Ministry on Friday the new daily COVID cases reported in the country has been below 10,000 for the past 20 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/omicron-spreading-avoid-unnecessary-travel/article37982218.ece
18 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Opposition cries foul over recent PMO-ECI meeting||A meeting of the Election Commission of India (ECI) with the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) last month that was reported on Friday caused the Opposition to cry foul and question the credibility of the poll body. Congress MP Manish Tewari moved an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha on the matter. He wrote that the summoning of the ECI for a meeting with the principal secretary to the Prime Minister raised “serious questions of propriety and autonomy of the Election Commission”. Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala said in a tweet: “This is atrocious. How can the PMO summon an independent Constitutional authority? One mandated to conduct free and fair elections? Worse how could the EC be so servile & attend?? over ECs neutrality & fairness. (sic)” Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Sitaram Yechury said the “cat was out of the bag”. “...What was whispered till now is a fact. PMO summoning ECI was unheard of in independent India. Treating EC as a subservient tool is yet another low in Modi Govt’s record of destroying every institution. (sic),” he said in a tweet. Former top election officials, too, raised concerns over the ECI meeting with the PMO official in an informal meeting after declining the initial meeting they were asked to attend by the Law Ministry. O.P. Rawat, who served as the CEC (Chief Election Commissioner) in 2018, said that in the past, ministries did not issue such notices to ECI to attend meetings. Rather officials would seek time to meet the commission at the ECI headquarters on various issues. ‘Improper move’ “The ECI did the right thing by reprimanding the officer. It was proper not to attend the meeting. The decision to attend the informal meeting afterwards appears to be incongruous….It will definitely affect the image of the ECI,” said Mr. Rawat. Another former CEC, S.Y. Quraishi, said such a meeting had never happened as far as he remembered. “It is outrageous. It is very cheeky and presumptuous of the official to call the full commission, even if the subject matter is of the election commission’s interest….We don’t know what was discussed. Was it election dates?” he stated. Not only was neutrality of the ECI, a constitutional body, important, “neutrality must be seen to be practised.” CEC Sushil Chandra did not respond to a request for comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/opposition-cries-foul-over-recent-pmo-eci-meeting/article37982219.ece
18 December 2021||NEW DELHi,||IUML opposes move to change age of marriage||The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) on Friday moved a notice for adjournment motion in Parliament opposing the government's proposal to raise the age of marriage for women to 21 years calling it an attempt to encroach on Muslim personal law. “It is learnt that there is a proposal to raise the minimum age of marriage for women from 18 to 21 which was cleared by the Union Cabinet recently. There is every reason to believe that it is also an attempt to encroach on Muslim personal law,” wrote IUML Leader and Rajya Sabha MP Abdul Wahab. AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi also criticised the move. Mr Owaisi posted on Twitter: “This is typical paternalism that we have come to expect from the government. 18-year-old men & women can sign contracts, start businesses, choose Prime Ministers & elect MPs & MLAs but not marry?.” Samajwadi Party’s Shafiqur Rahman Barq said he would also oppose the move. “India is a poor country and everybody wants to marry off their daughter at an early age,” he told reporters. The move also received flak from Left parties with CPM’s women’s wing, the All India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA) calling it a “diversionary tactic” and an “ineffective” way to bring women empowerment. “This move to raise the marriageable age is clearly a diversionary tactic from a government which refuses to allocate adequate resources towards nutritional programs like the ICDS (Integrated Child Development Scheme), education and healthcare. If, as has been noted, the nutritional status of women remains low from birth onwards, getting married at 21 and having a child after that cannot improve the condition,” AIDWA said in a statement. Former chief of the Samata Party Jaya Jaitly, who headed a task-force on whose recommendations the government has based its decision, said her report emphasises that raising the age of marriage should be accompanied by improving access to education, providing vocational training and employment opportunities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/iuml-opposes-move-to-change-age-of-marriage/article37982220.ece

Amarinder had recently quit as chief minister and broken away from the Congress to float a new outfit called the Punjab Lok Congress. Senior sources privy to discussions on the alliance told The Hindu that the BJP hopes that the new alliance, will make the contest four cornered and bring some advantages to the BJP. Seat sharing The Punjab Assembly has a total of 117 seats. The BJP also, very clearly wants to fight an equal number of seats as its ally or even more, playing more a Big Brother role in this alliance, something they could not do with their former ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). One of the oldest alliance partners of the BJP, the SAD broke off from the NDA over the three contentious farm laws since repealed. Under the old arrangement, the BJP used to contest only 23 out of 117 seats with SAD contesting the rest. This time around, the BJP will push for far more seats, even for as many as 70 seats, in the new alliance. The repeal of the three farm laws, BJP leaders say, has given the party some relief in terms of campaigning and moving about and to overcome what was becoming a heavy resentment against the party in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bjp-amarinder-seal-deal-ahead-of-punjab-polls/article37982224.ece

However, the West Bengal Government, through senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, had given an oral assurance to the court to convey a “message of restraint” to the commission. On Friday, Mr. Singhvi, appearing for the State, said the message of restraint had been conveyed to the commission as promised. It had stopped its work till the court had passed orders in October. Mr. Singhvi said the State could not interfere in the working of the commission of inquiry. It was now up to the Supreme Court to pass any formal orders for the commission, he added..

Addressing a rally hosted by BJP ally, the Nishad Party, which claims to be the political voice of the riverine backward castes, Mr. Shah said the previous governments run by the SP and BSP had only worked “for their castes,” in a veiled attack on the Yadav (OBC) and Jatav (Scheduled Caste) core support banks of the two parties, respectively. The Nishad Party and the BJP had entered into an alliance during the 2019 Lok Sabha election.  “Did they work for the Nishad community? Did they work for the other backward castes,” Mr. Shah asked, stressing that only Mr. Modi had worked for all backward castes and the poor providing them cooking gas, toilets, housing facilities, drinking water and health cards. Mr. Shah said it was the Modi government which had provided constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes and formed a separate Ministry for Fisheries and not the Congress, which enjoyed the support of the SP and BSP. He accused the SP and BSP leadership of dividing society on the basis of caste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/only-modi-worked-for-backward-castes-shah/article37982237.ece
18 December 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||19 years on, Odisha man acquitted in murder case||A local court in Odisha’s Mayurbhanj district exonerated a person from a murder case after he underwent close to 19 years of imprisonment. Habil Siddhu was around 40 when he was convicted and imprisoned in murder of three persons, including a child in 2003. Now 59, Siddhu has been exonerated due to lack of concrete evidence to prove his culpability. Siddhu hails from Balarampur village under the Jashipur police station, but used to live in Kudumutu. Two locals, Jamadar Pingua and Tunaram Purty of Kudumutu, were suspecting Siddhu of practising sorcery. On January 1, 2003, Pingua, his two-year-old daughter, and Purty had gone missing. Two days later on January 3, bodies of the three were traced to the Khairi river bank near Jashipur. Siddhu was said to have disclosed his involvement in the crime before a home guard who later alerted the Jashipur police station. In 2005, he was convicted and awarded life imprisonment by a fast track court. The man filed an appeal against the verdict from jail. His case came up for hearing in 2021. Accordingly, Asit Otta was appointed amicus curiae . “The case was based on extra-judicial confession. The investigating officer tried to build a chain of circumstances, but could not find witness to prove the confession,” said Mr. Otta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/odisha-man-acquitted-of-murder-after-19-years/article37982244.ece

18 December 2021||AHMEDABAD,||6 held in Gujarat over State exam paper leak||The Gujarat police have arrested six out of the 10 persons named in the First Information Report for their alleged involvement in leaking the question paper of an examination held recently in the State for the recruitment of government head clerks. The written exam for the recruitment of 186 head clerks was held at different centres across the State on December 12 in which as many as 88,000 aspirants appeared for the test conducted by the Gujarat Subordinate Services Selection Board (GSSSB). Former Ahmedabad Mayor and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Asit Vora is the Chairman of the GSSSB. The FIR was lodged by the police after the State government initially dismissed allegations of the paper’s leak from a centre in north Gujarat. Immediately after the exam began, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had claimed that the question paper was leaked prior to the exam, and the question and answer sheets were exchanged through WhatsApp. The accused have been booked under IPC Sections 420, 409 and 120-B. The leak has triggered a massive controversy in Gujarat slamming the State government for large-scale cheating in various recruitment exams.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/6-held-in-gujarat-over-state-exam-paper-leak/article37982251.ece

18 December 2021||Belagavi,TAMIL NADU||Federation opposes anti-conversion Bill||The Federation of Indian Christians, which held a protest against the proposed anti-conversion Bill at Belagavi on Friday, said the community would explore legal options if the Karnataka government pushed ahead with the law. Harry Dsouza, a community leader, suggested a systematic study of the issue of conversions and see whether the problem is indeed prevalent in the State, before arriving at such laws with stringent clauses. “Does the government have village, taluk or district-wise data on the quantum of conversions? Does the government have reasons to believe that these conversions are being done forcefully? Or is it just a political move? These questions need to be answered,” he said. Bishop Derek Fernandes feared that the contemplated law was aimed at targetting hapless Christians and their institutions. He pointed out to the rising number of attacks on minorities and reasoned that these were being “orchestrated to create an environment to bring in such laws.” He said an anti-conversion law was unnecessary. Siddaramaiah’s charge Meanwhile, senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah accused the ruling BJP in Karnataka of trying to divert the attention of the people from real issues by bringing in emotive ones like “Love Jihad, Anti Conversion” to implement its “hidden agenda”. The Leader of the Opposition said his party would not allow the anti-conversion Bill to be passed.

18 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Three more check dams proposed across Cooum||With the Cooum, which has been in full flow in the unpolluted portion this monsoon, filling up most of the tanks in Tiruvallur district, the Water Resources Department has drawn up plans to build more check dams. Abundant rain in November helped sustain flow in the Cooum. The river continues to get inflow from the Kosasthalaiyar and Kesavaram check dam upstream despite the rainfall receding in the last few days. Water from the Poondi reservoir is being diverted into the Cooum. Officials said the check dam at Pudhumavilangai, which is located 12 km downstream of Kesavaram, has improved storage in four tanks at Agaram, Kadambathur, Kasavanallathur and Egattur. Besides storing about eight million cubic feet (mcft) of water in the check dam, floodwater is diverted to the tanks. Proposals submitted As there is scope for storing more water, the department has proposed to build check dams in three more locations at Perambakkam, Adigathur and Sorancheri and restore dilapidated structure in Aranvoyal. The project for 85-metre check dam at Perambakkam and the 100-metre structure at Sorancheri have been submitted to the State government. The cost for the two storage structures was estimated to be Rs. 12.6 crore. Both the check dams are expected to boost water table and feed at least two tanks each. The proposal to construct check dam at Adigathur across the 200-metre wide river and store 15 mcft of water is under study. The British-era Korattur anicut, which was recently reconstructed, overflowed last month and discharged about 500 cusecs of water on Friday. A minimum of 130 mcft of water will be stored in the existing five check dams across the unpolluted portion of the river. The flow in the river till the Napier bridge had helped flush the stagnant sewage in the urban stretch. Steps were taken to tap the potential of the river in feeding more tanks, said the officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/three-more-check-dams-proposed-across-cooum/article37982621.ece

18 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Women to get more alerts during pregnancy and post childbirth||From now, 25 SMS alerts starting with antenatal care to child immunisation will be sent for the benefit of pregnant women and children in the State. All pregnant women registered in the Pregnancy and Infant Cohort Monitoring and Evaluation (PICME) System will be covered under this SMS-based vaccination reminder service. Health Minister Ma. Subramanian launched the service on Friday. According to a press release, the Universal Immunisation Programme was being implemented in the State since 1985. Every year, around 10.11 lakh pregnant women and 9.23 lakh children benefited from the programme. Through this, children were protected from 12 vaccine preventable diseases. As per the State’s Health Management Information System report, 95% of children have received all vaccines, while the National Family Health Survey-5 put the child immunisation coverage at 89.2%. The State Government was taking steps to achieve 100% immunisation by improving maternal and child health services. As a part of this, a scheme to create awareness among mothers on the importance of vaccination by sending them reminders on timely vaccination, pre- and post-childbirth and neonatal care was planned. In continuation of this, the Government announced that vaccination reminders would be increased from seven to 25 SMS alerts. All women registered in the PICME System would benefit under this scheme. They would continue receiving the reminders till the entire vaccination schedule for the pregnant women and children is completed. The State would spend Rs. 22 lakh every year for the scheme, the release said. The alerts would start with the registration of pregnancy (within the first 12 weeks) and go on to remind for antenatal check-ups for the 16th, 20th, 26th, 30th and 34th weeks followed by alerts for the third trimester. Alerts on the bank deposits made for the financial assistance under the Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy Maternity Benefit Scheme would also be sent. After childbirth, alerts including for vaccinations scheduled for the 6th, 10th and 14th weeks and 10th and 16th months would be sent. Among others, Directors R. Narayana Babu (Medical Education), T.S. Selvavinayagam (Public Health and Preventive Medicine) and S. Gurunathan (Medical and Rural Health Services) were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/women-to-get-more-alerts-during-pregnancy-and-post-childbirth/article37982634.ece
18 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Cyber Crime Wing unearths fraudulent gaming portals||The Cyber Crime Wing of the Tamil Nadu police unearthed a network of fraudulent online gaming portals run by a group of engineers who are suspected to have bilked people out of Rs. 10 crore. Russian operators had paid the group in cryptocurrency. In October, the Kallakurichi police arrested Manikandan, 26, considered to be one of the operators of these portals. Then the police arrested eight more engineering graduates. The arrests followed the detection of high-volume bank transactions. Amresh Pujari, Additional Director-General of Police, Cyber Crime Wing, ordered a special team, led by Superintendent of Police M.R. Sibi Chakravarthy, to conduct a thorough investigation. The team conducted raids at Pammal, Sankar Nagar and Ambattur and arrested Sasikumar, Saikumar, Raj Kumar, Rajesh Kumar and Mohammed Asif, all engineering graduates aged 24-26. Laptops, desktops, mobile phones, ATM cards, pen drives, SIM cards and a car were seized from them. Mr. Sibi Chakravarthy told The Hindu , “The accused are suspected to be the agents of Russian operators, and they were communicating through e-mail. They used the software supplied by them. The gang had programmed the application so that even the winner/loser could be decided by them; after bets were placed and payments were made, the accused made sure the customers lost all the money. The gang was making huge profits.” They engaged some persons for a few thousand rupees to get SIM cards and deposited the money in fictitious bank accounts. The initial investigation showed they had transacted with the foreign operators through cryptocurrency, Mr. Sibi Chakravarthy said. The police will alert the Enforcement Directorate and the Income Tax Department to this network. Steps are being taken to freeze the online websites used for gaming. The Cyber Crime Wing has requested people to avoid online gaming and asked the victims to report through cyber crime helpline 155260.

18 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘If Bar becomes corrupt, Bench will collapse’||“If the Bar, which is the source for the Bench, becomes criminalised and corrupt, the Bench will get only bad apples. That will be the last nail in the coffin of democracy. There is no point in ruing thereafter that the judiciary has collapsed,” the Madras High Court observed on Friday after expressing deep concern over 263 criminal cases having been booked against advocates between January and April this year. Justices P.N. Prakash and R. Hemalatha made the observations while finding lawyer R. Krishnamurthy guilty of contempt of court. The advocate had circulated an audio message on WhatsApp threatening Justice M. Dhandapani for having condemned the way in which a woman lawyer and her daughter, a law student, had behaved rudely with the police when they were questioned for roaming around in Chennai during COVID-19 lockdown. “All judges, right from a Magistrate to judges of the Supreme Court, including us, have come from the Bar and have not descended from the heavens nor have been imported from other countries. We are, therefore, grateful to the institution called the Bar, which has catapulted us to various judicial offices. We look upon the Bar as an independent and fearless body that would protect the judiciary when the judiciary is vilified and targeted by others,” the Bench wrote. “However, when we come across members of the Bar getting involved in unsavoury incidents, our paternal instinct is bound to make us exhibit our anguish and concern publicly. Statistics show that 263 criminal cases have been registered against advocates in the State between January and April, 2021. It is also unfortunate that Bar leaders tend to play God by readily going to the rescue of errant advocates who involve themselves in breaking the institution from inside,” it added. Observing that the contemnor does not deserve mercy for his conduct unbecoming of a lawyer, the Bench wrote: “If the respondent had not been an advocate, then, we could be sympathetic to some extent. We usually extend the longest of our olive branches to disgruntled litigants who attack judges off and on... To be noted, advocates may be proximate to Judges, but, that does not lead to the inference that they are proximate to justice.” The judges found him guilty of having scandalised the court by stating in the video that he had sent a representation to the Chief Justice with a request to shift the hearing of an anticipatory bail petition filed by the woman lawyer and her daughter from Justice Dhandapani to some other “honest and honourable” judge. They also found him guilty of having interfered with administration of justice and imposed a fine of Rs. 2,000 for each of the two charges. In default, he was ordered to undergo simple imprisonment for one week for each default. They also ordered that the lawyer should not practice in the High Court for a period of one year and marked a copy of their order to the Bar Council of Kerala, where he had got enrolled himself, and also to the Supreme Court Bar Association for taking appropriate action in accordance with law since he had also claimed to be practising in the Supreme Court too.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/if-bar-becomes-corrupt-bench-will-collapse/article37982643.ece

18 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Man from West Bengal undergoes surgery in both ears simultaneously||Doctors at MGM Healthcare here have performed a complex surgery on both the ears to treat a man, 69, suffering from tinnitus, a condition that caused a patient to experience constant noise in one or both the ears. While performing the surgery in one ear at a time has been done earlier, operating both the ears for the condition at the same time was rare, the doctors said. In this case, the patient, who hailed from West Bengal, was hearing a ringing noise in both his ears for the past five years. His son said that the condition, which resulted in many problems including sleeplessness, affected his father physically and mentally. K. Sridhar, director and group head, Institute of Neurosciences and Spinal Disorders, MGM Healthcare, who headed the surgical team, said an MRI showed that the patient’s blood vessels were in close contact with the hearing nerves. The blood vessels were compressing the hearing nerves, resulting in tinnitus, he said. While tinnitus could be caused due to a variety of reasons including tumours or psychological conditions, Dr. Sridhar stressed that it was important to rule out all other causes. A unique case He said that this was a case of “intractable tinnitus” and it needed a microvascular decompression of the cochlea-vestibular nerve complex to decongest the blood vessel and the hearing nerves. He highlighted that what was unique in this case was that the surgery was performed bilaterally on both the ears. He said that the role of the anaesthesia team, headed by V. Ponniah, was crucial as the patient was a senior citizen and the surgery went on for 10 hours. Dr. Sridhar said the ringing noise significantly came down soon after the surgery. “It takes a couple of months after the surgery for the condition to be cured fully. The delay is attributed to the “memory” of the sound that remains ingrained in the neural pathway,” he said.  While performing the surgery in one ear at a time has been done earlier, operating both the ears for the condition at the same time was rare. In this case, the patient was hearing a ringing noise in both his ears for the past five years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-from-west-bengal-undergoes-surgery-in-both-ears-simultaneously/article37982629.ece

Started on December 17, 1914, the heritage structure stands testimony to evolution of Chennai’s water supply infrastructure and challenges such as droughts faced by the city. In the 43 years since Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board was started, the quantity of water supply has touched 1,000 million litres a day for the first time this year. Organised supply system A press release said initially, James Fraser, a civil engineer, brought in organised water supply system in 1872 by tapping Kosasthalaiyar river, saving it in Cholavaram and Red Hills reservoirs. The water was transported through an earthen channel to a masonry shaft in Kilpauk and water was then conveyed to George Town and central Chennai through iron pipes. In 1914, J.W. Madley, the then special engineer to the Corporation of Madras, launched scientifically-designed treated water supply infrastructure that is still in use. This included construction of covered underground conduit lines from Red Hills to Kilpauk and several improvements were carried out after 1954. At present, about 270 mld is treated and distributed from the Kilpauk Water Works to nearly 25 lakh people in areas such as Perambur, Ayanavaram, Purasawalkam, Anna Nagar, Triplicane and Alwarpet.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kilpauk-water-works-quenching-the-citys-thirst-for-108-years/article37982619.ece
18 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC directs CBI to bring back two South Korean fugitives suspected to have fled the country||After being told by the Chengalpattu police that two South Koreans facing a GST evasion case here may have escaped to their country though the Indo-Myanmar border from Imphal in Manipur, the Madras High Court has directed the CBI to bring back the fugitives. Justices P.N. Prakash and R. Hemalatha felt the CBI would be the appropriate agency to investigate the issue since it had international ramifications. The court wanted the matter to be probed from all angles, including the possible involvement of local police and staff of the South Korean Embassy in Chennai. The judges noted that Choi Yong Suk and Choe Jae Won were the managing director and general manager, respectively, of Chowel India Private Limited, a car components manufacturing company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act of 1956. The unit was located in the Sriperumbudur Industrial Estate. The company was accused of having collected over Rs. 40 crore towards GST but failing to remit the money to the government. The duo was arrested by the GST authorities on June 24, 2019 and granted default bail by an Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate at Egmore, Chennai, on November 19, 2019. Subsequently, they were lodged in a special camp for foreigners in Tiruchi, and hence, they had moved two habeas corpus petitions in the High Court in 2019, challenging their detention at the camp. They also filed two writ petitions in 2020, seeking permission to leave the camp since they feared contracting COVID-19. The High Court dismissed the writ petitions on April 9, 2020. However, on appeal, the Supreme Court, on June 16, 2020, permitted them to reside at a posh, high-rise apartment, taken on lease by the duo at Oragadam in Chengalpattu district, and directed the local police to provide security there at the cost of the accused. Fabricated documents In October this year, the State police received intelligence that the duo had planned their escape with the help of locals, and had fabricated certain documents such as Aadhaar cards and passports, since their original passports were handed over to the GST authorities at the time of their arrest in 2019. On obtaining the intelligence report, the Palur police in Chengalpattu registered a case of cheating and forgery against the duo on October 11. “However, the police did not arrest the petitioners for reasons best known to them,” Justice Prakash wrote in his interim order on the habeas corpus petitions. Though the petitioners preferred anticipatory bail petitions in the forgery case, the High Court dismissed their plea on October 26. Thereafter, they moved the Supreme Court seeking advance bail and, on October 29, obtained an order restraining the police from arresting them. Between October 29 and 30, the petitioners escaped from their residence. The Palur police registered one more FIR against the duo and began to look for them. Inquiries revealed that the petitioners had reached Imphal. The police suspected that they may have crossed the Indo-Myanmar border and then escaped to their country. It was also suspected that some officials at the South Korean Embassy may have facilitated their escape by giving them fake passports. Therefore, the judges directed the CBI to take up the investigation since it was the nodal agency for the extradition of fugitives from other countries, and file a status report before the court on January 25.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-directs-cbi-to-bring-back-two-south-korean-fugitives-suspected-to-have-fled-the-country/article37982650.ece
18 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK government declares Tamil Thai Vaazhthu the State song||The Tamil Nadu Government on Friday declared the Tamil Thai Vaazhthu, penned by ‘Manonmaniam ’ Sundaranar, the State song of Tamil Nadu. Everyone except the differently abled should rise when the song is sung at educational institutions, government offices and public functions. The announcement came days after Justice G.R. Swaminathan of the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court observed that Tamil Thai Vaazhthu was a prayer song and not an anthem, and there was no statutory order requiring attendees to stand up when it was being sung. According to an official release, the song should compulsorily be sung at the beginning of events organised by all educational institutions, government offices and public sector undertakings. ‘Avoid recordings’ At public functions, the playing of the song with musical instruments/recordings is to be avoided, and trained singers should sing it. Since private players could play a major role in taking the richness of Tamil to the younger generation, they would be encouraged to sing the song, the release said. A part of the verses under the title ‘ Tamil Dheiva Vanakkam ’ from ‘ Manonmaniam’, penned by ‘ Manonmaniam ’  Sundaranar and published in 1891, eventually came to be known as the Tamil Thai Vaazhthu . In 1913, the annual report of the Karanthai Tamil Sangam made the demand for singing the song at all functions. The Tamil Thai Vaazhthu is being sung at Karanthai Tamil Sangam since 1914. It is also being sung at all Tamil Sangams associated with the Karanthai Tamil Sangam. The Karanthai Tamil Sangam had appealed to the then Chief Minister, C.N. Annadurai, to declare Tamil Thai Vaazhthu the State song. On March 11, 1970, the then Chief Minister, M. Karunanidhi announced that the song  would be sung at the events of the Tamil Nadu Government. While so, “in the situation demanding a standard operating procedure for singing the Tamil Thai Vaazhthu ”, the Tamil Development Department recently issued a directive against playing the recordings of the song, adding that trained singers should sing it. In a statement, BJP State president K. Annamalai asked the government to use the Tamizh Thai Vaazthu fully, not just the abridged version. He said Chief Minister M.K. Stalin must stay true to the oath of office he had taken and should not bring in his personal interests or disinterests and must ensure that the full song, with the lines on belief in god, were included in the song.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-thai-vaazhthu-declared-tn-state-song/article37982594.ece
18 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Jayakanthan’s children make an appeal to Kamal||The children of Tamil novelist and recipient of Jnanpith Award late D. Jayakanthan have made an open appeal to actor Kamal Haasan to change the title, Sila Nerangalil Sila Manithargal, of an upcoming film he has been promoting.  Sila Nerangalil Sila Manithargal is their father’s literary work that fetched him the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1972, his children J. Kadhambari, J. Jayasimhan and J. Deepalakshmi said in an open letter to Mr. Kamal Haasan. In the 1970s, the story was made into a Tamil feature film under the same title.

18 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC refuses advance bail to Rajenthra Bhalaji||The Madras High Court dismissed anticipatory bail petitions filed by former Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji in two cases filed against him for having allegedly cheated government job aspirants after receiving huge amounts of money from them. Justice M. Nirmal Kumar refused to grant the relief after the State Public Prosecutor, Hasan Mohammed Jinnah, said the inquiry was in the preliminary stage, and the police had recorded the statements of several people who claimed to have given over Rs. 3 crore through multiple sources to secure government jobs. The court was told that the first complaint was lodged on November 15 by S. Ravindran, the owner of an electronics shop, who had reportedly met the then Minister in October 2020 and given Rs. 30 lakh to his close associate Vijaya Nallathambi to secure the post of Aavin District Manager for his nephew. Though it was argued on behalf of the former Minister that Mr. Nallathambi was a person known for shifting loyalties from one political party to another, and was not reliable, the judge said that though the prime accused appeared to be involved in job racketeering since 2015, the second accused (former Minister) had approved his misdeeds by remaining passive. “In this process, innocent persons lost their money and future, which cannot be ignored,” he said, and directed the police to prioritise the case. As for the second complaint, lodged against the former Minister by Mr. Nallathambi, the judge said the allegation was that he had collected over Rs. 3 crore from various persons for securing them jobs and given the money to the then Minister and his personal assistants. Though the former Minister accused Mr. Nallathambi of having lodged a false complaint to escape from the first complaint, the judge said the advance bail petitioner could not be heard to take such defence after having had a close association with a person who had a dubious record of cheating job aspirants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-refuses-advance-bail-to-rajenthra-bhalaji/article37982651.ece

18 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Will seek Centre’s nod for 7-day home quarantine of all international travellers’||Tamil Nadu will seek permission from the Union Government to introduce a seven-day home quarantine for all international travellers, including those arriving from non-risk countries, Health Minister Ma. Subramanian said. Currently, all travellers from 12 countries deemed at-risk are subjected to RT-PCR tests at the international airports in the State. Two per cent of travellers from non-risk countries are randomly tested as per existing guidelines. The move to seek seven-day home quarantine came after travellers from non-risk countries such as Nigeria and Congo tested positive for COVID-19 on being randomly tested on arrival, and an analysis of the samples lifted from them and their COVID-positive contacts found S-gene dropout, a marker for the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. As of now, Tamil Nadu has one confirmed case of the Omicron variant in a 47-year-old man, who had travelled from Nigeria to Chennai via Doha. “Nigeria and Congo are not on the list of countries deemed at-risk. But travellers from the two countries were found to have been infected during random testing. So, we will be writing to the Union Government to permit us to bring in an advisory for seven-day home quarantine for all international travellers, including those from non-risk countries, arriving at Chennai, Madurai, Tiruchi or Coimbatore international airports. They would be allowed to move out only if they test negative for COVID-19 after seven days. This is because the transmission of infection is rapid. It has already spread in more than 10 States in the country,” the Minister told reporters on Friday. ‘Continuous monitoring’ The Minister added that if the Union Government permitted the State to bring in seven-day home quarantine for all travellers, they would be continuously monitored and measures would be taken to bring them under institutional quarantine in case they violated the rules. In the last two weeks, a total of 12,767 travellers from at-risk countries were tested at the international airports in the State. As many as 73,795 travellers had arrived from non-risk countries, of whom 2,101 were tested randomly. “So, in the last two weeks, a total of 14,868 persons were tested. Of them, 70 tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to hospitals. On re-test, five of them tested negative and were discharged. As of now, 65 people are admitted to various government hospitals in the State,” he said. On analysing their samples, S-gene dropout was observed in 28 samples. “All 28 of them were already in hospital isolation. They had mild symptoms of body pain, cold and fever, and none of them required oxygen support or intensive care,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/will-seek-centres-nod-for-7-day-home-quarantine-of-all-international-travellers/article37982644.ece
18 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Display contact details of Food Safety officials outside shops, says HC||The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the Food Safety Commissioner to ensure that WhatsApp complaint numbers, phone numbers and e-mail IDs of the officials concerned were displayed prominently outside every restaurant, eatery, provision store and other establishments dealing with food items. Justice S.M. Subramaniam ordered that time limits should be prescribed for officials to take action against complaints received from the consumers and they must be instructed to initiate prosecution against the offenders. Officers who fail to take prompt action on the complaints must be subjected to disciplinary proceedings. The Commissioner was also directed to create awareness among the people regarding the ill consequences of consuming adulterated food and their right to lodge complaints with the food safety officials. The directions were issued while rejecting a plea made by a dhania (coriander) trader. The trader had approached the court against action initiated against him for selling adulterated dhania, which was found to contain chemicals above the prescribed limits. Shocked over adulteration in an essential ingredient of Indian cuisine, the judge called for data regarding prosecution initiated for food adulteration. He found that the officials only make random inspection, and there was no mechanism in place for consumers to access phone numbers of officers and lodge complaints immediately. Therefore, he ordered that the complaint mechanism should be made effective and promoted widely.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/display-contact-details-of-food-safety-officials-outside-shops-says-hc/article37982635.ece

18 December 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Residents want Chettipalayam Road repaired at the earliest||As road users exit the Podanur bridge onto Chettipalayam Road, visibility of how far ahead are vehicles gets drastically reduced. The reduction in visibility is not because of fog, but the dust that gets kicked up off the road surface, complains G. Nandakumar, a resident of Sriram Nagar. He says right from the Chettipalayam end of the bridge to the Vellalore dump yard entrance, the condition is the same. The dust is from that patch of the road abutting the divider where the State Highways Department has filled wet mix macadam to level the surface after the Coimbatore Corporation dug the road to lay underground sewer line. On the other side of the road the condition is no different. The wet mix macadam and earth used to fill trenches dug across the road at several places to lay sewer line causes as much disturbance as on the other side, Mr. Nandakumar adds. On days without rain it is the dust and on rainy days it is water stagnation that trouble not only road users but also those who live on the Chettipalayam Road, rues A. Devi Priyadharshini, a resident of Eswar Nagar. The Chettipalayam Road has been in such a bad condition for the last six months or so. And, during the period, children in families living on the road have developed breathing problems because of the dust. Several such families are frequently calling on doctor, she says. For any road user passing through the Chettipalayam Road, a few minutes’ stoppage for a cup of tea or photocopying will reveal the extent of dust that rises of the road if they look at their seat or vehicle surface on return, she adds. Sources in the Coimbatore Corporation say the Highways Department levelled the road with wet mix macadam after it gave Rs. 1 crore for road restoration after completing a sewer line work. The civic body was hopeful that the Department will soon start the work to bitumen top the Road. The Department sources say the engineers will look into the residents’ complaint and resume watering the patch with wet mix macadam to prevent dust from flying around. As for road restoration, the Department will not wait for the Corporation to complete paying the remaining Rs. 1.1 crore and go ahead. And, the Department will complete the work before Pongal 2022.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-want-chettipalayam-road-repaired-at-the-earliest/article37982676.ece
18 December 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Foul odour from Vellalore dump yard returns to torment residents||It is that time of the year when residents in Podanur and areas west of the Coimbatore Corporation’s dump yard in Vellalore keep their doors and windows shut. For, wind blowing from east to west carries the foul odour from the yard into their houses. For the last 20 days, the odour is unbearable even though they have shut their windows and doors. And, they are forced to live with it until January 15 or so as the Corporation seems to be doing very little to control either the odour or flies. The odour travels as far as Echanari, complains K.S. Mohan, a Vellalore resident and an activist fighting for better environment in the area. Sriram Nagar resident S. Savithri Ganesan says the problem has returned this year as it has every year since the Corporation started dumping the city’s waste in Vellalore. No resident escapes the odour and everybody has one health problem or the other. R. Santhi, a Podanur resident, says she has just returned after visiting doctor for breathing difficulty. In the 10 years, the residents suffer from skin problems, digestion problems and many more, she says and adds that the doctors in the locality attribute the health issues to the odour from the dump yard. Besides, the residents also have to live with fly and mosquito menace. It has been a long time since the Corporation deployed conservancy workers to carry out fogging, says Ms. Ganesan. The Corporation officials say the civic body has started processing the accumulated waste through the bio-mining process. Very soon, the Corporation will be able to solve the odour issue. Mr. Mohan contradicts the Corporation saying the bio-mining process is only to process the accumulated waste. The Corporation is not talking about the waste that it keeps dumping every day. So, the residents will continue to face the odour issue this time of the year, every year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/foul-odour-from-vellalore-dump-yard-returns-to-torment-residents/article37982663.ece

According to the police, Muthukumar (44), a construction worker, was known to the family of the 14-year-old girl. Police said he had confessed to committing penetrative sexual assault on the girl and murdering her, after which he stuffed the body in a plastic sack and threw it into thorny bushes, about 150 m from his residence. The accused also allegedly broke into the residence of the girl and stole jewellery following the murder. The All-Women Police – Coimbatore East booked Muthukumar under Sections 5(n) (whoever being a relative of the child through blood or adoption or marriage or guardianship or in foster care or having a domestic relationship with a parent of the child or who is living in the same or shared household with the child, commits penetrative sexual assault on such child) read with Section 6 (Punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, along with Sections 302 (Punishment for murder), 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of offence) and 380 (Theft in dwelling house, etc.) of the Indian Penal Code. He was remanded in judicial custody. Addressing mediapersons at the Office of the Commissioner of Police, Deputy Commissioner of Police E.S. Uma said the accused committed the murder to falsely claim to the mother that the girl took the jewellery and eloped with someone. The police recovered jewellery weighing 4.25 sovereigns from the accused following the arrest, she said. The deceased's mother, who visited the Office of the Commissioner of Police on Friday, told mediapersons that the accused allegedly borrowed jewellery weighing 2.5 sovereigns from her and did not return it. Following this, Muthukumar allegedly called the girl to his house, which was close to her residence, claiming that he would return the jewellery. However, he murdered her and threw her body in the bushes, after which he allegedly broke into her residence and stole jewellery weighing 1.75 sovereigns, the mother alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/man-held-for-sexual-assault-murder-of-schoolgirl-in-coimbatore/article37982638.ece

Velumani here on Friday. He led the demonstration organised by the AIADMK outside the Coimbatore South Taluk office as part of the State-wide agitations condemning the DMK government for not fulfilling its poll promises.

Mr. Velumani claimed that the reason for the delay was the electoral defeat faced by the DMK in Coimbatore district during the Assembly elections. Accusing the DMK government as being “against people,” he condemned the Ministers for blaming the previous AIADMK regime for the government's shortcomings. Giving the example of the recent floods in Chennai, Mr. Velumani alleged that the present government failed to desilt the storm water drains in August and October.

A. Sengottaiyan and K. C. Karuppannan staged a protest in Erode on Friday. Speakers said that the DMK had in its election manifesto assured to reduce value added taxes (VAT) on petrol and diesel after coming to power. “But even after six months, it failed to reduce VAT which the Central government did last month”, they said. Speakers said that farmers were affected due to the flood and the government failed to provide them adequate compensation. Also, to ensure that people celebrate the Pongal festival, the government should immediately provide gift hampers to all, they added. Addressing the media, Mr. Sengottaiyan said that the DMK should announce in the Assembly whether the NEET exam will be conducted or not. He said that the DMK failed to concentrate on the people’s problem and their welfare and termed the government as a failure one in the last six months.

Basha said that concessions provided to senior citizens were stopped from March 23, 2020 due to the pandemic. While men above 60 years were given a concession of 40% concession in all classes, women above 58 were given 50% concession. “It is causing immense hardship to them and the railways should immediately restore concessions”, the letter said. The letter said that passenger trains that were stopped due to the pandemic are yet to be operated. Since rail fare is low when compared to bus fare, many prefer trains for commuting. Hence, passenger trains that pass through Erode to Coimbatore, Salem, Nagercoil and Tirunelveli should be operated at the earliest. The letter also said that unreserved coaches were attached to only too few selective trains and wanted it to be done for all trains. Also, about 150 trains pass through the Erode Railway Junction everyday. But, the four platforms are insufficient, forcing many trains to wait outside the junction. Hence, there is an urgent need for establishing a fifth platform, the letter said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cong-for-resumption-of-senior-citizen-quota-in-trains/article37982742.ece

18 December 2021||KALPETTA,TAMIL NADU||Locals edgy as tiger remains elusive||Local residents have become restive with the Forest department’s efforts to capture the elusive tiger in Wayanad yet to succeed. Despite intensive efforts, the tiger that is keeping Kurukkanmoola residents on their toes remained elusive for the 17th day on Friday. Some villagers sighted the animal at Puthiyedam, near Payyampally, in the Mananthavady municipal limits on Thursday night and launched a search operation in vain. An altercation ensued between forest officials and villagers when the former reached the spot around 7.30 a.m. Villagers’ charge The absence of senior officials to supervise the operation to immobilise the big cat at night provoked the mob. The public complained that some officials attacked a group of villagers, including Mananthavady councillor Vipin Venugopal. A visual of a front-line forest staff taking a dagger from the sheath during the scuffle went viral on social media. His colleague was seen trying to deter him. The search for the tiger was intensified in plantations, forest, and bushes with the support of officers drawn from Kannur and Kozhikode and the ‘kumki’ squad. However, the efforts were in vain as the team could not spot the tiger even by late evening. More options “We are planning to make a call playback, playing a recorded mating call of tigers, to attract the elusive tiger to the cage to trap the animal in the evening,” D.K. Vinod Kumar, Chief Conservator of Forests, Northern Circle, Kannur, said. “We have also ordered a thermal unmanned aerial vehicle to monitor the movements of the animal during night hours. We are also planning to hire volunteers from local people to help forest personnel in the operations,” he said. The carnivore has reportedly killed 16 domestic animals at Kurukkanmoola and adjacent areas in the Begur range under the North Wayanad Forest Division in a fortnight. Task force in place Meanwhile, Forest Minister A.K. Saseendran called for the support of the public in the combing operations to capture the tiger. A task force, consisting of 233 officials, supervised by the Chief Conservator of Forest (Northern Circle), has been on duty apart from 125 forest personnel deployed for patrolling, Mr.Saseendran said. He said 36 surveillance cameras had been installed in the area to monitor the movement of the predator and five cages set up to trap the animal. Three drones were also being used for monitoring the movement of the tiger. “Chief Wildlife Warden Bennichen Thomas would assess the situation after visiting the site on Friday and measures would be adopted as per his report,” the Minister said adding adequate compensation would be provided to farmers who had lost their cattle after getting post-mortem examination reports. The Kerala High Court assessed the situation through videoconferencing. The department would inquire into the issues related to the scuffle between some forest officials and villagers, the Minister said. Meanwhile, the district administration has made two executive magistrates in charge of law and order in the Mananthavady municipality and the Payyampally and Manathavady village limits in the wake of the tense situation there. They are Mananthavady tahsildar Jose Paul Chittilappally (9447097704) and Mananthavady tahsildar (Land Records) M.J.

18 December 2021||Kochi,TAMIL NADU||Conduct proper probe into Monson cases: HC||The Kerala High Court on Friday directed the Crime Branch to take forward the investigation in the cases against fake antiquities dealer Monson Mavunkal without any error. Justice Devan Ramachandran observed that “Prima facie, therefore, the reach of 5th respondent (Monson) — particularly when there are indications of persons outside India also being involved — cannot be taken lightly and that a proper investigation without any error will have to be taken forward and completed”. The court made it clear that the intent of the court was to ensure that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) worked in conjunction with the Crime Branch when the investigation into the crime was on. The ED sought more time to place on record the details of its investigation against Monson. The court gave the State Police liberty to conduct necessary investigations into a Facebook post of former judicial officer S. Sudeep criticising the judge for impleading the SPC and the Enforcement Director in the case and file a report. The court said that he seemed to be harbouring certain notions about the manner in which the court had to act and the limits of the court’s jurisdiction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/conduct-proper-probe-in-monson-cases-hc/article37982262.ece
18 December 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘DMK govt. has done nothing for people’||Charging that the DMK government had done nothing to the people since it assumed office, the AIADMK leaders in Madurai alleged that the DMK was synonymous with failures. The AIADMK MLA and former Revenue Minister R.B. Udayakumar, who was addressing a meeting at Vadipatti, said that right from the beginning, the mechanism in the Secretariat administration had failed. First, the floods exposed the lack of coordination among officials. Now, poor surveillance led to Omicron variant surfacing. Despite the alerts and cautionary messages from the Centre, the State government had not taken steps to screen the passengers arriving from countries marked as ‘risk’. After letting them off, the officials were chasing the first contacts of the passengers. The people were running a very high risk due to the nonchalant attitude of the government, he charged. While electioneering, the DMK claimed that it would scrap the NEET. Neither it had scrapped it nor allowed it. Ultimately, the students were put to untold hardships, he said. Likewise, the DMK and its allies made tall promises that they would release the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. Seven months had gone since the party assumed office but nothing had been done, the former Minister said. Former Minister and Madurai West MLA Sellur K Raju, who led the agitation in Madurai city, said that only in Tamil Nadu, the government had not reduced the taxes imposed on fuel, while most of the States in the country had reduced them. The price of tomatoes and other common variety vegetables had touched a new high. It was a shame on the part of the rulers to remain a mute spectator. By passing the burden on the common man, the government’s inability had been exposed. When AIADMK was in power, it had earmarked funds and through Cooperative Department, vegetables were sold at subsidised price thus giving relief to end consumers, Mr Raju said. Senior leader and Tiruparankundram AIADMK MLA V V Rajan Chellappa, who led an agitation at Othakadai, said that though the CM had toured districts, the people had not got any relief as the official machinery had failed. Apart from the skyrocketing prices of essential goods, the people paid fancy price for building materials. Whenever the DMK came to power, the cement price got inflated. The people should wake up and examine the reasons as only in Tamil Nadu, the prices were jacked up. Along with the 2024 election to the Parliament, the people would vote out the DMK too, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-govt-has-done-nothing-for-people/article37982917.ece

Jayaraj and his son J. Benicks. Retrieval of data Justice K. Murali Shankar took into account the fact that certain case properties remanded in the case had been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, for examination for retrieval of data, including deleted ones. The report was yet to be received and the authorities were addressed to give it top priority, it was said. The High Court was told that out of the 105 witnesses, 20 witnesses had been examined. Taking note of the fact that the trial court had sought five more months to complete, the High Court gave the time and disposed. Status sought The High Court had sought the status and the time required to complete the trial in the case. In March, the judge had directed the trial court to complete the trial in six months while disposing of a petition filed by J. Selvarani, wife of Jayaraj and mother of Benicks. She apprehended that since the accused in the custodial deaths case were police personnel, they could topple a fair trial. ‘Expedite trial’ The trial in the case should be expedited and concluded within a stipulated period in the interest of justice, she had said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sattankulam-case-five-more-months-granted-to-complete-trial/article37982680.ece

18 December 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||‘Will continue to press for Statehood’||Chief Minister N. Rangasamy on Friday said the administrative system of the Union Territory has to change for the speedy delivery of public services. While responding to an audio clip that went viral on social media where he hints that even though he was Chief Minister, he was not the only one calling the shots in the Union Territory, Mr. Rangasamy said, "The present system has to change. For that, Statehood is the only answer and I am firm on changing the administrative character of the Union Territory. I have already taken up the issue with the Centre and our government will continue to press for Statehood. In the leaked audio clip, Mr. Rangasamy is heard telling the caller from Karaikal that he was not a “king and there are people above and below him.” In a chat with The Hindu , the Chief Minister said it was a casual conversation with a person who had called him from Karaikal to ascertain the status of his announcement of Rs. 5000 as rain relief. “There is nothing new in my conversation that the public does not already know about. Decision making and implementation of programmes or schemes get delayed due to the existing administrative set up,” he said. “The way forward is only Statehood. Even during the recent meeting chaired by the Union Home Minister at Tirupati, I raised the issue. We will have to get Statehood to address all our problems. Even members of the public want the status of the Union Territory to be altered as a State. There cannot be and will not be any change in our party’s demand for Statehood,” he said. In the audio, the Chief Minister was heard telling the caller, “I am not a king, there are ministers, there are people above me and below me. They will have to decide. This is Pondicherry and it will be like this only.” This is not the first time that the Chief Minister is venting his unhappiness over the state of affairs after he assumed office with the support of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Earlier this month, Mr. Rangasamy, while addressing the valedictory of stakeholders meeting organised by the Tourism Department, said the Union Territory has no power as it comes under the control of Union Home Ministry. The Chief Minister had stated that even though the government has the intention to implement various schemes, the administration does not have the resource and power. Meanwhile, the principal Opposition party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), has asked the Chief Minister to name the people who have blocked implementation of Rs. 5000 as rain relief. Opposition leader R. Siva on Friday said the taped conversation revealed that someone was blocking implementation of his announcements. Mr. Rangasamy should reveal the identity of the person, the DMK leader demanded in a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/will-continue-to-press-for-statehood/article37983013.ece

18 December 2021||RAMANATHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||‘DMK govt. drops popular schemes of AIADMK rule’||Unable to stomach popular schemes of the previous AIADMK regime, the DMK government dropped them under some pretext or other. As a result, people were suffering, said former AIADMK Minister M. Manikandan here on Friday. Speaking at Aranmanai here to condemn the maladministration of the DMK government since it came to office in May, speakers said that the DMK had come to power by giving false promises and misleading the people. This would not last long and soon the AIADMK would come to power and set right all the defects, they said. The former Minister alleged that some of the ministers had started indulging in corrupt practices and the DMK instigated the police to foist false cases against the AIADMK leaders to hide them. “We will not be cowed down by such threats. The people have strong faith in the AIADMK, which had reflected in 1.46 crore votes the party had got in the Assembly election,” Mr. Manikandan said. District secretary M.A. Muniasamy presided. Former MP Niraikulathan, former MLA Sathan Prabhakar and many women’s wing representatives participated. There were similar protests in Sivaganga and Virudhunagar districts. In Dindigul district, former Minister and MLA Dindigul C. Srinivasan led the demonstration. He said that distribution of Pongal gift hampers to the poor was a popular scheme. The AIADMK government did not stop distributing them under any circumstances but the DMK government had not announced anything regarding this gift till date. It was a shame to keep the people in the dark, he said. The handling of the Mullaperiyar dam storage level had exposed the inability of the government. The farmers were upset as the water for irrigation might not be sufficient for the ensuing season due to wrong move of the DMK government, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-govt-drops-popular-schemes-of-aiadmk-regime/article37982725.ece

18 December 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Infant sacrificed at Mallipattinam||The Sethubhavachatram police have arrested a soothsayer and a couple on charges of murdering a six-month-old girl at Mallipattinam a few days ago. According to police, the infant was found dead in a plastic container used to stock fish in the backyard of the house of Nasurudeen (32) of Mallipattinam on December 16 morning. The girl child Hajarah was the second child of Nasurudeen and Shaliha (24). Subsequently, the body of Hajarah was buried at the burial ground of the Mallipattinam Jamat. However, Shaliha unable to control her sorrow continued to lament all through the day. Meanwhile, on coming to know about the sudden death and immediate burial of the child’s body, the village administrative officer, Thangamuthu brought the incident to the notice of the Sethubhavachatram police. Based on his complaint, the police started interrogating the couple and their relatives about the incident. The interrogation by the police led the pointer to Nasurudeen’s relative, Sharmila Begum (48) whose husband, Azharudeen (50), who had returned to Mallipattinam from overseas recently. As Azharudeen suffered from different types of illness for the past three months, Sharmila consulted a soothsayer, Mohammed Saleem (48) of Krishnajipatti in Pudukottai district. The soothsayer had advised Sharmila to slaughter chickens and goats in the vicinity of her house and obeying his directions she had slaughtered more than a dozen chickens and goats during the last few months. Despite the slaughtering of the animals and birds Azharudheen’s health condition did not improve. Subsequently, Sharmila approached Saleem who had suggested that sacrificing an infant might end the health disorder problems experienced by Azharudheen. Thus, Sharmila sneaked into Nasurudeen’s house on December 15 night and killed the infant by holding her down in the water-filled plastic container, police said. On confirming this act, the Sethubhavachatram police arrested Sharmila, her husband, Azharudheen and the soothsayer, Saleem. The body of the girl child was also exhumed and the postmortem was conducted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/infant-sacrificed-at-mallipattinam/article37982659.ece

18 December 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Shortage of hay in delta||Farmers rearing cattle are finding it difficult to procure hay to feed their animals. Hay is sold by Delta farmers at a throwaway price after the harvesting of the last samba, thaladi and summer crops, and in some places the cultivators allowed the procuring agents to remove the hay from the fields free of cost. Though some farmers were able to gain some paltry amount through the sale of haystacks in the recent past, now all the farmers are made to shell out not less than Rs. 350 per bundle of hay in the open market, says G. Srinivasan, a progressive farmer from Ganapathi Agraharam. The farmers are able to feed their cattle with hay once a day only. The district administration must buy hay from other districts and sell through the Animal Husbandry Department at a reasonable price, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/shortage-of-hay-in-delta/article37982711.ece

18 December 2021||THENI/SALEM,TAMIL NADU||‘DMK has gone silent on tall promises’||The AIADMK on Friday organised demonstrations in different parts of Tamil Nadu to highlight what it called the DMK Government’s failure to tackle various issues such as the rising prices of essentials and to keep its election promises. Taking part in an event at Bungalowmedu near Theni, AIADMK coordinator O. Panneerselvam said that after making “tall promises”, the ruling party had now gone “silent”, with the government remaining a “non-starter”. Under “one pretext or the other”, the government had only been making announcements but “nothing tangible” had emerged. Flood relief The recent floods in Cuddalore, Villupuram, Chennai and other districts had severely affected the masses. While the Chief Minister toured the affected areas, people were yet to get the relief. Whether in power or not, the AIADMK had “done its duty”, he said. Attacking the government for its “miserable failure” on the Mullaperiyar dam row, the AIADMK coordinator said thousands of farmers depended on the Mullaperiyar water for irrigation. Instead of being firm with the Kerala Government and asserting the State’s rights, the government remained “passive”, which led to a “unilateral decision” by the neighbouring State last month. He appealed to the farmers to remain calm. In a statement, Mr. Panneerselvam expressed sadness over the death of a nine-year-old girl in Dindigul district after she was found lying with her body half-burnt, and demanded a probe into the incident. Leading the protest in front of the Salem Collectorate with scores of members of his party, Leader of the Opposition and AIADMK co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami said his party was not afraid of the “false cases” registered by the DMK Government, and it would give a fitting reply to the ruling party’s “false propaganda”. The protesters raised slogans against the government. ‘False propaganda’ Mr. Palaniswami accused the government of having failed to fully waive the farm loans lent by cooperative banks, and added that it was indulging in “false propaganda” against the AIADMK Government’s waiver scheme. The government was yet to implement the schemes to provide Rs. 1,000 each to home-makers and a subsidy of Rs. 100 per gas cylinder, and reduce fuel prices, as promised by the DMK during the election campaign. Mr. Palaniswami said government officials were “feeling let down” by the government’s failure to restore the old pension scheme. He added that the government did not take “precautionary measures” ahead of the northeast monsoon. At Royapuram in Chennai, former Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar led a demonstration, wearing a garland of vegetables and provisions to highlight the issue of the rising prices of essentials.  The government has been making announcements, but nothing tangible has emergedO.

18 December 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Students learn finer nuances of carpentry from architect||A six-day winter school workshop mentored by Puducherry-based architect Kumaresan Muthukumar has introduced students of B.Sc Interior Design at CARE College of Arts and Sciences to basic aspects of woodworking. Fifteen pupils from the first and second year of the course have been honing their skills in different aspects of furniture making, including traditional joinery which consists of assembling wooden structures without nails or adhesives. “We started by teaching the students about joinery, because while they have read about it in their textbooks, they don’t have much practical experience in it. After four days of instruction, we asked them to design prototypes of furniture,” Mr. Muthukumar told The Hindu . Mr. Muthukumar has trained under Japanese master woodworker and Aurovillian Kenji Matsumoto. The items chosen by the students included storage units, benches and stools, and tested aspects of wooden joints such as strength, flexibility, durability and appearance. “Joinery is a basic skill that can help create many things. For instance, students can use a glass sheet on top of a sturdy set of wooden legs made with joinery to create a coffee table, which is actually an ancient Japanese technique called ‘Chidori,’” said G. Naveen, architect, visiting faculty and mentor for Interior Design course at the college. Possibilities The workshop explores the possibilities of using wood without metal inserts, screws, nails or epoxy glues, said R. Maniyarasan, architect, photographer and faculty mentor for Visual Communication course. “When you have a nail, you don’t have to think more. But traditional joinery is more like a puzzle, with a bit of mathematics and geometrical calculations. Once students understand it, they can create anything,” he said. In an age of compressed wood and moulded plastic furniture, natural options have more longevity and character, said Mr. Muthukumar. “Students have been responsive to the concept, working both as teams and alone, once they get the hang of it,” he said. He added that that the skill was not really male-dominated as perceived. “We actually have had more girl pupils in this course, because irrespective of their gender, interior designers have to know the techniques even if someone else is crafting the furnishing.” Much of the work has been done using reclaimed wood, to show the sustainability of the craft, said the experts. The workshop is scheduled to conclude on Saturday, with an exhibition of products created by the students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/students-learn-finer-nuances-of-carpentry-from-architect/article37982709.ece
18 December 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Financial position triggers concern among teaching, non-teaching staff||Anxiety is palpable among teaching and non-teaching staff of Bharathidasan University over the downslide in financial position, against the backdrop of the need for sufficient funds for settling the retirement benefits of employees retiring in units of batches. Over the next two or three years, a chunk of the first batch of employees appointed during 1986, the year of start of the university, will be completing their services and there will be requirement of crores of rupees for settlement benefits at regular intervals. The problem has been exacerbated by the release of the annual grant on the basis of the strength of teaching and non-teaching staff in 1996, according to representatives of teaching and non-teaching staff associations. The State government had released Rs. 19.64 crore as block grant for 2020-21 on that basis, while the actual salary outgo had risen substantially over the last 25 years owing to the start of more departments and appointment of more teaching and non-teaching staff, These appointments had been approved by the Syndicate, and, in the absence of corresponding increase in State government's block grant, the university has been meeting the expenditure with its own funds. In the absence of sufficient corpus, the university has been left with no option but to utilise project-related funds for meeting operational expenses. A bulk of employees who will be retiring next April after the two-year service extension have their fingers crossed, due to the uncertainty over prompt settlement of retirement benefits. “The audit team is working on the new requirement of block grants. The data is being compiled for submitting the same to the Finance Department for approval. The data has factored in the requirement of the need for human resource for making appointments in departments started over two decades,” Registrar Gopinath Ganapathy said. The State government has specified that January 1, 2016, will be the baseline for ratifying the posts sanctioned by the Syndicate. The government has assured to reimburse the expenditure incurred as salary for teaching and non-teaching staff as per the baseline, Prof. Gopinath said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/financial-position-triggers-concern-among-teaching-non-teaching-staff/article37982703.ece

18 December 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Nod for preparation of DPRs for semi ring road around Tiruchi||The State government has ordered preparation of detailed project reports (DPRs) for construction of a semi-ring road in Tiruchi and bypass roads around Aranthangi, Alangudi, Mayiladuthurai and Musiri in the central region. In an order issued on December 10, the Department of Highways and Minor Ports has granted administrative sanction for the preparation of DPRs for these and bypass roads for a few other towns in other parts of the state. 44.40-km road The department has sanctioned Rs. 3.57 crore for preparation of the DPR for the half ring road around Tiruchi. The road is proposed to be built between Panchapur, where the new integrated bus stand is to come up on Tiruchi-Madurai road, to Asoor on Tiruchi-Thanjavur road, connecting the Tiruchi-Dindigul, Tiruchi - Namakkal and Tiruchi - Chennai highways. The road is expected to run via Pirattiyur, Mutharasanallur, Madakudi, Poovalur and Kilikoodu. It will be 44.40 km long. The move comes amid a prolonged delay in resumption of construction work on the bypass road connecting Tiruchi-Madurai and Tiruchi-Karur national highways. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is expected to resume construction work on the bypass road connecting Tiruchi-Madurai and Tiruchi-Karur national highways after the completion of land acquisition for the revised alignment of the road. The project ran aground after farmers raised objections to the road being laid across irrigation tanks. The project was originally taken up as part of the widening of NH 67 executed on Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) basis by NHAI. It ran into controversy over alignment and land acquisition issues in 2006-07. Farmers complained that the road, if built across the tanks, would affect irrigation and their livelihood. The bypass road, which will run from Panchapur on NH45 via Thayanur to Thindukarai near Jeeyapuram on NH 67, was halted midway in 2010 after the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, while hearing a petition from farmers’ organisations, struck down the NHAI plan to build the road across Kothamangalam, Kallikudi and Punganur irrigation tanks in Tiruchi district. The court ordered that the bypass road be laid without affecting irrigation sources. Subsequently, a revised alignment was finalised. Meanwhile, the State Highways Department’s move to build a separate semi ring road is expected to significantly ease traffic congestion within the city. The alignment of the road and extent of land acquisition involved would be identified in the DPR, sources in the department said. Bypass roads This apart, the department has sanctioned Rs. 37 lakh for preparing the DPR for a bypass road, running for a length of about 10.20 km, around Aranthangi and Rs. 22 lakh for preparing the report for a six-km long bypass around Alangudi. Mayiladuthurai town, which is the headquarters of the newly created district, would also get a, eight-km long bypass road soon with Rs. 51 lakh being sanctioned for the preparation of the DPR. The town of Musiri on Tiruchi-Namakkal road would get a bypass road of about 7.60 km and the DPR for the same would be prepared at a cost of Rs. 74 lakh.  Coming soon The road will be built to link Madurai road with Tiruchi road Work on bypass road connecting Madurai and Karur highways to resume soon State Highways also plans to lay a separate semi ring road||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nod-for-preparation-of-dpr-for-semi-ring-road-around-tiruchi/article37982719.ece

18 December 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Industry forums to take part in protest against rise in cost of inputs||Industry associations in the region have expressed solidarity with the call by All India Council of Association of MSMEs (AICA), an umbrella body of 170 MSME associations, for closure of production units across the country on December 20 to protest against the spiralling cost of input materials. The associations have resolved to stage a hour-long demonstration in front of the Collector’s offices seeking Central government's intervention to check the escalating costs of raw materials. Expressing grave concern, the Tiruchi District Tiny and Small Scale Industries’ Association has given a call to affiliated associations for the protest. The MSME sector being next only to agricultural sector in terms of employment generation, it should be safeguarded from the impact of escalating costs of raw materials, TIDITSSIA functionaries said. The Perambalur District Small and Tiny Industries Association (PEDSTIA) has also given a similar call to its members for participation in the protest in front of the Collectorate. According to PEDSTIA functionaries, there is an imperative need for formation of a committee consisting of government officials and MSME representatives to arrive at the cost of input materials. According to small industry associations, the spiralling price of raw materials has severely affected the production and working capital. The associations expect the Central government to direct the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to compensate the MSMEs for the higher input costs. The AICA has demanded that the cost of raw materials be brought to the level of April 2020 prices, and has called upon public sector enterprises to accept cancellation of orders from MSMEs without putting a penalty or blacklisting them. MSMEs have been pushed into a helpless situation in the backdrop of the steep increase in price of steel, the AICA has pointed out, calling for the nation-wide protest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/industry-forums-to-take-part-in-protest-against-rise-in-cost-of-inputs/article37982704.ece

18 December 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||School teachers did not rush to aid of victims, say students||A section of students of the Schaffter Higher Secondary School in Tirunelveli, where three pupils were killed in a wall collapse, claimed the teachers did not immediately rush to the aid of the victims. Some of the students claimed that though a few teachers had come to school by car, they did not rush the injured students to hospital in their vehicles. “Only after we started removing the debris to rescue our profusely bleeding friends, some teachers joined us,” alleged a Class 10 student. “The teachers, after the students started the rescue measures, took the injured near the main building of the school while others alerted the fire and rescue services and the ambulance. They were waiting for the fire service and the 108 ambulance to enter the school premises to take them to the hospital instead of using their cars,” claimed another student. According to some students, they blocked the road agitated over the “slow response” of the teachers to the tragedy. Teachers, whom this correspondent approached, refused to comment on the charges of the students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teachers-did-not-rush-to-aid-of-victims-students/article37982731.ece

Leading the demonstration held near Old Bus Stand, former Minister and Nannilam MLA R. Kamaraj, Tiruvarur district AIADMK secretary, condemned the State government for not including the cash component in the ‘Pongal Gift’ announced for the year 2022. Distribution of cash assistance to the family cardholders would help them celebrate Pongal happily, he pointed out and also exhorted the government to fulfil its election promises such as extending financial assistance of Rs. 1,000 per month to women. Holding the State government for the current situation of inflated prices of essential commodities, he indicted the DMK government for not coming forward to reduce the State Tax levied on the petroleum products as implemented by several other States immediately after the Central government pulled down the percentage of tax on petrol and diesel levied by it. Condemning the closure of ‘Amma Mini Clinics,’ he urged the DMK government to provide adequate assistance to people who have been affected due to heavy rain and floods in the State. Demanding Rs. 40,000 per hectare as relief to farmers who have lost their crop to the rain and subsequent flooding, Mr. Kamaraj asked the State government to extend Rs. 12,000 per hectare for taking up cultivation again at the fields affected due to rain and inundation if the DMK government was really interested in safeguarding the farming community. Meanwhile, Food Minister R.Sakkarapani, addressing the gathering at a “Makkalai Thedi Mudalvar” events at Thiruthuraipoondi and Muthupettai areas on Friday, said that 21 products, including a full sugarcane, would be distributed to family cardholders as ‘Pongal’ Gift to celebrate Pongal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/include-cash-component-in-pongal-gift-aiadmk/article37982707.ece
18 December 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,TAMIL NADU||Collector orders inquiry into use of earthmovers in Ketti||A video of an earthmover alleged to have been working illegally under the cover of darkness to prevent detection went viral on social media. The district administration, acting on media reports, has formed a team of officials from the Revenue Department to conduct an inquiry. A local activist from Ketti said booming construction in the area as well as conversion of fallow land into farms had led to an increase in the use of earthmovers to excavate hillocks for farming and construction projects. “In the recent past, screens have been used to shield excavation activities, while this video shows that they are also being used at night to prevent detection,” he said. The use of earthmovers is strictly regulated by the district administration, with permissions being granted by the Revenue Department for their use. Activists said unregulated use of earthmovers not only damaged the fragile landscape of the Nilgiris, but also impacted slope stability and increased the chance of landslips. After media reports emerged of the use of earth excavators in Ketti Palada in Ketti, the Nilgiris Collector S.P. Amrith ordered an inquiry into the usage of the earthmovers in the area. Mr. Amrith told The Hindu 14 permissions had been given in the last month for the use of earthmovers in Ketti. A team of revenue officials would visit the area and conduct an inquiry and ascertain whether the earthmovers had been used illegally in any area where permissions were not granted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/collector-orders-inquiry-into-use-of-earthmovers-in-ketti/article37982673.ece

According to Raees Mohammed, a local resident and secretary of the All India Sanitation Workers’ Self Respect Trade Union and Founder of Dalit Camera, the stretch leads to six villages in Kotagiri. “Due to illegal parking of vehicles by the side of the road, people dispose of trash along the stretch, while patrons of a bar nearby would also dispose of liquor bottles there,” said Mr. Mohammed. A. Karpagam, another resident, said that petitions were sent to the Chief Minister’s Special Cell, and local police officials contacted residents to inquire into how their grievance could be redressed. “We decided that cars being parked by the side of the road were providing cover for people to litter the area,” said Ms. Karpagam. After consultations with the police and the Kotagiri town panchayat, the stretch was cleaned up and barricades were put up to prevent illegal parking. “Now, with the help of local residents, people are being actively discouraged from littering along the stretch, which is also the main access road to two schools in the area,” said Mr. Raees Mohammed, speaking to The Hindu . N. Velmurugan, Inspector, Kotagiri police, said that since the barricades were put up, illegal parking along the stretch has been completely stopped. “We have also given permission to residents to put up signage warning people against dumping garbage or littering,” he said. Locals have also planned to raise funds to install CCTV cameras to monitor the stretch remotely and to improve security in the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/residents-police-and-local-body-officials-work-towards-keeping-road-free-of-litter/article37982678.ece

18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Thai Vaazhthu declared the State song||A part of the verses under the title ‘ Tamil Dheiva Vanakkam ’ from ‘ Manonmaniam’, penned by ‘ Manonmaniam ’  Sundaranar and published in 1891, eventually came to be known as the Tamil Thai Vaazhthu . In 1913, the annual report of the Karanthai Tamil Sangam made the demand for singing the song at all functions. The Tamil Thai Vaazhthu is being sung at Karanthai Tamil Sangam since 1914. It is also being sung at all Tamil Sangams associated with the Karanthai Tamil Sangam. The Karanthai Tamil Sangam had appealed to the then Chief Minister, C.N. Annadurai, to declare Tamil Thai Vaazhthu the State song. On March 11, 1970, the then Chief Minister, M. Karunanidhi, while speaking at a government function, announced that the Tamil Thai Vaazhthu would be sung at the events of the Tamil Nadu Government. A Government Order issued on November 23, 1970, declared the select verses from ‘ Manonmaniam’ the Tamil Thai Vaazhthu . Since then, it is being sung at the beginning of government functions and those organised by educational institutions and public establishments. While so, “in the situation demanding a standard operating procedure for singing the Tamil Thai Vaazhthu ”, the Tamil Development Department recently issued a directive against playing the recordings of the song, adding that trained singers should sing it. A G.O. with guidelines to be followed while singing the Tamil Thai Vaazhthu had been issued, the release said. Annamalai’s plea In a statement, BJP State president K. Annamalai asked the government to use the Tamizh Thai Vaazthu fully, not just the abridged version. He said Chief Minister M.K. Stalin must stay true to the oath of office he had taken and should not bring in his personal interests or disinterests and must ensure that the full song, with the lines on belief in God, were included in the song.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-thai-vaazhthu-declared-the-state-song/article37982655.ece

18 December 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||Congress joins protest against proposed anti-conversion Bill||Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah and other Congress leaders joined the protest by the Federation of Indian Christians at the Suvarna Soudha against the proposed anti-conversion Bill in Belagavi on Friday. Addressing the protesters, he said the Congress would strongly oppose the proposed Bill, whenever it was tabled in the House. The Government is bringing it with malicious intention. There was no public interest behind this. The only intention was to divide the society and create hatred among castes and religious groups, he said. “The Government wants to create problems for the Christian community. We will not let it happen,” he said. “We want to assure the community that we are with you,” he added. Christian organisations were running schools, hospitals, and other institutions where people of all faiths are admitted. Not all of them have been converted. There are no forced conversions, he said. The Indian Constitution gives the fundamental right to the people to choose their faith, and practice and preach it. Any law that takes away these rights would be anti-constitutional. They will not stand the test of equity and justice in any court of law. The Government should not attempt any such misadventures, he said. Just because the Government had a majority in the Assembly, it does not mean that it could take anti-people decisions, he said. B.R. Ambedkar had said that the true intention of the Constitution would be carried out when the people who implement it are good. But the BJP is implementing its divisive agenda, he said. He said that the BJP and the RSS followed Manuwadi ideology that was aimed at creating wedges between groups, for political benefit. The Government was not following the egalitarian philosophy of Basaveshwara, he said. He noted that attacks on Christians were on the rise. He claimed that the erstwhile Congress Government, led by him, had ensured that there were no such attacks. Leaders such as Ivan Dsouza, K.J. George, Raje Gowda, Vijay Singh, Prakash Rathod, Ashok Pattan, and federation president Sajjan George, were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/congress-joins-protest-against-proposed-anti-conversion-bill/article37982761.ece
18 December 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||FIR against Minister: Cong. begins dharna in Assembly||The issue of an FIR being filed against Urban Development Minister Byrathi Basavaraj and BJP MLC R. Shankar on the direction of a court created furore in the Legislative Assembly too, with the Opposition Congress commencing a dharna in the well of the House demanding that the Minister be sacked and that they be allowed to discuss the episode. The Congress had sought to discuss the issue in the form of an adjournment motion that has a censuring clause. However, Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri rejected permission to raise the issue on the grounds that the matter was sub judice as it was still before a court. Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy endorsed the Speaker’s stand. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah took exception to this and sought to remind the Speaker and Mr. Madhuswamy that the BJP as an Opposition party had debated the issue of unnatural death of police officer M.K. Ganapathy when he was the Chief Minister though the issue was before the court. In fact, the then Home Minister K.J. George had resigned over the episode, he pointed out. But Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai argued that FIR had been filed against Mr. Byrathi based on a private complaint unlike the unnatural death of Ganapathy. He maintained that allowing discussion on issues that have cropped up due to private complaints would lead to unhealthy development. Taking exception to this, the Congress members led by Mr. Siddaramaiah accused the BJP government of lacking in morality. But the Chief Minister again argued that permission to debate the issue was being denied on the basis of legality. There was no issue of morality involved here, he asserted. This angered the Congress members who trooped into the well of the House and commenced a dharna. The Speaker adjourned the House till Monday and the Congress said it would resume the protest then.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fir-against-minister-cong-begins-dharna-in-assembly/article37982603.ece

The review report was tabled in the Assembly on Friday. It points out a shortfall in collection of tax revenue due to the impact of the pandemic in the first quarter of fiscal 2021-22. The State had revenue receipts of Rs. 83,031 crore till September 2021 as against the budgetary target of Rs. 86,136 crore. However, it also noticed a recovery in revenue collection from the second quarter of the year with the slowdown of the pandemic in Karnataka. The report has suggested taking all possible measures to ensure full collection of revenue by the end of the financial year. ‘Stick to guidelines’ The report referred to the finding by Fiscal Management Review Committee (FMRC), led by the Chief Secretary, that the State is providing funds beyond the SDRF and NDRF norms for flood-affected districts. It pointed out that the committee has recommended sticking to the expenditure (in disaster relief) as per guidelines prescribed by the Centre. The report expresses concern over the increased financial commitments with respect to major and minor irrigation works as well as those taken up by the Public Works Department. The financial commitments are in the range of five to eight times their annual budgets. It has been advised that new works should not be sanctioned till the financial commitments are brought down to a ratio of 1:3 in terms of actual budget and financial requirement for carrying out works. Social infrastructure At the same time, the report advised the Finance Department to increase expenditure on key areas of social infrastructure, like health and education, considering the reduced expenditure on these sectors in the first half of 2021-22 compared with budget estimates. FMRC acknowledged constitution of the second Administrative Reforms Commission by the Karnataka Government and hoped that it may aid in rationalising schemes, restructuring and merging certain departments, besides abolishing certain unnecessary posts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/covid-fiscal-position-weak-but-economy-recovering-now/article37982599.ece
18 December 2021||BELAGAVI,KARNATAKA||State Government to decide on guest lecturers in about a month||Karnataka Government is set to take a call on the demand for regularisation of services of guest lecturers in about a month, according to Higher Education Minister C.N.

18 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Many students want to drop Kannada as subject||Many students, who had taken up Kannada as a subject, have applied to drop the language. This comes just a day after the High Court of Karnataka issued an interim order that the Government cannot make Kannada a compulsory language for first-year undergraduate courses this academic year. Students, particularly those from outside Karnataka, have already applied to their respective colleges seeking a switch to either Hindi or Sanskrit. A student who completed class XII from Mumbai and is pursuing a first-year B.A. programme at a college in Bengaluru said she was “desperate” to change the subject. “I attended a few classes in functional Kannada but I cannot cope. I would like to study a language I’m more familiar with,” she said. B.G. Bhaskara, president of Federation of University and College Teachers’ Associations in Karnataka said that college managements were at sea as many had already started classes in October for the first semester. “Teachers have already completed 40% of the portion and now students want to change their subject. Not only will it be difficult for them to cope if they switch languages, teachers will have a tough time teaching them,” he said. He also pointed out that universities had not asked colleges to stop teaching Kannada. R. Parvathi, principal, VET First Grade College, said that students and teachers are confused about the way forward. “Many students from outside Karnataka are unable to learn the language. But we have not heard anything from the university authorities,” he said. The Higher Education Department had issued an order stating that the undergraduate degree students should learn Kannada as one of the two languages from this academic year. Students from other parts of the country and those who did their schooling in Karnataka but had not studied Kannada should learn it as a functional language. On Thursday, the Karnataka High Court in an interim order stated that the Government cannot make Kannada a compulsory language for UG students. While many students are relieved, government officials and university authorities that The Hindu spoke to described the development as a setback, and that “it was a pity” that students could not learn the local language.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/many-students-want-to-drop-kannada-as-subject/article37982573.ece
18 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Council polls: Cong. outsmarts BJP||The Congress on Friday said it won 44.64% of votes in the biennial elections held to the 25 Karnataka Legislative Council seats from 20 Local Authorities’ Constituencies, which was more than 7% of the votes secured by the ruling BJP. In the elections, both the Congress and the BJP won 11 seats each, while the JD(S) bagged two, and Independent one. KPCC working president R. Dhurvanarayana said the Congress won 44.64% of votes against the BJP’s 37%. Out of 99,062 voters, the Congress secured 44,225 votes while the BJP secured 37,283 votes. Both parties fielded their candidates in 20 constituencies. The JD(S), which fielded its nominees in six constituencies, secured just 10% votes (10,249 votes). More than 99% voters of the total 99,062 in 25 constituencies exercised their franchise in the elections held on December 10. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Dhruvanarayana said JD(S) which has been boasting its dominance in the Old Mysore region suffered a severe loss of face. The Congress won a majority of seats in the region, he said. The BJP too lost its bastion in Belagavi. The district has two MPs and 11 BJP MLAs. But the party candidate Mahantesh Kavatagimath was defeated by a margin of 1,286 votes in a double-member constituency against Channaraj B. Hattiholi of the Congress, he said. In Hubballi-Dharwad constituency represented by Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi, the BJP secured second place. Despite just three MLAs, KPCC working president Saleem Ahmed won the highest votes against Pradeep Shettar, brother of former BJP Chief Minister and MLA Jagadish Shettar, the Congress leader said.

18 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Innovative solutions: Govts. must lead the way||Imagine, a T-Rex walking into a room full of humans to deliver gyaan on what it feels like to go extinct. That’s exactly what a recent ad did to highlight the myopic choices that we make as a society. Our choices are dominated by convenience and cost, with little regard to their impact on the environment. We are now at crossroads, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, and only one path can sustain us as a civilization. The recently concluded COP26 conference aimed to get governments to reverse some of the long-drawn destructive impact. The conference highlighted the need for solutions that can drive economic growth, while balancing our carbon footprint. The concept of ‘circular economy’ or an economy that consumes what it produces as well as what it throws out as waste, is finally becoming mainstream. A growing economic powerhouse like India, which is also rich with natural resources, is vulnerable to climate disasters. This is reflected in the increasing occurrences of incessant rains and landslides. However, we have proven off late that we can innovate in record times under extenuating circumstances, vaccines during the pandemic a case in point. In addition, we have revolutionized financial payments with UPI and are moving to a cashless economy faster than some of our developed peers. Similarly, we are pioneering sustainable modes of transport such as electric scooters that could change mobility in the emerging world. With such disruptive innovations, we should be at the forefront of advances required to mitigate climate change as well. Like in most cases, behavioural changes on such a wide scale, governments need to lead the way. We are also seeing enablers in the innovation ecosystem, such as academia, incubators, global non-profit foundations, all identifying business ideas for a circular economy using various approaches: competitions, hackathons, to name a few. Several corporates are repurposing their CSR funds as well, for sustainability initiatives that can fund startups. While corporate funding has never been in dearth, the need of the hour is an opportunity to ‘pilot’ promising solutions in a real-world setting with these larger companies. The Indian startup ecosystem has begun to see ideas from genesis to scaled systems, over the last four to five years. TrashCon, an NSRCEL-IIMB incubatee, uses technology to segregate waste and repurpose it to create products such as furniture and stationery. They have created the world’s first automated waste segregation system that is key to managing large scale waste. Greenvironment, an IIT-Madras incubated company, provides tech solutions to manage water and other utilities like power in commercial establishments. EcoSTP, a startup promoted by a private accelerator Brigade REAP, uses anaerobic methods to treat wastewater with zero power and zero chemicals, touted as a best practice case study by a UN report. Phool.co, an IIT Kanpur startup, has pioneered flowercycling technology to upcycle cellulose waste to manufacture charcoal free incense sticks. While startups are trying to ensure that substitutes are available, their pricing remains a concern. They cater to niche customers who are willing to pay a premium. Retail consumers are seeing alternatives, but it is industrial users who are likely to make a significant dent in our sustainability targets. Sectors, such as real estate and manufacturing, can benefit immensely from alternative materials for cement and steel. A recent move by the government to lower GST on recycled waste is a good step but not enough to promote large-scale adoption. Aggressive tax breaks and material subsidies, along with increased availability of funding, are equally critical for these young companies to operate competitively with their non-environmentally friendly peers. While governments have talked the talk on saving the planet, it is time now for them to walk the walk.  Dr. Venkatesh Panchapagesan is Professor of Finance and Chairperson of NSRCEL at IIM-Bangalore, and Nachiket Kulkarni is Program Lead, NSRCEL Social Ventures Incubation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/innovative-solutions-govts-must-lead-the-way/article37982579.ece
18 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Fresh tenders for building FoBs at metro stations||Metro stations on Tumakuru Road have been operational for more than seven years, but in the absence of foot-over-bridges, crossing the busy road remains a safety hazard for pedestrians and metro passengers. The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has now floated fresh tenders to build FoBs connecting metro stations such as Dasarahalli, Nagasandra and Yeshwantpur. But commuters remain sceptical given the long delay. Yeshwantpur metro station, for instance, was operational in March 2014, but both the agencies, BMRCL and South Western Railways (SWR), have so far failed to integrate the two stations which are used by thousands of people every day. The lack of “good response” for the previous tenders reportedly forced BMRCL to float fresh tenders. When asked about the delay in integrating the two stations, Divisional Railway Manager of Bengaluru Division of SWR Shyam Singh said, “BMRCL has to build the FoB connecting to stations.” On Tumakuru Road, the BMRCL has floated a tender to build an FoB linking the under-construction Chikkabidarakallu metro station, which is part of Phase II metro project extending the Green line from Nagasandra to Bangalore International Exhibition Center (BIEC). Two stations, Jnanabharathi and Mailsandra (Kengeri Bus Terminal), on the newly opened metro line on Mysuru Road will also get FoBs. At Mailasandra, two FoB will come up, one for pedestrians to cross the road and another that will link the metro metro station with a traffic Transit Management Centre. This FoB at Jnanabharathi will help railway passengers access the metro station. Once approved, the FoBs will take one year to complete at an estimated cost of Rs. 12.15 crore. BMRCL’s chief public relations officer B.L. Yeshwanth Chavan said, “Fresh tenders have been floated as previous tenders did not receive good response. Once these FoBs are operational, people will get direct access to the concourse of the metro stations. Pedestrians too will benefit from the project.” Several years ago, the BMRCL had proposed to build subways on Tumakuru Road and initiated acquisition of land. Later, citing non feasibility, the project was dropped. Meanwhile, commuters remain frustrated by the lack of headway. “Tumakuru Road sees high density traffic and crossing it is not easy. Every day, pedestrians struggle to cross the road. Foot-over-bridges will help hundreds of people,” said a commuter.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/fresh-tenders-for-building-fobs-at-metro-stations/article37982575.ece

In anger, he picked up a metal showpiece and hit Ganga on her head with it. She collapsed and lost consciousness. According to the police, Sham strangled her and later took her to the hospital where he claimed that she had fallen down.

A Division Bench passed the order after the State Government clarified that there was no need for the organisers to take permission from the authorities as the number of participants is less than 500. The Bench passed the order while disposing of the PIL petition filed by Prashanth Urs, a medical practitioner and a past president of NNFI’s Karnataka chapter. The Government counsel also told the Bench that the Hoskote taluk health authorities and the jurisdictional police have inspected the venue of the event and found no violation of COVID-19 guidelines and the number of participants registered for the event is around 300 persons. Following this, the Bench directed the NNFI to ensure strict compliance of the SOP and give no room for any violation. The court also said NNFI should enforce strictly its own guideline prescribed for the participants that they should produce two-dose vaccination certificate and RT-PCR test negative report of at least 48 hours prior to the date of attending the event. Earlier, counsel for the NNFI orally pointed out to the Bench the petitioner had approached the court against holding of conference as he had unsuccessfully contested an election held to the forum some time ago. However, the Bench said that it is more concerned about preventing spread of COVID-19. It was also pointed out on behalf of the NNFI that only around 300 participants were registered to attend the conference and not 3,000 as claimed in the petition. The Government counsel, who had initially said that no permission was sought, later clarified in writing to the court that no permission was necessary as number of participants is less than 500.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-permits-neonatology-forum-to-go-ahead-with-conference/article37982581.ece

18 December 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Ramesh Kumar’s statement condemned||The All-India Mahila Samskrutika Sanghatane (AIMSS) has strongly condemned what it has termed as insensitive and objectionable comment on rape during the legislature session in Belagavi. In a statement issued here, president of the Dharwad District Unit of AIMSS Madhulata Goudar termed the statement of the former Minister K.R. Ramesh Kumar and response of Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri as nothing but shameless acts that was unbecoming of legislators. Being a senior legislator who should uphold the constitutional values, Mr. Ramesh Kumar had indulged in loose talk instead of expressing sympathy over plight of victims of heinous acts such as rape. “What is even worse is that Mr. Kageri, who was on the Speakers’ chair, had laughed along with the former Minister, instead of censuring him for his insensitive remark. The shameless acts of both had exposed the male chauvinistic, senseless mindset of the legislators,” she said. The AIMSS strongly condemned such acts by politicians and urged society to condemn such acts vehemently. In another press release, district secretary of the All-India Democratic Youth Organisation (AIDYO) Ranajit Dhoopad has strongly condemned the statement of Mr. Ramesh Kumar and insensitive response of the Speaker. The AIDYO would urge the people to reject such leaders, he said in the release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ramesh-kumars-statement-condemned/article37982756.ece

18 December 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||PFI activists protest against ‘police atrocity’||Activists of the Popular Front of India (PFI) staged a protest here on Friday condemning what they called “police atrocity” against them outside the Uppinangady police station on December 14. After Dakshina Kannada Superintendent of Police Rishikesh Sonawane assured them of conducting an inquiry into the alleged high-handedness of the police, the activists withdrew their protest. As part of the ‘SP office chalo’ call, the activists assembled near the Hampankatta Circle. Later they marched till the Clock Tower where the police had placed barricades to prevent them from going ahead. Addressing the protesters, Shafi Bellare, a Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) activist, said the PFI activists were peacefully protesting outside the Uppinangady police station demanding release of their three activists secured in connection with an assault case. Some police officers, he alleged, spoke with the protesters in a rude way and tried to provoke them. The police, he alleged, suddenly lathi-charged and many of the protesters were injured. To make up for the “unprovoked lathi-charge”, the police have falsely claimed that its personnel too have been injured. They accused the protesters of harassing a woman police official. Accusing the police of behaving in a partisan manner, Mr. Bellare said the PFI would continue its agitation until the district police got rid of some personnel who he alleged were biased towards a community. Memorandum Later, Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar arrived at the site of the protest with Mr. Sonawane. The Superintendent of Police received a memorandum from the activists and said the allegations against police personnel would be inquired into. Mr. Kumar thanked the activists for holding the protest in a peaceful manner.  Meanwhile, security had been tightened near the office of the Superintendent of Police and barricades had been placed to prevent unauthorised entry of people to the premises. The police had diverted traffic on the stretch between Hampankatta Circle and Clock Tower to other roads for a brief period in the evening. The protest affected the traffic movement for some time. College students and those returning from offices found it difficult to catch their buses to return home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pfi-activists-protest-against-police-atrocity/article37982938.ece
18 December 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Three arrested for assault on fish vending stall owner at Uppinangady||The Dakshina Kannada police have arrested three persons allegedly involved in the assault of a fish vending stall owner and two others at Subramanya Cross in Uppinangady. The police gave the names of the arrested persons as Mohammed Sinan, Mohammed Zakaria, and Mustafa. Around 25 persons came on two-wheelers and assaulted Mohandas Shetty, his brother Ashok Kumar, and a customer, Mahesh, with sharp weapons. This assault was in retaliation to group clashes reported from Ilanthila village recently , in which the police arrested six persons. It was on August 22 that the stall of Mohandas was set on fire and he was threatened against running the business. Special police teams were formed to trace the persons allegedly involved in assault of Mohandas and two others. After going through footage of CCTV cameras and some electronic surveillance data, the police arrested Sinan, who was said to be among the persons allegedly involved in the attack. Based on his statement, the police secured Popular Front of India activists Zakaria, Mustafa and Hameed and brought them for questioning to the Uppinangady police station on December 13 night. As the three were being questioned on December 14, the activists carried out demonstration outside the station demanding their release. The police issued a notice to Hameed asking him appear later for the investigation and sent him out. The other two were arrested. The protests then turned violent and the police were reportedly assaulted and harassed. Ten persons were arrested in connection with three cases registered in this regard. Superintendent of Police Rishikesh Sonawane said the protesters were repeatedly asked to leave the police station. The police were forced to lathi-charge as the protesters turned unruly, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/three-arrested-for-assault-on-fish-vending-stall-owner-at-uppinangady/article37982932.ece
18 December 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||SDPI for judicial probe into lathi-charge||The Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) on Friday demanded judicial probe into the lathi-charge on the Popular Front of India (PFI) activists outside the Uppinangady police station in which several activists were injured on December 14. Talking to reporters, SDPI State president Abdul Majeed said PFI activists on December 14 peacefully carried out a protest demanding release of three persons secured in connection with the assault on a fish vending stall owner. The police suddenly charged on the activists and several of them, including a local religious leader, were injured. In order to cover-up this unprovoked lathi-charge, the police falsely showed that their personnel were injured and harassed. While claiming that none of the activists misbehaved or harassed police personnel, Mr. Majeed said Dakshina Kannada Superintendent of Police Rishikesh Sonawane should forthwith release footage of the attack and harassment to substantiate charges made against the activists. “We are law- abiding activists and we are not the ones to attack police personnel. The police are wilfully giving a bad impression of the activists to public,” he said. The SDPI would work with the PFI to legally fight for the activists facing these false charges. SDPI district president Aboobacker Kulai claimed that police inspector Prasanna was fine soon after he returned after the lathi-charge to a room in the police station where he and other PFI leaders were having discussion with the police. “There was no injury on this hand. We were surprised to hear a case was registered that Mr. Prasanna was stabbed,” he said. He also claimed that none of the activists had harassed a woman police personnel or assaulted the Assistant Superintendent of Police. Mr. Kulai said he was among the activists who were facing the false charges made by the police. Riyaz Farangipete said the police had failed to comprehensively investigate the attack on fish vending stall owner and the preceding series of attacks and incidents in Uppinagady. These incidents were as a result of personal animosity, which was deliberately being given a communal by the police, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sdpi-for-judicial-probe-into-lathi-charge/article37982940.ece
18 December 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘India’s ease of doing business ranking has considerably improved’||The Customs Department on Friday commissioned a Mobile X-ray Container Scanner (MXCS) for speedy clearance of containerised EXIM cargo at the New Mangalore Port Trust. Dedicating the scanner through virtual mode from New Delhi, Central Board of Indirect Taxes (CBIT) Chairman Vivek Johri said the board was in the forefront in enhancing trade facilitation. The Government has initiated several measures to ensure “ease of doing business”, thereby reducing the dwell time for release of the cargo. Mr. Johri said commissioning of the mobile scanner provides minimum physical intervention with maximum speedy clearance of cargo. He said the ease of doing business ranking of India had considerably improved over the recent years following several initiatives taken by the department for trade facilitation. NMPT Chairman A.V. Ramana said the CBIT had taken several important steps to ensure ease of doing business, including online filing of Import General Manifest (IGM) and other documents, online delivery of bulk cargo, Single Window Interface for Facilitating Trade (SWIFT) Platform for speedy clearance etc. This has also helped the port to ensure speedy turnaround time for vessels, he noted. Karnataka Chief Commissioner of Customs Mandalika Srinivas said while the NMPT was the 7th largest port of India with predominantly bulk cargo, container cargo traffic was growing substantially in the recent years. He said the MXCS was installed at NMPT in January 2020 that received the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board approval this April. With very high resolution, the scanner helps in speedy clearance of containerised cargo at the port. Board members D.P. Nagendra Kumar, Sungita Sharma, and Rajeev Talvar, Mangaluru Customs Commissioner Imamuddin Ahmad, and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/indias-ease-of-doing-business-ranking-has-considerably-improved/article37982925.ece

18 December 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||MYMUL to set up vigilance squad to tackle fake products||A day after a fake Nandini ghee racket was unearthed in Mysuru, the Mysuru District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Societies’ Union Limited (MYMUL) has decided to set up a vigilance squad to counter the distribution of fake dairy products misusing the Nandini brand name. MYMUL president P.M. Prasanna told reporters in Mysuru on Friday their vigilance team, which will comprise chemists and other food experts, will visit different Nandini milk parlours and agencies to check for the purity and genuineness of the products they are selling under the brand name. Though such a vigilance squad has to be set up by Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF), the apex body of dairy co-operatives in the State, MYMUL will deploy the vigilance squad in areas falling under its purview. The members of the squad will also seize products at random and have them checked at the laboratory. Mr. Prasanna said MYMUL representatives had met the Superintendent of Mysuru district police R. Chetan to conduct a detailed probe by senior officials into the racket, which was unearthed on Thursday after activists stormed a godown at Hosahundi on the outskirts of Mysuru. A FIR has been registered against four persons, he said while hoping that the police investigation will help bring out not only all the culprits involved in the crime, but also its marketing network. Mr. Prasanna said the fake packaging material recovered from the godown on Thursday had copied all the contents of Nandini packaging material including even the taxation numbers. It may be mentioned here that large quantities of palm oil, vegetable cooking oil, colouring and flavouring agents, besides packaging material in the name of Nandini, which is the brand name of KMF’s dairy products, had been seized by food safety officers from the godown on Thursday. MYMUL, in a statement, has claimed that about 3 to 4 tonnes of pure ghee had also been recovered along with 5 to 6 tonnes of adulterated ghee from the premises of the godown. P.M. Prasad, Mysuru’s designated officer for Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), said the samples of the seized material will be sent to the laboratories for testing. MYMUL officials also said that their directors and officials rushed to the godown after they were alerted by the members of a local human rights organisation, which had received a tip-off about the racket.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mymul-decides-to-set-up-vigilance-squad-to-tackle-fake-products/article37982934.ece

18 December 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||BJP candidate denies sabotage by partymen in Legislative Council polls||Chairperson of D. Devaraj Urs Backward Classes Development Corporation Raghu Kautilya, who was the BJP candidate in the recently-held elections to the dual-member Legislative Council seat from Mysuru-Chamarajanagar local bodies constituency, has denied that his partymen sabotaged his chances of winning. He told reporters in Mysuru on Friday that he was owning the blame for his loss. Though all the party leaders and workers of both the districts toiled for his success, he was unable to sail through, he said. Earlier, former Minister and BJP MLC A.H. Vishwanath had alleged that a few BJP leaders had sabotaged the chances of Mr. Raghu. He also claimed that a few BJP leaders in the region had worked as ‘agents’ of JD(S), leading to the loss. But, Mr. Raghu sought to clarify that former Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, Minister in charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar, MPs V. Srinivas Prasad and Pratap Simha, besides party MLAs and party leaders of Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts had all worked for him. This was his second successive loss in the elections to the Legislative Council from the constituency. He said he would not blame any BJP leader for it. However, Mr. Raghu did not rule out the possibility of a hidden understanding between Congress and JD(S) in the elections. Even though the two parties appear to be rivals, a “hidden understanding” between them may have been responsible for his loss, he said. He said he was not aware of how Mr. Vishwanath was accusing the BJP leaders of sabotaging his chances. Will continue Even though he was disillusioned by electoral politics, Mr. Raghu said he will continue in active politics and serve the party. He admitted that he was pained by the loss as he was looking forward to entering the Legislative Council by polling enough first preferential votes. It may be mentioned here that Congress party’s D. Thimmiah and JD (S) candidate C.N. Manje Gowda were declared elected after Mr. Raghu Kautilya, who secured the second highest first-preferential votes, was eliminated during the subsequent rounds of counting of preferential votes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bjp-candidate-denies-sabotage-by-partymen-in-legislative-council-polls/article37982950.ece
18 December 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Move to raise legal age of marriage for women welcomed||The Chairperson of Karnataka State Commission for Women, R. Pramila Naidu, has said the Centre’s move to raise the legal age of marriage for women to 21 was a step in the right direction. She told media persons here on Friday that at 21 years a woman can think independently and will be in a position to take a decision that is in her interest. She would have completed her education by 21, and will be economically independent all of which will stand her in good stead to face the vicissitudes of life whereas teenaged girls will be vulnerable and unable to think independently. Ms. Naidu, who was in the city to receive grievances, said she received more than 200 cases from Mysuru this year and a majority pertained to domestic issues or to asking for protection. Across the State the number of complaints is in excess of 3,000, she added. But on Friday the response to the grievance redressal programme was muted. Speaking on general issues she said owing to COVID-19 the concept of work from home was in vogue and during the first wave a majority of the complaints pertained to domestic or family atrocities while in the second wave there was a surge in appeals seeking medical assistance or counselling. She said 22 pregnant women who were afflicted by COVID-19 received timely assistance due to the intervention of the commission. Some of them have also written letters of appreciation to the commission.. The pressure of office work coupled with the imperatives of maintaining a balance in family life added to pressure on women who were working from home due to the pandemic. There were nearly 100 cases related to such instances, according to the chairperson. Greater awareness In response to a question on whether the atrocities against women were on the rise Ms. Naidu said there was greater awareness among women and hence were coming out in the open or the cases were being reported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/move-to-raise-legal-age-of-marriage-for-women-welcomed/article37982955.ece

Kelu, MLA, said he had got complaints from the public in Payyampally area that some Forest officials had attacked a group of villagers, including Vipin Venugopal, councillor, Mananthavady municipality.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/attacks-on-forest-personnel-condemned/article37982814.ece
18 December 2021||KANNUR,KERALA||Kannur varsity decision on research guides stirs row||A peer team report on “Institutional Accreditation of Kannur University” in July 2021 had pointed out insufficient research publications in Scopus Index Journal as a weakness in the overall analysis of the university. Despite this, the university syndicate has decided at a meeting that faculty members would be granted guideship on the basis of their research papers, without insisting on their publication in prestigious journals. The Kerala Students Union has come out against the decision, stating that it would affect the quality of research in the university. KSU district president P. Mohammad Shammas said that for anyone to be considered for the post of research guide or supervisor, he/she should have worked as an Assistant Professor for two years and should have at least two research papers published in the UGC-CARE List and Scopus Index Journal after receiving PhD. The present decision by the syndicate was to serve the interests of certain people and to provide them supervisory posts, he said. Mr. Shammas said that the assessment report had negative remarks on the research works carried out in the university. The new decision would further dilute research activities. A senior faculty member, on condition of anonymity, said that after getting PhD, two research papers would have to be published in illustrious publications of the UGC-CARE List and in Scopus Index-Journal. The syndicate decision would allow faculty members to publish the post-PhD research works in any unreputed publication to get the guideship. This would set an unhealthy trend in research, he said. However, Vice Chancellor Gopinath Ravindran said that the decision was taken to increase the number of supervisors. It was suggested that not much emphasis be given to publication of research papers and that assessing two good research papers of the faculty member would be enough to grant guideship. Stating that the university would consider only quality research work, Mr. Ravindran dismissed the allegation that the university was trying to dilute research activities just to serve the interests of some persons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kannur-varsity-decision-on-research-guides-stirs-row/article37982825.ece

Sivankutty has said that the decision to wear any type of dress was one’s decision and there was no need to insist on special clothes for teachers and students. The Minister was speaking after laying the foundation stone of the Kozhichal Government Higher Secondary School building to be constructed with Kerala Investment Infrastructure Fund Board (KIIFB) funds, on Friday. The Minister welcomed progressive thinking related to gender equality. Change was essential in the field of education and the department was working to embrace it, he observed. The Minister said he could not accept some school managements’ insistence on special clothing for teachers. The building for the Kozhichal Government Higher Secondary School is being constructed at a cost of Rs. 1 crore sanctioned from the KIIFB Fund by the Public Education Department. The 2,500-sqft building will have four classrooms. There will also be a lounge for girls, toilets, auditorium and room for counsellors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/choice-of-clothes-is-individual-freedom-minister/article37982828.ece

18 December 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Design consultants to be hired for bypass widening project||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is set to invite design consultants to widen the 16-km-long Edappally-Aroor NH Bypass into a six-lane road as part of its endeavour to hew out the Kozhikode-Edappally-Aroor stretch of NH 66 as a six-lane corridor. Special attention will be given to free the Edappally-Aroor Bypass of signal junctions, considering that motorists get caught in snarls at Edappally, Vyttila, and Kundannur, where traffic continues to be regulated by signals despite the presence of flyovers, it is reliably learnt. The sole exception is at Palarivattom, where the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) — which rebuilt the Palarivattom flyover — introduced an innovative method to streamline traffic in the east-west direction by providing a U-turn each on the northern and southern sides of the flyover. Many parts of the Edappally-Aroor Bypass remain four-lane, despite it being considered the busiest such corridor in Kerala, where intra-city, inter-district and inter-State traffic vie for space. An average of over 1 lakh passenger car units (PCUs) use the stretch every day. Redesigning space “The design consultant, who will be shortlisted in early 2022, is expected to come up with multiple design options to make optimal use of available space on the 45-metre-wide national highway. The tentative plan is to reduce the width of medians to a metre and integrate the buffer zone located between the NH Bypass carriageway and service roads on either side, to the carriageway,” sources said. The service roads at many places have substantial width, while they are narrow in several other locales. Even as fresh land acquisition has not been mooted, it may, in all probability, be needed at Edappally, Vyttila, and Kundannur to ensure smooth flow of vehicles in different directions, it is learnt. Deadline The NHAI is learnt to have set a 30-month deadline to complete the development of the entire Kozhikode-Edappally-Aroor NH into a six-lane stretch. Vyttila United Forum, a conclave of residents associations, traders and others, has, in the meantime, demanded that either the NHAI or the PWD (NH Wing) which built the flyovers at Vyttila and Kundannur, take steps to streamline the flow of vehicles that criss-cross the junction beneath the flyovers. “The NHAI, which owns the NH Bypass, must clarify how it will incorporate the six-lane NH at the bottlenecked junctions in the corridor. Motorists have to wait for long to get the green signal, despite the presence of flyovers,” Thampy V.R., president of the forum, said. It is because the State government has not given the go-ahead to the PWD (NH Wing) to kick-start the second phase development work at Vyttila and Kundannur, he added. Elevated NH The design for an elevated NH for the 11-km-long Aroor-Thuravur stretch has been readied, and work will begin in the first half of 2022. Apart from ensuring faster commute, the elevated corridor is expected to lessen accidents involving pedestrians crossing the highway.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/design-consultants-to-be-hired-for-bypass-widening-project/article37982848.ece
18 December 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Galleries come alive in Kochi||The maiden Kochi Art Week has injected fresh life into the art galleries of Fort Kochi and Mattancherry. Inaugurated on December 12, it is being conducted at 11 venues across the city and addresses a range of themes, many inspired by the ongoing pandemic. David Hall is host to ‘Wheeling on Borderlines’, a show by the former Chairman and Secretary of Kerala Lalithakala Akademi, Sathyapal, which offers a peek into the life of tribes of Madhya Pradesh, where the artist lived intermittently for several years from 1998. At Kashi Café, 47 black-and-white drawings by Mumbai-based artist Lakshmi Madhavan fascinate with curious use of technology. The small frames grouped together in an entity titled ‘See, Saw, Seen’ are works done when the first lockdown was announced in March 2020. The most striking feature in the drawings is the eye, which moves in six frames. “I had a certain sense of sight, during this period, by watching my baby and the changed perspectives due to the pandemic,” says Lakshmi. Baroda-based artist Raju Baraiya walks a fine balance between his rural and urban identities, in the context of the current health crisis, in ‘Social Gathering’ at Mandalay Hall in Jew Street. The late Jangarh Singh Shyam, who was among the first Gond artists to use paper and canvas for his paintings, thereby inaugurating what is now known as ‘Jangarh Kalam’, is celebrated in a group show with images of the tribal culture at Dezika Tribal Art gallery in Jew Town. Dibin Thilakan’s solo show at Mattancherry OED Gallery, ‘Bonds of Lineage’, presents watercolours and moves at a philosophic level. K.R. Sunil’s black-and-white photographs, shot over a period of two years, capture the trauma of broken and washed away homes on the Kerala coast, at a show in Pepper House. Malabar House, a boutique hotel, off Parade Ground, offers a stunning exhibition of creative weaving with tapestry works by a family of artists – Balakrishnan, K.V. Santha and V. Vasudevan – from Beypore in Kozhikode. At the District Heritage Museum, the journey of Kerala’s history is presented in artefacts, paintings, lithographs and maps. Organised by the Kochi Biennale Foundation, the seminars and talks related to the Art Week end on December 19 while the exhibition at the venues runs for a month till January 12.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/city-galleries-come-alive-again-with-kochi-art-week/article37982854.ece
18 December 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Retrofitted e-autos likely from Jan.||The skyrocketing price of fuel, including of CNG that crossed Rs. 70 this month, has led to autorickshaw operators banking hopes on staying afloat by retrofitting electric kits in conventional autorickshaws. “Each new e-auto that comes with fixed battery is priced up to Rs. 3.30 lakh, while the retrofitting process is estimated to cost approximately half as much. Such substantial lowering of investment in an extremely price-conscious segment like autorickshaws, looks feasible and is the need of the hour. Especially so, since auto drivers were amongst the worst hit by the pandemic-induced fall in demand for public transport,” said Binu Varghese, secretary, Autorickshaw Drivers Union (AITUC), who was among the office-bearers from Kerala who visited manufacturing units of different e-auto firms and did test drives. Benefits “We hope to get a clearer picture when the State-level retrofitting process begins in Kochi in January 2022. The retrofitting cost can further be brought down if the State or the Centre announces a subsidy, on the lines of the subsidy that both the governments currently extend to new e-autos. Each fossil-fuel run autorickshaw now incurs minimum Rs. 400 as fuel expense and this leaves hardly anything left for the driver or operator. This is simply not sustainable and there is demand for alternative fuel options like battery-run vehicles. The added advantage is that they do not cause sound and air pollution, and also cause much-less vibration,” he added. Even among e-autos, there are ones having fixed battery, and others whose drained-out batteries can be swapped with fully-charged ones. Recharging “The fixed battery option will be tried out initially, since the batteries can be recharged at home using a normal five-ampere power plug, including for single-phase connection, whilst paying domestic tariff. The travel range will be up to 120 km after each recharge,” said Nishanth Ravindran, CEO of Technovia Info Solutions which has been associated with many public-transport related initiatives in the city, who is part of the launch of the retrofitting initiative in Kerala. The retrofitting process involves retaining the chassis and body, while the rest will be redone, at approximately half the price of a new e-auto. The advantage is that the vehicle’s lifespan increases, while the battery and other components will get warranty. The considerable cost saving for capital, operational expense and the greener fuel option will be the main advantages. It gains relevance since the expected switch over from conventional to new e-autos is not taking place at the same pace as was expected, probably due to the relatively higher capital investment, Mr. Ravindran added. ARAI-approved kits Sources in the Motor Vehicles Department said such retrofitting is permitted, provided the kit for the purpose has been approved by Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/retrofitted-e-autos-likely-to-be-launched-from-january-next-year/article37982852.ece
18 December 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Anti-dowry campaign from today||A month after their formation, as many as 1,830 auxiliary groups of the District Kudumbashree Mission are all set to spearhead the more than three-month-long campaign, Sthreepaksha Navakeralam, aimed at sensitising society to the menace of dowry and atrocities against women, including domestic violence. The district-level launch of the State-wide campaign, which will last till March 8, will be held at Pension Bhavan at Athani on Saturday. Kudumbashree formed the auxiliary groups targeting women from the relatively younger age group of 18-40 years. They are also aimed at overcoming the existing hurdle limiting Kudumbashree membership to just one person from a family. “Auxiliary groups will facilitate the seamless transition of those who joined the Kudumbashree over two decades ago, when it was launched, and are now in their advanced age by a younger lot. Besides, members of auxiliary groups are expected to be more effective in a campaign aimed at bringing about an attitudinal change in the new generation,” said Shine T. Money, district programme manager (gender), Kudumbashree. The campaign assumes significance considering that Snehitha, the Kudumbashree’s round-the-clock gender help desk at Kakkanad, has logged over 200 domestic violence cases, including dowry-related ones, each in three successive financial years since 2018-19. The campaign has been planned at the level of Community Development Societies (CDSs) and Area Development Societies (ADSs). The promotional programmes for the campaign began at the CDS-level on Friday. “We have designed the campaign in such a way that different categories of people will be addressed each week. “For instance, a week will be dedicated to sensitising schoolchildren, while in another week, the focus will be on social media,” said Mr. Money. Special debates and discussions will be held in auxiliary groups between December 19 and 26. An oath against dowry will be taken by 27,000 neighbourhood groups in the district on December 18 and 19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/campaign-against-dowry-to-be-launched-today/article37982840.ece

The Minister asked the hospital authorities to come up with a detailed proposal on how to improve services. Ms. George claimed that it was for the first time a heart surgery was done in a district-level government hospital in the country. The government is trying to provide speciality and super-speciality services in all districts, she said. The 54-year-old Ezhikkara native, who underwent the bypass surgery, is stable. A driver at the Palliyakkal Cooperative Bank, he was not able to meet the Rs. 3-lakh expense for the surgery quoted by a private hospital.

18 December 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Start-up to roll out premium e-cycles from Varapuzha||A premium electric cycle designed in Austria and featuring components made in Italy is all set to be assembled and rolled out from a plant at Varapuzha by the middle of January. Assembling of the first batch of 400 e-cycles is already on at the plant spread over 12,000 sq.ft. The electric cycle is the first of the multiple products to be launched by VAAN Electric Moto Private Limited, a lifestyle e-mobility start-up registered in Maharashtra and founded by Jithu Sukumaran Nair, a marine engineer from Kerala. The global launch of the product was held at the prestigious EICMA Motorcycle Show in Italy last month. The brand and the product were designed by Austria-based KISKA, which owns the famed motorcycle brand KTM, while the components are being supplied by Italian motorcycle brand Benelli. The start-up has dealers in Portugal, Spain, and the Czech Republic. “Our plant at Varapuzha has capacity to assemble 2,000 cycles a month, and we are initially targeting sale of 8,000 to 10,000 cycles a year. We targeted a young crowd earlier but are now looking at even those in the age group of 40-55 years who need not be cycling enthusiasts, considering the advantages of our product that comes with three modes. We are yet to finalise the price, which would be upwards of Rs. 50,000,” said Mr. Nair, chief executive officer (CEO) and founder of the start-up, which was launched in 2017. The e-cycle has a power-assisted mode with five electric gears and a full-throttle mode ratcheting up a speed of up to 25 km per hour. The lithium-based removable battery weighing around 2.50 kg with a two-year warranty can be fully charged in around four hours and lasts for 50 km to 60 km depending on the mode in which the cycle is used. The intelligent battery management system offers 14 safety precautions, which, among others, eliminate potential overcharging. “Our idea is to target the market in Kochi and then scale up to the rest of the State and country. Initially, the service of cycles will be available at our plant at Varapuzha before setting up more service outlets,” said Manjit Mohan, co-founder and chief operating officer, VAAN. A kid’s superbike for racing by children aged between 4 and 12 years has also been launched, though it predominantly targets the international market, since race tracks are far and few between in India. The product was fully designed and manufactured in Spain. “Electric cycles, kids’ superbikes, and apparels constitute the first phase of our project. We are planning to roll out e-mopeds next year followed by e-scooters in another 18 months,” said Mr. Nair.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/start-up-to-roll-out-premium-e-cycles-from-varapuzha/article37982856.ece

The Health authorities in the district are having a hard time carrying out contact tracing and other follow-up measures, as the number of international travellers reaching the Cochin International Airport has gone up considerably. According to official estimates, around 55,000 travellers have arrived at the airport and left for various destinations since the first week of December. Of them, nearly 6,000 were from ‘at-risk’ countries. A senior Health department official said the lack of adequate manpower combined with the waning support from local bodies and enforcement agencies has taken a toll on their efforts to track those returning from abroad and ensure that they comply with norms. “The person who was infected with the Omicron variant came from Congo, which did not figure in the list of high-risk countries. He was placed under the self-health monitoring category and did not even figure among those who were asked to undergo quarantine, as he had no symptoms on arrival,” said the official. The person had to undergo a surgery, and he had visited a city hospital, where he underwent an RT-PCR test. Only then it was found that he was infected. Officials said they were able to ensure compliance with norms by those who returned from at-risk countries, as they have to undergo seven-day quarantine and follow it up with an RT-PCR test on the eighth day. But chances are high for those under the self-health monitoring category venturing out of their homes after two or three days of arrival, citing absence of symptoms and claiming that they had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. “The Congo case has proved that the new variant may not be restricted to people coming from at-risk nations,” officials said. The department has stressed the need for rapid response teams and the police to step up support to ensure that those returning from abroad comply with norms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/health-dept-in-a-fix-as-international-arrivals-go-up/article37982845.ece

The 16-point suggestions drawn up by the Central Project Elephant Monitoring Committee of the Project Elephant Division of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change were forwarded to the Chief Wildlife Wardens of Kerala and Tamil Nadu recently. Underpasses The latest in a series of elephant deaths on rail tracks was on November 26 when three elephants were mowed down by a train at Mavuthampathi village, near Navakkarai, in Tamil Nadu. Incidentally, the proposal for constructing two underpasses in Line B between the Ettimadai and Walayar stations was mooted 11 years ago. Though the Tamil Nadu Forest department was supposed to fund the project, the committee suggested that Railways meet the expense as funds did not come as expected. Level-crossings for animals that combine fencing, cattle guards, and animal-warning systems have been suggested at sites with high probability of animal movement. Warning systems Early warning systems that will generate sound and get triggered by an approaching train have also been mooted. Installation of signboards on the Tamil Nadu side for alerting loco drivers of speed restrictions and blowing horns at vulnerable points and GSM-based alert systems to warn about elephant presence near tracks may be explored. The Forest departments have agreed to allow Railways to do earth work to prepare ramps to enable easy passage of elephants, especially in embankments.  16-point suggestions by Central Project Elephant Monitoring Committee GSM-based alert systems to warn about elephant presence near tracks Three elephants killed at Mavuthampathi village on November 26||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/slew-of-suggestions-to-avert-elephant-deaths-on-rail-tracks/article37983054.ece
18 December 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||KSHEC for govt. nominee as VC search panel chief||The Kerala State Higher Education Council (KSHEC) has recommended amendments to the constitution of the search committee for the selection of Vice Chancellors of State universities by proposing a nominee of the State government as chairperson of the panel. The amendments seek to remove the clause included in the University Grants Commission (UGC) Regulations, 2010, which states that the nominee of the Visitor/Chancellor should be the chairperson of the search committee in respect of the State and Central universities. The proposal for amendments to the provision concerned in the Acts of universities in Kerala has been made in view of the “persistence of anomalies in the Acts of universities of Kerala in relation to the stipulations regarding the selection of Vice Chancellor provided in the University Grants Commission Regulations, 2010 and 2018,” according to the minutes of the Governing Council meet of the KSHEC held on October 25, 2021. Nominee of Syndicate The council has proposed a “nominee of the Syndicate of the University concerned” on the search committee instead of the clause in the UGC Regulations, 2010, which stated that it should be a ‘‘nominee of the Syndicate/Executive Council/Board of Management of the University’’. There is no change in the clause that the search committee shall include a nominee of the Chairman, University Grants Commission, or the chairman/equivalent of any other body mandated in areas of knowledge that are exempted from the purview of the UGC. The KSHEC has proposed the amendments exercising its powers provided for in the Act of 2007 and (Amendment) Act 2018. The aim is to unify the provision concerned in the Act of each and every university in the State. It also aims at satisfying the UGC’s requirement from the universities/State government to modify or amend the provision concerned in the Act/Statutes of the universities in tune with the regulations by the commission. Quoting the UGC Regulations, 2018 the Governing Council said the “nominating agency of the other two members of the search committee can be decided by the university/ State government.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kshec-for-govt-nominee-as-vc-search-panel-chief/article37982869.ece
18 December 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Coastal cargo service from Jan.||The success of the coastal container movement from the Kochi port to the Beypore and Azheekkal ports, introduced in the first week of July this year, has encouraged the State Ports Department to consider introduction of a new coastal service linking Kollam, Kochi, and Beypore in January next year. V.J. Mathew, Chairman of the Kerala Maritime Board, said on Thursday that the present service linking Kochi and Beypore had completed 35 voyages. Discussions to finalise the new service would be held in Kochi on December 21. The present coastal voyages carry an average of 50 containers each and the vessel, now linking the ports on the coastal route, has 100 TEU capacity. Munshid Ali, honorary secretary of the Kerala Exporters’ Forum, said the coastal movement had livened up the cargo transport scene. Around 400 containers are moved via the coastal route to Beypore and Azheekkal from Kochi on a monthly basis. The exporters’ forum has now taken an initiative to arrange a meeting with Ports Minister Ahammad Devarkovil in Kozhikode on Saturday. The meeting will be attended by stakeholders in the sector, including vessel operators, port management representatives, industrialists, traders and those others in the export-import business, he said. One of the encouraging development for those calling for developing the coastal movement of cargo was the recent export of 28 containers of plywood from Kannur to Malayasia from Azheekkal via Kochi. The increasing volumes on the coastal route have resulted in more enquiries and transport of consignments such as rice from Andhra Pradesh and cement is now under consideration by stakeholders. There are two voyages a week and though each voyage takes about a day to reach Beypore, the lack of sufficient draft is a problem that forces the vessels to wait for high tide before entering the port area. Dredging of the port to achieve the required draft is one of the key issues that will be discussed at Saturday's meeting. In a memorandum submitted to the Ports Minister earlier this year, the exporters’ forum had appealed to the government to take steps to increase the draft at the port. One of the problems associated with dredging in Beypore is related to deposing of the dredged material. However, a solution has been found to address the problem, Mr. Ali said.

Thus, the time gap between metro services will be 6.15 minutes, instead of 7 minutes during peak hours on Mondays and Saturdays. It will be 7.30 minutes instead of 8.15 minutes during non-peak hours. On Sundays, the time between two services would be 9 minutes instead of 10 minutes during both peak and non-peak hours. With the change in train frequency, there will be 271 services/trips on Saturdays and Mondays. It attributed the rise in ridership to discounts in ticket rates, free passes on special days and hosting of a variety of programmes at stations. From Saturday, metro stations will come alive with a Christmas event named Frosty Fest 2021, wherein the public can join competitions like star making, carol singing, crib making, Christmas tree decoration and Santa Claus competition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/metro-to-increase-frequency-of-services/article37982842.ece

It was filed before the Additional District and Sessions Court for the trial of cases relating to atrocities and sexual violence against women and children within 59 days after the case was registered, which is considered an achievement since charge sheets are supposed to be filed within 60 days in POCSO cases. The case pertains to the alleged multiple sexual abuse and rape of a minor, the daughter of an employee of the accused, in 2019. Monson is the sole accused in the case registered on a complaint filed by the survivor, who was by then an adult, shortly after the arrest of the accused on the night of September 25. As per the charge sheet, the accused deployed a mix of coercion and persuasion to sexually exploit the petitioner at his home during 2019. He reportedly promised the petitioner to help with her education besides training her to be a cosmetologist. Incidentally, among his many alleged frauds, Monson also claimed to be a cosmetologist and had treated even celebrities. He allegedly promised the petitioner and her mother to build them a house and got their house at Kumbalanghi demolished. They were then shifted to a rented house near his house at Kaloor. Monson allegedly raped the petitioner a week before his arrest. A separate case has been registered for the alleged rape after the petitioner had attained adulthood. The Crime Branch had recorded the arrest of Monson in the case on November 16 by which time he was already behind the bars in a slew of other cases. Investigation officer Y.R. Restem, DySP, filed the charge sheet. The charge sheet also draws strength from the statements of 36 witnesses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/charge-sheet-filed-against-monson-in-pocso-case/article37982827.ece

Incidentally, they have been missing out such aids out of ignorance or inability to claim them through proper channels. The first mega camp for enrolling more migrant labourers will be held at Feroke on December 20. Labour Minister V. Sivankutty will open the camp, where free medical check-up will be held. Essential medicines will also be supplied to participants. Minister for Public Works and Tourism P.A. Mohamed Riyas and senior Labour Department officers will be present. The Labour Department targets to complete the enrolment of over 25,000 migrant workers in Kozhikode district alone. Though some of them have already completed the enrolment process from their own States, a majority are yet to cooperate with the process out of negligence or ignorance. Camps will also be organised to help out those who are unable to attend the mega camp. Similarly, arrangements are in place to organise special enrolment camps for lottery vendors and autorickshaw drivers. According to official figures, there are over 2,500 lottery vendors in Kozhikode district, and they are expected to cooperate with the process. The number of autorickshaw drivers within the Kozhikode city limits alone is over 5,000. Labour Department officials hope that exclusive camps for such segments could attract better participation other than general camps. Efforts are also being made to enhance the participation of transgenders in the drive. “At a special camp on Wednesday, we managed to issue identity cards to nearly 40 persons from the LGBTQ community. During the enrolment drive, we also held a discussion with their representatives seeking their cooperation to encourage the enrolment of more such persons,” said Assistant Labour Officer L.N.

Harris who was recently removed from the post of State general secretary for violating party discipline, quitting the party on Friday. The other rebels who quit the party are State secretaries Angathil Ajaykumar and V. Rajesh Prem, who were earlier expelled from their positions for anti-party activities. All of them have sent their resignation letters to LJD State president M.V. Shreyams Kumar stating that the present leadership had failed to take the responsibility for the poor performance of the party in the last Assembly elections. Arbitrary decisions In his letter, Mr. Harris accused Mr. Kumar for taking arbitrary decisions on shuffling office-bearers without addressing the basic issues confronting the party. In their letters, Mr. Ajay Kumar and Mr. Prem hurled similar charges against Mr. Kumar for not adhering to democratic norms or organisational propriety. Meanwhile, Mr. Harris told The Hindu that the leaders would hold a meeting in hybrid mode in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday to chalk out various plans, including the option of forming a new party. Many have expressed their desire to return to the parent party, the Janata Dal (Secular) led by H.D. Deve Gowda. New entity “However, the future of that party remains uncertain as it is getting closer to the BJP. Besides, the JD(S) is losing prominence even in its stronghold of Mysuru,” he said. Several elected representatives and State and district-level office-bearers of the LJD had informed him that they would join the new political entity, Mr. Harris said. Meanwhile, unlike others, V. Surendran Pillai, a secretary general who was placed under suspension during the rebel uprising in the LJD, has so far not resigned from its primary membership. “Actually, I held conciliatory talks with the State leadership. I am hoping that the president would revoke the disciplinary action against me,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/crisis-deepens-in-state-ljd/article37982868.ece

He claimed that around 5,000 traders on the 49-km-long highway between Vengalam and Azhiyoor in Kozhikode district were the majority who were dragged into a crisis owing to faulty valuation.

Biju Simon of Ether India says the common perception is that once the children reach child-care institutions, their life has come to a pause. Ether’s endeavour is to tap into the potential of these children and hone their skills. The programmes are funded by the Women and Child Development department. The photography workshop, Click and Blink, was held offline as a follow-up to an online workshop held last year in which 97 children participated. Of them, 49 were selected for the offline workshop this year, but only 28 attended. They learnt how a camera functions, the theory of photo composition, cropping and editing, night photography and so on. “I want to work in the media and this workshop has proved useful. Earlier, there was no one to guide us. Now, there is a WhatsApp group of the workshop participants. We upload photos we click and the instructor, Biji C., tells us how these can be improved,” he says. Residential training In the next phase, 10 of the 28 students who seek a career in photography will be selected for a five-day theme-based residential training. They will be helped with enrolment in courses and finding placements. An exhibition of photographs captured by the children is also being mulled by the DCPU. For the community theatre workshop, Home Frames, to be held from December 27 to 31, a total of 30 students will be selected. They would learn how to script and direct a play. Next year, the students will participate in a short film-making workshop and make a short film on a social subject. In the third phase, they will make a film of 60 to 80 minutes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nurturing-talents-in-care-homes/article37983041.ece

Anilkumar, cashier at the Kazhakuttam zonal office of the civic body, was suspended following an inquiry that revealed that he had misappropriated funds collected for tar-cutting in the 2019-20 period. The accounts wing had conducted the inquiry after the Mayor received information that corruption using cancelled receipts had been happening at the Kazhakuttom zonal office. The inquiry team went over the tar-cutting files of the past three financial years that showed discrepancies in the figures for 2019-20. A copy of the receipt showing the amount remitted for tar-cutting was submitted to the engineering wing for work permission, while the original receipt was found to be cancelled. Four such receipts amounting to a total of Rs. 28,171 in cutting charges have been recovered. The enquiry team is carrying out more checks. Action was taken against the cashier as it was seen that he was prima facie involved in the fund misappropriation. The Mayor has instructed the officials to check whether similar instances of financial fraud have taken place in other zonal offices and in the main office.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-staff-suspended-for-fund-fraud/article37983049.ece

18 December 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Two more Omicron cases||Two more cases of COVID-19 caused by the virus variant Omicron have been confirmed in the State, taking the total number of such cases in the State to seven, Health Minister Veena George said here on Friday. Omicron was confirmed in a husband-wife duo, aged 68 and 67 years, who flew into Kochi from Sharjah on December 8. As per the Centre’s directive, the United Arab Emirates is not on the list of “high-risk” nations and, hence, this couple had been allowed to be on self-observation rather than quarantine. After they developed symptoms, they underwent RT-PCR test on December 11 and 12 and as they tested positive for COVID-19, the samples were sent for genomic analysis to the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, which confirmed the presence of Omicron. Contacts traced According to official information, there are six persons on the contact list of the husband and one on the primary contact list of the wife, all of whom will be subjected to testing. There were 54 passengers on the flight in which they flew in. Of the seven cases of Omicron documented in the State now, three were people who had come from nations not deemed to be “high risk”, raising the question whether these geographic demarcations make any sense any more. Ms. George said in a statement that persons from nations not listed as “high risk” should go on self-observation and follow the rules strictly. They should not visit crowded places or public places or functions in any circumstance, the Minister added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/two-more-omicron-cases/article37982872.ece
18 December 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Tharoor puts a dampener on UDF stir||Congress leader Shashi Tharoor’s refusal to oppose the K-Rail (SilverLine) project has arguably put a dampener on the United Democratic Front’s (UDF) impending Statewide agitation against the Pinarayi Vijayan government’s flagship semi-high-speed railway project. Mr. Tharoor has declined to sign a petition by Opposition MPs seeking to stop the land acquisition and allied works for the scheme. The MPs have sought a directive from the Centre to stop the State from forging ahead with SilverLine. They have addressed the petition to Union Minister of Railways Ashwini Vaishnav. At ‘variance’ with KPCC Mr. Tharoor appears to have further threatened his standing with the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) by a tweet that seems to endorse the developmental activities of the Left Democratic Front government. After meeting Mr. Vijayan at a private function on Thursday, Mr. Tharoor tweeted: “Enjoyed discussing Kerala’s development with CM@vijayanpinarayi. On some issues, it is necessary to put political differences aside & get on with growth. The young people of our State deserve opportunities that the current economic situation does not offer them”. The tweet immediately drew flak from top Congress leaders. Former KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said Mr. Tharoor had made a habit of putting the Congress in a spot. “Tharoor may be a diplomat, writer and orator. But he is foremost a Congress worker. The MP has to tow the party line. Or else, the high command should discipline him,” Mr. Ramachandran said. UDF stand ‘undermined’ Mr. Ramachandran said Mr. Tharoor’s statement has undermined the UDF’s studied position on K-Rail and advantaged Mr. Vijayan. Breaking with party line is not new to Mr. Tharoor. Earlier, he had endorsed an allegedly pro-Bharatiya Janata Party private group’s takeover of the Thiruvananthapuram international airport against the KPCC’s official line. He is also a member of the G-23 group of leaders who have batted for organisational elections in the party. Mr. Tharoor has reportedly demurred signing the UDF petition purportedly to study the SilverLine’s economic and environmental viability. Stance flayed However, Mr. Ramachandran refused to subscribe to the view. “Even children in Kerala know K-Rail does not augur well for the State,” he said. The government has welcomed Mr. Tharoor’s stance. Industries Minister P. Rajeeve said it reflected public opinion. Kerala development should remain above partisan politics. KPCC protest today KPCC president K. Sudhakaran is scheduled to inaugurate the Statewide anti-SilverLine campaign here on Saturday. He was likely to seek an explanation from Mr. Tharoor. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said the party would examine Mr. Tharoor’s statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tharoor-puts-a-dampener-on-udf-stir/article37982874.ece

18 December 2021||Belagavi/Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cong. MLA apologises for rape comment||A day after a flippant comment on rape created an uproar, former Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar on Friday tendered an unconditional apology in the Legislative Assembly. ‘Quoted a saying’ Soon after the House proceedings started, Mr. Kumar said: “I had only quoted a saying. I had no intention of bringing down the honour of the House or insulting women. I tender my apology without conditions.” Further, he said: “I have tried to live respectfully. To whoever is affected, especially women, if my statement has caused hurt, I apologise.” He also requested the House to not continue with the matter. Prior to this, he tweeted an apology, “I would like to express my sincere apologies to everyone for the indifferent and negligent comment I made in the Assembly about rape. My intention was not to trivialise or make light of the heinous crime, but an off-the-cuff remark! I will choose my words carefully henceforth!” Many other Congress leaders, including AICC general secretary in charge of Karnataka Randeep Singh Surjewala and KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar, tweeted disapproving of the comment. The KPCC chief further said: “While we note that the legislator has tendered an apology, the incident in the Assembly is a sign that all of us men in politics need to do better to shed our inherent regressive attitude towards women.” On Thursday evening, during a discussion on floods, when Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri expressed helplessness about not being able to curtain the long speeches of members, Mr. Kumar had said: “There is a saying.. when rape is inevitable, lie down and enjoy it.” Mr. Kageri had laughed aloud in response and none in the House had objected to Mr. Kumar’s comment. Speaker’s response Soon after Mr. Kumar tendered an apology in the House on Friday, the Speaker said, “We are in a family. All of us have emotional bonds with everyone. All of us have the same respect towards women and we are committed to protecting women. There is no need to continue (discussion on) the issue.” Karnataka has, on more than one occasion, seen people’s representatives making insensitive remarks about rape. After the gang-rape of a medical student in Mysuru in August 2020, Home Minister Araga Jnanendra said the Opposition was politicising the incident and “raping him”. He had initially said it was a “joke” and later apologised. Mr. Kumar, when he was Speaker, had drawn the ire of women members by comparing himself to a rape survivor.     Congress disapproves the highly objectionable and insensitive banter between Karnataka Assembly Speaker and senior Congress MLA in the House. Speaker as custodian and senior legislators are expected to be role models and should desist from such unacceptable behaviour. Randeep Singh Surjewala AICC general secretary in charge of Karnataka   It is not about a person being from Congress or BJP. Women members wanted the House to apologise because members present were also part of it.

We are also experimenting and the cultivation of strawberry in Agency areas is giving good results,” said the Minister. Vice Chairman of Agricultural Mission M.V.S.

18 December 2021||GUNTUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Reports on proposed ORR baseless: Perni||Objecting to ‘baseless reports’ being published in a section of the media on the proposed Outer Ring Road (ORR) around Vijayawada, Minister for Transport Perni Venkatramaiah said the publications are targeting the State government at the behest of TDP supremo N. Chandrababu Naidu. Addressing reporters, the Minister said that the previous TDP government had in 2016-17 sent a proposal to the Centre to build a 198-km long Outer Ring Road at a cost of Rs. 17,762 crore, and stated that 8,213 acres of land would have to be acquired from farmers for the project. The Centre had suggested to the State to complete the land acquisition to proceed further, Mr. Venkataramaiah said. The Transport Minister said that the Central government had sidelined the project after the TDP government showed no interest in taking the project ahead, and added that some vernacular publications were spreading misinformation without highlighting the fact that Mr. Naidu failed to acquire any land for the project. “Mr. Naidu should remember that both the Benz Circle flyover and Kanaka Durga flyover were completed by the Jagan Mohan Reddy government. Did Mr. Naidu ever sanction a bypass road for Vijayawada? Has he done anything to ease Vijayawada’s traffic woes? Mr. Jagan has sanctioned a bypass road from Chinna Avutupalli to the Kaza toll plaza to address the traffic problems and it will be completed by 2023,” Mr. Perni Nani said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/reports-on-proposed-orr-baseless-perni/article37983076.ece
18 December 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||Don’t light fire on train, devotees told||If you are blissfully sleeping while travelling by a long distance train and are suddenly awakened by the smell of burning camphor or incense sticks, would it scare you? Apparently, there have been instances of Sabarimala-bound Ayyappa Swamy devotees performing daily worship inside the train by lighting incense sticks, alarming travelling railway personnel. Public advisory This year, the South Central Railway (SCR) has issued a public advisory, urging devotees travelling in these pilgrim special trains to Kerala not to perform ‘aarti’ as part of ‘puja’ by burning camphor and lighting of match sticks/ incense sticks inside the coaches since carrying inflammable materials and lighting fire in any form in trains or other railway premises is strictly prohibited. “Such acts pose grave threat to safety and may result in fire hazards endangering human lives and railway property too. These activities constitute a punishable offence, for which the offender is liable to be punished with imprisonment up to three years or a fine of Rs. 1,000 or both, besides being liable for the loss/ injury or damage caused,” said the official communique. Sabarimala special trains, incidentally, are being run after a year’s gap, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. These special trains being run from Thursday are originating from various stations spread over the zone – Secunderabad, Hyderabad, Kacheguda, Kakinada, Tirupati, Nanded, etc – and will be stopping at several stations en route. “We have issued the alert to make the train journey safer for all passengers as there were such incidents in previous years. We used to carry close to two lakh passengers in many specials from within SCR zone alone between mid-October and January-end before COVID. Last year, it was zero. Many pilgrims prefer trains because it is economical when compared to other modes of transport and convenient too besides being safe for a 30-hour journey,” said a senior official, wishing to remain anonymous. 19 specials About 19 specials have been planned so far this year and these are a mix of AC, sleeper and general compartments with the fares ranging from Rs. 2,800 to Rs. 2,000, Rs. 800 and Rs. 400 depending upon the preferred mode of the travelling coach. Senior officials also informed that the railway personnel would ensure COVID protocol is ‘strictly’ adhered to, with intensive checks to be taken up by the Railway Protection Force and commercial branch officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/dont-light-fire-for-prayer-in-sabarimala-bound-trains-scr/article37982783.ece

18 December 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||PG medicos call off strike||Postgraduate medical students or junior residents of government medical colleges in the State who have been on an indefinite strike boycotting all hospital services, including emergency services (except COVID-19 duty), called off their strike on Friday morning. Representatives of the Kerala Medical Postgraduates’ Association (KMPGA), which had been leading the strike, said they had all rejoined duty on Friday morning. The medicos had held a round of talks with Health Minister Veena George on Wednesday. Though the issue of posting more non-academic junior residents (NAJRs) to reduce the heavy workload of PG medicos and the demand for a 4% hike in stipend were raised, the Minister had been non-committal. Oral assurances Though the medicos were given only some promises regarding their grievances, the students willingly rejoined emergency duties on Thursday, saying that the talks had ended on a positive note. They, however, had refused to totally withdraw from their agitation. However, in a sudden development, after they met the Chief Minister’s private secretary on Thursday, the KMPGA decided to call off the strike. The KMPGA said it had been given oral assurances from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) that their demand for stipend hike would be met after examining the financial commitment involved. Though their demand for more NAJRs was ruled out citing fund crunch, it was promised that the matter would be examined. But a terse note from the CMO on Friday denied that any talks had been held. When contacted, some senior medical college faculty expressed disappointment that the government had been “dismissive” and “unconcerned” about the welfare of medicos who had been working inhuman hours. “They might have been forced to call off agitation but if these medicos were to strictly follow the residency manual and stick to work-to-rule, patient-care services will be badly affected,” a senior clinician said.

18 December 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Rayalaseema leaders join Amaravati cause||Several leaders hailing from the Rayalaseema region expressed their support to the Amaravati farmers’ demand on the capital, saying that the ‘capital shift’ will not benefit the region, but cause unnecessary rift among districts. Of all the speakers at the mammoth public meeting held at Daminedu here on Friday, the addresses by leaders hailing from the Rayalaseema region were watched with keen interest. The support assumes significance in the wake of the back-to-back meetings and rallies planned by leaders championing the cause of Rayalaseema a day before, and a day after the conclusion of Amaravati Padayatra in Tirupati. Former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu flayed the YSRCP regime for trying to paint Amaravati black by calling the river-side region as flood-prone and unfit for construction, apart from making baseless charges on the nonexistent ‘insider trading’. He took a dig at the rally taken out by Rayalaseema Intellectual Forum a day ahead in Tirupati, adding that college students were ‘forcibly’ made to participate. ‘CM has let down the region’ N. Amarnatha Reddy and N. Kishore Kumar Reddy, both hailing from Chittoor district and having served in the Naidu Cabinet, accused Mr. Jagan of letting down Rayalaseema by taking a ‘U turn’ on the issue. They further accused the State government of attempting to bring in a divide in the social fabric in the name of caste. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vice-president C. Adinarayana Reddy said retaining the capital at Amaravati would not harm the interests of Rayalaseema.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/rayalaseema-leaders-join-amaravati-cause/article37982999.ece

18 December 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Real estate interest behind padayatra, says Peddireddi||Minister for Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy has termed the “Amaravati padayatra” and the entire movement as being driven by real estate interests, and dubbed the participants as not genuine farmers. Speaking to the media at the Renigunta airport here on Friday, he accused the Telugu Desam Party of driving the movement from behind, which he said was evident from the presence of its president N. Chandrababu Naidu at the concluding public meeting. The Minister accused Mr. Naidu of trying to benefit a single community and to prevent the asset value in the region from taking a dip. “He is shouting at the top of his voice to get value for his landed property in Amaravati,” Mr. Reddy alleged. Accusing the political parties such as the BJP, CPI and Congress of riding piggyback on the TDP on this ‘non-issue’, Mr. Reddy wondered how many votes could they collectively get to take on the ruling party. “The meeting showed Naidu’s eagerness to join hands with the BJP to fulfil his dream of becoming the Chief Minister once again,” he said. Mr. Reddy made it clear that the YSRCP would go it alone in the ensuing elections, as Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was against cobbling up “unholy alliances”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/real-estate-interest-behind-padayatra-says-peddireddi/article37982986.ece

18 December 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||TTD sets the ball rolling on energy conservation||The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) is all set to conserve energy in a big way using world-class energy efficient technologies to become one of the top eco-friendly and energy efficient pilgrim centres across the globe. The Union Ministry of Power-led Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has given its consent to the Andhra Pradesh State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM), Energy Department, Government of Andhra Pradesh for implementing energy efficiency measures in TTD, its allied temples and choultries. During a webinar with the Secretary, Energy Department and SECM officials on Friday, near Vijayawada, on the eve of National Energy Conservation Week-2021, TTD Executive Officer K.S. Jawahar Reddy said the TTD is leaving no stone unturned to ensure the best service for devotees. “Eco-friendly energy efficient practices are important areas for which we would like to showcase TTD as a world-class energy efficient temple. These measures shall also help in providing better services to the devotees,” he said. He thanked Union Secretary Abhay Bhakre and the State Energy Department for coming forward to implement energy efficient measures. “The initiative will encourage others to look at eco-friendly solutions. We would like to turn TTD into a role model in energy efficiency not only in the country but also across the globe,” he said. Energy Secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said that the focus of the State government is to provide high quality and affordable power supply, and added that the State is considered one of the best in promotion of renewable energy, innovative energy efficient technologies and best practices. The TTD is planning to install 2.2 MW rooftop solar systems at all educational institutions in Tirupati and TTD buildings in Tirumala with the support of State-level agencies such as New & Renewable Energy Development Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (NREDCAP). This apart, the TTD is also planning to promote electric mobility in Tirumala and Tirupati. Out of the total energy consumption of 68 MU per annum in TTD, around 30% of the consumption is being met from solar and wind power generation. The remaining 70% of electricity needs of 435 lakh units for TTD and its allied temples around Tirumala hills are being supplied by Andhra Pradesh Southern Power Distribution Corporation Limited (APSPDCL.) As per the recommendations of the third party accredited energy auditor of BEE, the TTD has decided to replace 5,000 ordinary fans with super-efficient Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) fans in the first phase with an investment of Rs. 1.35 crore with estimated energy savings of 0.88 Million Units per annum. On the likely energy savings in the initiative, APSECM Chief Executive Officer A. Chandrasekhara Reddy said that the TTD’s power bill, which is presently around Rs. 49 crore a year, will come down substantially. “The TTD’s annual spend on power is likely to come down by Rs. 4-5 crore in a phased manner through these initiatives in conservation and energy efficiency,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ttd-sets-the-ball-rolling-on-energy-conservation/article37982265.ece

The protest was part of two-day nationwide strike against the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021. All the banks were closed due to the strike on the second day on Friday. Addressing the gathering, Andhra Pradesh And Telangana Bank Employees’ Federation former vice president K.S. Rao said that in a developing economy, the public sector banks had to be further strengthened and expanded to accomplish the goals, aims and objectives of bank nationalisation of subserving the interests of the vast masses of this country. In this background, attempts to privatise our banks were unwarranted and counter-productive. In addition, privatisation would result in these banks and their vast resources being handed over to private hands. Banks represent huge and precious savings of the people and hence it was imperative that the government should be the custodian of the banks and the people’s money therein, he said. All India Bank Officers Association representative Avinash said that the employees were prepared to go to any extent, including indefinite strike, against the privatisation of banks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bank-staff-participate-in-second-day-of-strike/article37982537.ece

Mr. Atchannaidu alleged that the government was attempting to do so even though the court has accorded permission for the Maha Sabha. “Even the British did not suppress people like the Jagan Mohan Reddy regime is doing now. Unlawful arrests are being made and false cases being foisted on those who are raising people’s issues,” Mr. Atchannaidu said in a statement.

18 December 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||Jagan formally inaugurates NAD Flyover||The long-awaited inauguration of the NAD Flyover was completed with Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy formally dedicating it to the nation on Friday evening. Though the flyover was operational for the past several months, minor works were pending which were completed recently. The NAD Flyover and seven other development works, undertaken by the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) at a total cost of Rs. 186 crore, were inaugurated by the Chief Minister. The other works virtually inaugurated from the NAD Flyover were: a commercial complex constructed at a cost of Rs. 7.60 crore at Pithapuram Colony, widening of the 9 km stretch of road from Anandapuram Junction to Boni at cost of Rs. 7.55 crore, Peda Rushikonda Beach Master Plan Road, which was widened at a cost of Rs. 7.50 crore, the Visakha Valley Road developed at a cost of Rs. 6.97 crore, a kalyana mandapam built at a cost of Rs. 5.14 crore at China Mushidiwada and a community hall constructed at Thatichetlapalem at a cost of Rs. 1.56 crore.

Interacting with reporters, he said that the State government was committed to the development of all three regions of Andhra Pradesh through decentralised development. He said that concentration of development at one place, like it was done in the case of Hyderabad in the past, would once again see demands for further division of Andhra Pradesh over a period of time. The Tourism Minister asserted that there was no going back on the decision to make Visakhapatnam an executive capital and Kurnool the judicial capital of the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cm-formally-inaugurates-nad-flyover/article37983078.ece
18 December 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||Cows abandoned by police at Gyanananda Ashram, alleges TDP||The abandoning of a large number of cows, allegedly by the Anandapuram police, at Gyanananda Ashram, near Venkojipalem, here, has drawn flak from people’s representatives. Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MLA Velagapudi Ramakrishna Babu and Jana Sena Party (JSP) Corporator Peethala Murthy Yadav visited the Ashram on Friday and provided fodder to the cows. Mr. Ramakrishna Babu alleged that 180 cows, which were being illegally transported to Hyderabad and Kerala for slaughter, in three vans, were intercepted by the police on Monday. The cows were left at the Ashram. He said that the Swamiji of the Ashram was away on a tour to Puri and the cows were dying of starvation. The police could have shifted the cows to the Gosala of Simhachalam temple or Sri Sarada Peetham at Pendurthy. He alleged that about a dozen cows had died of starvation. Veterinary staff, brought by the MLA, administered fluids to some of the cows, which were in a critical condition. He said that some of the dead cows were buried by the ashram staff. He called the endowment officials on the mobile phone and directed them to take immediate steps for saving the cows by deputing veterinary doctors. Mr. Yadav said that 160 cows were purchased at the Narayanavalasa shandy in Srikakulam district and were being shifted to Hyderabad, when the vehicles were intercepted by the Anandapuram police at Mamidilova. The police shifted cows to the Gyanananda Ashram and left there. He alleged that the cows had no fodder since Tuesday. He alleged that the action of the police in dumping the cows at the Ashram, which has no money for the maintenance of ashram, gives rise to the suspicion that some vested interests were operating behind the scene to harass the swamiji and drive him out of that place, in a bid to grab the land. He said that the shifting of the cows to Gyanananda Ashram, which was about 33 km away from Mamidilova, instead of Sri Sarada Peetham, which was just 17 km away, further strengthens the suspicion. He said that three to four cows at the ashram were in a critical position due to lack of food. He demanded immediate action for the protection of the cows.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cows-abandoned-by-police-at-gyanananda-ashram-alleges-tdp/article37983027.ece

18 December 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||Almost all projects inaugurated by CM were initiated during TDP rule: Palla||Almost all the projects that were inaugurated by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday, were initiated when Telugu Desam Party (TDP) was governing the State, in its last term. The projects were not only initiated but also funds were allotted and a major portion of the works were also completed by the TDP, said party Visakhapatnam Urban president and former MLA Palla Srinivasa Rao. Addressing the media here on Friday, he said that the Chief Minister cannot take credit for the projects just by inaugurating them. Mr. Srinivasa Rao said officials should explain why the 35,000 houses, that were constructed by the TDP in 2017, when it was in power, was not being allotted to the beneficiaries. The houses were constructed by TIDCO and the base amount was also collected from beneficiaries, he said. He urged the Chief Minister to forego ego and think humanely, as the people were suffering in the winter without the houses. “Just because it was TDP’s project, the CM cannot inconvenience people to satisfy his personal ego and for some political gains. The CM should direct the officials concerned to verify the list of beneficiaries and allot them houses as soon as possible,” he demanded. The TDP leader also took objection to the OTS (one-time settlement) scheme and demanded that the government revoke the order. “Instead of charging a fee for regularisation, the government should regularise the land that was given to the BPL segment, for free. Under GOs 296 and 388 over 60,000 pattas were already given and now they are caught in a limbo,” he said. The TDP leader alleged that it was a ploy to get some money from the people to fund the government’s welfare schemes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/almost-all-projects-inaugurated-by-cm-were-initiated-during-tdp-rule-palla/article37983088.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy has proposed three capitals for decentralised development of the State. Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N. Chandrababu Naidu, who is insisting on a single capital at Amaravati, should come out with the reason for it, Anakapalle MLA and YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) Spokesman Gudivada Amarnath has said. Addressing the media here on Friday,he said that those who were behind the padayatra for Amaravati were real estate agents, who want high price for their lands. He alleged that Mr. Naidu was trying to thrust his ideas on the people. He also alleged that the Jana Sena Party (JSP) president Pawan Kalyan has no definite stand and refers to the place, wherever he goes, as the capital. He said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, who had dubbed ‘Amaravati’ as a scam in the past, were now supporting it. It was unfortunate that the Left Parties, which stand for Communist ideology, were supporting the capitalists, he said. MLA Adeep Raj said that it was unfortunate that the TDP leaders from the region were silent, when injustice was being done to the people of North Andhra region. The success of the YSRCP in the local body elections has made it clear that people were supporting the idea of three capitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/real-estate-agents-behind-amaravati-padayatra-alleges-ysr-congress/article37983087.ece

An estimated 95% of the total eligible population of 7,94,206 adults in the district have already been vaccinated with one dose. A little over 49% of the district’s eligible adult population received both doses till date, sources said. The administration has been carrying out the vaccination drive in a mission mode since its launch to ensure cent percent coverage of all the eligible population in the district in September. Challenges The hard-to-reach areas in the vast tribal hinterland and location of many tribal habitations in fringe areas of the forest posed multiple challenges to the field-level Health functionaries entrusted with the task of motivating eligible adults among the tribal communities to inoculate themselves, sources added. Meanwhile, Collector D. Anudeep charted out an action plan to accelerate the vaccination drive in the next few days to accomplish the task. The plan focuses on achieving greater synergy among the frontline functionaries of all the concerned government departments at the field level. Mobile teams The plan envisages deployment of mobile vaccination teams at important public places in Bhadrachalam, the famous pilgrim centre and the gateway to the vast tribal region, and elsewhere in the district to ramp up the drive and cover the district’s entire eligible population in less than a fortnight.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/racing-against-time-to-reach-jab-target/article37982806.ece
18 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Rythu Bandhu will continue sans restrictions, says KCR||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has cleared the air on continuing the Rythu Bandhu scheme without any restrictions, following a suggestion from the Agriculture Department that it should not be extended to farmers who cultivate paddy in the Rabi season. He said on Friday that the scheme would be continued as long as he heads the State. He asked the party ranks to stage protests in different forms starting from the village level on December 20 against the Centre’s ‘attitude’ on procurement of paddy pertaining to Kharif season itself. According to party leaders, burning of effigies of the BJP-led Centre and Unions Ministers speaking ‘lies and spreading misinformation’ would be part of the protests. The paddy procurement issue and implementation of Rythu Bandhu and Dalit Bandhu schemes came up for discussion at the TRS executive meeting chaired by KCR here on Friday. MPs, legislators, chairpersons of Zilla Parishads, DCCB and DCMS, and nominated chiefs of State corporations took part in the meeting. The CM is understood to have said that he had given the word on the floor of the Assembly that he would “continue the scheme without any restrictions” as long as he leads the State. He was said to have expressed anguish over the Centre’s stand and asked party leaders to explain facts to people and create awareness among farmers not to go for paddy in Rabi season as the Centre had made it crystal clear that it would no longer procure parboiled rice produced during the season. He asked them to rebut the Opposition criticism on Dalit Bandhu or any other scheme of the State Government and stated that Dalit Bandhu would be extended across the State in a phased manner. In a message to party leaders, particularly MLAs, the CM observed that some leaders were silent in constituencies and said that they would suffer if they continued to be dormant. He asked them to pull up their socks and become active and take everybody along to strengthen the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rythu-bandhu-will-continue-sans-restrictions-says-kcr/article37982792.ece
18 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TRS MPs, Ministers plan another visit to Delhi||A delegation of TRS MPs and a half-a-dozen Ministers will leave for Delhi on Saturday to meet Union Ministers concerned and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to impress upon them on the need to increase the quantity of Kharif paddy procurement. The decision was taken at a party meeting chaired by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday. The Ministers of Agriculture, Civil Supplies, Energy, Roads and Building, Transport and Panchayat Raj would go to Delhi along with the MPs. Giving details to the media after the meeting, Minister for Agriculture Niranjan Reddy along with Minister G. Jagadish Reddy and V. Srinivas Goud and MP K. Keshava Rao said that their visit was necessitated as procurement of Kharif paddy had almost reached the quantity agreed upon by the Centre (Food Corporation of India) this year till Friday and more than half of paddy was yet to be harvested and reach procurement centres. Mr. Niranjan Reddy stated that the Centre had made it clear that it would no longer procure parboiled rice, which is produced in Telangana during the Rabi season. However, it was also creating problems in the procurement of Kharif paddy after making it clear several times that it had no problems on the quantity of raw rice, which is produced in Kharif season. He explained that the FCI had agreed to procure 59.6 lakh tonnes of paddy or 40 lakh tonnes of raw rice for 2021-22 Kharif and as of Friday, the procurement of paddy was about 55 lakh tonnes. Stating that paddy is cultivated in 62.13 lakh acres in Kharif, against 58.6 lakh acres as estimated by the Centre, he said production of paddy would be in the range of 1.3 crore tonnes to 1.5 crore tonnes at an yield of 24-25 quintals per acre. He said that harvesting was yet to be completed, and harvested grain was yet to reach procurement centres. He alleged that Minister Piyush Goyal and other Union Ministers were speaking lies on paddy procurement issue. He also blamed the FCI for not lifting the rice pertaining to the last Rabi season lying in godowns of rice mills. On alternative crops, the Minister said that groundnut and Bengal gram cultivation had actually crossed 5 lakh acres each. Green gram was also likely to go up as it would be sown in paddy fields after harvesting Kharif crop. He admitted that there was shortage of sunflower seed this season but it would be made available in required quantities from the next Rabi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-mps-ministers-plan-another-visit-to-delhi/article37982794.ece

The nine items approved in the second standing committee meeting too might be tabled for discussion, a source has informed. The standing committee has all 15 member corporators elected from TRS and MIM parties and not a single one from BJP, as the corporators from the latter abstained from the election seeing no hope for being elected. Of the 150 elected council members, TRS is represented by 56 corporators, BJP by 47, MIM by 44 and Congress by three. These apart, there would be ex-officio members who include representatives to the State Legislature from the city. While with support from MIM, the TRS may sail through getting nod for all the proposals tabled, there is ample chance for the opposition to raise its voice over various issues plaguing the city.

Sources said the number of ATMs that were not working was more compared to Thursday, presumably on account of the machines running out of cash.

18 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||No farmer suicides in Medak from 2019 till June this year||On February 6, 2019, 53-year-old Ramavath Rupla of Sheritanda in Koudipally mandal of Medak district ended his life by hanging. He dug two borewells that had failed. Paddy and maize crops were badly hit due to drought conditions adding to his woes of an existing debt of Rs. 2.5 lakh. On February 23, 2019, 45-year-old Golla Chinna Shankaraiah, a farmer belonging to Achampet village in Narsapur mandal, had ended his life by hanging. He was unable to come out of the agriculture debt he had. Before taking the extreme step he moved around several villages to find out a solution for his problem. On March 8, 2019, 55-year-old Maddi Anjaiah, a farmer of Katriyal village in Ramayampet mandal, had attempted suicide by consuming pesticide. He was shifted to Gandhi Hospital where he died while undergoing treatment. All these three incidents took place within one month in Medak district alone and all were registered by the police. However, these were not mentioned in the list of farmers’ suicides from Medak district in the information provided under RTI Act sought by B. Kondal Reddy of Rythu Swarajya Vedika. The reply to the information showed no farmer suicide deaths for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 till June 30. This has become a serious question for many NGOs working on farmers’ issues on the actual number of farmers who had committed suicide in the last seven years in Telangana and how many of these deaths were actually registered in the records. “We have requested information under RTI Act from the office of Superintendent of Police, Medak, about the farmers suicides in Medak district since 2014 June. The information provided by officials claimed that there were no deaths for three years,” Mr. Kondal Reddy told The Hindu||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-farmer-suicides-in-medak-from-2019-till-june-this-year/article37983037.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao to immediately release a white paper on vacant posts in the government, halt the orders issued on employees’ transfers and take it up only after discussing the issue with them. In an open letter to the Chief Minister, a copy of which was released to the media, the BJP leader criticised the TRS government for releasing the orders on transfers without much thought in a tearing hurry and this leading to much disenchantment as many could be deprived of an opportunity to work in their respective districts. He pointed out that the government had earlier issued orders to transfer employees with three years experience as per the presidential orders but this was allowed to lapse. “It is shameful that the government did not think of discussing the issue with legal experts and employee unions before issuing the latest orders. The inordinate delay in framing service rules for new districts and zones reflects the government functioning,” the BJP leader said. Mr. Sanjay Kumar said the current orders are likely to end up in legal tangles if the government is adamant about sticking to them. He also expressed the fear that the present situation could lead to many districts getting deprived of fresh job notifications. The BJP leader called for completion of talks with employee union leaders within 15 days and take up steps to begin the process of filling the vacant posts by issuing notifications within a month. “BJP will continue to keep up the pressure on the government till it listens to the grievances of aggrieved employees and the unemployed youth,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-demands-white-paper-on-vacancies-halt-in-transfers/article37982798.ece

He stated that the government was reimbursing full fee for students getting ranks below 10,000 in engineers and others were being reimbursed only Rs. 35,000 a year. Some students were unable to continue education due to their inability to bear the remaining fee, he pointed out.

The award is in recognition of the development of GAGAN-enabled mariner and instrument for navigation and information (GEMINI) system for dissemination of ocean information services such as potential fishing zones advisories, ocean state forecasts, high wave alerts, tsunami early warning services, etc. to fishermen and seagoing community. GEMINI system addresses one of the major and critical communication gaps faced by the fishermen community once the seafarers go beyond the communication range of mobiles in the ocean. The very high frequency (VHF) sets also have limited coverage in the ocean and there have been several instances where fishermen venturing into deep-sea fishing have suffered loss of life, injuries, damages to fishing crafts, etc., pointed out INCOIS director T. Srinivasa Kumar. The Ministry of Earth Sciences institute here at Pragatinagar in association with the Airports Authority of India developed the low-cost GAGAN system-enabled GEMINI receiver that can be used to broadcast the messages as far as 6,000 km in the sea. The in-house developed GEMINI mobile app connects to the GEMINI receiver, decodes, and displays the information in easily understandable format. ‘Robust satellite’ “This is a robust satellite based cost-effective dissemination system, and user-friendly data distribution systems in vernacular languages,” he explained, in a press release. INCOIS has been serving its user community including fishermen, Navy, ONGC, shipping industry, researchers, students, etc., during last two decades. In addition to the GEMINI system, it disseminates the ocean information services through various mediums like telephone/fax, e-mail, web, SMS, local newspapers, local radio, local TV channels, electronic display boards installed at fishing harbours/fish landing centers, IVRS, voice messages, 24x7 help-line system, etc., the release added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cii-industrial-innovation-award-for-incois/article37982781.ece

Sukumar’s Telugu film Pushpa - The Rise , set in the Seshachalam forest bordering Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, a character makes a frenzied announcement to Pushparaj (Allu Arjun) that the cops are on their trail, with their eyes on the red sandalwood stocked in the godown. What follows in the next few minutes shows yet again why Telugu filmmakers excel in making masala segments that capture viewers’ imagination. How Pushpa hoodwinks the cops and secures the red sandalwood might seem tough in reality, but a larger-than-life Telugu film will make the audiences give into that suspension of disbelief.  Pushpa - The Rise, the first instalment of the two-part gangster drama, traces rise of the shrewd protagonist from a daily wager to controlling the smuggling syndicate. The story takes place when pagers were in vogue and mobile phones a luxury. The cat and mouse game between the cops and smugglers in the opening segment serves to show what makes Pushpa stand out from others of his ilk. Wesee him through the eyes of daily wager Kesava (Jagadeesh Prathap Bandari makes a mark) who goes on to be his loyal apprentice. It’s a ‘meeting story’ when we are introduced to Pushpa’s audacity to want a lot more than the pittance that the coolies are doled out. Pushpa’s only vulnerability is when someone mocks him of his origins. Sukumar gives Pushpa a characteristic gait with a raised right shoulder and an ever-present swagger, but never actually makes him vulnerable. Not even when he is taking on supposedly ruthless kingpins at every step of the smuggling syndicate. The three smuggler brothers hardly pose a threat to Pushpa. Despite the want of more depth in the characterisation, Allu Arjun makes Pushparaj striking. He owns the swagger and is in control of things. He exudes the shrewdness required for his part and brings in restraint in the emotional portions. The much-hyped special song featuring Samantha Ruth Prabhu elicits the expected response cheers in the theatre but you can’t help wondering if someone of her stature and calibre needed to do this. But the biggest disappointment is Fahadh Faasil. The second part will see a lot more of him, but the little we get of him in this film is a dampener. You don’t need a Fahadh Faasil for an over the top opponent.

Speaking on calling attention motion brought in the House surrounding Haryana Private Universities (Amendment) Bill, Chief Minister Manohar Lal said that like earlier, the appointment of Vice-Chancellors in universities will be done through the Governor, who is the Chancellor of all the universities. CM Manohar Lal Khattar too clarified that the Government alone used to appoint the Registrar until now. “The appointment of Group-B, non-teaching, Group C and D and assistant professors will be done as per the new provisions,” he added. Forceful imposition Opposing the Bill, Leader of Opposition and Congress member Bhupinder Singh Hooda said: “This Bill is being forcefully imposed in Haryana and all universities, students and teachers are opposing this bill. There is still time for the Government to understand or it may end up facing the same fate as the farm laws.” Mr. Hooda added: “The Government is going to open another loot shop in the State as it is going to hand over the future of the students to the institution – the Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC), which has already betrayed job seekers in the State. Do not bring laws that work against students, and which will spoil the future of our children. Let universities continue to be run by the universities,” he said. Education Minister Kanwar Pal said, “The State Government provides complete independence to the State universities in academic and administrative matters. There is complete transparency in the affairs of universities.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cong-opposes-haryana-private-universities-bill/article37982892.ece
18 December 2021||GURUGRAM,||No clarity on namaz in the open, say Muslim groups||Uncertainty prevailed over offering Friday prayers (Jumma namaz) in open spaces on Friday after Chief Minister Manohar Lal categorically stated last week that religious activities should be confined to religious places and namaz at public places would not be tolerated. “We met the Deputy Commissioner this Wednesday, but he did not offer any clarity on the matter. We tried to contact his office again on Thursday, but there was no response. The Muslims went to offer prayers at the 20-odd designated places agreed upon last month, but they either faced resistance or were turned away by the police,” said Mufti Mohammad Saleem Qasmi, president of Jamiat-Ulama-i-Hind here. However, namaz was allowed at six places sought by the Gurgaon Imam Sangathan in a letter to the Deputy Commissioner earlier this month. Mr. Qasmi said the administration should make its stand clear and pave way for the “amicable solution” to the controversy as suggested by the Chief Minister. Verbal confrontation In a verbal confrontation between the two communities, some right-wing group members insisted that those reaching a park in Udyog Vihar Phase-V area for Friday prayers should chant slogans before being allowed to offer the prayers. Later, some of those who had gathered said they offers prayers in the park since the mosque was far from their workplace and their employer did not allow them any extra time beyond the lunch break. “There are children playing football in the park and some others are roaming around. How does it make a difference if we peacefully offer our prayers for a few minutes?” asked Abdul. Later, the police reached the spot to diffuse the situation. Altaf Ahmad, spokesperson, Gurgaon Muslim Council, said vigilantism seemed to have taken over law and order of Gurugram. Udyog Vihar Phase-V incident was just one of the examples. He added that the far right-wing groups were now deciding on how and where to offer Jumma Namaz. Khurshid Rajaka, national convener, Muslim Rashtriya Manch, however, said that Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) Deepak Saharan had, in a meeting with Gurgaon Imam Sangathan on Thursday, directed them to offer namaz only at the six new places. Dr. Garg did not respond to calls and messages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/no-clarity-on-friday-prayers-in-the-open/article37982692.ece

Principal Rural Development Secretary Aparna Arora said a detailed action plan would be formulated shortly, covering all aspects of branding, quality control, packaging and marketing of women’s products. The cluster-level groups would be strengthened in order to equip them to supply the products to meet the demand in the market, she said. According to the RGAVP’s estimate, about 27.18 lakh rural women are associated with the SHGs. Linking the SHGs with each other has also led the establishment of community investment funds and ensured financial inclusion of underprivileged sections. The RGAVP declared Ruma Devi, a Barmer-based traditional handicraft artisan and a recipient of the Nari Shakti Puraskar in 2018, as its brand ambassador. Rural Development Minister Ramesh Chand Meena said that Ms. Devi had provided guidance for women’s upliftment and recognising her would help strengthen the rural economy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/rs-2400-crore-shot-in-the-arm-for-womens-shgs/article37982894.ece
18 December 2021||Kolkata,||Campaign ends for KMC election||The campaign for elections to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) concluded on Friday with leaders giving last-minute push for their parties and contesting candidates. The polling is scheduled for December 19 across 4,939 booths in the city. Elections to the 144 wards of the KMC will be held without deployment of central armed police forces after a Division Bench of Chief Justice Prakash Srivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj on Friday rejected BJP’s plea for the same. The court said, “So far, no instance of violence has been pointed out nor along with the writ petition, any such material has been enclosed which furnishes a ground for deployment of the Central Paramilitary Forces in the forthcoming Kolkata Municipal Corporation Elections.” Meanwhile, TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, during a roadshow in south Kolkata, said if any party worker was found indulging in irregularities, he or she would be expelled. He added that the BJP will allege irregularities on the polling day since it is going to lose the polls. The TMC leader claimed that of the 144 wards in KMC, his party will win 135. The State Election Commission has made special security arrangements for Sunday’s polls.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/campaign-ends-for-kmc-election/article37982891.ece
18 December 2021||New Delhi,||Court stays action against pan masala firm on advertising||A Delhi court has stayed a notice issued to a pan masala company pertaining to surrogate advertising of it’s products. Additional Sessions Judge Rajinder Singh in his order said, if during the pendency of the suit, the advertisement is stopped “it will cause loss of revenue as well as goodwill which will be irreparable.” The case pertains to a notice issued to Dilbaag Pan Masala by Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) for advertising tobacco products through a hoarding at Dabri flyover in 2018 which, it said, was in violation of the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003. The judge, in his order allowed the company to continue selling its pan masala as per law saying, “If the product of a manufacturer is missing from the market for sometime, it is not probable for the said product to make a comeback.” As per case records, the company sells pan masala under the brand name Dilbagh, among other established products of Dilbagh brand. On April 25, it received a notice from DGHS saying that the company was indulging in surrogate or indirect advertising of Dilbagh tobacco and gutkha products in violation of the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 (COTPA). However, the company responded in writing that COTPA does not apply to the product in question. It said that the sale advertisement, manufacturing, transport etc. of gutkha is banned throughout the country, unless it is meant for export. It further said that the advertisement of pan masala is not prohibited by law. “Dilbagh pan masala does not contain any prohibited substances in violation of any law and/or COTPA Act,” it contended. During the proceedings, DGHS claimed that the advertisement in question was and indirect one for the brand promotion of Dilbagh gutkha/products. It said that the company, while promoting Dilbagh products, had put up a big hoarding at the Dabri Flyover for the event of “Khatu Shyam Katha” and community marriage function to be held at Dabri Palam Road. The company contested that its pan masala was 100 per cent tobacco free and that there was no reason to carry out surrogate advertisement for a product which it cannot sell. To this, DGHS claimed that as a general practice, tobacco pouches were also sold with pan masala pouches. “The plaintiff can carry out its advertisement campaign with regard to the product in question till the final disposal of the suit,” Mr. Singh noted. The company had moved the court seeking permanent injunction restraining the DGHS from directly or indirectly interfering into the business of its products and sought Rs. 5 lakh as damages.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-court-stays-action-against-pan-masala-firm-on-advertising/article37982691.ece
18 December 2021||New Delhi,||Woman dragged for 100 metres while trying to foil snatching bid||A 23-year-old woman was dragged for about 100 metres on the road while trying to thwart a mobile snatching attempt by two men on a scooter in north-west Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh, the police said on Friday.

It was revealed that around 5.30 p.m., the victim, identified as Payal, who works with a private hospital as front office assistant, was on her way home. When she reached the traffic signal, two persons came on a scooter and the pillion passenger snatched her phone. But she caught hold of his jacket and was dragged along with the vehicle.

18 December 2021||New Delhi,||DU allows paid maternity leave for ad hoc and contractual employees||The executive council of Delhi University on Friday decided to grant paid maternity leave to ad hoc and contractual teaching and non-teaching staff. The long-standing demand made by ad hoc teachers was examined by a committee formed by the university. The panel in its report recommended that the university give maternity leave for a maximum period of 26 weeks to ad hoc and contractual staff within the specified period of such fixed term engagement. The recommendations of the committee said “recognising the fact that availing of maternity leave is a basic and vital necessity for the physical and emotional well-being of the mother and the child, the committee recommends that paid maternity leave be granted to ad hoc/contractual women teaching and non-teaching employees working in the university/colleges of the university”. It also said that the benefits may be made available to women with less than two surviving children. Welcoming the decision, Abha Dev Habib, secretary, Democratic Teachers’ Front, said that it was a big relief to thousands of women teachers working in the university and its colleges and it was the result of the continuous work of the teachers’ collective and many individuals. “The movement will continue to demand a Parliament order or UGC regulations for absorption of working teachers to bring the real relief and professional and academic growth these young teachers deserve,” Ms. Habib said. The executive council also passed a proposal to hold an entrance examination for undergraduate admissions from the 2022-23 season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/du-allows-paid-maternity-leave-for-ad-hoc-and-contractual-employees/article37982688.ece

18 December 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi HC calls for swift disposal of UAPA trials||Calling for a swift trial of cases where accused are charged under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the Delhi High Court on Friday sought its administration’s stand to streamline expeditious disposal of trials in such cases before the special designated courts here. Justice Mukta Gupta said “it is for the High Court to decide whether to transfer the cases (from the special designated courts to other courts) or have more courts”. She was hearing a petitionby an alleged Indian Mujahideen operative, who was arrested in 2013, seeking day-to-day hearing. The High Court observed that the cases under UAPA involved serious offences and foreign nationals, and it was not easy for those in custody to secure bail. “...Thus it is paramount that offences under UAPA, whether investigated by NIA (National Investigation Agency)or Delhi Police special cell, are tried by special designated courts expeditiously which have no other matters listed before it,” the High Court stated. The HC was informed that there are two designated special courts for NIA in Delhi and listing of non-UAPA cases had no impact on the status of UAPA cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-hc-calls-for-swift-disposal-of-uapa-trials/article37982695.ece

18 December 2021||Pune,||TMC in Goa: Mamata may have bitten more than she can chew||West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee’s second tour of Goa in less than two months culminated with her party formalising its alliance with the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) to take on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 40-seat Goa Assembly election scheduled early next year. However, political analysts said Ms. Banerjee’s Goa strategy is unlikely to yield the desired results. The problem, according to them, lies in its ideologically-opposed alliance with the MGP, Goa’s first ruling party following the Portuguese departure in 1961. Despite Ms. Banerjee projecting TMC-MGP as a “real alternative” in Goa, the MGP, once the State’s most influential party, has seen its fortunes decline over the years with just one MLA, Sudin Dhavalikar, in the present Assembly. The MGP’s Hindu vote-bank has been steadily eroded by the BJP over the last two decades. “Mr. Dhavalikar, who has kept the MGP in play, is known for his affinity to the radical rightwing Sanatan Sanstha. So, the TMC’s alliance with the MGP puts Ms. Banerjee’s strident ‘anti-Hindutva’ rhetoric in a spot,” said a senior Goa-based political analyst. The Sanatan Sanstha has come under the scanner in recent years for its alleged role in the murders of rationalist Dr. Narendra Dabholkar, Communist leader Govind Pansare, journalist Gauri Lankesh and scholar-rationalist M.M. Kalburgi. “The deal in the TMC-MGP alliance is that the TMC will contest in South Goa leaving the MGP to tackle the north. However, therein lies the rub. The MGP does not have much presence in north Goa while the TMC has virtually no foothold in the State,” said another election-watcher. In what could be called a political coup, former Chief Minister Luizinho Faleiro joined the TMC in September, followed by another former CM, Churchill Alemao, the sitting NCP legislator from Benaulim, joining TMC last week. “Mr. Faleiro and Mr. Churchill are local stalwarts. But if they win, it will be largely on the strength of their personal influence and not because of any grand vision the TMC may have for Goa. Ms. Banerjee’s efforts notwithstanding, her Goa strategy seems to be a case of overreach,” says a Mumbai-based poll analyst. “The BJP under its Goa election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis has been running a shrewd campaign. It has successfully dissuaded smaller parties and crucial independent players in casting their lot with the TMC. The BJP’s logic was simple: ‘will you keep going to Calcutta to get every small problem solved?’,” said a Mumbai-based election watcher. PM visit on Sunday The BJP is also expected to play the Goan pride card, evident from the scheduled visit of Prime minister Narendra Modi to Goa on Sunday, the 60th anniversary of the State’s liberation from Portuguese rule in 1961. “The BJP is trying to mesh the ‘Liberation Day’ and ‘son-of-the-soil’ celebratory feeling with the sentiment that political outsiders [read the TMC] cannot call the shots in Goa,” said another election-watcher. He observed that Ms. Banerjee may keep saying that Goans will control Goa and the State would not be remote controlled from Gujarat or Delhi, the perception that the TMC is alien to Goa’s soil is inescapable. However, the TMC may have an ace in tennis great Leander Paes, who joined the party recently. “If he [Mr. Paes] joins the fray, he is likely to be a major draw. Being a famous son, of Goa, he has a non-controversial image, as opposed to most politicians, and a formidable appeal that cuts across demographics,” said a local analyst.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/tmc-in-goa-mamata-may-have-bitten-more-than-she-can-chew/article37982886.ece
18 December 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra exam council chief held for fraud||In a development which raises serious questions on the conduct of fair examinations in Maharashtra, the Pune police have arrested two persons, including Commissioner of the Maharashtra State Council of Examination (MSCE) Tukaram Supe, in connection with alleged malpractices which include tampering with students’ marks in the Teachers Eligibility Test (TET). The MSCE is the State’s premier exam conducting body which organises the TET where diploma holders are required to be declared as ‘eligible candidates’ to secure jobs in schools and institutions run by the State Government and local self-governing bodies. Exam postponed According to authorities, the alleged malpractices in the TET, which was held in January 2020, came to light now during the probe of the recent question paper leak before the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) examination. The exam had been postponed by the Government on December 12 and is now scheduled to be held in mid-January next year. The police found more than Rs. 88 lakh in cash during search and seizure operations in Mr. Supe’s house, said Pune Commissioner of Police Amitabh Gupta. “Tukaram Supe, the Commissioner of MSCE, was arrested by the cyber cell of the Pune police following his questioning in the alleged malpractices in the TET examination late Thursday. Also arrested was Abhishek Savarikar, a consultant to the State Education department, on the charge of conniving with the director of the software company to tamper with the marks of some candidates during the TET,” Mr. Gupta said, adding more arrests were likely to follow. Six persons have already been arrested in the MHADA paper leak case, including Pritish Deshmukh, director of the same software firm which was contracted by the Government for conducting the TET exam. Mr. Deshmukh had been arrested on the intervening night of December 11 and 12 in the MHADA exam case, compelling Maharashtra Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad to announce postponement of the exam in a video message in the wee hours of December 12. Police said Mr. Supe and Mr. Savarikar were allegedly in cahoots with Mr. Deshmukh. “From what we have discovered so far, the trio had collected around Rs. 4.20 crore by charging anything between Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 1 lakh per candidate whose marks they then tampered with to make them eligible,” said Mr. Gupta. Embarrassment to Govt. The development comes as a major embarrassment to the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Government which has been facing criticism from irate students and the opposition BJP. The BJP has accused the MVA Government of gross inefficiency in conducting Government examinations by awarding contracts to dubious and blacklisted firms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/maharashtra-exam-council-chief-held-for-fraud-in-tet/article37982696.ece
18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||In dry Bihar, 84% of women face spousal violence, finds NFHS-5||Bihar was declared a dry State in April 2016 but the latest (2019-21) National Family Health Survey-5 report finds that “84% of women face spousal violence when their husbands get drunk often” and “61% of them face spousal violence when their husbands are drunk sometimes”. Bihar is second only to Karnataka (at 44%) with 40% of married women between the ages of 18 and 49 years subjected to spousal violence, said the report, adding, “spousal violence prevails in the State across all groups, although it is lower among more educated women and higher among currently married women (42%) and women married more than once (61%)”. The report also said that 43% of women face spousal violence when their husbands drink. In December 2020, the NFHS-5 had said that over 15% men above the age of 15 years “consume alcohol” in dry Bihar. The report had also said that nearly 77% women in Bihar have their own bank account and over 51% of them use mobile phones. Liquor from Nepal Most of the women, who told the 2019-21 NFHS-5 survey that their husbands drink, belong to districts sharing borders with the neighbouring States of Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, besides Nepal. “Liquor comes into Bihar from the areas bordering Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, and also from Nepal, while desi (countrymade) liquor is traditionally brewed in districts with tribal populations sharing borders with Jharkhand,” said Professor S. K. Singh of the International Institute for Population Sciences in Mumbai. Singh, along with Luxmi Kant Dwivedi, Chander Shekhar and Brajesh, had contributed to the NFHS-5 report. The report stated: “More than two-fifths (42%) of women have experienced both physical and sexual violence and the most common types of injuries among women ever-married who have experienced physical and sexual violence are cuts, bruises or aches (39%), deep wounds, broken bones, broken teeth or any other serious injury (17%), eye injuries, dislocations or minor burns (16%), and severe burns (4%).”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/in-dry-bihar-84-of-women-face-spousal-violence-finds-nfhs-5/article37982887.ece

18 December 2021||Moscow,||Russia drafts pact to limit U.S., NATO role in ex-Soviet nations||Russia on Friday unveiled proposals to contain the U.S. and NATO in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, calling for urgent negotiations with Washington as it amasses forces near Ukraine. The U.S. said it was willing to talk but stated upfront that it disagreed with much in the far-reaching proposals, as it renewed warnings of painful reprisals if Russia invades Ukraine. Russia released unfinished security documents — an unusual move in diplomacy — that call for U.S.-led NATO alliance not to bring in new members or establish bases in ex-Soviet countries. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia was ready to hold urgent security talks with the U.S. “as early as” on Saturday. “We are ready to immediately, even tomorrow — literally tomorrow, on Saturday — go for talks with the U.S. in a third country,” he told reporters, suggesting Geneva as a venue. In Washington, a senior official said the U.S. expected to respond “sometime next week” to Russia on a format for talks but made clear it was not enthusiastic about the proposals. “If there is any further aggression against Ukraine, that will have massive, massive consequences and will carry a high price,” the official said. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki noted that the U.S. has negotiated with Moscow on strategic concerns for decades but said it would only act in concert with NATO allies. “There will be no talks on European security without our European allies and partners,” she told reporters. The West says Moscow has readied some 1,00,000 troops for an imminent attack on Ukraine, which has been battling a pro-Moscow insurgency in its east since 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin denies planning an attack and blames NATO for the rise in tensions, demanding “legal guarantees” the alliance will not expand eastwards. The draft document addressed to NATO says its members should “commit themselves to refrain from further enlargement, including the accession of Ukraine as well as other states”. It also insists that alliance members not conduct military activity in Ukraine or other countries in Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and Central Asia. Moscow and NATO, the document said, should limit the deployment of missiles, set up an emergency telephone hotline and also work to “prevent incidents” in the Baltics and the Black Sea.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-drafts-pact-to-limit-us-nato-role-in-ex-soviet-nations/article37982210.ece
18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Radical change is needed in the mindset and governance of Hong Kong’||Raucous campaigning and sharp exchanges between the pro-Beijing and pro-democracy camps usually mark Hong Kong’s legislative elections. But ahead of this year’s December 19 polls, campaigning in the Special Administration Region (SAR) has been muted. Low voter turnout is set to mark the first polls since Beijing’s passing of a national security law and a massive overhaul of the electoral system. Some in the pro-democracy camp are boycotting the election, while others are either in prison, for their roles in the 2019 pro-democracy protests, or have given up politics entirely.    Regina Ip , a long-time lawmaker who is running for re-election, is the founder of the pro-Beijing New People’s Party, and is a former Secretary of Security, shared her thoughts on the issues facing Hong Kong providing written responses to questions from The Hindu . “Radical change”, she said, is needed in the “mindset” and “governance” of a government beset by “myriad problems”. Edited excerpts:  How different is this election, being the first major election after the passing of the national security law and the restructuring of the electoral process? Our new electoral system differs in the following ways. Firstly, the geographical constituency candidates will be returned under a new “double seats, single vote” system, which means each of the 10 geographical constituencies will have two seats but each voter can cast only one vote. Secondly, there is a ‘Candidate Eligibility Verification Committee’ chaired by the Chief Secretary, which will vet every candidate’s sincerity in upholding the Basic Law and pledging loyalty to the HKSAR based on his or her words and deeds. The purpose is to ensure that only true patriots can take part in the governance of Hong Kong. Pushing this idea of only “patriots governing Hong Kong” has been criticised as shrinking the democratic space. How do you respond to that? There is also the question of who gets to define who is a patriot and who isn’t. Is that defined by Beijing? Who is a patriot has been defined by Deng Xiaoping back in the 1980s. In his words, a patriot is someone who respects and loves his own people, genuinely supports Hong Kong’s reunification with China, and would not do anything to hurt the interests of Hong Kong. I think these requirements are very reasonable. What’s your message to voters in your campaign? This is my fifth attempt to win a LegCo seat. My key message is change. I think we badly need a radical change in the government’s mindset, culture, and governance style to help resolve Hong Kong’s myriad problems, such as the severe land and housing shortage, upward mobility for young people, slow pace of development and issues with national identity. How has the new national security law changed Hong Kong? Has it ended the original ‘One Country, Two Systems’ model? We have a constitutional duty under Article 23 of the Basic Law to enact local legislation to prohibit seven offences that endanger national security — treason, secession, sedition, subversion, theft of state secrets, foreign political organisations or bodies conducting political activities in Hong Kong, and political organisations establishing ties with foreign political organisations or bodies. The national security law has plugged serious loopholes in our legislation by adding the offences of secession, subversion, terrorist activities and collusion with external forces. Our city quickly returned to peace and stability. Income inequality in Hong Kong is one pressing issue. What’s your plan to address it? Last year, when Hong Kong’s economy was hard hit by COVID-19, the overall poor population rose to 1,652,500 [the total population is around 7.4 million] and a poverty rate of 23.6% before government intervention, the highest on record. After government intervention, the numbers fell to 553,500 poor population. However, one-off subsidies are not a good way to alleviate poverty. I disagree with the Chief Executive [Carrie Lam] that in a capitalist economy like Hong Kong there is little the government can do to reduce the wealth gap other than by making welfare payments. To narrow the wealth gap, we need to do more to counter monopolies and help SMEs and young people move up their career ladder through social and economic strategies rather than just relying on handouts. The housing crisis is the other pressing issue. Can Hong Kong adopt a Singapore-type public housing model? The Singapore model is admirable. Even with 80% of housing in the public sector, developers can still find their market niche and make money. But it will take Hong Kong some time to redress the massive supply-demand imbalance, and wean the government off land revenues to abandon its unspoken “high land price” fiscal policy. Hong Kong’s current “Zero COVID” strategy has been successful in limiting deaths and cases, to 213 deaths since the pandemic began and a little over 12,000 cases. But what is the way forward in your view towards opening up? Does Hong Kong have to choose between opening up to the world and opening up to the mainland, and does it have a choice as long as the mainland continues a “Zero COVID” approach? I am confident we can re-open soon in an orderly and safe manner. We don’t have to choose between mainland China and the world. Ideally, we want to have the best of both worlds. Our 21-day quarantine requirements in regard to travellers from most countries are a function of their COVID-19 situations. Our priority must be to keep the 7.4 million people in our city safe, and we have done well in this respect.

18 December 2021||London,||U.K. Tories suffer byelection upset||U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party has suffered a stunning defeat in a parliamentary byelection that was viewed as a referendum on his government amid weeks of scandal and soaring COVID-19 infections. Liberal Democrat Helen Morgan overturned a Conservative majority of almost 23,000 votes from the last election to win Thursday’s contest in North Shropshire, which has been represented by a Conservative almost continuously since 1832. The election was called after the former Conservative MP resigned amid a corruption scandal. The result will heap pressure on Mr. Johnson just two years after he was re-elected with 80-seat majority in Parliament. His authority has been dented in recent weeks by allegations that he and his staff attended Christmas parties last year while the country was in lockdown. Against this backdrop, critics are questioning Mr. Johnson’s handling of the pandemic after coronavirus infections soared to records this week due to Omicron variant. “Tonight the people of North Shropshire have spoken on behalf of the British people,” Ms. Morgan said in her victory speech.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-tories-suffer-by-election-upset/article37982208.ece

18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Sowing the seeds of a disaster||From the time he began voting, Kurunegala farmer B.M.H. Jayatilleka has not backed any party other than the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) at the polls. By extension, his vote in recent elections went to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP or People’s Front) that the Rajapaksas carved out of the SLFP where they made their political careers. In the presidential poll of 2019, Jayatilleka voted for Gotabaya Rajapaksa. In the 2020 general elections, he campaigned hard for Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa who contested from Kurunegala district, located in Sri Lanka’s North Western Province and home to a large population of farmers and military families. Prime Minister Mahinda polled a record 5,27,364 preferential votes in that election, reflecting his enduring electoral appeal a decade after the armed forces under his leadership defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), ending the country’s long civil war. In the last few months, though, Jayatilleka feels very differently about his hitherto favourite political camp, with his staunch loyalty giving way to seething anger. “I will never vote for them [Rajapaksas] again in this lifetime,” vowed the farmer leader, nearing 70. His shift is drastic, much like President Gotabaya’s overnight policy switch to ‘organic only’ agriculture that triggered it. No transition plan On May 6, President Gotabaya issued a gazette banning the import of chemical fertilizers, in what was widely seen as a rash embrace of organic farming promised in his poll manifesto. At a time when all sectors, including agriculture, were reeling under the persisting economic impact of the pandemic, the Rajapaksa administration’s announcement, perhaps the most consequential change to agriculture policy in the region in recent decades, came with no consultation, forethought, or convincing transition plan apparent. In a curiously belated effort months after changing policy, the Ministry of Agriculture on Thursday (December 16) said it was setting up a task force to study and report on the “adverse effects of the use of chemical fertilizers and chemical pesticides on the human body.” President Gotabaya has defended his ambitious initiative locally and at international fora. “We need a new agricultural revolution that is not against nature,” he said, speaking on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow held in October-November. Acknowledging there was “some criticism [of] and resistance” to his government’s ‘organic only’ policy, he told the summit: “In addition to chemical fertilizer lobby groups, this resistance has come from farmers who have grown accustomed to overusing fertilizer as an easy means of increasing yields.” He did not mention Sri Lankan scientists, who have slammed the initiative, terming it “ill-advised” and “a catastrophe” in the making. “The ban was a big jolt,” Jayatilleka said, seated in a community hall adjacent to a Buddhist temple in Ibbagamuwa, about 13 km from Kurunegala town. “Paddy is our livelihood, our main source of income for generations. And that is under serious threat now.” In the face of criticism, government spokespersons have sought to justify the move with more than one reason. They pitch it as a necessary step to prevent a chronic kidney condition – loosely attributed by non-scientists to chemicals in the soil – and to save dollars spent on fertilizer import [about $300 million annually] for the country that is in a dire forex and economic crisis. But the argument did not find many takers among farmers, who came under enormous pressure soon after the new policy took effect. They had no source of chemical fertilizer when sowing season — one of two tied to Sri Lanka’s monsoons — began in September. As for organic fertilizers, farmers are caught in uncertainty — over its availability, quality and potential effect. “It is all just chaotic,” said Jayatilleka, who heads a farmers’ society in the district. E.P.D.K. Atugalage even considered quitting farming. “The pressure to buy organic fertilizer, the transport costs and the uncertainty about the quality of organic fertilizer... all this made me think why I must farm hereafter. Is it worth growing paddy with all these risks,” she asked. The district, with over 4 lakh farmers, is among the top paddy producers in the country. For paddy cultivators like Jayatilleka and Atugalage, whose farming lives began in the 1960s, coinciding with the Green Revolution that aimed to increase productivity, organic agriculture is alien. The abundance and security they are used to are a consequence of using chemical fertilizer, one of the chief drivers of the Green Revolution, and the subsidy — promoted especially by the earlier Rajapaksa administrations from 2005 to 2014 — that made it easily accessible to them all this time. Some 1.8 million farmers across the island are engaged in paddy production, delivering an average yield of over 3 million tonnes a year, data published by Sri Lanka’s Rice Research and Development Institute showed. Like many other countries, Sri Lanka too witnessed a marked increase in productivity in the last five decades, achieving self-sufficiency. From importing 60% of the country’s rice requirement in the 1940s, when Sri Lanka’s population was about 6 million, to producing more than what is consumed now (barring a small percentage of foreign varieties still being imported) — when the population is nearly 22 million — is a significant leap, remarked Buddhi Marambe, a senior professor at the Department of Crop Science at the Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, located in the central Kandy district. Top crop in peril The government’s ban, while putting Sri Lanka’s top staple crop in peril, also endangers the country’s food security achieved through decades, experts like him fear. “With this decision, the government has taken the entire country for a ride. The policy will affect the next crop, the farmers who grow them, and subsequently the whole society. A food crisis is imminent,” Prof. Marambe noted, reflecting a sentiment that several fellow scientists have aired from the time President Gotabaya imposed the ban. Critics of the move are not necessarily opposed to organic farming. As academics studying the science of food production, they were only voicing concern that a transition that ought to take place in phases, over years, was being rushed through without a plan. Now, the implications of the abrupt shift are beginning to manifest. Farmers are dreading their next paddy harvest in January and February, with most fearing their yield would drop by 50%. Those growing vegetables and fruits are also already noticing worrisome changes, according to W.A.D. Sylvester, a 65-year-old farmer. “The quality of bananas has suffered. Earlier, one large bunch would weigh 25 kg to 30 kg, but now it’s barely 15 kg. For coconuts grown commercially, we use chemical fertilizer once in six months. Now I see that coconuts have shrunk without the fertilizer,” he said. The ban will also adversely impact Sri Lanka’s $1.3-billion tea industry, a vital foreign exchange earner for the country, planters have warned. They anticipate a 40-50% slash in production, despite the government relaxing the chemical fertilizer ban for the sector in October after their repeated appeals. Even for other crops, the government partially revoked the ban last month. Agriculture Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage on November 24 said the private sector would be allowed to import agrochemicals, but the part-reversal is too little too late, in farmers’ view. Farmers’ resistance Their resentment over the government’s policy change is no secret. Men and women who rely on agriculture for a living have been agitating across the country for months. Visuals of angry farmers, anti-government slogans, and protestors burning effigies of the Agriculture Minister dominated prime time news. As Prof. Marambe observed: “Instead of spending their time on their lands cultivating, farmers were forced to take to the streets.” But the government did not budge, even a little, until late November. Addressing a special meeting on organic farming on November 22, President Gotabaya said there was no change in the government’s green agriculture policy, and that subsidies would be provided only for organic farming. Farmers were “organising protests and delaying cultivation” because “they have not been properly educated,” he said, as per a statement issued by his office. “If officials who do not agree with the government policy wished to leave, there would be no obstacle,” he said. The government’s stubbornness for almost seven months, despite its fast-declining popularity and mounting protests, baffled some of its own supporters. It defied popular analysis that the Rajapaksas are more politically astute than their rivals. It was also amply clear that the ruling regime despised any resistance or challenge, even if it came from subject experts. Minister Aluthgamage removed Prof. Marambe, who earlier questioned the government’s policy in the media, from an experts’ committee advising the government on the national agriculture policy. However, the government’s emphatic claims of supporting farmers in the long run could not drown the criticism, by now widespread and loud in the public sphere. Far from being able to locally produce all the organic fertilizer required in the country, Sri Lanka was, rather ironically, importing organic inputs, including from India and China, despite banning agrochemicals in order to preserve draining foreign reserves. In what turned out to be an unexpected diplomatic confrontation, Sri Lankan authorities in October rejected the Chinese company’s fertilizer consignment on grounds that it was “contaminated”. As the dispute escalated, China blacklisted a top public sector bank in Sri Lanka, and the Chinese firm filed a lawsuit in Singapore, challenging Colombo’s “backtracking and insincerity”. The government has said it would pay $6.7 million to the Chinese company, amid criticism from detractors accusing the government of “succumbing” to pressure. Meanwhile, farmers are watching an unprecedented crisis unfold in their plots, just as a growing fear of a food scarcity next year grips the country. Confusing messages Just like the ban in May, the government’s decision in late November to permit the private sector to import chemical fertilizers also came all of a sudden. A gazette on November 30 repealed the May 6 gazette, along with another issued on July 31 on the subject. A series of announcements was made around the time by top officials including the Cabinet Minister, State Minister and a senior bureaucrat attached to the Ministry, none clarifying the part-reversal of policy. In fact, farmers and scientists did not know what to make of their statements – some pointing to an exemption for paddy, and others denying the same. They found the messages conflicting and confusing. The Hindu ’s attempts to reach the Minister and Secretary for a comment were unsuccessful. Gleaning the essence of their statements, farmers found two takeaways — neither of the two state-owned fertilizer companies would now be involved in importing agrochemicals; and the government was doing away with subsidies on chemical fertilizers, that they received at heavily discounted rates or for free thus far, they deduced. According to Namal Karunaratne, National Convener of the All Ceylon Farmers’ Federation (ACFF), there is currently a small stock of imported chemical fertilizers that is grossly inadequate to fulfil the nationwide requirement. It takes months to import a large consignment of chemical fertilizers, from the time of placing the order until it reaches the farmer. Even if the chemical fertilizers were immediately available, few farmers would be able to afford it, spending tens of thousands without the subsidy anymore. Moreover, with 75% of the current crop’s life cycle already over, chemical fertilizers will not be of much help to paddy growers, who add it at different stages after the sowing season, he pointed out. “It might make a difference to farmers growing vegetable and fruits, though,” he added. Karunaratne is now a familiar name in the media in recent months. He has been consistently challenging the government’s policy shift, countering its claims with hard data and prevalent scientific opinion. The ACFF is affiliated to the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) — currently in Opposition with just three seats in the 225-member House. It is the largest organised body of farmers in the country. In his assessment, the government’s ban on chemical fertilizers and subsequent tweak in policy allowing private players alone to import the same reveals its “actual agenda”. “They just wanted to cancel the fertilizer subsidy, which they know will be an unpopular decision at any time,” he said. “Sadly, because of the route they took, our farmers will now forever be repulsed by the idea of organic farming, averse to exploring its merits.” The government’s efforts, he said, is the “greatest disservice” to the concept of organic farming. Speaking more broadly about the country’s “much-neglected” agriculture sector, Karunaratne said it was naïve on the part of the government to think that they could “simply tinker with” one aspect – fertilizer use – of farming, without reviewing Sri Lanka’s water policy that is “heavily tilted towards hydropower” generation, and much less towards agriculture. The “neglect”, he said, began after Sri Lanka liberalised its economy in 1977, ahead of any other country in the region. “Before 1977, agriculture contributed 74% to our GDP. After opening up, it has reduced to about 7%, despite employing 28% of our labour force,” he said. The thrust gradually moved to agro business, with successive governments failing to look at value addition, or value chains within the market. “In that way, agriculture in Sri Lanka is still at a very primitive stage,” he remarked. Short-sighted policy Regardless of how the government changes its fertilizer policy, the farmers’ protests through the last seven months have “built political momentum,” he noted. “They [Rajapaksas] promised national security, but fail to realise that a crucial component of national security is food security. And that is in complete disarray now. This is bound to have a political cost.” What began as a farmers’ problem is already manifesting as a problem of all consumers – seen in the soaring costs of rice and vegetables, and the fear of an imminent shortage, he pointed out. “LPG cylinders are in short supply, or are exploding,” he said, referring to a series of recent accidents amid shortage. “People are just frustrated.” It was this frustration that Jayatilleka voiced, while swearing never to vote for the Rajapaksas again. “It is time to weed out the old crop of politicians; they don’t care about us,” he said. The fertilizer controversy has upset his decades-old voting reflex, while also making him averse to “all politicians — those in government, those in opposition, everyone.” The sentiment is not insignificant, just two years into President Gotabaya’s term. Coming from a senior citizen in Sri Lanka’s Sinhala Buddhist heartland — no less than Prime Minister Mahinda’s own constituency — it begs the question of whether the sheen of the Rajapaksa brand might be wearing off now. On the one hand, it is evident that the Rajapaksa administration’s biggest slip yet was not on account of a challenge thrown by the political opposition or due to pressure from the international community. It was its own short-sighted policy change that is proving a costly political error. On the other, with no imminent election or formidable opposition – the ruling coalition has a two-thirds majority in Parliament – it is difficult to see what might come of the disillusionment voiced by traditional supporters. Although vehement in their condemnation of the government’s fertilizer policy dilemma, farmers are barely preoccupied with its political implication now. They have more pressing concerns like the next harvest, and what that could mean to their families’ three meals in the coming year. “My father was a farmer. I am 65, and I have grown food all my working life. I never thought I would be facing a food shortage at home,” Sylvester said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/sowing-the-seeds-of-a-disaster/article37982205.ece
18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||The challenge of achieving 9.5% growth rate||The National Statistical Office (NSO) released the second quarter gross value added (GVA) and gross domestic product (GDP) numbers on November 30, 2021, indicating the pace of economic recovery in India after the two COVID-19 waves. The contraction was highest in the first quarter of 2020-21, gradually easing off in the subsequent quarters. The resultant base effect was the strongest in the first quarter of 2021-22 as reflected in real GDP and GVA growth rates of 20.1% and 18.8%, respectively. The base effect weakened in the second quarter with GDP and GVA growth rates at 8.4% and 8.5%, respectively. Considering these two quarters together, the real GVA for the first half of 2021-22 at Rs. 63.4 lakh crore has remained below the level in the first half of 2019-20 at Rs. 65.8 lakh crore by (-)3.7%. This difference is even larger for GDP which at the end of first half of 2021-22 stood at Rs. 68.1 lakh crore, which is (-) 4.4% below the corresponding level of GDP at Rs. 71.3 lakh crore in 2019-20. As the base effect weakens in the third and fourth quarters of 2021-22, a strong growth momentum would be needed to ensure that at the end of this fiscal year, in terms of magnitude, GVA and GDP in real terms exceed their corresponding pre-COVID-19 levels of 2019-20. Sectors that improved In the first half of 2021-22, on the output side, only four of the eight GVA sectors have exceeded their corresponding 2019-20 levels. These are agriculture; electricity, gas, et al.; mining and quarrying; and public administration, defence and other services. Of these, the first and second quarter growth of public administration, defence and other services was at 5.8% and 17.4%, respectively. The upsurge in the growth of this sector in the second quarter of 2021-22 reflects the Central government’s emphasis on capital expenditure which started gathering momentum in recent months. The Central government capital expenditure grew by 38.3% during the first half of 2021-22. This emphasis on government investment expenditure, supplemented by recovery of private investment expenditure, resulted in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) showing a positive growth of 1.5% in the second quarter of 2021-22 over its corresponding level in 2019-20. However, even in this case, the level of GFCF in the first half of 2021-22 has remained below its corresponding level in 2019-20 by a margin of Rs. 1.93 lakh crore. Overall, domestic demand including private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) in the first half of 2021-22 remains below its corresponding level in 2019-20 by nearly Rs. 5.5 lakh crore. This indicates that investment as well as consumption demand have to pick up strongly in the remaining two quarters to ensure that the economy emerges on the positive side at the end of 2021-22 as compared to its pre-COVID-19 level. Private consumption demand would pick up with employment and income growth, especially in the small and medium sectors, which is linked to the recovery in the services sectors, particularly the trade, hotels et al. sector. This may happen in the second half of 2021-22 provided economic activities are not beset again by COVID-19’s new strain, Omicron. Annual growth prospects To realise the projected annual growth at 9.5% for 2021-22 given both by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), we require a growth of 6.2% in the second half of 2021-22. This will have to be achieved even as the base effect weakens in the third and fourth quarters since GDP growth rate in these quarters of 2020-21 was at 0.5% and 1.6%, respectively. Thus, achieving the projected growth rate of 9.5% is going to be a big challenge. Had the growth rate of the second quarter been higher, the task would have been easier. If, in fact, we achieve the growth rate 9.5% in 2021-22, we can be confident that 2022-23 will see a growth rate of 6% to 7%. The policy instrument for achieving a higher growth may have to be a strong fiscal support in the form of government capital expenditure. This is currently being facilitated by the buoyant Centre’s gross tax revenues. The Centre’s gross tax revenues have shown an unprecedented growth rate of 64.2% and a buoyancy of 2.7 in the first half of 2021-22. The nominal GDP growth at 23.9% and the implicit price deflator-based inflation at 9.0% in H₁FY22 is the key reason for the buoyant tax revenues. The fiscal deficit target of 6.8% may come under pressure because of upward revisions in some expenditure items such as food and fertilizer subsidies, MGNREGA and extension of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana along with some shortfall in non-tax and non-debt capital receipts. In spite of these pressures, it would be advisable for the Centre to continue infrastructure spending. The Centre’s incentivisation of state capital expenditure through additional borrowing limits would also help in this regard. According to available information, 11 States in the first quarter and seven States in the second quarter qualified for the release of the additional tranche under this window. Even as Central and State capital expenditures gather momentum, high frequency indicators reflect an ongoing pick-up in private sector economic activities. High frequency indicators PMI manufacturing increased to a 10-month high of 57.6 in November 2021, increasing from 55.9 in October 2021. PMI services remained high at 58.1 in November 2021, its second-highest level since July 2011. Gross GST collections at Rs. 1.31 lakh crore remained above the benchmark of Rs. 1 lakh crore for the fifth consecutive month in November 2021. Core IIP growth increased to 7.5% in October 2021 from 4.4% in September 2021. Compared to its October 2019 value, core IIP showed a growth of 7.0% in October 2021. Merchandise exports growth was at 26.5% in November 2021 and 43.0% in October 2021 as compared to the corresponding month of the previous year. When compared to 2019 levels, exports grew by 35.9% in October and 15.9% in November 2021, reflecting robust external demand. An important difference between 2019-20 and 2021-22 arises from the performance of the Centre’s gross tax revenues (GTR). The growth in the Centre’s GTR in the first half of 2019-20 was at 1.5% and there was a contraction of (-)3.4% for the year as a whole. In the face of such weak revenues, the Central government could not mount a meaningful fiscal stimulus in 2019-20 even as real GDP growth fell to 4.0%. In contrast, the government is in a significantly stronger position in 2021-22 since the growth in GTR in the first half is 64.2% and the full year growth is expected to be quite robust. Thus, the key to attaining a 9.5% real GDP annual growth in 2021-22 lies in the government’s ongoing emphasis on infrastructure spending as reflected in government’s capital expenditure. This is also seen in the high real growth in public administration, defence and other services of 17.4% in the second quarter of 2021-22. It is imperative that this momentum is sustained in the remaining part of the fiscal year. C.

18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||For disabled citizens to have the police they deserve||While effective and meaningful access to the police is important for all Indian citizens, it is doubly so for persons with disabilities. Their disability exposes them to heightened risk of violence. As the Supreme Court noted in a case concerning the rape of a blind Scheduled Caste woman earlier this year ( Patan Jamal Vali v. The State Of Andhra Pradesh ), “as the facts of this case make painfully clear, women with disabilities, who inhabit a world designed for the able-bodied, are often perceived as ‘soft targets’ and ‘easy victims’ for the commission of sexual violence.” Against this backdrop, the Draft Accessibility Standards/Guidelines recently released by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) for built infrastructure under its purview (police stations, prisons and disaster mitigation centres) and services associated with them assume significance. The Standards recognise that these spaces and services must be barrier-free by design, for persons with disabilities to fully and effectively enjoy their rights equally with others. Unfortunately, however, the Standards are not in conformity with a rights-based understanding of disability when they state that accessibility is society’s “social responsibility” towards the “differently abled”. This understanding is flawed as accessibility is in fact a legal entitlement that inheres in the disabled as rights-bearing citizens. Steps in the right direction The Standards set out models for building new police stations as well as improving upon existing police stations and prisons that are modern, gender sensitive and accessible. On the positive side, the Standards speak to the need to make the websites and institutional social networks of police stations accessible, ensuring that persons with disabilities accused of committing any crimes are treated appropriately, having disabled-friendly entrances to police stations and disabled-friendly toilets. Interestingly, the Standards state that the police staff on civil duty could be persons with disabilities. This is inconsistent with the Office Memorandum issued by the Department of Empowerment for Persons with Disabilities on August 18, 2021, according to which the Centre has exempted posts in the Indian Police Service; the Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshdweep, Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli Police Service; as well as the Indian Railway Protection Force Service from the mandated 4% reservation for persons with disabilities in government jobs. Even as the Central Government is committed to creating a more disabled-friendly police service through the issuance of these standards, it has foreclosed the possibility of the disabled being part of the police force. A police force that does not have adequate representation of people with disabilities can scarcely be inclusive towards them. The Standards further highlight the distinctly disadvantageous position of persons with disabilities, especially women, children and persons with psycho-social disabilities, during natural disasters. Acknowledging that persons with disabilities must receive equal protection as others in such situations, the Standards provide direction on disability inclusion in disaster mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery efforts. They also stress on disability inclusive training for persons involved in disaster relief activities, data aggregation, use of information and communication technology (ICT) and enforcing accessible infrastructure models for schools, hospitals and shelters following the principle of universal design. Moreover, the Standards introduce accessibility norms for services associated with police stations and prisons. These norms promote the use of ICTs to facilitate communication, development of police websites, app-based services for filing complaints, making enquiries, etc., as well as encouraging the use of sign language, communication systems such as Braille, images for persons with psycho-social disabilities, and other augmentative and alternative modes of communication. Inadequate in certain aspects Equally, however, the Standards are also inadequate in some key ways. First, the cover letter to the Standards, containing such crucial details as the coordinates of the competent official to whom public comments are to be sent and the last date of submission, is embedded in an image. Consequently, a screen reader (the software used by the blind to access the computer) cannot make out the text. Second, the Standards call for the deployment of directional signage regarding accessibility features in the MHA’s physical infrastructure as well as to indicate the location of accessible toilets. However, they do not require that such signage itself be accessible to the visually challenged, such as through auditory means. Third, the Standards characterise several reasonable accommodations that are necessary for the disabled as being merely recommendatory. These include having trained police personnel in every police station to assist persons with disabilities and placing beepers at all entrances to enable the visually challenged/blind to locate themselves. Just as posting signs for the benefit of the able-bodied is not optional, it is difficult to understand why placing beepers for the benefit of the visually challenged should be. Finally, in the case of Patan Jamal Vali , the Court suggested connecting special educators and interpreters with police stations to operationalise the reasonable accommodations embodied in the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013. It further recommended setting up a database in every police station of such educators, interpreters and legal aid providers to facilitate easy access and coordination. While the standards do require developing a mechanism to provide human assistance to the disabled such as sign language interpreters, they are short on specifics on this count. In sum, the Standards, when enacted into law, will mark a huge step forward in making our law enforcement apparatus more disabled-friendly. Bolstering the Standards further, by incorporating the suggestions flowing from well- thought-out public comments, will take us closer to the aim of ensuring that India’s disabled citizens truly have the police they deserve.

18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||For an honest broker||Days after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, Russian President Vladimir Putin held a summit via video conference with Chinese President Xi Jinping. While the two meetings may have focused on bilateral issues, the conversations appear to have overlapped in unusual ways. According to a senior Kremlin official, after discussing with Mr. Modi India’s problems with Chinese aggression, which were raised publicly during the visit by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Mr. Putin “briefed” Mr. Xi on his talks in Delhi. The official then indicated that a trilateral summit of the leaders of Russia, India and China (RIC) could be held in the near future, which would pick up on the Modi-Putin-Xi conversation during an RIC summit on the sidelines of the Osaka G-20 summit in 2019. However, much has occurred between that summit and today. China’s aggression at the Line of Actual Control has dented hopes of peaceful coexistence and growth between the neighbours that had been outlined during the RIC as well as the Modi-Xi Mamallapuram summit, when the leaders last met face to face. Since April 2020, the two leaders have not spoken directly even once, and while they have attended the same multilateral summits (BRICS, SCO, G-20, etc.), it would be hard to see them engaging in a face-to-face format unless the situation at the LAC considerably eases. In addition, the RIC summit should not be held before promises made by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in meetings with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar are fulfilled. While India-Russia defence and bilateral ties have considerably strengthened, especially after the Modi government’s decision to go ahead with its purchase of the S-400 missile defence systems despite the U.S. threat of sanctions, New Delhi must tread cautiously in its trilateral and multilateral cooperation with Moscow and any hint that Russia could play a facilitator of talks with China must be scrutinised closely. Russia and China have consolidated their support for each other in the face of U.S. concerns over Russian action against Ukraine and Chinese action on Taiwan. Russia is also deeply dependent on Chinese investment, particularly in the 30-year $400 billion gas pipeline. On Afghanistan, Russia has shown that it was prepared to cut India out of negotiations held by the Troika plus group with the U.S., China and Pakistan. Any expectation that Mr. Putin could play “honest broker” between Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi must take these factors into account. While India must continue to walk the tightrope between Moscow and Washington, and its partners in Eurasia versus those in the Indo-Pacific, it needs to disentangle these threads from the very potent threat it faces directly and bilaterally from its northern neighbour, where it has little choice but to follow an independent path.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/for-an-honest-broker/article37982196.ece
18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||When the chips are down||The Union Cabinet’s decision this week to set aside Rs. 76,000 crore for supporting the development of a ‘semiconductors and display manufacturing ecosystem’ is a belated but welcome acknowledgment of the strategic significance of integrated circuits, or chips, to a modern economy. The basic building blocks that serve as the heart and brain of all modern electronics and information and communications technology products, the ubiquitous chips are now an integral part of contemporary automobiles, household gadgets such as refrigerators, and essential medical devices such as ECG machines. The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically thrown into sharp relief the vulnerability that a range of manufacturing industries and, by extension, national economies are exposed to in the face of disruptions in the supply of these vital semiconductors. The pandemic-driven push to take sizeable parts of daily economic and essential activity online, or at least digitally enable them, has also highlighted the centrality of the chip-powered computers and smartphones in people’s lives. With the bulk of semiconductor manufacturing and supply capability concentrated in a handful of countries including Taiwan, South Korea, U.S., Japan and, more recently, China, governments worldwide have realised that it is in the national interest to treat chip manufacturing as a strategic imperative. The Cabinet decision to simultaneously establish an India Semiconductor Mission helmed by ‘global industry experts’ to drive long-term strategies for the sustainable development of the chip and display industry is therefore a step in the right direction. The challenge ahead, however, is fairly daunting. For one, the level of fiscal support currently envisioned is minuscule when one considers the scale of investments typically required to set up manufacturing capacities in the various sub sectors of the semiconductor industry. A semiconductor fabrication facility, or fab, can cost multiples of a billion dollars to set up even on a relatively small scale and lagging by a generation or two behind the latest in technology. Even granting that India’s Production Linked Incentive scheme intends to give only 50% of the cost of setting up at least two greenfield semiconductor fabs by way of fiscal support, not much of the current scheme outlay of approximately $10 billion is likely to be left to support other elements including display fabs, packaging and testing facilities, and chip design centres.

It may be best if the new mission focuses fiscal support, for now, on other parts of the chip-making chain including design, where surely India already has considerable talent and experience.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/when-the-chips-are-down/article37982201.ece
18 December 2021||BHUBANESWAR,||ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel to invest Rs. 1.02 lakh cr. in Odisha||The Odisha government on Friday approved ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel’s proposal to set up a 24 million tonne per annum integrated steel plant in Mahakalpara block of Kendrapara district at an estimated investment of Rs. 1.02 lakh crore. Touted to be the largest project in the country’s manufacturing sector, the proposed facility of AM/NS (the Kendrapara complex), would produce various grades of steel with its latest ‘green’ steel making technology and also make 18.75 MTPA of cement. On completion, the steel and cement facilities would both be India’s largest single location greenfield projects, respectively. The project is proposed to be completed in phases over seven years. While the steel plant would enable the churning out of high value added downstream products, the cement facility would likely help boost infrastructure development in the region. Odisha’s High-Level Clearance Authority (HLCA) chaired by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik approved the project. which is expected to directly generate 16,000 jobs and create significant indirect employment opportunities through ancillary and downstream industries and services. According to the State government, along with the Steel complex, the company will also develop a downstream industry park to promote micro, small and medium enterprises and help import substitution. A large number of ancillary manufacturing firms are expected to set up units in the region to support the steel plant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/arcelormittal-nippon-steel-to-invest-rs-102-lakh-cr-in-odisha/article37982172.ece

The company had acquired 128.4 MHz spectrum (including Telenor spectrum) for Rs. 19,051 crore in the 2014 auction, the company said in a statement.

18 December 2021||Adelaide,||Smith leads the charge as Australia takes total control||Marnus Labuschagne, 95 not out overnight, duly completed his century and captain Steve Smith missed out on a ton as Australia strangled England with a powerful total of 473 for nine declared in the second Ashes Test on Friday. Labuschagne made 103 and Smith scored 93 before Australia’s tailenders knocked off some quick runs against England’s worn-out bowlers and Australia declared after tea. Poor start England limped to 17 for two in 8.4 overs — still trailing by 456 runs — before a massive flash of lightning took the players off the field and brought an early closure to the second day’s play. Michael Nesser got a wicket off his second ball in Test cricket when he had Haseeb Hameed (6) caught at mid-on after Mitchell Starc had Rory Burns (4) caught in the slips off a delivery which went across the left-hander and took the shoulder of the bat. Starc (39 n.o.) and Neser (35) had earlier shared a rapid half-century stand for the eighth wicket after England seemed to have contained the damage and had Australia on 390 for seven at tea. Jhye Richardson lofted Chris Woakes for a big six off his second ball over midwicket before Smith declared when Richardson was caught behind off Woakes. Australia removed both England openers cheaply before play was called off early.  Smith and Alex Carey (51) combined in a 91-run sixth-wicket stand before Anderson removed both batsmen in successive overs just before tea. Smith shuffled back across the line and was adjudged lbw and Carey chipped an easy catch in the covers. Earlier, England took three wickets during an even first session after Australia resumed on 221 for two. Australia’s humungous first innings total could prove significant in the outcome of the game. All eight teams which have posted 300 or more batting first in day-night Tests have gone on to win. And the eight teams to pull up short of that mark have all lost. Australia is playing its ninth day-night match, and has won the previous eight, all at home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/smith-leads-the-charge-as-australia-piles-it-on-england/article37982501.ece

18 December 2021||Liverpool,||Liverpool rolls along despite covid absentees||Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold scored with a spectacular strike as it overcame the loss of three players to suspected positive COVID-19 tests and conceding an early goal to beat Newcastle United 3-1 in the Premier League on Thursday. Liverpool moves onto 40 points from 17 games, one behind leader Manchester City. Chelsea, meanwhile, suffered another setback in its title challenge when it was held to a 1-1 home draw by an injury-hit Everton on Thursday, leaving the Blues four points adrift of City. With Virgil Van Dijk, Fabinho and Curtis Jones ruled out for Liverpool, Jonjo Shelvey struck the opener for Newcastle against the run of play in the seventh minute, with a swerving, dipping drive past unsighted keeper Allison Becker at Anfield. The lead lasted 14 minutes before Diogo Jota fired home the rebound after Martin Dubravka saved his initial header to level. Mohamed Salah put Liverpool ahead four minutes later, equalling Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy’s record of 15 consecutive Premier League games with a goal or assist by blasting home the rebound form a Sadio Mane shot. Dubravka could do nothing three minutes from the end of normal time as Alexander-Arnold took a touch on the edge of the box before firing a rocket into the top corner. Chelsea, also missing its first-choice strikers due to COVID-19, failed to turn early dominance into goals before Mason Mount made the breakthrough in the 70th minute when he took a pass from Reece James and fired past Jordan Pickford. The visitors drew level within four minutes when Anthony Gordon floated a looping free-kick to the far post and 19-year-old Jarrad Branthwaite stretched out a boot to turn the ball past goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.  The results: Chelsea 1 (Mount 70) drew with Everton 1 (Branthwaite 74); Liverpool 3 (Jota 21, Salah 25, Alexander-Arnold 87) bt Newcastle 1 (Shelvey 7); Leicester v Tottenham (postponed due to coronavirus) .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/liverpool-rolls-along-despite-covid-absentees/article37982188.ece

Srikanth and young Lakshya Sen entered their maiden semifinals of the marquee event here on Friday. However, women’s defending champion P.V. Sindhu lost to familiar foe Tai Tzu Ying. Srikanth, seeded 12th, sent Mark Caljouw of the Netherlands packing with a 21-8, 21-7 in a quarterfinal that lasted just 26 minutes.

Labuschagne resumed on 95 and Australia on 221 for two. In a dramatic 40 minutes to start the day, Labuschagne edged Jimmy Anderson to third man for four to record the sixth century of his career and first in the Ashes. Moments later he was caught behind off Ollie Robinson, retreating all the way to the boundary rope before replays showed it had been a no-ball. Labuschagne eventually fell in the 400th minute of his innings, lbw, after trying to leave a ball in Robinson’s next over that came back at him. Of the 3,068 players in Test cricket’s 144-year history, only Don Bradman, George Headley, Herbert Sutcliffe and Mike Hussey have reached 2,000 runs faster than Labuschagne’s total in 34 innings.

18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||NEUFC blanks SC East Bengal||NorthEast United FC produced a nice turnaround in the second half to outplay SC East Bengal 2-0 in an Indian Super League fixture at Fatorda on Friday. V.P. Suhair and Patrick Flottmann produced the strikes for North East United, which looked a very average side in the barren first half. The opening half saw listless exchanges in the midfield. The NorthEast suffered a blow just before the start losing Hernan Santana to injury. The Spanish midfielder hurt himself during the warm-up process forcing the Highlanders to field only three foreigners in a refreshed start-list. East Bengal also lost its Croatian defender Franjo Prce, who twisted his ankle and hobbled off midway through the match. The second half completely changed the complexion of the game as NorthEast United arrived with a renewed resolve and got two quick goals around the hour mark. V.P. Suhair found the target in the 61st minute as the NorthEast sharpened its offensives with regular incursions in the East Bengal box. Suhair showed the right knack for the goal as he collected a cross from Mapuia, got the better of East Bengal defender Amir Dervisevic and finished with a powerful punch. The Highlanders doubled the lead in the 68th minute when its Australian defender Patrick Flottmann nodded home a floater from Imran Khan following a free kick. East Bengal was down to 10 men in the added time when Antonio Perosevic received a red card for venting his frustration with a body charge on the referee.  The result: North East United FC 2 (Suhair 61, Flottmann 68) bt SC East Bengal 0 .

The teams remained atop their respective groups registering their third successive wins in the competition. While NTHPC won 5-2 against Him Hockey Academy, Himachal Pradesh, in Group A, MPHA beat Delhi Hockey 9-1 in Group B. The Odisha team, playing with a well-organised structure and determination, continued to push ahead despite some desperate fightback from Him Academy. Having taken a 3-0 lead early on, NTHPC appeared to be content staying defensive, only to allow the opposition to step up the pressure and score twice within six minutes in the final quarter. Shaken, the winner regrouped quickly to score two more to seal the deal. Also returning to winning ways was SAI-B after a crushing defeat on Wednesday.

18 December 2021||Mumbai,||A Super Sunday beckons in Mumbai||All roads will lead to the Mahalaxmi Racecourse on Sunday (Dec. 19) afternoon to witness the greatest Super Sunday in the history of Indian racing, where 7 Group races including 5 Group I races will be staged in a single day. Though delayed this year due to pandemic, the Managing Committee of the Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) has left no stone unturned and finally resurrected the 59th edition of this prestigious event. The total stakesmoney for the day is whopping Rs. 3 Crores and the winner’s purse for the rich plum, the Zavaray S. Poonawalla Indian Turf Invitation Cup is Rs. 60 lakhs. Among the 7 contestants vying for premier honours in the Zavaray S. Poonawalla Invitation Cup (Gr.1), the present form of the Mumbai-based queen filly Juliette, who is unbeaten in her last five starts, looks imposing. She has proven her mettle by winning the Indian St. Leger, Golconda St. Leger, the President of India Gold Cup and the Eclipse Stakes Of India in this year. The first classic of Mumbai racing season, the Villoo C. Poonawalla Indian 1000 Guineas (Gr.1), has 9 runners and Trainer Pesi Shroff’s wonder filly Miracle, who is unbeaten in her career by winning six races, stands out from the rest. A small field of six horses will line up for the Spartan Poker Sprinters’ Cup (Gr.1) with two among them standing a good chance. Hyderabad-based trainer L. D’Silva’s Corfe Castle, who is the winner of the Sprinters Cup in 2020 at Mysore, is doing well in the morning trials and will be right there. The local challenger Iron Age from trainer Imtiaz Sait’s stables is working well on track and might be a threat to all. In the Maj. P.K. Mehra Memorial Super Mile Cup (Gr. 1), trainer Satish Narredu’s Born Queen, who ran second in her last start at Pune, is judiciously prepared and should make amends. Cosmic Ray, who hails from Bengaluru-based trainer S.S. Attaollahi’s yard, may pose a threat. The Dr. M.A.M. Ramaswamy Stayers’ Cup (Gr.1) which has 7 runners wears an open look. Bisate, Salazaar and Theon may fight out the finish.  Invitation Cup the biggest race of the day||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-super-sunday-beckons-in-mumbai/article37982499.ece
18 December 2021||Miami,||Woods fans in for ‘crazy’ treat||World No. 6 Justin Thomas is excited to see his friend Tiger Woods tee it up alongside son Charlie at the PNC Championship family tournament this weekend, and Thomas’ dad Mike thinks Woods fans are in for a treat. “It’s crazy how good he’s hitting it and far he’s hitting it for what he’s been through,” Mike Thomas said of 15-time Major champion Woods, who suffered career-threatening leg injuries in a California car crash in February. Too soon to tell Woods has downplayed expectations for the event at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Florida, saying he’s playing “as a dad” as he continues to consider how he might fashion a return to tournament golf proper. But Mike Thomas — a former collegiate golfer and longtime club professional who teamed with Justin to win the event last year — said he’d played a recent round with Woods and found it “impressive where he’s at.” “He’s got some speed, he’s got some length. Hits a lot of really, really flush shots,” the elder Thomas said after playing in a Thursday pro-am round. “I mean, I was surprised.” Woods has recently offered some tantalising glimpses of his progress, posting videos of himself hitting balls on social media and putting in some practice sessions while hosting the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas this month. This weekend’s low-key outing will be the next step in that progression, Justin Thomas said. “My excitement level is high just for him being out here and being somewhere other than his house and getting to see a lot of familiar faces,” Justin Thomas said. “And I know spending time with Charlie is a huge deal to him. In terms of competing, I think his expectations are very low. But at the same time, he is who he is for a reason,” he added. Tiger cub on the prowl Woods and Charlie made their debut in the event, which pairs Major winners with a family member, last year and the younger Woods stole the show with a first-round eagle, some sharp trash-talking and a swing eerily similar to that of his famous father. Mike Thomas expects to see more of the same from the 12-year-old this year. “He’s pretty solid,” he said. “He hasn’t gotten any taller. He’s a little stronger. He hits it very far for his size,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/woods-fans-in-for-crazy-treat/article37982544.ece

18 December 2021||KOVILPATTI,||Sunil and Sudeep reinforce Odisha||Defending champion Odisha has added two players — India juniors Sunil Jojo and Sudeep Chirmako — to its team in the Junior National men’s hockey championships here. Defender Sunil and striker Sudeep have returned to the State team after competing in the recent Junior Hockey World Cup in Bhubaneswar. Long-time mates The two, who have been training together since their Rourkela Sports Hostel days in 2016-17, are definitely a value addition and are determined to help their State retain the title. “We play in different positions, but we have learnt a lot from each other. We have to do well as there are youngsters looking up to us,” Sunil told The Hindu . “The team has retained most of those who played the last edition (2019), so we intend to retain the crown as well,” Sudeep said. The disappointment of the Indian juniors finishing fourth at the World Cup was writ large on their faces. “We didn’t convert our chances against France [third-place play-off match]. But coach Graham Reid says it is not the end of the road for us. We still have the 2023 World Cup, Asia Cup, and Sultan of Johor Cup. Reid also told us not to get demotivated,” said Sudeep, who scored the lone goal in the 1-3 defeat to France. Losing way Sunil said India played well against France, but lost way in the third quarter. “In our first group match against France, we were unable to read them. But we rectified our mistakes and beat Belgium in the quarterfinals. “Against France in the third-place match, we were equal but after the goal in the third quarter, we were mentally down,” said Sunil. Odisha appears to be the overwhelming favourite for the crown. and the inclusion of Sunil and Sudeep has given the team’s head coach Bijay Kumar Lakra a headstart.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sunil-and-sudeep-reinforce-odisha/article37982552.ece

18 December 2021||Dhaka,||India suffers first loss||India lost by a solitary goal to hosts Bangladesh for its first defeat in the SAFF U-19 women’s football championship here on Friday. India had earlier registered comfortable victories over Sri Lanka and Bhutan. Shamsunnahar's seventh minute strike from the penalty spot made the difference between the two sides. The match began with both teams going hard from the first whistle as Bangladesh looked to make the most of its physical prowess and pressed the Indian defenders high up the pitch. The first opportunity of the game went to Bangladesh, which was awarded a penalty in the seventh minute which was converted by Shamsunnahar. India got an excellent opportunity to restore parity in the 40th minute when Sumati Kumari passed a ball to Mariyammal whose left-footer went straight into the hands of Bangladesh goalie Rupna. India next plays Nepal in its last match on Sunday and a victory in that game will assure it a place in the final.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-suffers-first-loss/article37982557.ece
18 December 2021||London,||Premier League a ‘lottery’ as Covid cases run riot||Aston Villa manager Steven Gerrard revealed there is “constant paraonia” over the status of his players after a glut of Premier League postponements due to coronavirus outbreaks. Five of the previously scheduled 10 matches due to take place on Saturday and Sunday have been called off, taking the total number of postponed top-flight fixtures over the past week to nine. Villa’s clash with Burnley is still set to go ahead, but Gerrard admitted that could quickly change after two matches this week were postponed just hours before kick-off. “There’s certainly a constant paranoia. The testing process has gone on every day and the PCR tests are twice a week. Even now we are playing in 24 hours, I have a team I want to play but it could change,” said Gerrard. Premier League clubs are due to meet on Monday to discuss the spiralling crisis, with a split emerging on whether to temporarily halt the season as a firebreaker for infections or carry on. The timing of the surge in cases in the middle of the most hectic period of the English football calendar has aggravated the chaos. Four rounds of Premier League matches are due to the played between the weekend and January 3. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said earlier in the week he wanted to keep going, but admitted that could become impossible as squads become stretched by Covid absences and injuries caused by the schedule. The Reds were without Fabinho, Virgil van Dijk and Curtis Jones for their 3-1 win over Newcastle on Thursday following suspected positive tests for Covid. “With reduced squads, smaller squads you cannot play that schedule,” said Klopp. Crazy decisions likely Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel said he could be forced to make “crazy” decisions in rushing N’Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic back from injury due to the Blues’ outbreak. Romelu Lukaku, Timo Werner and Callum Hudson-Odoi missed their 1-1 draw with Everton after testing positive. “No more positive tests but the lottery starts again tomorrow morning or tomorrow afternoon,” said Tuchel on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/premier-league-a-lottery-as-covid-cases-run-riot/article37982944.ece
18 December 2021||PUNE,||Omae and Pranjala the top two seeds||It is an ITF women’s tennis tournament that has a 20-year history in the city. It was the biggest tournament won by British teenager Emma Raducanu before she won the US Open women’s trophy this year. It was also the second biggest tournament that the current world No.2 Aryna Sabalenka won in 2015, a year after Ankita Raina had crowned herself in a $25,000 event for the first time. The organisers are quite upbeat about hosting the event at the Deccan Gymkhana from Sunday, with the support of long-time sponsor National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC). The tournament, featuring players from 15 countries, is scheduled to have Japanese Akiko Omae as the top seed and Pranjala Yadlapalli, who won the $15,000 event in Bengaluru, as the second seed. The tournament will be played in a bio-bubble owing to Covid protocols till December 22. Bojana Jovanovski, Magda Linette and Kateryna Bondarenko are the other famous winners of this tournament who went on to become top-20 players in the world. Rutuja Bhoale, Karman Kaur Thandi and Zeel Desai are the other Indian players who have gained direct acceptance by virtue of their rank, apart from Pranjala. Four more Indian players Akanksha Nitture, Vaidehi Chaudhari, Mihika Yadav and Farhat Aleen Qamar, will get wild card entries.

18 December 2021||Bengaluru,||Rohit, Jadeja begin rehab at NCA||India white-ball captain Rohit Sharma and all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja have started their rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy here after being ruled out of the upcoming Test series in South Africa due to injuries. The two senior players were seen at the NCA with India U-19 captain Yash Dhull in his social media posts. The U-19 team is currently camping at the NCA ahead of the Asia Cup beginning in the UAE from Dec. 23. Rohit, who was named ODI captain last week replacing Virat Kohli, was to travel to South Africa as vice-captain of the Test team for the series starting on Dec. 26 but a hamstring injury during training ruled him out. His expected recovery time is between three to four weeks. India-A captain Priyank Panchal was named in place of Rohit in the Test squad, which reached South Africa on Thursday for the series. The senior opener, who took charge as T20I captain against New Zealand last month, is expected to be available to lead the team for the ODI leg of the South Africa tour, which is to take place in January. Jadeja has been ruled out of the South Africa tour due to a knee injury which he sustained during the home New Zealand Test series last month. He may take a longer time to recover from his injury.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rohit-jadeja-begin-rehab-at-nca/article37982506.ece

18 December 2021||Madrid,||Sevilla’s title challenge to be tested by Atletico Madrid||Sevilla may be Real Madrid’s most likely challengers in La Liga this season and it has a chance to prove it on Saturday when it faces the defending champion Atletico Madrid. Atletico’s defeat last weekend in the Madrid derby leaves it 13 points off the top but Sevilla in second is at least slightly closer, sitting eight points behind the leaders with a game in hand. Neither side can afford to be cast further adrift at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan especially as even a Covid-depleted Real Madrid will be expected to win again at home to Cadiz on Sunday. Sevilla’s lofty position is no fluke after it pushed Atletico, Real Madrid and Barcelona hard for the title last season, only to fall away with five games to go.  The fixtures:   Saturday: Rayo Vallecano v Alaves, Real Sociedad v Villarreal, Barcelona v Elche, Sevilla v Atletico Madrid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sevillas-title-challenge-to-be-tested-by-atletico-madrid/article37982946.ece

18 December 2021||Dubai,||England fined 8 WTC points||England has been penalised eight World Test Championship penalty points and not five, as announced earlier, for maintaining a slow over rate in the first Test against Australia in Brisbane, the ICC clarified on Friday. The ICC had earlier announced that England was fined 100% match fee and five WTC points for the over-rate offence in Brisbane last week. England was eight overs short (not five as previously announced) but was only fined 100% of its match fee due to the limit. “However, the points deduction for penalty overs is not capped and must reflect the actual number of penalty overs a team is short of the minimum requirement as per Clause 16.1.2 of the ICC Playing Conditions,” said the ICC. “As per Article 2.22 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, players are fined 20% of their match fee for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time, up to a maximum fine of 100% of the match fee,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/england-fined-8-wtc-points/article37982492.ece

18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Ambal as witness||When we find ourselves in difficult situations, our faith in God wavers, and we wonder if He will help us. But there are many cases where God has stepped in to help His devotees. Goddess Shakti, who occupies the left half of Lord Siva’s body, is like a mother to Her devotees, forgiving them for their acts of omission and commission and showering Her mercy on them. That is why Abirami Bhattar describes Her feet as the feet that get rid of sorrows, said M.A. Manickavelu, in a discourse. At Paruthiyur in Tamil Nadu lived a man called Pavadai, who was a devotee of the Goddess Santana Maariyamman of Paruthiyur. Pavadai borrowed money from a resident of the village, and repaid it in time. But the creditor said Pavadai had not repaid the loan, and went to court. Pavadai had no one to give evidence on his behalf, and he told the judge that the only witness to what had happened was Santana Maariyamman. The judge heard arguments of both sides and the judgment was to be given the next day. That night, the judge had a dream. In his dream, Santana Maariyamman appeared as a little girl, and said Pavadai was speaking the truth. The Goddess named some people in the village as being in the know of things. They knew that the amount had been repaid, but had not spoken out. The judge was asked to summon them and ask them about it. The next day the judge sent for those men and when they were questioned, they admitted that Pavadai had indeed repaid the loan. The judge dismissed the case against Pavadai. So in this case, the Goddess testified on behalf of Her devotee. Pavadai was a firm believer in Maariyamman, and the reward he got for his belief was his acquittal in a false case. The bonus was that the world got to know of his faith in Her.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/ambal-as-witness/article37982248.ece

18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Into the void with Sati||When The Matrix released in theatres in 1999, it proved to be a precursor for chatter on the responsibility of the individual person in regards to mixed reality and the hegemonic power of technology. The next 22 years would raise philosophical questions, referencing the movie; ‘are we in a simulation?’, ‘what makes a person?’ and, of course, ‘would you choose the red pill or the blue pill?’ The latter even has its own Wikipedia page and official Reddit forums. It makes total sense that actor-producer Priyanka Chopra calls herself “a red pill girl”, as she takes on a “nurtured and well-positioned” legacy role in the franchise, playing Sati whose younger version (Tanveer K Atwal) appears in The Matrix Revolutions (2002). On the surface, Sati is the picture of sweetness with her endearing smile, lemon-coloured frock and schoolgirl braids. The little girl — program, really — was born without a purpose, and in a world of utilitarian machines, it made her an exile: a malfunctional program that should not exist. She is then pursued by the Machines and the Smiths (Hugo Weaving), putting her in danger of deletion, and is ultimately left in the protection of the Oracle. But she is saved by Neo, aka Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), and is revealed to be the saviour of both the artificial world of Anderson and the dystopian rabbit-hole world of Neo. When Sati and the Oracle watch Neo walk off into the sunset the former created, the little girl asks if they will ever see him again. And Oracle affirms they will. So it fits that in Chopra’s entry into The Matrix world, she stands in a sun-basked forest and tells Neo, “I tried to keep my eye on you.”  Following the white rabbit  In an interview with The Hindu Weekend , Chopra reveals she was excited “that the responsibility of playing the grown-up Sati was placed on my shoulders; [director Lana Wachowski] had trusted me to play this typically-placed character, and no one knows this world better than her”. A few years ago, Chopra had already been a blip on the Wachowski’s radar having auditioned for the film. When she was shooting for a film in India, she was called to meet with the filmmakers in San Francisco the next day. Much later, in a meeting with producer James McTeigue and Wachowski, Chopra was handed a freshly-printed script with her name on it, kicking off her The Matrix Resurrections journey. Save for her involvement in the film, not much was revealed about her role for a long time until November this year when she revealed her character poster and a recent trailer confirmed her as Sati. Indian fans were elated that she would not be the too-often tokenised diversity role in a Hollywood film, but rather an integral part of The Matrix .  Claiming her seat  The responsibility of playing Sati is huge, but so is her unofficial ambassadorship of Indian cinema on a global stage. The White Tiger actor takes neither of these roles lightly, explaining, “I’ve always thought that films should not be divided by the countries they’re made in. For me, it has been a very conscientious effort to bring not just Indian talent but also Indian stories and showcase the country.” She reflects, “Getting to where I am today required educating the people in Hollywood — from whom I am seeking work — that I deserve a seat at the table. South Asian talent deserves that and very few people get the opportunity to represent the Indian diaspora and very very few that are in India. It’s predominantly people settled outside of India but I would like to see a cross-pollination of storytelling and cultures. I work hard on that as a producer and an actor to make sure there’s a nod to my heritage.” And playing Sati is no different. She worked with Wachowski and the costume department to bring some Indian essence to the character’s ensemble. “I depended on Lana a lot to make sure that I create, in my own way, the best form of Sati. Her jacket was made from the borders of saris and the pants were deliberately made to look like a dhoti . It’s subtle, but it hits the nail on the head,” she says.  Next year spells a busy one for Chopra. She will be working on miniseries Citadel , alongside Eternals and Game of Thrones actor Richard Madden, and Farhan Akhtar’s Jee Le Zaraa with Katrina Kaif and Alia Bhatt.  The Matrix Resurrections releases in theatres in India on December 22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/into-the-void-with-sati/article37982478.ece
18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||The burden of beauty||As I watched the crowning moment of the Miss Universe 2021 pageant, I realised that I could not differentiate between Miss Paraguay and Miss India. As the camera panned from one face to the other as they held hands in a schoolgirl simulation of “sisterhood”, they could well have been twins for all I could tell. And that, in a nutshell, is what the event is today; or perhaps science has just made the “sameness” more pronounced. I faithfully watched segments of this utterly pointless annual exercise — and it was painful. Identical women, with identically sculpted faces and bodies, parading in identically ideated clothing that matches up to what the West has declared will constitute ‘evening wear’ or ‘beachwear’. The event at best is the Hollywood princess cliché at its syrupiest, but this year it seemed to serve up many more face-palm moments than ever before. There was the crowning irony moment when India’s Harnaaz Sandhu, who became Miss Universe, passionately dissed beauty and declaimed, “Let’s talk about more important things happening worldwide…” while blithely forgetting that she was participating in an event in Israel amidst boycott calls and global concerns about the country’s ruthless settlement and suppression policy vis-à-vis Palestinians, an “important thing” that neither participants nor organisers were talking about. In fact, some contestants posed with Palestinian costumes and food using a Visit Israel hashtag, oblivious to the blatant appropriation that allows Palestinian culture to be showcased even as Palestinians are systematically erased. “Know you are unique,” trilled Harnaaz, “and stop comparing yourself with others,” even as she fought her way to the Top 10 of an event that sets 80 women in a pitched battle to decide which one will be declared most beautiful. As the young women cat-walked in a style very remote from the human gait, several of them tripped in their impossibly high heels and on the trains of their de rigueur flowing gowns. They carried ridiculous props in the national costume round. They meowed like cats. They smiled relentlessly. As always, it was all rather silly and sad. Many of the women’s bios declared that they were working with children or young adults or women’s rights issues — and yet none of them seemed to see anything wrong with an event that forces women to measure up to boxed standards of height, weight, proportions, teeth, nose in order to be declared “beautiful”; an event that unequivocally foregrounds and rewards women for their physical appearance. The standard response to such criticism is that these women “choose” to participate and that it empowers them. In fact, when Nelson Mandela’s son called for a boycott, Miss Universe Iraq went ballistic. “How dare you as a man try to tell an organisation for women and women empowerment what to do,” she said. She described the event as an “opportunity” for millions of women who dream of going on the world stage to represent their countries. But to use words like “choice” and “empowerment” in the context of a massively marketed and financed event that is strategically backed by leading cosmetic and couture brands, and which exists inside a giant bubble of unbridled consumerism is farcical at best and tragic at worst. Touching faith in an entirely make-believe world makes it no more real than the winners posing with slum kids or domestic violence victims makes Miss Universe a human rights affair. One imagined that something as cataclysmic as a global pandemic might have made us look at the world differently. To rethink fashion and beauty. To give women real rather than skin-deep power. But it’s business as usual. Just as celebrities believe that wearing the same dress twice makes them eco warriors, Miss Universe rolls on, peddling itself as a women’s empowerment mission while ignoring the enormous damage done to the female psyche by such idealised beauty myths. At an even more basic level — what really does a beauty pageant mean in a world where the perfect nose is a scalpel away and flawless skin comes in a bottle? When an entire team works to create a Galatea-like vision of perfection, where does reality end and illusion begin? Ultimately, we are left “celebrating” as feminine beauty something that’s little more than a perfect mannequin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/the-burden-of-beauty/article37982420.ece
18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Breaking the mould in Benares||Prayers are answered in Benaras, and souls liberated on its ghats . I’m not sure if couturier Tarun Tahiliani had this in mind when planning to launch his premium men’s label, Tasva — his first salvo with Aditya Birla Fashion Retail Ltd (ABFRL) that acquired a stake in Tahiliani’s business in February this year. At the fabled Brijrama Palace — originally built for the Maharaja of Darbhanga in the early 19th century — models dressed in finely-fashioned ethnic wear mingled with guests and members of the press in the early afternoon glow. The clothes they wore carried all the hallmarks of Tahiliani’s attention to detail, drape, and design. “The kurtas begin at Rs. 1,599,” said Tahiliani, sinking into a couch on the terrace overlooking the Ganga. In my personal conversations with him over the past few years, he had often talked about a well-priced and accessible label. Tasva, launched a few months after the ABFRL deal, then, makes sense. “It is the right time; I want Indian men to be able to dress well in clothes that are made in India with Indian textiles, clothes that are comfortable and make them look good.” Separately, I asked Ashish Dikshit, ABFRL’s managing director, if this label intended to cater to the rapidly growing (and marrying) young population of India. Dikshit immediately outlined the brand’s strategy: “We’re looking at opening 70 stores across the country in 2022 alone.” Over our conversation, I find that the soft-spoken Dikshit is serious about, and committed to, the cause. “At Aditya Birla, we’ve been in the business of clothes for a long time. We recognised the opportunity and wanted to take Tarun’s design and fashion sensibility to the country in a big way.”  By the hand and powerloom   As the afternoon progressed and the models changed and came back to mingle with us, they wore a variety of textiles ranging from khadi to machine-woven jacquards, cotton slub to viscose-infused staple, cotton velvet to silk kataan . To me, this is where the soul of Tasva lies: in embracing and innovating with the kind of textiles being produced in a historic place like Benaras today, and not just a venerated fantasy of what Benarasi textiles should be. Tahiliani has embraced both the hand and powerloom, and worked with the weavers to ensure the kind of supply, and price points, that wouldn’t be possible had everything been handwoven or hand-embroidered. Many Tasva designs use hand-made fabrics, but not all. This direct form of collaboration and design intervention also sets Tasva apart and above the label’s closest competitors — Fabindia and Manyavar, two labels that own the lion’s share of the men’s ethnic wear market in India. At the studio of award-winning textile artist Vakil Ahmed, we meet his son, Salman, an English-speaking Delhi University graduate who came back to his family business and helped to modernise it. He was proud to show us around his various weaving facilities: one of them in his ancestral maternal haveli where artisans sit on handlooms producing fine Benarasi brocade taking days, and another, a mechanized affair where humongous powerlooms churn out textiles at the rate of tens of meters every few hours. Along with Ahmed and Salman, and many like them, Tahiliani has accepted and decided to work with the reality of what Benaras is today: a hybrid creature of the past and present, living simultaneously in both timelines.  Design led  In connecting with the real Benaras through Tasva, Tahiliani has freed the tormented soul of ethnic wear design that, till now, was held captive in the snobbish diktat that anything ‘ethnic’ has to be made with handwoven cloth and embellished with hand-embroideries only. On the flip side, hundreds of labels big and small ride on the ‘ethnic’ bandwagon without so much as a nod to the work of master craftspeople working in textile centres like Benaras, using cheap materials to offer low prices. Tahiliani’s approach is as fresh as it is needed. I asked him how it all began. “ABFRL had been looking for someone to get into this category, and decided that they’d be better off working with an owner-designer who could bring in a consistent point of view. If I’m doing it, I would do it while fully embracing new technologies and techniques.” His 25 years in fashion, he added, have taught him to look at clothes as representations of the times in which they are made, and as vehicles for change and expression. Later that evening, on a boat ride to take in the spectacle of the aarti on the ghats , I mused on the resilience of Benaras —a centre of both spiritual and fiscal pursuits housing temples and traders in equal numbers — and how Tahiliani is perhaps best placed to access this metaphor through fashion and design. A men’s label in a market that’s thirsting for well-designed solutions for a people who have always loved and understood good fabrics, comfort, and style, and who have been stuck with a Bollywood fantasy promoted by its biggest stars — not on the strength of design, but by outmoded ad campaigns that sell a dream. On the ghats of Benaras, Tarun Tahiliani has perhaps answered that prayer. The year 2022 will tell us how well he and ABFRL have answered it.

18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||How to make a pre-apocalyptic comedy||“Hypothetically if there were a comet or asteroid heading our way, what would be your most immediate action? What would you do if it were the last day on Earth?” My heart sinks at the only India-origin press question selected for the cast and crew of Netflix’s Don’t Look Up  to answer. In a virtual press conference moderated by renowned astronomer Dr Amy Mainzer, who consulted on the film, said cast and crew include musician-actor Scott Mescudi AKA Kid Cudi, filmmaker-actor Tyler Perry, actor-comedian Jonah Hill, Academy Award-winning actor Meryl Streep, actor-activist Leonardo DiCaprio, actor Jennifer Lawrence, and the film’s writer-director-producer Adam McKay. The energy reverberates through the screen even at 2 am. Close to 400 journalists from around the world have logged in to have their chance to pick the brains of some of Hollywood’s contemporary greats… and the strike-out question of ‘what if’ got asked in this finite time. The cast and crew subtly exchange a ‘look’, then Mescudi smiles and responds he would love to spend time with his 11-year-old daughter Vada. But Hill, ever the quick reactor, responds, “I think I would tweet; make sure that people knew the cool thoughts that I had to say, [my] opinions on different stuff like movies and how the stars live their lives and what they look like, and who they are dating and stuff.” The joke earns some giggles from Lawrence, McKay, Streep and Perry, while a slowly-reddening DiCaprio ducks his head. Hill’s response is also a stab at how the media has played up his weight loss, ultimately labelling him a ‘thirst trap’ leading him to request people to refrain from commenting on appearance, positive or otherwise. Like his castmates, Hill wants the focus to be on his work. And Don’t Look Up — one of the year’s most anticipated feature films — is all about directing dialogue and attention where it needs to be: on our planet’s future, how we consume news, our relationships. As DiCaprio puts it, “McKay creates a sense of urgency with the film,” but not one of mass hysteria. It is a tone McKay has perfected over the years with films such as Academy Award-winning The Big Short (2015), Vice (2018), and Booksmart (2019). The value of science A black comedy based on real events, Don’t Look Up follows two astronomers Dr Randall Mindy (DiCaprio) and Dr Kate Dibiasky (Lawrence) who discover a comet heading towards Earth. To raise awareness and urgency of the impending danger, the two embark on a media tour. DiCaprio, portraying socially awkward and quiet Dr Mindy, explains, “I was just thankful to play a character who is based on so many of the people that I’ve met from the scientific community, and in particular, climate scientists who’ve been trying to communicate the urgency of this issue and feeling like they’re subjected to the last page in the newspaper… I also love the way he was just incredibly truthful about how we’re so immensely distracted from the truth nowadays. And then, of course, Covid-19 hit and there was a whole new scientific argument going on there.” He calls Lawrence’s character Dr Dibiasky a “Greta Thunberg-type”: an activist at heart. She also has her own battles at home with parents who ‘don’t talk politics’. With this in mind, Lawrence, like her co-star, empathises with the science community whose cries on our planet’s future have gone unacknowledged for the past 30-odd years. “It’s just so sad and frustrating to watch people who have dedicated their lives to learning the truth, be turned away because people don’t like what the truth has to say,” she says. Portraying an image-conscious and conservative US President Jeanie Orlean who consistently turns away from science and danger, Streep agrees. “The kernel of truth of [ Don’t Look Up ] is that we push this information away. Even smart people — people who don’t have a scientific background — everyone pushes it away because it’s just too painful.”  Don’t Look Up will stream on Netflix from December 24.   Read the full story on weekend.thehindu.com   The right notes The film also features an original track ‘Just Look Up’ by Scott Mescudi who portrays DJ Chello and Ariana Grande who plays pop star Riley Bina. The emotive love ballad lies in the context of the end of the world. The lyric video uploaded to Grande’s official YouTube channel on December 3, has more than 2.5 million views. Mescudi recalls how the first version, by the film’s composer Nicholas Britell ( The Big Short , Vice , Succession , The Underground Railroad , Cruella ), seemed to be written from Mescudi’s perspective, but Mescudi switched it up to suit his character DJ Chello. He wanted the song to be an expression of love for Riley after a public fallout. Proud of the track, he says with a smile, “It was intense at first because Ariana is such an incredible artist. Her voice is just amazing... I’m just really happy that we were able to figure it out, and it worked.” He adds jokingly, “We can do a NASA mixtape.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/how-to-make-a-pre-apocalyptic-comedy/article37982465.ece
18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||The universe conspires||Twenty one years after Lara Dutta was crowned Miss Universe, 21-year-old Harnaaz Sandhu has brought the crown back to its rightful place in the year 2021. You think those numbers are a coincidence? This is a preordained event that occurred because of the delicate conjunction of planets. For a reason. As someone who trained rigorously for 45 minutes under the renowned astronumeropalmist Guru Kilijosyananda in the rugged forests of Parangi Malai, and as someone who has repeatedly predicted past events with unerring accuracy, let me show you the significance of these numbers. That’s three 21s in a row. 21 + 21 + 21 = 63. Now divide that 63 by 3. What do you get? 21 again! While that is amazing in itself, there is more. If you divide that 21 by 3, you get 7. How many views do you think Ms Sandhu’s crowning moment garnered on the pageant’s official Twitter page? 7 lakh views, that’s how many. Hold on, there’s more. Now if you take that 7 and multiply it by 10, you get 70. And she is the 70th Miss Universe. Ha. Do you see what I am saying now? No? Okay, divide that 70 by 10 and you get 7, which is a prime number, which proves once and for all the primacy of our nation among not just all the countries of the world but the entire universe itself. Plus, it happened on the 12th day of the 12th month (though it may have been the 13th for us). And what is that? Thalaivar Rajini’s birthday, dammit! The divine significance of this date aside, Ms Sandhu’s historic win came now to serve as a slap in the face of all those whining about our position on the hunger, pollution, press freedom, happiness, health and employment indices, or how badly we lost in the World Cup. The Crown is ours, for god’s sake. Our beti has brought it back to us. It is only a matter of time before the British realise their mistake, call the Lalitha Jewellery man and request his assistance to prise out the Kohinoor from their crown jewels and courier it to us. So deeply moved by young Ms Sandhu’s glorious victory were the UP Police that they tweeted ‘Congratulations #HarnaazSandhu for bringing back the “beautiful moment” for India after 21 years. Proud of you!’ See that clever pun on beauty there? The ‘beautiful moment’ is within quotes. Kudos. Imagine how secure the lovely Ms Sandhu would be feeling knowing the UP Police is proud of her. The irrepressible Sunny Paaji, too, praised Ms Sandhu’s achievement on Twitter. ‘Women raising the bar in all fields,’ he tweeted. ‘We couldn’t be more proud of her.’ Coming from a man who has raised hand-pumps with alacrity, that is a compliment indeed. Not to be left behind, Upasna Singh of The Kapil Sharma Show took the opportunity to share her connection with Ms Sandhu. ‘She was living with me before leaving for Israel,’ said Ms Singh. ‘She once cooked rajma chawal for me.’ I request Upasna-jito share the recipe with us, so all Indians from all corners of the world can cook and eat the dish on the 12th of next month, call it Universal Rajma Day, and be filled with pride, like we are every other day, about something we can take zero credit for. The next day, as is our duty, we will go back to trolling all unsansakari women who need to be taught a lesson. Krishna Shastri Devulapalli is a satirist. He has written four books and edited an anthology.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/the-universe-conspires/article37982400.ece
18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Kal Penn: ‘I wanted to tell my story in the most truthful way’||Over two decades ago, Kalpen became Kal Penn. This choice of a stage name leaned into the American proclivity for monosyllabic names, without forsaking the Indian roots that bind it. Actor Kalpen Suresh Modi or Kal, who grew up in New Jersey, has a clear vision of his hyphenated Indian-American identity: “Having stronger roots makes me feel more American and interesting.” While working — in a brief sabbatical from acting — in the White House Office of Public Engagement under Barack Obama, he had placed in his office a portrait of Gandhi he received from his grandfather, who was an active participant in the freedom struggle. It was in this role that he helped organise the first White House celebration of Diwali by an American president in 2009. In his memoir, You Can’t Be Serious (Simon & Schuster), Penn, 44, speaks to this hyphenated existence, his years in Hollywood, the casual racism in casting rooms, and the explicit stereotyping in the roles offered, along with his years in the Obama administration. He is best known for starring in the Harold & Kumar franchise, that rewrote how representation on screen can be irresponsibly fun and cuttingly irreverent, and Mira Nair’s The Namesake , based on Jhumpa Lahiri’s novel on an immigrant family’s coming-of-age in a gently fraying America. In a Zoom interview, edited for brevity and clarity, Penn discusses the memoir, whom he wrote it for, and what the path ahead looks like.   Why a memoir now, when you are fairly in the thick of your career?  I wrote the book with two sets of people in mind. One was the 25-year-old version of me, a young Indian-American guy trying to break into Hollywood, while also being interested in social service. There was never a podcast, a book, or a movie that could guide me then. The second group are those that have different passions they want to pursue in life. See, right from the aunties and uncles to the guidance counsellors, everyone told me to do one thing. But now people are embracing the fact that the world isn’t made of mutually exclusive choices. You could have a job, like working on these ridiculous comedies in Hollywood, and then take a sabbatical to work for the first Black president of the United States of America. To your question, I do hope to continue doing a lot more, but I am excited to share this part of my story right now.  Y our relationship to queerness — i t is not something you delve into in your book, and yet you introduce your partner.  I just wanted to tell my story in the most truthful way. The two things I wanted to share were how I met Josh — we have been together for 11 years, engaged for three years — and about my dad. Both are incredibly private people, and I wanted to be respectful of their experiences. Josh and I come from completely different worlds. He grew up in a rural town in Mississippi and I am the son of Gujarati immigrants who grew up in New Jersey. We didn’t grow up with a lot of money; my dad came to America with $12 in his pocket. So, I wanted the story to be about things that brought us together, to be mindful of growing up in a place that was left-leaning and open-minded, with a supportive community.  Did you think there was too much attention given to your queerness in the headlines post the release of this book? Did  Belated  , where you are playing a middle-aged married man with two kids, coming out, happen because of this churn?  While writing that chapter about Josh, I naively thought it wouldn’t be of much interest. I am glad it resonated with so many people. They were congratulating me on Twitter for being engaged. The thing is I have been engaged to Josh for three years. This has just made my mum go “ Kya re ? When are you actually getting married?” That was unexpected [laughs]. You just never know what will resonate with people. Belated , I am very excited about. I play a trauma surgeon, who has been with his wife for 20 years with two beautiful kids. He goes on a business trip, has a couple of drinks with a guy whom he ends up hooking up with and realises he needs to let his wife know he is figuring things out. But like a Ted Lasso or a Ramy, this is just the set up.  What is your relationship like with India?  Because of growing up in New Jersey — a fairly diverse place with a huge Jewish and Italian community — I used to speak both English and Gujarati. My Hindi is still questionable, but I am working on it. So I just assumed that everyone is from somewhere if you are American. It just underscores how American you are if you speak more than one language. Besides, summers were spent in Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and Baroda visiting the grandparents and masis . Then, as an adult, I keep coming here to pitch shows and work here; one of the reasons I am trying to improve my Hindi.  You write that you make playlists for all your characters, like a Dr Dre playlist for  Harold & Kumar  . I’m curious, what was your  Namesake  playlist like?  Gogol’s music choices are in the book. Jhumpa’s writing is incredible, intimate, and accurate — from his ATM code to the room in Yale where he lost his virginity. Part of my research was finding the dorm in Yale and just knocking on the door, forgetting for a second that I was a recognisable actor and that this was a super creepy thing to do.  You spend a lot of time in the book discussing your Obama gig. Was it the Obama nostalgia during the Trump years?  Anybody who has had the honour of working in a place like the White House recognises the incredible opportunity to serve the country and do the right thing. As a mid-level staffer, you feel the work you do is sometimes bureaucratic, sometimes reactive. So many of the things we did were not sexy enough to make it to cable news, but it is what impacted lots of people, making their lives better. It was really inspiring to me.  There’s a constant tension with merit in your book. You keep asking if you deserve what you got or if you got it because you were Indian. What is this unease?  I don’t think it is unease. I write about struggle because I love what we do for a living. Hollywood has changed so wonderfully in the last decade, with streaming. This was why I spoke about the barriers to entry. But you are right because we do talk a lot about imposter syndrome. It is less about whether I deserve to be here as opposed to I can’t believe I’m here.  In 2007, when you played a teenage terrorist in  24  , you had said, “I have a huge political problem with the role. It was essentially accepting a form of racial profiling... But it was the first time I had a chance to blow stuff up... As an actor, why shouldn’t I have that opportunity?” That’s a fascinating dilemma, between wanting to be an actor who does exciting new things and being a brown person in Hollywood who has a fair share of responsibility. Do you still face that?  I am glad you asked that so I can throw New York Magazine under the bus. I definitely didn’t say it that way. I was a little bothered it was written that way. 24 was a cool opportunity. But in terms of reality, we had not had the kind of home-grown radicalisation that has existed since. There was nuance there. One of the first times I had seen brown people on screen with depth and flaws was Mississippi Masala . The family members were not blameless, they were racist. I remember some people not liking that depiction of the Indian community. But what does that mean? The fact that there are flawed, fully-fleshed characters? You just always want more nuance. Hopefully, with streaming, your question will be irrelevant in the years to come. The audience is bored with lazy stereotypes.  What are you working on next?   Hot Mess Holiday releases in India on Comedy Central, I think on Christmas Eve. It is a Diwali/Christmas diamond heist movie I co-produced. Then there is the Nav Bhatia biopic. He [a Canadian businessman and superfan for the Toronto Raptors basketball team] has an incredible story I am excited to tell. I have been a fan of ‘The Superfan’ for a while. I remember seeing him at the games, on the jumbotron thinking, “Who is that uncle on the courtside? This uncle is amazing.” There is also Belated , which starts shooting in February. You Can’t Be Serious is priced at Rs. 699 , and is available at all leading book stores.

In an interesting move, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, chairperson of the Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival, introduced the film through a virtual interaction hosted by the streaming platform with lead actor Tovino Thomas and director Basil Joseph. ‘Something for everyone’ with a focus on ‘strong storytelling’ sums up Netflix India’s current content strategy. “Our approach has been to diversify and have many shades reflected on the canvas. It is a painting that will evolve over time depending on how our audience responds to the choices we’ve made,” Tanya Bami, Series Head Netflix India said recently during the trailer launch of their next India Original, Aranyak . The streaming platform is betting big on its India Originals that span genres and then some. “ Aranyak is a thriller. We have Finding Anamika [ starring Madhuri Dixit], a drama and a hybrid-like Yeh Kaali Kaali Ankhein , a romance thriller. We have a very strong comedic slate with Decoupled with R Madhavan and Surveen Chawla, and the Kapil Sharma special,” she adds. Netflix India is also looking to make deeper inroads into the country by offering more local content, especially in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam. “This year we’ve had many exciting titles like Navarasa and Paava Kadhaigal , [now] we have Minnal Murali . We are cognisant that the way forward is to get into regional languages.”  Read the full interview on weekend.thehindu.com||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/an-eye-on-the-local/article37982468.ece

18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Flex spaces in demand||India’s flex space is expected to see major expansion in Tier-II cities in the coming years. According to a JLL-Awfis report titled “Flex your Workplace”, 48% of respondents/occupiers who already have a presence in Tier-II cities want to further expand. Not just that, 78% of these occupiers are expected to do so within the next one year, with 84% wanting to utilise flex spaces. The story is almost similar for players who do not yet have a presence in Tier-II cities. Even among those who did not have a Tier-II city office footprint, 34% of companies had employees working from such locations. While 47% of the respondents had a presence in Tier-II cities, one-third of those were medium to large companies with employee strength of 3,000 or more. Increasingly, domestic tech firms targeting cities/towns beyond the metros for business expansion opportunities are looking to create regional offices. Such plans will need flex operators as they will be the enablers for providing quality workspaces with quick turnaround time. Times have changed, so have offices. Today’s offices are more flexible and can accommodate the changing needs of their employees. Going flex or hybrid is one way to ensure that talent stays. Through the pandemic, flex has remained resilient. Given the new realities, it’s now a crucial part of occupier real estate strategies. “While 75% of the flex portfolio, on an average, is still in Tier-I cities, the hybrid model is fostering growth of flex operators in Tier-II cities as well. We expect demand for flex spaces to continue to rise in the metros, and the Tier-II cities will witness tremendous growth. Driven by reverse migration, focus on talent across regions and cost of living, the Tier-II market is perfectly poised to witness a significant upswing in hybrid workplaces,” said Radha Dhir, CEO and Country Head, India, JLL.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/flex-spaces-in-demand/article37982480.ece

Even during COVID, while 5 million sq. ft of flex space was closed, the segment reinvented itself and the growth is now being fuelled by demand for managed workspaces, says Samantak Das, Chief Economist and Head of Research & REIS (India), JLL.  Healthy growth Among the top-7 cities, Bengaluru is the clear leader accounting for 34% of the total flex stock. Mumbai and NCR have witnessed healthy growth. Pune and Hyderabad will see remarkable growth in the coming years. “Tenants are increasingly requiring flexibility in lease terms, especially as they await greater clarity in business conditions and workplace strategies. Landlords will need to adapt to tenant demands. Flexible workspace is likely to become a mainstream element of commercial real estate,” says Amit Ramani, Founder and CEO, Awfis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/bengaluru-is-the-clear-leader/article37982481.ece
18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Home again||The pandemic and the subsequent shift in work patterns have led many people to re-evaluate their lifestyle choices and investments. The combination of remote working turning into the new normal, enhanced affordability, need to diversify investments and softening home loan interest rates is creating an ideal environment for Indians to invest in second homes. The market that was initially driven by the desire of having a home in a holiday destination to relax and rejuvenate, is now gaining wider traction from working population. As several aspirational buyers evaluate alternate and additional homes, the market seems to cater to the demand effectively by offering a variety of options. Hence, second homes are witnessing a strong demand growth as the economy emerges from the pandemic. Our recent research reveals that 70% of the consumers would like to invest in second homes within two years. It also reveals that around 70% of the overall demand is for properties priced within Rs. 2 crore. As a part of the research, we analysed the customer responses on critical parameters that they consider while purchasing second homes. These include the desire of having a spacious and comforting second home at a holiday destination that serves an ideal place to relax, unwind and rejuvenate, spacious and larger floor size, and health and wellness. Other significant parameters include direct connectivity from base destination, internet infrastructure and access, and return on initial investment. We have witnessed a higher preference (around 58%) for second homes in gated communities that include apartment complexes, gated villas, penthouses, and condominiums as compared to standalone farmhouses, bungalows and plots. The buyers want to cherish even the limited sense of community living as COVID-19 forced everyone into isolation for a long time. Rising affordability is one of the major key demand drivers of second homes. Though residential property costs have been rising over a period, so is affordability. This is coupled with lower interest rates on home loans. The rise is also attributed to the increase in the number of professional players in the segment. The developers are increasingly offering targeted supply for different customer segments and a smooth digital sales experience to promote safety and hygiene amid the pandemic. The growing presence of property management operators such as AirBnB, Vista Rooms and Isprava is bringing more organisations to the segment. These operators are providing end-to-end property management services to customers. Within India, holiday destinations such as Goa, Lonavala, Dehradun, Shimla and Alibaug are emerging as preferred second home destinations. Across the world, Indians are investing in second homes in London, Dubai, Portugal, Scotland and Canada. A snapshot of South India Coonoor, Ooty, Kodaikanal and Chennai’s East Coast Road (ECR) are the popular second home destinations in Tamil Nadu. In Karnataka, Coorg is a popular holiday home destination, and in Kerala, people are investing in second homes in Wayanad. Tamil Nadu is leading the domestic demand from the south, contributing to over 9% of pan-India demand for second homes. In Chennai’s East Coast Road, 13% of residential housing demand comes from penthouses which are bought as second homes. In other markets, the demand for penthouses is around 3 to 7%. The second home property market in the region is in an early upswing stage and rental yields are around 3 to 4%. The rich cultural heritage, beautiful coastline and picturesque hill stations make Tamil Nadu, which is among the top tourist destinations, a preferred second home destination. Though there has been an appreciation of 15 to 20% in the property prices compared to the pre-pandemic year of 2019, homes still remain affordable as compared to many other markets. The investors thus benefit from good rental income as well as high appreciation advantage. The market is also ideal for end users with excellent road, railway and air connectivity to all parts of the country and countries abroad. Key considerations Millennials do not consider second homes as a symbol of affluence or a means for asset diversification. In fact, these are now the least important factors across age groups. The more important considerations when investing in a second home are price buckets and returns in the short and long terms. They are being used as a means for good income generation in the form of rentals and high returns upon exit. Even when investing in second homes in international locations, the key consideration is getting a good return on investment. In a market where there are many lucrative options available, it becomes even more important to weigh all the pros and cons and make an informed decision. Hence, several investors are also looking at fast-developing localities, rather than only evaluating to invest in an already developed location.  The writer is CEO,   Savills India.

18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Memories around the table||As the year draws to a close, it’s time to cast a look back and look ahead to the new year. Our homes are our haven, and each space evolves with us. Be it the dining room or the kitchen, these are areas where the entire family gathers to enjoy their meals and share their news and views. A place where differences are sorted and bonds are made. What better time than this season of Christmas when peace and joy are for everyone to savour. As 2021 draws to a close, we tell you what dining and kitchen décor trends you can try in 2022: Interesting lighting If you want a chic dining room, interesting lighting is a must. And interesting doesn’t translate into opulent chandeliers or a lineup of pendant lamps. Instead, make a statement with a fixture that’s one of a kind. DIY chandeliers, a string of yarn lamps, or a sci-fi kind of fixture — anything is sure to grab the spotlight. Eye-catching accessories Knick-knacks and artifacts that are off the beaten track will ensure that your dining room stands out. It could be a collection of forks and spoons, vintage containers, stylish posters, super-sized artwork; or vintage menus; they add colour and chutzpah, and spice things up. Velvet upholstery There’s a reason why royalty has, down the ages, had a thing for velvet. This fashion staple can be used on dining chairs, lending the room a rich and opulent feel. Available in a range of colours, it helps create a formal ambience when juxtaposed with decorous settings and can seem casual in an informal setting. Dark walls Dining rooms can get a glam touch with a dark shade of paint. Cloaking the walls in moody and dramatic shades such as navy, scarlet or indigo can create drama. A few light-coloured accessories add interest and visually lighten up the room. Mixed seating We’ve loved the idea of mixed seating in the dining room ever since we saw Monica work the look in her warm apartment in the much-loved serial Friends . Be it materials, colours, styles or eras, a mix of chairs sets off any kind of dining table. The bench Mixed seating is in, for sure, but try and include a bench in your dining seating. Available in a variety of styles, classic to modern, benches are all about form (style), function (seating and storage) or a combination of both. They can be used in dining rooms in a variety of materials — wood, metal, stone, synthetic or upholstered. What can you do in the kitchen? Colour things up With the kitchen taking centrestage as the heart(h) of the home, it is supremely important to think about kitchen decor. Hence the colour consideration — and almost everything can work in this workroom! Smart spaces Gadgets are now a part of life, be it the phone, notebook or the tablet. The modern kitchen needs to be much more accommodating with a designated space to charge devices, send out emails, and even pop your digital cookbook. Say no to plastic Time was when the kitchen was synonymous with a bunch of plastic shelves and dabbas. But no more. Glass and ceramic bottles and tins take pride of place on wooden shelves now — and you would be wise to invest in them and bin all the plastic ware. A hood to keep odours at bay Cooking is now an enjoyable task, one that you often do along with entertaining. A hood/ chimney can help keep those garlicky odours at bay in integrated spaces so that you and your guests can smile on. Shimmer and shine Kitchens and boring don’t need to go together. Mirrored backsplashes, shiny counters, metal lamps and colourful knick-knacks ensure that the cooking room looks good. Add a well-chosen rug, in a dark colour and a striking pattern, to create a grounded feeling and pull the look together.  The modern kitchen needs to be much more accommodating with a designated space to charge devices, send out emails, and even pop your digital cookbook||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/memories-around-the-table/article37982488.ece
18 December 2021||December 18 2021 00:00 IST,||Kal Penn: ‘I wanted to tell my story in the most truthful way’||Over two decades ago, Kalpen became Kal Penn. This choice of a stage name leaned into the American proclivity for monosyllabic names, without forsaking the Indian roots that bind it. Actor Kalpen Suresh Modi or Kal, who grew up in New Jersey, has a clear vision of his hyphenated Indian-American identity: “Having stronger roots makes me feel more American and interesting.” While working — in a brief sabbatical from acting — in the White House Office of Public Engagement under Barack Obama, he had placed in his office a portrait of Gandhi he received from his grandfather, who was an active participant in the freedom struggle. It was in this role that he helped organise the first White House celebration of Deepavali by an American president in 2009. In his memoir, You Can’t Be Serious (Simon & Schuster), Penn, 44, speaks to this hyphenated existence, his years in Hollywood, the casual racism in casting rooms, and the explicit stereotyping in the roles offered, along with his years in the Obama administration. He is best known for starring in the Harold & Kumar franchise, that rewrote how representation on screen can be irresponsibly fun and cuttingly irreverent, and Mira Nair’s The Namesake , based on Jhumpa Lahiri’s novel on an immigrant family’s coming-of-age in a gently fraying America. In a Zoom interview, edited for brevity and clarity, Penn discusses the memoir, whom he wrote it for, and what the path ahead looks like.  Why a memoir now, when you are fairly in the thick of your career?  I wrote the book with two sets of people in mind. One was the 25-year-old version of me, a young Indian-American guy trying to break into Hollywood, while also being interested in social service. There was never a podcast, a book, or a movie that could guide me then. The second group are those that have different passions they want to pursue in life. See, right from the aunties and uncles to the guidance counsellors, everyone told me to do one thing. But now people are embracing the fact that the world isn’t made of mutually exclusive choices. You could have a job, like working on these ridiculous comedies in Hollywood, and then take a sabbatical to work for the first Black president of the United States of America. To your question, I do hope to continue doing a lot more, but I am excited to share this part of my story right now.  Y our relationship to queerness — i t is not something you delve into in your book, and yet you introduce your partner.  I just wanted to tell my story in the most truthful way. The two things I wanted to share were how I met Josh — we have been together for 11 years, engaged for three years — and about my dad. Both are incredibly private people, and I wanted to be respectful of their experiences. Josh and I come from completely different worlds. He grew up in a rural town in Mississippi and I am the son of Gujarati immigrants who grew up in New Jersey. We didn’t grow up with a lot of money; my dad came to America with $12 in his pocket. So, I wanted the story to be about things that brought us together, to be mindful of growing up in a place that was left-leaning and open-minded, with a supportive community.  Did you think there was too much attention given to your queerness in the headlines post the release of this book? Did  Belated  , where you are playing a middle-aged married man with two kids, coming out, happen because of this churn?  While writing that chapter about Josh, I naively thought it wouldn’t be of much interest. I am glad it resonated with so many people. They were congratulating me on Twitter for being engaged. The thing is I have been engaged to Josh for three years. This has just made my mum go “ Kya re ? When are you actually getting married?” That was unexpected [laughs]. You just never know what will resonate with people. Belated , I am very excited about. I play a trauma surgeon, who has been with his wife for 20 years with two beautiful kids. He goes on a business trip, has a couple of drinks with a guy whom he ends up hooking up with and realises he needs to let his wife know he is figuring things out. But like a Ted Lasso or a Ramy, this is just the set up.  What is your relationship like with India?  Because of growing up in New Jersey — a fairly diverse place with a huge Jewish and Italian community — I used to speak both English and Gujarati. My Hindi is still questionable, but I am working on it. So I just assumed that everyone is from somewhere if you are American. It just underscores how American you are if you speak more than one language. Besides, summers were spent in Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and Baroda visiting the grandparents and masis . Then, as an adult, I keep coming here to pitch shows and work here; one of the reasons I am trying to improve my Hindi.  You write that you make playlists for all your characters, like a Dr Dre playlist for  Harold & Kumar  . I’m curious, what was your  Namesake  playlist like?  Gogol’s music choices are in the book. Jhumpa’s writing is incredible, intimate, and accurate — from his ATM code to the room in Yale where he lost his virginity. Part of my research was finding the dorm in Yale and just knocking on the door, forgetting for a second that I was a recognisable actor and that this was a super creepy thing to do.  You spend a lot of time in the book discussing your Obama gig. Was it the Obama nostalgia during the Trump years?  Anybody who has had the honour of working in a place like the White House recognises the incredible opportunity to serve the country and do the right thing. As a mid-level staffer, you feel the work you do is sometimes bureaucratic, sometimes reactive. So many of the things we did were not sexy enough to make it to cable news, but it is what impacted lots of people, making their lives better. It was really inspiring to me.  There’s a constant tension with merit in your book. You keep asking if you deserve what you got or if you got it because you were Indian. What is this unease?  I don’t think it is unease. I write about struggle because I love what we do for a living. Hollywood has changed so wonderfully in the last decade, with streaming. This was why I spoke about the barriers to entry. But you are right because we do talk a lot about imposter syndrome. It is less about whether I deserve to be here as opposed to I can’t believe I’m here.  In 2007, when you played a teenage terrorist in  24  , you had said, “I have a huge political problem with the role. It was essentially accepting a form of racial profiling... But it was the first time I had a chance to blow stuff up... As an actor, why shouldn’t I have that opportunity?” That’s a fascinating dilemma, between wanting to be an actor who does exciting new things and being a brown person in Hollywood who has a fair share of responsibility. Do you still face that?  I am glad you asked that so I can throw New York Magazine under the bus. I definitely didn’t say it that way. I was a little bothered it was written that way. 24 was a cool opportunity. But in terms of reality, we had not had the kind of home-grown radicalisation that has existed since. There was nuance there. One of the first times I had seen brown people on screen with depth and flaws was Mississippi Masala . The family members were not blameless, they were racist. I remember some people not liking that depiction of the Indian community. But what does that mean? The fact that there are flawed, fully-fleshed characters? You just always want more nuance. Hopefully, with streaming, your question will be irrelevant in the years to come. The audience is bored with lazy stereotypes.  What are you working on next?    Hot Mess Holidayreleases in India on Comedy Central, I think on Christmas Eve. It is a Diwali/Christmas diamond heist movie I co-produced. Then there is the Nav Bhatia biopic. He [a Canadian businessman and superfan for the Toronto Raptors basketball team] has an incredible story I am excited to tell. I have been a fan of ‘The Superfan’ for a while. I remember seeing him at the games, on the jumbotron thinking, “Who is that uncle on the courtside? This uncle is amazing.” There is also Belated, which starts shooting in February. You Can’t Be Serious is priced at Rs. 699, and is available at all leading book stores.
