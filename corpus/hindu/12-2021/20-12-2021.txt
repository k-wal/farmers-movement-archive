20 December 2021||CHANDIGARH,||One more lynched in Punjab over ‘sacrilege’||A day after a man was beaten to death over an alleged sacrilege attempt at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Punjab, a mob killed a person on Sunday for allegedly desecrating the Sikh religious flag at a gurdwara in Nijampur village of Kapurthala. The police, however, said the initial investigation indicated that no sacrilege had been committed in the Nijampur gurdwara and the case could be that of theft. “The manager, Amarjeet Singh, saw a man inside the gurdwara early on Sunday and got suspicious as he tried to flee. Two sewadars (co-workers) caught the man and thrashed him. Later, several people gathered there and as emotions ran high, the man was killed. The deceased was wearing a jacket of gurdwara students, which indicates the possibility of theft,” said Harkamalpreet Singh Khakh, Senior Superintendent of Police, Kapurthala. “We are in the process of identifying the man. We will procure his DNA samples. The deceased has suffered sharp injuries to his head and body. We are probing the incident from all angles and will take necessary legal action against the accused who killed the youth,” Mr. Khakh said. The officiating Director-General of Police, Siddharth Chattopadhyaya, said in a tweet: “I have taken serious note of the unfortunate incidents in Amritsar and Kapurthala. Any attempt to violate the communal harmony in the State will be dealt with a firm hand. Stern action will be taken against all those disturbing the law and order in Punjab.” Golden Temple probe Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said a Special Investigation Team (SIT) had been constituted to probe the Golden Temple incident. The team will submit its report within two days. Mr. Randhawa, who also holds charge of the Home Department, termed the incident unfortunate, and said the police would get to the bottom of it. “During preliminary investigation, it has been revealed that the accused entered into the Sri Darbar Sahib (Golden Temple) complex at 11.30 a.m. and he stayed there till late evening, which indicates that the accused had come with a target. The CCTV footage of markets adjoining Sri Darbar Sahib is also being scanned to ascertain if anyone else was there with him. We will probe the entire incident jointly with the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC),” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/one-more-lynched-in-punjab-over-sacrilege/article37993607.ece
20 December 2021||RAMESWARAM,||Sri Lanka arrests 55 Indian fishermen||The Sri Lankan Navy on Sunday seized eight Indian fishing vessels and arrested 55 fishermen on the charge of poaching. The Sri Lankan government agencies said a fast attack craft of the 4th Fast Attack Craft Flotilla attached to the Northern Naval Command took hold of six trawlers and arrested 43 fishermen, hailing from Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, south-east of the Delft Island, Jaffna, in the early hours. The operation was in compliance with the COVID-19 protocol. Arrangements were being made to hand the fishermen over to the authorities concerned for legal action after rapid antigen tests, they said. The agencies said the Navy conducts regular patrols to curb illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters. During the day, the Navy arrested 12 fishermen from Mandapam and seized two trawlers. According to reports received by the fishermen here, the 12 fishermen were taken to a Sri Lankan naval camp. It was not clear whether they would be arrested or released with a warning, said a senior officer in the Fisheries Department in Chennai.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sri-lanka-arrests-55-indian-fishermen/article37993598.ece
20 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Govt. leaving our queries hanging: MPs||Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, on December 7, asked the Union government to give in writing whether it would pay compensation to the families of farmers who died during the year-long agitation. He also asked if the government was considering giving legal guarantee to the minimum support price (MSP) for crops, something that the farmers have been demanding. But the government’s reply in Parliament skipped the first two parts of the question and only answered on the impact of COVID-19 on the farming community. “The first two questions were swallowed up and the answer to the third is that agriculture is functioning smoothly during the pandemic. What kind of a joke is this!” asked Mr. Gandhi on Twitter and tagged the government’s written response to his unstarred question. Several Opposition members have raised a range of complaints regarding the government’s stance: from “unsatisfactory” answers to disallowing questions on the face-off with China along the border. Questions on the border row were posed by BJP member Subramanian Swamy in the Rajya Sabha and by Congress members Manish Tewari and Karti Chidamabaram in the Lok Sabha. But the face-off has been a “no-go area” and the questions were disallowed. DMK leader and Lok Sabha member K. Kanimozhi pointed out that the Union Law Ministry’s response to her question on the status of the Women’s Reservation Bill was “identical” on three different occasions — March 17, 2017, July 28 and December 3 this year. “Gender justice is an important commitment of the government. The issue involved needs careful consideration on the basis of the consensus among all political parties before a Bill for amendment in the Constitution is brought before Parliament,” the Ministry responded. “The government is blindly copy, cut pasting the answers. The Ministers are taking the entire exercise very lightly,” Ms. Kanimozhi said. Congress’s Deputy Leader in the Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi told The Hindu , “In the Lok Sabha over the past few days the Opposition parties have been noting with concern that during the Question Hour, largely the answers from the government have been unsatisfactory.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/govt-leaving-our-queries-hanging-mps/article37993603.ece
20 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||6 nations call for ‘immediate’ aid for Afghans||India and Central Asian nations share a “broad regional consensus” on Afghanistan, said a regional conference of Foreign Ministers in Delhi on Sunday that proposed the use of the India-run terminal at the Chabahar port in Iran as a route for trade. A joint statement issued at the end of deliberations as part of the third India-Central Asia dialogue, hosted by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar with the Foreign Ministers of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, said it was important to provide “immediate” humanitarian aid for Afghans. Sources told The Hindu that the Ministers had confirmed the participation of the leaders of their respective countries at India’s Republic Day celebration, when they will hold a summit-level dialogue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Central Asia dialogue comes a month after National Security Adviser Ajit Doval hosted five counterparts from the region for a security dialogue focusing on Afghanistan. “Ministers noted that there is a broad ‘regional consensus’ on the issues related to Afghanistan, which includes formation of a truly representative and inclusive government, combating terrorism and drug trafficking, central role of the UN, providing immediate humanitarian assistance for the Afghan people and preserving the rights of women, children and other national ethnic groups,” the joint statement said. In his opening remarks, Mr. Jaishankar said that the six nations all shared common “concerns and objectives” in Afghanistan. “We must find ways of helping the people of Afghanistan,” he added. India sent a shipment of medical aid by air to Afghanistan earlier this month, but the bulk of its planned aid including 50,000 tonnes of wheat is still being discussed with Pakistan, the External Affairs Ministry said on Thursday. The five Foreign Ministers travelled to India, sending their deputies to Pakistan for a Organisation for Islamic Cooperation meeting. Turkmenistan Foreign Minister travelled to Islamabad on Saturday, and held bilateral talks with Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. While none of the countries recognise the Taliban, only Tajikistan has taken a strong stand against any bilateral contacts with the group after it took control of Afghanistan in August. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan have re-opened their missions in Kabul. They have also exchanged ministerial level visits with Kabul, as have Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. India has thus far met Taliban leaders publicly only twice, in Doha and Moscow. The dialogue also discussed how to increase links in what Mr. Jaishankar called the “4 C’s” of Commerce, Capacity enhancement, Connectivity and Contacts. India-Central Asia trade is quite small at present, accounting for less than $2 billion, most of which comes from Kazakh oil exports to India. Given Pakistan’s block on land trade from India, the countries determined to make more use of the sea route via Chabahar, which is connected to Central Asian countries by road and rail through Iran, as well as the International North South Transit Corridor that goes via the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. “India welcomed the interest of Central Asian countries to utilize the services of Shahid Beheshti Terminal at Chabahar Port for facilitating their trade with India and beyond,” the joint statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/6-nations-call-for-immediate-aid-for-afghans/article37993605.ece

The hastily called meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Islamabad ended with a promise to set up a fund to provide humanitarian aid through the Islamic Development Bank, which would provide a cover for countries to donate without dealing directly with the country’s Taliban rulers.

Opposition leaders, however, say the call to attend this meeting will have to be taken as a group. Floor leaders of the Congress, Trinamool Congress, CPI, CPI(M) and Shiv Sena confirmed that they had received missives from Mr. Joshi calling for a meeting. Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge responded to Mr. Joshi, saying it is “unfortunate and unfair” to invite only leaders of parties whose MPs have been suspended rather than all opposition party leaders. Pitch for unity His strong pitch for Opposition unity was for once echoed by the Trinamool Congress, which has so far kept away from the joint Opposition strategy meetings called by the Congress. “Monday morning stunt from a government who do not want Parliament to function. Government calls leaders of the four opposition parties whose 12 Rajya Sabha MPs have been arbitrarily suspended. Government leaves other 10 opposition parties out. Failed stunt. All opposition clear: first revoke arbitrary suspension,” tweeted Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien. Sanjay Raut of the Shiv Sena confirmed that Mr. Joshi had written to his party, and added that “Opposition leaders will meet in Parliament tomorrow to take a decision on taking part in the meeting called by the government.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-calls-for-meeting-with-parties-of-suspended-mps/article37993608.ece

Raghav Langer, Divisional Commissioner, Jammu, in a letter to the Defence Ministry on Sunday, said, “Due to strike by electric department personnel in the UT of J&K, essential services have been severely affected in the Jammu region. We would like to hereby requisition the Indian Army to assist in the restoration of the said essential services by provisioning manpower to man critical electricity stations and water supply sources.” Officials said the Army was deployed at various power stations in the Jammu division. Earlier in the day, the Lieutenant Governor’s administration failed to negotiate a settlement with the protesting employees, which, according to one estimate, affected 50% the population in the Union Territory. Discussions going on “There have been rounds of talks at various levels with the Power Development Dept. (PDD) employees on indefinite strike. Power sector reforms are inevitable, as the Centre has directed us to ensure the same. Certain policy-related and service-related issues cannot be decided on the spot, it requires some time-frame and a joint working group,” Mr. Langar said. Around 20,000 employees, including the temporary and permanent daily labourers of the J&K Power Development Department, are protesting and many staying away from the work to protest against the move by the J&K Power Transmission Corporation Limited (JKPTCL) to privatize grid stations to the Power Grid Corporation of India. The employees were also demanding regularisation and promotion of the employees.  Normal life hit Poor electricity supply impacted normal life in parts of Jammu and Kashmir divisions, hitting COVID-19 patients dependent on oxygen concentrators.

National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah said the J&K administration may be able to claim the constitutional authority to privatise the assets of J&K but it completely lacks the political authority.

20 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Priority for Bill on voter ID-Aadhaar link||The Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which seeks to link electoral rolls to Aadhaar number, has been listed for introduction in the Lok Sabha on Monday. The Bill allows electoral registration officers to ask for Aadhaar numbers of applicants wanting to register as voters so as to establish the identity of the applicant. Main topic According to government managers who spoke to The Hindu , priority has been accorded to this Bill over seven others mentioned by Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal on Friday in Parliament as business for the last week of the winter session. The Union Cabinet had cleared the Bill on Wednesday when it met last. It also seeks to allow the officers to ask for the number from “persons already included in the electoral roll for the purposes of authentication of entries in electoral roll, and to identify registration of name of the same person in the electoral roll of more than one constituency or more than once in the same constituency”. The amendment Bill makes it clear that “no application for inclusion of name in the electoral roll shall be denied and no entries in the electoral roll shall be deleted for inability of an individual to furnish or intimate Aadhaar number due to such sufficient cause as may be prescribed”. People who cannot furnish their Aadhaar numbers will be allowed to present other documents to establish identity. According to the Bill circulated to the Lok Sabha members ahead of its introduction, various Sections of the Representation of the People Act, 1950 and 1951 will be amended. The Statement of Objects and Reasons says Section 23 of the RP Act, 1950 will be amended to allow linking of the roll data with the Aadhaar ecosystem “to curb the menace of multiple enrolment of the same person in different places”. Four qualifying dates Amendment to Section 14 of the RP Act, 1950 will allow to have four “qualifying” dates for eligible people to register as voters. As of now, January 1 of every year is the sole qualifying date. People who turn 18 on or before January 1 can register as voters. Those turning 18 after that have to wait for one whole year to register as voters. Now, “the January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 in a calendar year” will be the qualifying dates in relation to the preparation or revision of electoral rolls. Gender-neutrality Amendment to Section 20 of the RP Act, 1950 and Section 60 of the RP Act, 1951 will allow the elections become gender-neutral for service voters. It will also help replace the word “wife” with the word “spouse” making the statutes “gender neutral”. This seeks to redress any discrimination against male spouses of female armed services employees, with “wife” being replaced as “spouse.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/priority-for-bill-on-voter-id-aadhaar-link/article37993548.ece
20 December 2021||Pune,||Goa never forgot its Indianness: Modi||On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Goa from Portugal in 1961, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday inaugurated a raft of development and public work projects estimated at Rs. 600 crore in the poll-bound State, stressing the BJP’s deep ties with Goa in his speech. The diamond jubilee celebrations of Goa’s Liberation Day commenced with Mr. Modi arriving at the Dr. Shyama Prasad Mookerjee Stadium at Taleigao for the main event, where he felicitated freedom fighters and veterans of Operation Vijay, the military action in 1961 by which India liberated the territories of Goa, Daman and Diu from Portuguese rule. “Goa did not lose its ties with India even after enduring 450 years of Portuguese rule. Goa came under Portugal rule when the major part of the country was ruled by the Mughals. But even centuries later, neither Goa has forgotten its Indianness, nor has India forgotten its Goa,” said Mr. Modi. Meet with Pope He also said that had former Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel lived longer, then Goa would not have needed to wait so long for its liberation. The Prime Minister recalled his recent meeting with Pope Francis in Vatican City and the warm sentiments that the head of the Catholic Church had for India following Mr. Modi’s invitation urging the Pope to visit the country. “After I gave him my invitation, Pope Francis said, ‘This is the greatest gift you have given me’… this was his love for India’s diversity and our vibrant democracy,” said Mr. Modi. With elections slated for February 2022, Mr. Modi particularly underscored the BJP’s strong links to the coastal State and the legacy of the BJP government under the late Manohar Parrikar. “When Goan freedom fighter Mohan Ranade continued to languish in a Portuguese prison for over a decade after Goa was liberated, the matter was pursued by [former Prime Minister] Atal Bihari Vajpayee,” he said. Performance lauded Lauding the performance of BJP governments under Parrikar as well as the current Chief Minister Pramod Sawant, the Prime Minister said: “The sincere nature of the Goan people was reflected in the commitment of Manohar Parrikar, who was seen carrying out his duties till his last breath. The country, through his [Parrikar’s] character saw how honest, talented, and hard-working the people of Goa are.” Appreciating Mr. Sawant’s work, the Prime Minister said Goa topped in good governance, per capita income and many other parameters. Greater heights Urging the Goan people to achieve greater heights by the 75th year of the State’s liberation, the Prime Minister said the State was giving strength to the country through its flagship ‘Swayampurna Goa’ programme. The BJP’s massive show-of-strength with Mr. Modi’s presence is seen as a counterpoint to West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee’s hectic campaigning in Goa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/goa-never-forgot-its-indianness-modi/article37993564.ece
20 December 2021||Srinagar,||Pakistani militant killed, say police||A Pakistani militant, affiliated to the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), was killed in a brief shoot-out on the outskirts of Srinagar on Sunday, the police said. Saifulla is the third foreign militant to be killed in the past 33 days in and around the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, the police added. The slain militant, who is said to be a “top commander”, was killed during a shoot-out in the hilly belt of Dhara-Harwan early in the morning. “Saifulla, alias Abu Khalid, alias Shawaz, of the LeT outfit was killed in a brief exchange of fire in the Dhara pocket of the Harwan area of central Kashmir’s Srinagar district,” Inspector-General of Police Vijay Kumar said. He said the wanted militant was from Karachi and had infiltrated in 2016. “He was active in the general area of Harwan and involved in several terror crimes,” Mr. Vijay Kumar said. All the three Pakistani militants killed in the past 33 days were involved in terror crimes, including attacks on security forces, he said. The IGP said it showed Pakistan was hell-bent on disturbing peace in the Valley, especially in Srinagar city. Man arrested In a separate incident, a militant affiliated to the Resistance Front was arrested in Anantnag district of south Kashmir. Preliminary reports suggested that Feroz Ahmad Zargar, 34, alias Kamraan, from Kulgam’s Gratabal Qaimoh, was arrested near the Al-Noor Masjid in Anantnag town.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pak-militant-killed-in-srinagar/article37993533.ece
20 December 2021||New Delhi,||Rahul may return to Cong. helm||The return of Rahul Gandhi. Depending on the context, it could well be about his former Lok Sabha constituency, Amethi, where he held an impressive padayatra against inflation on Saturday. Or about taking back the reins of the party and lead the charge against the ruling BJP. If 2021 witnessed Congress’ group of 23 reformists pushing the boundaries by stating that “our party doesn’t have a full-time president”, loyalists of the Gandhi family have also raised their pitch for Mr. Gandhi to become the chief once again. The election schedule to elect a new president by September 2022 has already been announced but it is not clear if Mr. Gandhi would be a candidate. Leaders close to the former chief argue that he stepped down to ensure ‘accountability’ for the 2019 Lok Sabha poll debacle but has not ruled out the possibility of a return as the party chief. At a meeting of the Congress Working Committee on October 16, when several members urged him to take over, Mr. Gandhi said he would ‘consider it’ but sought ‘ideological clarity’ on key issues. Akhlaq issue He cited the example of the 2015 lynching of 52-year-old Mohammed Akhlaq at Dadri, barely 50 km from Delhi, and pointed out how he wanted to visit his family but many in the party had reservations. Standing up for Mohammed Akhlaq’s family was the right thing to do but the ‘fear’ of being labelled as a party given to ‘minority appeasement’ may have led many to adopt a different course. “The feeling of being a Hindu comes from within and inspired by love and fearlessness. One who doesn’t have love and has fear can’t be a Hindu,” Mr. Gandhi said while addressing a rally at Amethi on Saturday. This assertion by the Congress leader is as much a direction to his colleagues in the party on its political line as it is about taking on the BJP on its turf. Taking a dig at the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent trip to Varanasi, Mr. Gandhi said, “A ‘Hidutavawadi’ bathes alone in the Ganga but a Hindu will bathe with crores of others”. Twin challenges But as the Congress signals the return of Mr. Gandhi to a pivotal role while heading into a new year, it should also factor in the need to be consistent. The challenge to Congress leadership is from within as well as outside, with three-term West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee positioning herself as the main challenger in the Opposition space.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rahul-may-return-to-cong-helm/article37993550.ece
20 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Mixed record for SC’s expert panels||The Supreme Court has stayed the proceedings of West Bengal’s Justice Madan B. Lokur Commission of Inquiry into the Pegasus allegations. The reason for the stay is ostensibly because the apex court is seized of the case and has itself formed an expert technical committee overseen by former apex court judge, Justice R.V. Raveendran, to examine allegations that the Centre used Israeli software Pegasus to spy on citizens. The Justice Raveendran Committee was formed by the court in October to ensure “absolute transparency and efficiency”. The court had asked the committee to submit its report “expeditiously” and posted the next hearing after eight weeks. But committees formed by the court in the past in an earnest effort to uncover the truth or to broker peace have had mixed results. Take the case of an October 2020 order of the court in the stubble-burning case. The court formed a one-man committee of Justice Lokur to protect Delhi NCR from air pollution caused by stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana. But the order came to nothing and was put on hold by the court itself when the Centre promulgated the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance of 2020. Again, the court, with best intentions in mind, formed a four-member committee of experts “to listen to the grievances of the farmers on the farm laws and the views of the government and make recommendations”. At one point in the 11-page order of January 2021, the three-judge Bench led by then Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde had expressed the hope that the committee “may create a congenial atmosphere and improve the trust and confidence of the farmers”. It was reported that the committee gave its report. Meanwhile, the government repealed the three controversial farm laws and the protesting farmers have headed home. Recently, one of the members of the committee, Anil Ghanwat, told the media that the report could play a certain “educational role” and should be made public. The past months had seen Supreme Court’s Justice V.S. Sirpurkar Commission repeatedly seek extensions because of the pandemic to complete its probe into the deaths of four men, accused of the gang-rape and murder of a veterinarian, in an alleged encounter with the Hyderabad Police on December 6, 2019. In the Ramjanmabhumi dispute case, the constitution of a mediation committeedid not stop adversarial litigation in court and the final judgment in favour of the Hindus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mixed-record-for-scs-expert-panels/article37993529.ece
20 December 2021||Bhopal,||Cautious welcome for Gadchiroli’s first jumbos||The herd of 22 wild elephants that has been in Kanker, Balod, Gariaband,and Dhamtari districts of Chhattisgarh for the last nine years, has successfully surmounted the last natural barrier to settle down in its new habitat in Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra. Conservationists say the habitat is ideal for elephants but express concern on possible human-elephant conflict during tendu leaf collection and in case of crop damage. “The team of Chanda Hathni has entered the forest of Gadchiroli district in Maharashtra,” Satovistha Samajdar, Divisional Forest Officer of Dhamtari district told The Hindu . The herd is very gentle, well behaved and even responds to the calls of the Balod and Dhamtari district field forest staff members, Mr. Samajdar said. Peaceful stay According to the forest officials, the Chanda Hathni herd entered Dhamtari district from Balod district forest ranges somewhere in February 2021. The forest officials narrated two interesting incidents during the herd’s stay in Balod. After the male tusker departed, the herd was blessed with a baby. The forest officials also managed to change the radio collar of Chanda Hathni that got damaged in September 2021. The group of 22 elephants that has been in the forested areas in Dhamtari district for about 10 months, started travelling westwards in September without doing any harm to other wildlife or humans. First settlers It eventually reached the outskirts of Gadchiroli district in Maharashtra categorised as tribal dominated with about 76% of its area is covered with forest, an official said. The main river basin of the district is the Godavari, while Vainganga, Pranhita and Dina are three other major rivers flowing through the district, he said. However, the district does not have any records of regular and resident elephants. In fact, the State was overwhelmed when in 2006, a herd of elephant entered Maharashtra from adjoining Karnataka. The State government has drawn a long-term mitigation plan of about Rs. 1.4 crore to ensure safety to the elephants, and acquired drones for aerial monitoring of the animals’ movement in the night to ensure safety of villagers. Action plan According to Deputy Conservator of Forests, Gadchiroli Division, S.R. Kumaraswamy, although this herd has appeared peaceful and harmless so far, it was being monitored closely and officials are preparing an action plan if it decides to stay in the district. Along with the excitement is concern of human-elephant conflict.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cautious-welcome-for-gadchirolis-first-jumbos/article37993543.ece
20 December 2021||New Delhi,||RTI plea seeking SBI reports on poll bonds dismissed||The Central Information Commission (CIC) has dismissed an appeal seeking disclosure of reports submitted by the State Bank of India to the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India regarding sale and encashment of electoral bonds in 2018 which are withheld by the SBI on grounds of personal information held in fiduciary capacity. Nearly three years after an appeal was filed with the CIC, the highest adjudicator of RTI matters, Information Commissioner Suresh Chandra noted that there appears to be “no public interest” in further prolonging the matter as there is no substance in the appeal calling for intervention by the Commission. “The Commission after adverting to the facts and circumstances of the case, hearing both the parties and perusal of records, feels that due information has been given to the appellant,” he said. Denomination-wise data The case pertains to an RTI application filed by activist Venkatesh Nayak seeking denomination wise details of electoral bonds sold by the SBI in March and April 2018, total number of buyers, application forms submitted for buying the bonds, reports submitted by the SBI to the RBI and the Government on sale and encashment of bonds, in his eight pointer application. The SBI provided the data on electoral bonds sale through various branches, but did not give details on application forms submitted for purchase of the bonds and the reports submitted by the bank to the RBI and the Government, citing two exemption clauses — information being held in fiduciary capacity and information being personal in nature — to deny the information. Mr. Nayak approached the CIC in 2018 with his appeal against the SBI’s denial of information. The petitioner argued that the Electoral Bonds Scheme, 2018 was not legislation duly enacted by Parliament or legislature. Mr. Nayak cited the reply of the SBI on his query on the methodology applied by the bank to ascertain whether or not a political party redeeming electoral bonds with any of authorised branches had secured at least 1% of the votes polled during the last round of general elections, as required under the bond scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rti-plea-seeking-sbi-reports-on-poll-bonds-dismissed/article37993553.ece
20 December 2021||CHENNAI,||Avoid self-medication: DGCA to pilots||The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has advised pilots to avoid self-medication and taking over-the-counter medication as it could be detrimental to their flying performance. In a safety advisory, the DGCA said one of the foremost health determinants of psychomotor and cognitive flying performance was the use of medicines by pilots. “It is an undeniable fact that some of the prescription drugs or over-the-counter drugs can impair the performance of pilots on duty… More so, in the Internet age, the pilots are now more aware of drugs and self-medication. However, they lack awareness of the potential side-effects of self-medication, which may impede their cognitive and decision-making performance,” the aviation watchdog said. To ensure safe flight operations, pilots have an arduous task that starts with the planning phase of a flight through the end of it. Even a slight impairment of pilot’s cognitive or psychomotor skills and his/her decision-making ability is a significant threat to safety and can be a potential contributory factor in an accident. A report of the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) suggested that 467 of the 5,231 pilots involved in accidents from 1990 to 2005 were found positive for illicit or prescription drugs. The advisory said that in an Air India Express plane crash on May 22, 2010, the pilot was on ‘self-medication’ for his “seemingly trivial” symptoms of stomach upset and sore throat that resulted in sedation and adversely affected his flying performance and decision making. Another accident involving an Air India Express flight exposed numerous human factor issues among the causes of the accident, of which “adverse physiological condition” of the pilot due to self-medication for diabetes was highlighted. “The series of errors committed by pilot were partly and indirectly attributed to the subtle incapacitation caused due to mild hypoglycaemia as a result of multiple un-prescribed anti-diabetes drugs that he was consuming,” the advisory said.  It is an undeniable fact that some of the prescription drugs or over-the-counter drugs can impair the performance of pilots on duty||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/avoid-self-medication-dgca-to-pilots/article37993562.ece
20 December 2021||Pune,||Better coordination needed between NDRF, SDRF: Shah||Stressing the need for better coordination between the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Forces (SDRF) in individual States, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday said that unless the two outfits worked in closer affinity, problems could arise in rescue efforts during major calamities. Mr. Shah, who inaugurated the camp of fifth NDRF Battalion near Talegaon in Pune, congratulated the NDRF for its swift response towards disasters within the country as well as the dedication of its personnel in tackling calamities in other countries across the globe. “Though the work of SDRF personnel in most States has been satisfactory, they are in need of guidance in terms of training and adaptability with the latest equipment. Hence, the NDRF and SDRF must coordinate and train jointly,” said the Minister. “It is critical that 16 NDRF battalions today are strategically stationed at various places across the country for swift response. People heave a sigh of relief when they see NDRF personnel in their orange uniforms,” Mr. Shah said, praising the exploits of the NDRF jawans. Observing that the NDRF’s work in aiding in disaster management and relief in neighbouring countries had won plaudits for the outfit, the Home Minister also urged the NDRF form a team to study all dimensions and problems in disaster management across the globe. Mr. Shah also inaugurated a new building of the city’s Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory (CFSL) facility.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/better-coordination-needed-between-ndrf-sdrf-shah/article37993535.ece
20 December 2021||Kolkata,||Sporadic violence mars Kolkata polls||Isolated incidents of violence, including attacks on candidates, and allegations of electoral irregularities by the Opposition parties marked the polling for the Kolkata Municipal Corporation election on Sunday. While polling for 144 wards took place without the deployment of the Central Armed Police Forces, the Kolkata police deployed over 23,000 personnel across 4,939 booths. Polling started at 7 a.m. and by 5 p.m. about 64% of the voters had exercised their franchise. The final voting percentage may rise. Three persons sustained injuries after a crude bomb was hurled near a school. There were reports of a bomb being hurled at another school in the same ward. Meena Devi Purohit, BJP councillor, alleged that she was assaulted by the Trinamool Congress supporters. Another BJP candidate, Rajarshi Lahiri, was assaulted by unidentified people and was admitted to a hospital. Supporters of the Congress and the Trinamool were involved in a scuffle at a polling venue and the police had to intervene. Sujata Saha (CPI-M) sustained injuries in an attack and was admitted to the State-run SSKM Hospital. The vehicle of another contestant Faiz Ahmed Khan was attacked. BJP MLAs blocked Five MLAs of the BJP who were residing at the MLA Hostel on Kyd Street said they were not allowed to leave it as the main gate was locked. The police did not allow them to leave the premises. The BJP claimed that the MLAs had an appointment with the Governor and threatened to block the streets if there were any electoral irregularities. The polls are crucial not only because its outcome will decide who will administer the civic body for the next five years but also because the State government and the ruling party have assured the Calcutta High Court that the polls will be “free and fair” without the need for additional forces. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said the Kolkata police have done a good job as far as the management of the polls is concerned. “If somebody does drama it is better to ignore,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sporadic-violence-mars-kolkata-polls/article37993536.ece
20 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Private hospitals to be tagged for being breastfeeding-friendly||A new initiative will now help mothers identify “breastfeeding-friendly” hospitals before they give birth. The Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India (BPNI), in collaboration with the Association of Healthcare Providers of India (AHPI), which comprises more than 12,000 private hospitals, has launched an accreditation programme that will enable hospitals to get a “breastfeeding-friendly” tag. This programme is called “Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI)”. The initiative is only for private hospitals and is based on the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s MAA programme for government hospitals launched in 2016. The certification process involves two stages — the first stage includes self-assessment by a hospital, followed by an external assessment by an authorised appraiser who interviews doctors, nurses and patients as well as reviews different practices and training of staff. The accreditation process costs Rs. 17,000 per hospital. Golden hour Early initiation of breastfeeding continues to be low in the country. According to the National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-2021), while there were 88.6% institutional births, only 41.8% of infants were breastfed within the first one hour, which has improved only marginally from 41.6% during NFHS-4 (2015-2016). In fact, many States such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh have shown a decline in the proportion of children breastfed within the first hour. Provision of mother’s breast milk to infants within one hour of birth ensures that the infant receives the colostrum, or “first milk”, which is rich in protective factors, according to the WHO. Lack of support and counselling for expectant mothers during pregnancy and at birth as well as aggressive promotion of baby foods are the reasons for poor early breastfeeding rates. C-section delays A rise in caesarean sections is also known to negatively impact breastfeeding rates.“During caesarean operations everyone is focused on recovery, wound surgery, infection control and breastfeeding within the golden hour is missed. Evidence shows that improving breastfeeding rates in hospitals reduces neonatal mortality and infant mortality rates. Therefore, it is important that we train our nurses, doctors and allied health staff. We will roll out our accreditation programme in phases and begin with 100-bed hospitals through our 19 chapters,” said Giridhar Gyani, Director General, AHPI. The tools for this evaluation process have been developed in partnership with the Health Ministry and World Health Organisation. The BFHI programme is a worldwide programme of the WHO and UNICEF. Though India adopted it in 1993, it fizzled out by 1998 and is now being revived after more than two decades. Chennai’s Bloom Healthcare has become the first hospital to be recognised as “breastfeeding-friendly” under this programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/private-hospitals-to-be-tagged-for-being-breastfeeding-friendly/article37993561.ece
20 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Poshan data under wraps for ‘privacy’||Data recorded in the Poshan (Nutrition) Tracker have not been made public in the interest of privacy of women and children, the government told Parliament last week. “The data that we deal with within the Poshan Tracker, to maintain the privacy of women and children in our country, especially the minor children whose data should not be publicly made available, is an issue which is close to my heart. My pledge is to honour the privacy of women and children who are serviced by the Government of India in collaboration with State Governments across the anganwadi systems in the country,” Smriti Irani, Minister for Women and Child Development, told the Lok Sabha on Friday. The Minister was responding to a question from YSRCP MP Goddeti Madhavi on why nutrition indicators recorded in the tracker were not in public domain. Critical tool The tracker is one of the important pillars of the Poshan Abhiyan and helps the government monitor services delivered at 12.3 lakh anganwadi centres and record nutritional indicators of 9.8 lakh beneficiaries, including children in the age of six months to six years as well as pregnant women and lactating mothers. Anganwadis provide six services, which include supplementary nutrition in the form of hot-cooked meals and take home ration, immunisation and pre-school education. The Government has spent Rs. 1,053 crore to develop the tracker. Of the total, Rs. 600 crore was spent on procurement of smartphones, followed by Rs. 203.96 crore on smartphone recharge and maintenance, Rs. 180.68 crore on incentives to anganwadi workers and helpers for using the technology and Rs. 68 crore on training. These details were provided by the Ministry of Women and Child Development to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth and Sports which tabled its report recently. Limited details On its Poshan Tracker website ( https://poshantracker.in/ ), the government hosts a dashboard which provides only limited administrative details at national, State and district level. This includes total attendance on a given day, vaccinations, take-home ration and hot cooked meals delivered. But it provides no information on the nutrition status of the beneficiaries such as stunting and wasting among children or prevalence of anaemia. Constant monitoring The parliamentary committee in its report raised several questions on the effective use of the Poshan Tracker. It sought that key performance indicators be constantly monitored and uploaded on its website and a State-wise progress report be maintained “so that identification of those deprived of the benefits can be made on a real-time basis for timely remedial measures.” The committee also recommended that the Ministry put in place a monitoring mechanism to ensure there were no gaps in distribution of food packets to anganwadi beneficiaries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/poshan-data-under-wraps-on-privacy-concerns/article37993545.ece

20 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Mental disability: SC sets aside disciplinary action||The Supreme Court has held that disciplinary proceedings against a person with mental disability amounts to indirect discrimination. “The mental disability impairs the ability of persons to comply with workplace standards in comparison to their able-bodied counterparts. Such persons suffer a disproportionate disadvantage due to the impairment and are more likely to be subjected to disciplinary proceedings. Thus, the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against persons with mental disabilities is a facet of indirect discrimination,” a Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud observed in a recent judgment. The court held that such a person is protected under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act provided the discrimination was triggered by the disability. Notable judgement The judgment came in an appeal filed by Ravinder Kumar Dhariwal, an assistant commandant in Central Police Force, who was accused of using offensive language, of appearing in the media without prior approval and assault. However, the court discovered that the appellant had a history of depression and categorised with up to 70% disability. Setting aside the disciplinary action against him, the court protected his pay and emoluments and gave the authorities the discretion to assign him a job which does not require use or control of fire arms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mental-disability-sc-sets-aside-disciplinary-action/article37993527.ece

India sent a shipment of medical aid by air to Afghanistan earlier this month, but the bulk of its planned aid including 50,000 tonnes of wheat is still being discussed with Pakistan, the External Affairs Ministry said on Thursday. The five Foreign Ministers travelled to India, sending their deputies to Pakistan for a Organisation for Islamic Cooperation meeting. Turkmenistan Foreign Minister travelled to Islamabad on Saturday, and held bilateral talks with Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. While none of the countries recognise the Taliban, only Tajikistan has taken a strong stand against any bilateral contacts with the group after it took control of Afghanistan in August. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan have re-opened their missions in Kabul. They have also exchanged ministerial level visits with Kabul, as have Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. India has thus far met Taliban leaders publicly only twice, in Doha and Moscow. The dialogue also discussed how to increase links in what Mr. Jaishankar called the “4 C’s” of Commerce, Capacity enhancement, Connectivity and Contacts. India-Central Asia trade is quite small at present, accounting for less than $2 billion, most of which comes from Kazakh oil exports to India. Given Pakistan’s block on land trade from India, the countries determined to make more use of the sea route via Chabahar, which is connected to Central Asian countries by road and rail through Iran, as well as the International North South Transit Corridor (INSTC) that goes via the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. “India welcomed the interest of Central Asian countries to utilize the services of Shahid Beheshti Terminal at Chabahar Port for facilitating their trade with India and beyond,” the joint statement said, adding that Mr. Meredov had stressed on the importance of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline project. The dialogue also decided to explore establishing joint working groups to address issues of free movements of goods and services between India and Central Asian countries, according to the statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/six-nations-call-for-urgent-aid-for-afghan/article37993538.ece

The stern directive by the technical education regulator came following an objection raised by the Cyprus government with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) after some Indian academics participated in a conference organised in the occupied part of the Republic of Cyprus. “The institutions have also been asked to instruct their faculty members to not become party to any event organised in states or countries not recognised by the Indian government,” a senior AICTE official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/aicte-issues-directive-to-colleges/article37993540.ece

The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) had asked the State Government to take appropriate action after a petition from the Chakma Development Foundation of India (CDFI) said such an exercise was nothing but racial profiling aimed at throwing the refugees out of Arunachal Pradesh. The Buddhist Chakmas and Hindu Hajongs, displaced by a dam in erstwhile East Pakistan and subsequent religious persecution, had been settled in Arunachal Pradesh in the 1960s. “The Government of Arunachal Pradesh must tell the PMO that the census is an administrative exercise,” AAPSU general secretary Tobom Dai said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/group-wants-census-despite-pmo-order/article37993546.ece
20 December 2021||New Delhi,||Assam CM grabbed govt. land: Congress||Accusing Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his family of “grabbing” 18 acres of government land meant for the landless, the Congress on Sunday demanded a Supreme Court-monitored probe by a Special Investigative Team (SIT) and sought Mr. Sarma’s dismissal. At a a press conference, All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Assam Jitendra Singh, Lok Sabha member Gaurav Gogoi and party spokesperson Gourav Vallabh alleged that Mr. Sarma had “misused” his official position to illegally transfer the land in favour of RBS Realtors from 2006 to 2009. Mr. Sarma was a powerful Minister in the Tarun Gogoi-led Congress Government when the transfer is said to have taken place. So far, neither the Assam Chief Minister nor the BJP has commented on the allegations. The Congress leaders claimed as per independent investigations, the real estate company, co-founded by Mr. Sarma’s wife, is allegedly occupying around 18 acres meant for landless individuals and institutions. “We want that the Prime Minister should conduct a probe by a SIT under the monitoring of a sitting Supreme Court judge,” Mr. Vallabh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/assam-cm-grabbed-govt-land-congress/article37993742.ece
20 December 2021||New Delhi,||Man convicted by weapon tracing||“Every firearm tells a story”, a Sessions Court in Nuh said while convicting an ex-Army official for shooting dead a man, over a trivial dispute, after tracing the ownership of murder weapon through the unique identification number engraved on the pistol. Additional Sessions Judge Prashant Rana, while sentencing the convict Khalid to life imprisonment, also stressed that the investigating officers (IOs) and the public prosecutors should be sensitised to the importance of firearms tracing and its role in justice delivery system. The judge noted that there was a delay in dispensation of justice of around one year in this case due to a lapse of the IO in tracing the ownership of the firearm. The court said that the pistol was seized from Khalid and it bore a unique identification number through which the IO could have easily proved the ownership and chain of custody of the weapon of offence, but he did not do so. The unique identification number could have been easily linked Khalid as its owner, but it was not investigated, the court said. “The lapse of the investigating officer may have been wilful and deliberate, or on account of lack of training,” the judge said. The court said that every police station has a register with the details of all the arms licences and weapons issued to the citizens, in its jurisdictional area. There is a national portal too — National Database On Arms Licence — containing a database of arms licences. These sources may be tapped to trace a firearm, the court said. On September 2, 2018, Khalid had fired a gunshot at Aamil Rashid, who passed away two days later. Khalid was arrested four days later and the murder weapon was recovered upon his disclosure. The court had convicted Khalid based on the dying declaration of Rashid, the weapon seized from him, and the matching ballistics report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/man-convicted-by-weapon-tracing/article37993551.ece

20 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Corporation plans to set up carbon credit framework||The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) and Chennai Smart City Ltd. will set up a carbon credit framework, facilitating emission reduction by civic infrastructure projects. Once the carbon credit framework is in place, the Corporation will be able to improve civic infrastructure projects with better facilities for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, get money for infrastructure projects that are environment friendly and trade carbon credits, which are permits that allow organisations to emit a certain amount of greenhouse gas. Under the carbon credit framework, organisations can purchase additional credits from other organisations that offset GHG emissions through programmes that directly remove GHG in the atmosphere. For example, the proposed increase in green cover by the Corporation is one such environment-friendly initiative. Eco-friendly steps Other programmes that use environment-friendly alternatives to traditional technology, such as solar energy, will gain prominence in the carbon credit framework. LED street lights project of the Corporation has led to a reduction in carbon emissions. The civic body will assess the impact of the project and explore ways to improve the street lights infrastructure to reduce carbon emissions. Expert in LED technology J. Kumar, UGC-BSR faculty fellow, said the Corporation and other line agencies should focus more on projects such as the installation of charging stations with solar power for electric vehicles. “In India, we are leading in terms of putting solar panels on waterbodies. Earlier, there were technical issues in doing this. Now they are able to stabilise and put such things. Electric vehicles are considered to minimise greenhouse issues. But that electricity should not be generated by burning fossil fuels. We can minimise carbon footprint by using standalone solar panels for electric vehicles charging stations,” said Prof. Kumar. “The State has always been a pioneer in initiatives such as LED streetlights. After LEDs were commercially made available, the city installed them along roads, near landmarks such as the Raj Bhavan. Later, the technology was adopted in the city. We have to adopt more innovations in such technologies. Similarly, public buildings can have better thermal management to minimise their carbon footprint,” said Prof. Kumar. AGS Colony Residents’ Welfare Association president Geetha Ganesh said tree planting drives should be supported by providing better tree pruning equipment and technical expertise to sustain the green cover. “TNEB workers who prune the trees are not doing it properly. They are damaging a large number of trees planted by residents. The Corporation Parks Department has to monitor such pruning,” said Ms. Ganesh. “To reduce carbon footprint, the GCC should coordinate with MTC to improve public transport in every nook and corner of the city. Small buses can be changed to EVs so they can be used more as a local transit or as transfer buses. Tree plantation can be encouraged, provided the GCC improves the staff in its Park Department, across all zones. Tree pruning becomes a problem during the monsoon because of inadequate staff in the 15 zones. Cycling should be encouraged after providing safe cycling tracks across the city. Solar-powered streetlights also can be looked into as an alternative,” said Ms. Ganesh. Former Corporation floor leader V. Sukumar Babu said the Corporation and Chennai Smart City Ltd. should hold a public consultation before finalising the carbon credit framework, as a number of residents do not understand the significance of emission reduction. According to Corporation officials, Chennai Smart City Ltd. and the GCC stand to benefit from setting up a carbon credit framework. The civic body has prepared a Request for Proposal to call for consultancy for revenue generation from carbon credits for Chennai Smart City Limited. The consultants will register the eligible projects under any of these methods, and explore any other credit for GCC and Smart City projects. The consultants will be responsible for the trading of issued carbon credits and bringing revenue to the current bank account of the Corporation and Smart City. The consultants will carry out extensive research and data gathering to fill the documents, find a buyer and plan for long-term monitoring of emission reduction. The consultants will also have to make a plan for the project, in the event of the loss of project infrastructure, for instance, damages to solar panels on building roofs due to a cyclone. Moreover, a comprehensive set of guidelines are to be set out by the bodies that issue carbon credits. In terms of emission documentation, the first required step is for the consultant to document emission savings by various infrastructure projects. There is an extensive list of documents for project registration, which will need to illustrate how much emission reduction or removal is taking place, and the manner in which the project is achieving this, said an official. Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said the civic body had included many environment experts in the Smart City projects to cut down carbon footprint.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/corporation-plans-to-set-up-carbon-credit-framework/article37993842.ece

20 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Row over outsourcing leaves Ambattur in a mess||The vast open space at the intersection of Justice Rathnavel Pandian Road and Oori Road in Mogappair East, which has become a dump, is symptomatic of the issues in conservancy operations across Ambattur zone of the Greater Chennai Corporation. Not only the residents, but the conservancy workers also dump garbage on this spot, which is surrounded by houses, a hospital, eateries and shops. The stink from garbage permeates the area. R. Meyyappan, a resident of the locality, said the problem persisted despite bringing it to the notice of the Corporation officials several times. “It is unhygienic, causing health issues. It has led to an increase in rat menace as well in the area,” he said. Businesses hit A person running a restaurant in the locality said that he spends a full bottle of insect repellent every day to keep away the flies as odour keeps customers away. Ambattur has a unique arrangement of conservancy operations. The zone was supposed to be one of the four — the other three being Tiruvottiyur, Manali and Madhavaram — in which conservancy work was to be outsourced to the Ramky Group earlier this year. Even as the Ramky Group was installing garbage bins in the zone, the plan was shelved after fierce protest by conservancy workers engaged under the National Urban Livelihood Mission (NULM), who feared loss of jobs. Subsequently, Ramky Group took over the work in Tiruvottiyur, Manali and Madhavaram zones and just three of the fifteen wards in Ambattur Zone. Residents and conservancy workers alleged that as the garbage clearance in the zone was supposed to be outsourced, the GCC did not invest adequately in conservancy operations. While the GCC had begun addressing a number of these issues now, the workers and residents said that a lot more had to be done to improve the situation. Not enough vehicles A few key concerns raised were inadequate number of bins, tricycles, battery operated vehicles and compactor vehicles, all of which led to overflowing garbage bins and dumping of garbage in open spaces. A conservancy worker said the tricycle she was using was more than 10 years old. “There are fewer garbage bins. I have to push the tricycle for long distances to dump the garbage in the bins,” she said. The workers were not even given adequate safety gear. “Workers in many other zones received rain coats during the recent rain. We had to work without them,” she said. Nearly 1,500 NULM conservancy workers were engaged by the GCC in Ambattur Zone, whose contract had been extended till April 2022 following their protest. With the GCC not investing adequately, the workers fear that they would eventually be terminated and work would be outsourced to a private contractor. Data provided by the GCC showed that there were 16 compactor vehicles deployed in the zone to remove roughly 420 tonnes of solid waste daily. Compared to other zones, the number of compactor vehicles was low. For instance, Thiru Vi Ka Nagar zone, which generated 426 tonnes of waste, had 22 compactor vehicles and Anna Nagar had 33 compactors for 501 tonnes of waste generated daily. Admitting that rain had worsened some of the problems, a top official said that several steps were being taken to improve the situation. He said that more bins had been allocated to the zone apart from deploying 100 new battery-operated vehicles. Eateries blamed He said that a key problem was smaller eateries dumping their waste in bins past midnight, soon after the compactor vehicles cleared the garbage. “Now, we have told them that our battery operated vehicles or tricycle operators will collect it from them at night. We have asked them to keep the waste segregated,” he said. The official said that a drive had been initiated to repair all the partially damaged bins and tricycles within the next 10 days. Pointing out that the recent rains resulted in the generation of a lot of garden waste, he said these have been cleared. The mass cleaning drive planned from Monday till Friday would help in clearing all the accumulated garbage and in maintaining the zone cleaner going forward, the officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/row-over-outsourcing-leaves-ambattur-in-a-mess/article37993836.ece
20 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Tamil Nadu people won’t take BJP seriously’||Lauding the DMK government’s performance, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) president K.S. Alagiri, in an interview to The Hindu, rejects the charge that the Congress, by simply endorsing its Dravidian ally, is ceding the political space to the BJP. He is of the view that people in the State will not take the BJP seriously. Excerpts:  How would you rate the DMK Government’s performance in the last seven months? The DMK Government is performing well. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin is performing well, he has the Cabinet under his control, the Ministers and officials carry out their duties according to his guidance and directions. During the [recent] floods, too, his work was commendable. At many places, members of the public were telling me that water had never drained faster before in such a scenario. Also, the reduction of the petrol price by Rs. 3, the first cut by any State, was a big thing. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi didn’t do it for seven years, but Mr. Stalin did it. We are also seeing that people associated with the DMK...if they are stepping out of line, they are being condemned or punished. Does the Congress have any seat-sharing expectation from the DMK in the urban civic bodies polls? We are looking at a respectable number of seats. I hope the Chief Minister will listen to our wishes. The DMK promised there will be no NEET if it was voted to power. But now the next NEET will be held in a few months... Electoral promises cannot be fulfilled in one day. They [DMK Government] are working towards getting NEET abolished in the State. Other States do not have as much opposition to the exam because the syllabus in 90% of their schools, including government schools, is the CBSE’s. Our syllabus is largely the State Board. The demand for abolishing NEET is not political or meant to oppose anyone. NEET is not in line with the education offered in Tamil Nadu and it is tough for rural students. The State Government cannot dump the exam just like that. It is following a process to get it abolished. During the AIADMK Government, the Congress was vocal but now appears to have gone silent. BJP State president K. Annamalai is saying his party will be the principal Opposition party. Is the Congress ceding political space by being in the DMK’s shadow? The BJP might be doing various activities but people do not take them seriously, nor are they in people’s minds. They won only four out of 23 Assembly seats and its then president L. Murugan and incumbent Annamalai were defeated. It is not right to say the Congress is not seen doing anything. In India, no party is willing to go it alone. All parties, including the BJP, are part of alliances. So why should the Congress fight alone? We are an alliance partner of the DMK and when the government does good things, it is only right to commend them. On the other hand, if they [the DMK Government] do something wrong, we will point it out. Mr. Annamalai and Naam Tamilar Katchi leader Seeman want the Tamizh Thaai Vaazthu to be played fully instead of the abridged version... What the DMK Government has done now [declaring the abridged version the State song] is the correct thing. Religion, god or spirituality is based on every individual. It cannot be forced on anyone. In the full version, there is a line “ Aariyam Pol …” …if the government uses it, it will be wrong. Political parties can use this line if they want at their events, but the government cannot do it. Mr. Annamalai and Mr. Seeman are trying to see if they can put the DMK Government in a spot and ensure it gets a bad name. How do you view the criticism in some quarters of Governor R.N. Ravi not visiting Coonoor to pay respects to Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and others who died in a helicopter crash? There is nothing wrong with that. The Chief Minister went to Coonoor. The Governor paid his respects to a photograph of the CDS at Tiruchi. There is no need to politicise the issue.  We are an ally of the DMK and when the government does good things, it is only right to commend them. On the other hand, if it does something wrong, we will point it out||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-of-tamil-nadu-wont-take-bjp-seriously/article37993817.ece

20 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Centuries-old sculptures found in Chengalpattu||A team of the Chennai Circle of the Archaeological Survey (ASI) of India has dated three sculptures, found at Irumbedu in Chengalpattu district, at 5th century AD Two have been identified as the sculptures of Goddess Vinayaki, the female form of Lord Vinayaka, and Lakulisa, the preceptor of Pasupatha school of Shaivism. The figure in the third sculpture is yet to be firmly ascertained, the ASI officials said. R. Ramesh, archaeologist, Chennai Circle, said an ASI team visited the village a few months ago after Ezhil Murugan, a resident, alerted them to the presence of two sculptures. The team included M. Prasanna, archaeologist, Temple Survey Project, Southern Region, Chennai Circle, ASI, and P.T. Nagarajan, epigraphist, Chennai Circle, ASI. “The two half-buried sculptures were worshipped by the villagers,” Mr. Ramesh said. They were sculpted on stone slabs. One was that of Goddess Vinayaki, which is rarely found in Tamil Nadu. The other was worshipped as Goddess Durgai Amman. “However, the iconographic features indicate that the sculpture is of a male. It may either be Lord Vishnu or Karthikeya. We are not able to say with certainty yet,” he said. Recently, the team was alerted to the presence of a third sculpture in the village, which was subsequently identified as that of Lakulisa. Mr. Ramesh said the age of the sculptures was estimated on the basis of the inscriptions found in them. “The script was a form of Tamil that was used around that period,” he said. All the three sculptures had the same inscriptions that read, ‘Cheyam Patta Mutthira Varikan Madavathi’. This indicated that the sculptures were donated to the village by a person named Mutthira Varikan Madavathi to mark his victory. “We do not have further information. We will be researching more on these sculptures,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centuries-old-sculptures-found-in-chengalpattu/article37993855.ece
20 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Centre is not paying funds owed to States’||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Sunday expressed hope that the State Government’s finances will become better soon while blaming the Union Government for not giving the State’s share of Goods and Services Tax or flood relief funds fully. Speaking at the 14th State-level conference of the Tamil Nadu Government Employees’ Association, the Chief Minister said the State was in debt to the tune of Rs. 5 lakh crore. “The financial situation of the State needs to be fixed. In the last 10 years, a government functioned that destroyed and ransacked the finances of the State. We have started the process of reviving Tamil Nadu from the wrongs of the previous few years,” he said. Mr. Stalin said without government employees there was no government. He further said he was making a change to the slogan ‘do or die’ to ‘do and die’, meaning he was working with a vision that he needed to complete his work fully and only then die. The DMK Government had the task of paying off the debt of Rs. 5 lakh crore, ensuring new industries and companies come to Tamil Nadu and help the economy grow. Policy announcements to that effect have been made by the Government, and it was working towards increasing job opportunities. Due to COVID-19, many micro, small and medium industries had been affected badly, and the government was fighting to pull them out of the doldrums, he said. GST refunds Mr. Stalin said GST refunds were among the funds the State had to receive from the Union Government. “The Union Government has usurped it completely. The situation now is that States are at the mercy of the Union Government. From GST to flood relief funds, we are not getting any funds. The funds which are given are not given at the right time,” the Chief Minister added. When the financial situation of the State becomes better ‘soon’, the demands of the Government employees will be met without them asking. “At that time, without you asking, holding these type of conferences and inviting me to give assurances, your demands will be met by the Government. You do not have to worry about that,” Mr. Stalin said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/centre-is-not-paying-funds-owed-to-states/article37993821.ece
20 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Asthma patients can lead a normal life’||Asthma patients can lead a normal life if they received the right diagnosis and right treatment, said doctors, who took part in an online discussion organised as part of The Hindu ’s series of Wellness Webinars on Sunday. In the discussion organised in collaboration with Naruvi Hospitals in Vellore, T.V. Rajagopal, consultant, Department of Interventional Pulmonology and Respiratory Medicine at the hospital, stressed the need for continuous consultations and interventions for asthma patients as the disease was chronic. There was a misconception that asthma should be treated only when the symptoms arose, which he pointed out was wrong. He highlighted the need for people who suffered from asthma in their childhood not to be complacent as the symptoms had waned over the years. “There is a perception that childhood asthma goes away over the years. It can reappear. It is important to consult pulmonologists periodically as the long function may drop without much symptoms,” he said. R. Vijayaravindh, consultant, interventional pulmonologist, GKNM Hospital, Coimbatore, spoke on the importance of inhalers in treating asthma patients. Inhalers are in several ways advantageous compared to tablets or injections. There need not be any fear regarding the presence of steroids in inhalers, as the amount of corticosteroids through inhalers was extremely low to cause any side effects, he said. Prince James, head of the Department of Interventional Pulmonology and Respiratory Medicine at Naruvi Hospitals, spoke on the latest advancements in treatment for asthma, which were focussing more on targeted interventions. Monoclonal antibodies and bronchial thermoplasty were increasingly being used for effective treatment of asthma. Stating that asthma can be of many types, he pointed out that that was why the one-size-fits-all approach did not often work.  There is a perception that childhood asthma goes away over the years.

20 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Tamil Nadu’s capital spending healthy so far||Tamil Nadu has spent Rs. 16,493.37 crore till October 2021 towards capital expenditure, which is about 39.1% of Rs. 42,180.96 crore, budgeted for 2021-22, according to provisional figures of Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG). Capital expenditure includes capital outlay which leads to the creation of assets such as schools, hospitals, and roads and bridges and helps in improving economic activity and creating jobs. Capital expenditure also includes repayment of loans. Analysts said while the current trend is healthy, sustaining the level of capital expenditure would be challenging going ahead. The State’s capital expenditure for the current fiscal is budgeted to be around 14% of its total expenditure. The capex spending so far is better than previous year, wherein 29% of the budgeted amount was incurred, Kavita Chacko, senior economist, CareEdge pointed out. “Spending on capital outlay is not very evenly distributed across months in a year. There are two methods to understand whether the expenditure level is adequate or not- how it compares with the same month in previous years, whether the State catches up on spending by end of year and how it compares to other States, Mr. Saket Surya, senior analyst at PRS Legislative Research said. “If we see past year trends on average, Tamil Nadu spends 29% of the budgeted capital outlay by October of that year. In comparison to this, it has fared better this year,” he pointed out. Mr. Surya said Tamil Nadu usually spends less on capital outlay than what it budgets. For instance, during 2015-20 it had spent 18% less. In comparison, Karnataka fares much better as its spending was only 3% less than the budgeted capital outlay during 2015-20. Karnataka is among the States that observe the least variance in budget estimates and actual figures, he added, and pointed out that even Karnataka had spent 39% of its budgeted capital outlay till October 2021. Going by these trends, at the moment, Tamil Nadu seems very well poised to meet its capital outlay target by March 2022, he added. Mr. Surya said the Centre had released the entire back-to-back GST compensation loan for the financial year 2021-22, which had helped in capital spending. Tamil Nadu got Rs. 8,095 crore on this account, which is about 19% of its budgeted capital outlay. According to him, sustaining the capital outlay would be challenging for Tamil Nadu due to issues like high interest payment, in case of discontinuation of GST compensation grants after June 2022 and high level of expenditure towards salaries, interest and pension and revenue deficit. Tamil Nadu is estimated to spend about 66% of its revenue receipts on payment of salaries, interest, and pension in 2021-22.

20 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Outsourcing was never a smooth affair||As Ambattur zone of the Greater Chennai Corporation struggles with conservancy work with partial outsourcing of the work to a private contractor, a recollection of the city’s history of outsourcing conservancy work showed that the exercise often faced trouble. Outsourcing started in 2000, when the then Ice House, Kodambakkam and Mylapore zones were given to CES-ONYX. After their contract was over, Neel Metal Fanalca was engaged to do conservancy work in Ice House, Kodambakkam, Adyar and Pulianthope zones. However, their contract was terminated due to poor performance. In 2012, Chennai Municipal Solid Waste Pvt. Ltd. owned by the Ramky Group, was engaged for conservancy operations in Teynampet, Kodambakkam and Adyar zones. The contract, which lasted till 2020, drew several complaints of inefficiency. In October, Urbaser Sumeet, a joint venture between Spain-headquartered Urbaser and India’s Sumeet Group, took the contract for seven zones — Teynampet, Kodambakkam, Valasaravakkam, Alandur, Adyar, Perungudi, and Sholinganallur. The contract was one of the largest ever globally for Urbaser. The Ramky Group, through a separate company, now handles the conservancy operations in Tiruvottiyur, Manali and Madhavaram zones, apart from three wards in Ambattur zone. The GCC carries out the conservancy work in the remaining areas of Ambattur zone and the four remaining zones of Tondiarpet, Royapuram, Thiru. Vi. Ka. Nagar, and Anna Nagar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/outsourcing-was-never-a-smooth-affair/article37993837.ece
20 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Measures to stop child sexual abuse needed’||Tamil Nadu BJP unit president K. Annamalai on Sunday called for initiatives to prevent sexual harassment of children. In a series of tweets, he called for the police to activate the beat system and press women officers into service in school areas and interact frequently with children and school authorities. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other social organisations should reach out to schools and start educating students about good touch and bad touch so that seniors and relatives do not exploit them. Teachers also needed to talk to students about this, Mr. Annamalai said. School authorities had the important responsibility of identifying signs of disturbance in a child’s mind, watch for abnormal behaviour and immediately alert the parents and police authorities if anything is found to be amiss. “The online teaching system has blurred the line between privacy and classroom setting. It is very sad to see some of the sexual assault cases where teachers are the primary accused. The fear of anonymity and the power factor of being a teacher needs to be curbed,” Mr. Annamalai said. ‘A societal problem’ TNCC president K. S. Alagiri said these sexual assaults were a societal problem and everyone had to pay attention to it. He said parents must teach their children about how people with wrong intentions could approach them and how they were likely to behave. “They should provide counselling to children to empower them. The government also needs to bring in stringent punishment for such cases,” Mr. Alagiri said.

The firm would build tunnels and stations in Boat Club, Nandanam, Panagal Park, Kodambakkam, Kodambakkam Flyover, Light House, Kutchery Road, Alwarpet and Bharathidasan Road. Of the Phase II project’s three corridors, construction work has been on for many weeks in a section of Corridor 3 from Poonamallee to Light House. This corridor had been designed in such a way that while half of it would be elevated, the other half will be an underground stretch. At present, a joint venture between Hindustan Construction Company and KEC International had been carrying out construction of an elevated viaduct from Poonamallee to Porur. L&T had begun this work between Porur and Power House. After Power House, the viaduct dips and runs underground till Light House. According to sources in Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL), two tenders were floated for construction of stations and tunnels between Light House and Bharathidasan Road and from Boat Club to Kodambakkam. “This firm is the lowest bidder for both contracts. The firm will be given sometime to set up site office and start work. It will have to build a tunnel for nearly 10 km here and also build nine stations. First, it will build a diaphragm wall next year and then continue with the tunnelling work,” an official said. In the other two corridors of the phase II project — Madhavaram to SIPCOT and Madhavaram to Shollinganallur — underground work had been going on from Madhavaram to Taramani though work for the entire stretch has not been allotted yet.

In a statement, he cited Electricity Minister Senthilbalaji’s statement that the monthly billing system would be implemented after strengthening infrastructure. ‘Implies many things’ Mr. Panneerselvam pointed out that strengthening infrastructure would imply many things, like planning more power projects, ensuring adequate supply of coal, procuring renewable energy and installing smart meters, among others. “The Electricity Minister has not given a definitive time frame for bringing in the infrastructure, and this casts doubt over the implementation of the poll promise of shifting to a monthly billing cycle,” he said. Mr. Panneerselvam alleged that the DMK Government was trying to escape from fulfilling promises ad that its betrayal was condemnable.

Heads of various MSME units said they would stage a silent protest in front of the Chennai Collector office. All units at the Kakkalur Industrial Estates have decided to down their shutters. Rs. 50 crore loss Its secretary, K. Baskaran, said over 250 units with more than 20,000 employees will be closed. One day’s closure here means a loss in business worth Rs. 50 crore. Businessmen from the Guindy Industrial Estate will also participate in the demonstration but firms here said they would come back and resume work as they could not afford any further losses. V.K. Girish Pandian, president of IEMA Guindy, said, “Steep rise in prices of raw materials over the past ten months has severely affected lakhs of MSMEs across the country and we are also very badly affected by this unprecedented hike. MSMEs have long-term contracts with big companies without a price hike clause. The price rise is affecting all the units and it has become difficult to sustain, especially post the pandemic,” he pointed out. Members of the Thirumudivakkam Industrial Estate Manufacturers Association and Thirumazhisai Industrial Estate will also participate in the demonstration. But there would be no impact on production at these two estates. R. Selvam, Secretary of Thirumudivakkam Industrial Estate Manufacturers Association and R.G.

20 December 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore Corporation trims fuel expenditure||Financially embattled Coimbatore Corporation that has started plugging leaks to curb expenditure has found success in streamlining the movement of vehicles used in waste collection. After fitting vehicle-tracking equipment to the auto rickshaws used in door-to-door collection, the Corporation started getting the actual readings of the distance the vehicles moved and stopped relying on drivers for the information. This has resulted in savings for the Corporation, says Commissoner Raja Gopal Sunkara, who cites the August-September data to underscore his point. In August, the difference in data obtained from the equipment and what the drivers reported was 3,376 km in Central Zone, taken as a test case. After close monitoring in September, the difference in data from the equipment and what the drivers reported narrowed down to 66 km. In other words, the Corporation had in August spent on fuel for 3,376 km – distance that the vehicles did not cover. In September, with the difference in the reported distance and that of the equipment reading narrowing down to 66 km, the Corporation’s loss was minimised, Mr. Sunkara says. What the Corporation did to plug the leak was deploy two contractors to fix the equipment and monitor vehicle movement on a real-time basis. This prevented the drivers from tampering with the odometer in the vehicles to inflate the distance travelled and taking vehicles for work other than waste collection. A zonal sanitary officer says the issue before the Corporation fitted the vehicle-tracking equipment was that either the local sanitary officers or drivers misused the vehicles to transport waste from commercial establishments for personal gain. This meant diversion of vehicles from door-to-door waste collection. With the Corporation fitting the equipment, this has stopped, he explains. The consequence of this strict monitoring is that door-to-door waste collection has improved, particularly the organic waste collection, from 90 tonne to 175 tonne a day. Mr. Sunkara says the next step in further plugging the leak in fuel expenditure is fitting the equipment on lorries used in waste transportation. The Corporation has at present used it only in 200 auto rickshaws. It will also fix route charts for each of the 200 vehicles. If drivers of the vehicles deviate from the given route chart, the software attached to the vehicle tracking system will alert senior Corporation officers who will the check on the deviation, on a real-time basis. This stops the misuse of the vehicles and saves fuel and expenditure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-corporation-trims-fuel-expenditure/article37993865.ece
20 December 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||A unique duty for foresters||Forest Department workers attached to the Manambolly forest range of the Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) have been doing a unique duty for the last three days. They take turns to ‘babysit’ three leopard cat ( Prionailurus bengalensis ) cubs that have taken shelter, along with their mother, in a gap in a firewood stack close to a tea factory at Thonimudi near Valparai. It all began on the night of December 16 when people noticed three feline cubs a few metres away from the firewood stack. They telephoned the Manambolly forest range staff, who rushed to the spot around 9.30 p.m. “The public initially thought they were leopard cubs. But on a close examination, we found out that they were leopard cat cubs,” Manamobolly ranger A. Manikandan said. Mr. Manikandan immediately alerted ATR Deputy Director (Pollachi Division) M.G. Ganesan, who told the staff that the cat species was of greater importance in terms of conservation as it is listed on Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and on the Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. “Cat families have this habit of shifting their place when noticed by humans, especially when they are with cubs. Hence, we decided to guard the place until the mother relocates the cub to another place,” said ATR Field Director S. Ramasubramanian, who tasked a team with guarding the mother and the cubs. The team ensures there is no movement of people or vehicles in the area. Lights are switched off at night. Though the cubs came out of the firewood stack a few times, the mother took them back. “Leopard cat is a nocturnal animal which preys mostly on small animals like rodents that are active at night. It also hunts birds perched on bushes...,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-unique-duty-for-foresters/article37993828.ece

Five cars carrying the processional-cum-presiding deity, Lord Nataraja, and his consort Sivagamasundari, Lord Vinayaka, Lord Subramaniam and Chandigeswar rolled out from the temple premises at around 7.00 a.m. The devotees pulled the cars, covering the four car streets in the temple town.

20 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TAMIL NADU||Withdraw GST hike on textiles: Telangana govt.||Telangana government has urged the Centre to drop its plan to hike the GST on textiles and handlooms from 5 to 12% from January 1 because the sector is going through a tough phase due to the impact of pandemic. In a letter to Union Textiles Minister Piyush Goyal, Industries Minister K.T. Rama Rao observed that taxes were never levied on handlooms in the country’s history. The Centre’s move to impose 5% tax initially was strongly opposed by textiles and handlooms sector across the country. The latest decision to impose additional 7% cent GST on the handlooms would leave the sector crippled, he said. Telangana produces world class handlooms and weavers are worried lot due to the Centre’s decision, he observed. The Minister also said almost 80% of units in the sector were in micro, small and medium enterprises segment. Fixing the rate at 12% for fabrics and garments would hit the powerloom and handloom weavers. It will have a cascading effect on common public due to higher prices, he said. India has the advantage of millions of skilled people working in eco-friendly processes, natural fibres and handmade garments. By hiking GST, the country will be driving them out of employment when it should actually be investing in them and target international market. Mr. Rao said the new generation is not attracted to handlooms sector anymore because of low profitability and critical conditions. The families dependent on handlooms had shrunk from 43.3 lakh in 2011 to 30.44 lakh presently. Nearly 25% of families left the industry and if the trend continues, the handloom sector could become extinct in a few years, he warned. The latest figures show that 70% of handloom weavers are SC, ST, BC and OBCs. Almost 72% of them are women and 77% did not go beyond school education. Therefore, they are not expected to be aware of tax issues and critical conditions of the industry. The income of 67% of families is less than Rs. 5,000 and 26% of families earn less than Rs. 10,000. On the whole, as much as 93% of families earn less than Rs. 10,000. Therefore, it is not wise to hike taxes on products produced by them, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/withdraw-gst-hike-on-textiles-telangana-govt/article37993569.ece

20 December 2021||KUMBAKONAM,TAMIL NADU||Ray of hope for the ruined Chola temple||There is a ray of hope for the 12th century Apatsahayeswarar temple at Tukkachchi near Kumbakonam, which has been standing derelict for over a century. The Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, which has studied the temple, is preparing a detailed project report for conservation. “We are preparing a detailed project report, and we will be able to submit it to the Department of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments by December-end. The intention is that if we submit it now, the Department can deliberate on it, and in the new financial year, it can start work on the site,” said Arun Menon, Associate Professor, Structural Engineering Group, Department of Civil Engineering, IIT. According to late historian S.R. Balasubrahmanyam, the temple was closely associated with Kulotunga I and Vikrama Chola. Expressing concern over “the magnificent but much-neglected temple”, he had noted that the “temple is of greater significance in the evolution of Chola art and architecture during the later Chola period”. “Apart from that, its importance lies in the fact that it is perhaps the only big temple built during the days of Vikrama Chola,” he had observed in the book Later Chola Temples . Historian Kudavasal Balasubramanian, the author of a monograph on the temple, pointed out that inscriptions referred to it as Thenthirukalathi or Vikramacholeeswaram. “The history of Tukkachchi is the history of Vikrama Chola as he renovated the old Thenkallathi temple and named it Vikramacholeeswaram,” he explained. Vikrama Chola’s father Kulotunga had made contributions to the temple for the singing of ‘Thevaram’. Today, a visitor to this temple, whose architecture closely resembles that of the Darasuram temple, would realise that the neglect would have started at least a hundred years ago. It looks as if it had been subjected to an attack by invaders and left to decay. Covered with moss Time had taken its toll on its structures. The roof had collapsed at many places, leaving one to wonder whether it could be saved at all. The main gopuram and the gopuram in the second prahara and the vimana of the temples are covered with moss and vegetation and have lost their shape. “That was what prompted us to work on the temple in 2018-19. We were terribly upset, seeing the status of the temple. IIT-Madras gave a proposal for a pilot conservation project of the temple just before the pandemic, February 2020,” Mr. Menon said. Subsequently, it signed a memorandum of understanding with the HR&CE Department for preparation of the conservation proposal, factoring in all aspects: archaeological, structural, Ahamic, inscriptions and mural paintings. But there was a delay because of the pandemic. “In the last one-and-a-half years, we have conducted all field documentation... We have also done our surveys, and are also satisfied with the inputs we have received. We have very interesting drone pictures of the entire site and have extensively documented the temple,” Mr. Menon said. Asked whether there was a need for total reconstruction, he said certain parts of the temple would require dismantling and reconstruction. “The mahamandapam of the Durga temple requires dismantling, but the sanctum sanctorum is in good condition. Some portion of the prahara wall needs reconstruction. Otherwise in-situ conservation is proposed...,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ray-of-hope-for-the-ruined-chola-temple/article37993847.ece
20 December 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Road relaying work under way in many places across Madurai||In a much-needed relief to vehicle users and residents of Madurai city, bad roads and pothole-ridden stretches in some wards in zones 1 and 2 would be relaid and the State government had earmarked Rs. 23.68 crore for the purpose, said Finance Minister P.T.R. Palanivel Thiaga Rajan said here on Sunday. According to Corporation Commissioner K.P. Karthikeyan, it has been decided to lay new metalled and paver block roads in locations where drinking water connection works and underground drainage project had been completed. Ellis Nagar, Arapalayam, Tamil Sangam Road, Sundararajapuram, Perumal Teppakulam, Krishnarayar Teppakulam, Tamil Sangam Road, Chokkanathar Temple, North Krishnan Temple, Subramaniapuram and Kajimar Street had been identified for laying new roads. The work, which started two days ago, would be completed in about two months, he added. The Corporation had received Rs. 23.68 crore through Capital Grant Fund and TN Urban Road Infrastructure Project Fund. With this, 148 stretches in the two zones would be completed in 60 days. The officials said that as per the tender conditions, the roads shall be laid as per the norms. Added wards In the added wards of Madurai Corporation, which included some parts of Anaiyur and Sambakulam, and other roads in Madurai East Assembly Constituency shall be taken up for road laying, said Commercial Taxes and Registration Minister P. Moorthy. The northeast monsoon had battered many roads in the added wards where the engineers had very recently completed the UGD works. Many roads in P and T Nagar and other locations were not motorable leading to accidents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/road-relaying-work-under-way-in-many-places-across-madurai/article37994130.ece
20 December 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Micro-financing firms harass hapless women, says AIDWA||Micro-financing companies have been harassing women who were unable to repay loans due to lack of income during COVID-19 lockdown, according to a survey conducted by All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA). Talking to reporters here on Sunday, its State secreta/ry S.K. Ponnuthai said the survey was conducted among 1,387 women in 30 districts two months back. Among those surveyed, 192 women were from Madurai city and 51 women from rural areas. They revealed that they had to borrow from the micro-financing companies, government banks and moneylenders even to pay house rent and meet health, marriage, funeral and educational expenses and repay interest for the already obtained loans. “In some cases, the women had pledged their land documents, ration and Aadhaar cards and jewellery in the absence of regular income,” she said. When they were unable to repay loans with interest that ranged from 5% to 27%, the representatives of micro-financing companies abused them. “Some of the women even attempted to end their lives,” Ms. Ponnuthai said. The thugs used to visit their houses as early as 6 a.m. and even at 11 p.m. They used to wait for long hours in front of their houses to put pressure on the women to repay the loan instalments. The survey revealed that the women had borrowed more money after the COVID-19 pandemic. Moratorium The Madras High Court had ordered that micro-financing companies should not use force while collecting loan dues during the lockdown and consequently the Reserve Bank of India announced a six-month moratorium for the borrowers to repay loans. However, the behaviour of the representatives of micro-financing companies never changed. “They targeted single women, widows and families led by women,” she said. The association appealed to the State government to put an end to such illegal tactics of the micro-financing companies and to make efforts to waive interest for loans taken during the lockdown. Additional time should be given for loan repayment. The State government should provide financial assistance to women to start business and the loans of single women should be waived. Special officers should be appointed in every district to monitor the micro-financing companies and action taken against those using pressure tactics. The Centre should allocate additional funds under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme to ensure jobs for more people and the scheme should be extended to urban areas. The State government should provide Rs. 7,500 monthly COVID-19 assistance for at least six months, she said. Association district secretaries R. Sasikala and C. Muthurani were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/micro-financing-firms-harass-hapless-women-says-aidwa/article37994136.ece

20 December 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry sees rapid rise in stray dog population||Lack of proper rehabilitation and a systematic approach to carrying out the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Programme have led to a rapid growth in the stray dog population across commercial and residential areas. Though in several areas, especially residential, the dogs live in harmony with the community, there are several incidents of stray dogs chasing cyclists and two-wheeler riders, leading to accidents and dog bite cases. “It is a nightmare coming home during the night on a two-wheeler. It is not just one or two dogs chasing the rider. Three days ago, I was chased by a pack of strays near the Saram market. Only when the dogs started chasing a two-wheeler rider coming in the opposite direction could I escape,” said a government employee residing at Reddiyarpalayam. According to a government veterinarian, not all urban free-ranging (as described in scientific literature) dogs are ferocious and attack human beings. “There could be cases of dogs in packs pouncing on people. But there are several cases of stray dogs living in peace with people. In fact, they are guardians as they don’t allow strangers to come, especially during the night. But it is better to control the stray dog population as they are poorly cared for, and in certain cases, are carriers of pathogens. They suffer deep wounds and go untreated. It is cruelty to the animal. So, it is better to bring down their population through the Animal Birth Control Programme and proper rehabilitation,” he added. State Surveillance Officer, Health Department, Ravivarman, told The Hindu that the healthcare sector received dog bite cases, including from pet dogs, every day. In 2020, hospitals in the Union Territory treated 25,797 people for dog bites. Of the total treated, 19,667 are for mouthing by dogs, 1,718 for minor injuries and 3,543 for deep wounds. All of them were given anti-rabies vaccine (ARV). In cases of deep wounds and if the bitten dogs are dead, rabies immunoglobulin is also given in addition to the anti-rabies shot. Last year, the Health Department procured 53,000 vials of ARV and 780 vials of immunoglobulin. “We can’t say all bites are due to stray dogs. Only about half of them will be due to strays, and mostly, the victims will be children,” Mr. Ravivarman told The Hindu . Pet dogs, according to the government veterinarian, are mostly vaccinated against rabies, which is not the case with urban free-ranging dogs. A dog census survey conducted a few years ago revealed that there were around 3,254 stray males, 2,402 females and 331 puppies in the Puducherry Municipality. In Oulgaret, there were 3,902 males, 3,016 females and 965 puppies, he said. According to the veterinarian, a comprehensive programme involving the local administration, animal husbandry and health departments, pet owners and animal welfare organisations has to be evolved. “It is a misnomer to say that population of dogs on the streets increases because of stray dogs only. Even pet dogs or puppies of domestic dogs are abandoned for various reasons. We have to implement mandatory licensing, microchipping and annual registration of pet dogs. We should also increase the annual renewal fee for non-sterilised dogs from Rs. 100 to Rs. 1,000,” he said. Along with the measures on the domestic dog front, the civic body should regularly carry out ABC programmes involving non-governmental organisations (NGOs). “Involving animal rights activist is very important in ABC and other programmes. They should set a target of sterilising 70% of the stray dog population in two years. Carrying out ABC programmes in intervals, and in small numbers, will not serve the purpose. Importance should be given for the proper rehabilitation of the sterilised dogs,” he said. Veterinary Medical Officer, Puducherry Municipality, Thulasiraman, said a comprehensive ABC programme involving the Worldwide Veterinary Service, Udhagamandalam, Rajiv Gandhi Veterinary Hospital and NGOs was being evolved. The municipality has already identified 12 places in Puducherry for conducting the ABC programme. Even trained dog-catchers from Chengalpattu have been identified, he added. “We want to do the ABC programme in a more systematic manner so that better results can be achieved. The local administration has given a clear instruction on carrying out the programme in a more scientific manner, including getting trained dog-catchers so that the canines do not get hurt,” Mr. Thulasiraman said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/puducherry-sees-rapid-rise-in-stray-dog-population/article37994221.ece

20 December 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||NFIW urges Governor to forward Bill on medical admission to President||The National Federation of Indian Women, Tamil Nadu, has urged Governor R.N. Ravi to forward the Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill to the President for the latter’s consent. A resolution to this effect was passed at its State Committee meeting, chaired by State president and former MLA Padmavathi held here on Saturday. In the resolution, the Federation claimed that by introducing NEET in 2013, the Centre had usurped the State’s right over education, which was in the concurrent list. Stating that the dream to pursue medical education among rural students had been shattered by NEET, the resolution said several students ended their lives and the seats of students of the State in medical education had been lost. Alleging that continuance of NEET would affect the State Health Infrastructure and put poor women depending on government health services in a disadvantageous position, NFIW urged the Governor to forward the Bill against NEET passed in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly in September to the President for his consent. It also exhorted the President to give his consent to the TNAUMDC Bill. Another resolution pleading the DMK Government to pass a resolution in support of 33% reservation for women and exert pressure on the Centre to pass the Women’s Reservation Bill immediately was also passed. In another resolution, NFIW wanted the State government to utilise the Rs. 190.68 crore fund released by the Centre from NIRBAYA Fund fully and effectively to ensure the safety of women in Tamil Nadu. It also exhorted the State government to initiate steps to create awareness among the people of the Protection of Women From Domestic Violence Act, 2005. Opposing the Central Cabinet’s nod to raise the legal age of marriage for girls to 21 from 18 recently, NFIW chided the reason given by the Cente government for bringing in the amendment. Instead of raising the legal age of marriage, it should concentrate on implementing schemes to protect the health of women and ensure education and employment for them, it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nfiw-urges-governor-to-forward-bill-on-medical-admission-to-president/article37993916.ece

20 December 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Mohiniyattam is yet to get the attention it deserves, says dancer Rekha Raju||For Rekha Raju, dancer and member of the expert committee panel for Mohiniyattam at the Ministry of Culture, Government of India, the two-year gap due to COVID-19 lockdown was an opportunity to learn many nuances of the dance form. “While the entire world was confined to their homes, I spent time with my guru Kalamandalam Sugandhi to hone my craft and also pass it down to my students through online classes. The break was much-needed, as it allowed me to pause and take feedback, something I had been longing to do but did not have time for,” said Ms. Sugandhi. She was in the city to perform at the Margazhi Mangala Utsavam on Sunday. Speaking to The Hindu prior to her performance, she urged connoisseurs to witness such programmes in person. “We have become accustomed to live-streaming online, but the audience is an appetiser for an artiste. Looking into a screen and performing before the audience is not the same.” By attending concerts and performances, the audience would be supporting artistes and organisers, she added. Ms. Raju said that while Bharathanatyam was the focus of cultural performances in Tamil Nadu, Mohiniyattam, too, deserved attention. “We work hard to customise performances according to the audience and the location. The songs and story are well-researched." She added that she worked towards promoting the art form and teaching it to her students. Sai Vignesh, a young vocalist from Chennai, also performed at the event on Sunday. Performing in Tiruchi for three years in a row, Mr. Vignesh said the audience in the city was diverse and open to new ideas. Events such as the Margazhi Mangala Utsavam must be organised in Tiruchi, a cultural hub.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mohiniyattam-is-yet-to-get-the-attention-it-deserves-says-dancer-rekha-raju/article37993922.ece
20 December 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||TNCC chief urges State government to rescue farmers from debt crisis||Stating that farmers of the State were in distress due to mounting debt burden, TNCC president K.S. Alagiri on Sunday urged the State government to provide Rs. 1,000 to each farmer family per month to mitigate their financial crisis. Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Alagiri said the farming community faced multiple challenges as they could not get remunerative price for their produce. ”The wrong policies of the AIADMK government during its 10-year rule ruined the farmers. It did nothing to rescue them from the debt burden.” Citing a recent study of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), which revealed that the debt crisis faced by farmers in Tamil Nadu was much higher than their counterparts in other States, Mr. Alagiri called upon the DMK government to rescue them by providing monthly relief. He took strong exception to BJP’s demand to disband the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR&CE) department, which, he said, upheld equal rights for all in temples. It was only after the temples in the State were brought under the department that all people irrespective of their caste could visit the them without discrimination. The BJP was attempting to tamper with the well-established system and it was condemnable, he contended. On the BJP government’s move to raise the legal age of marriage of girls to 21 from 18, the TNCC president said it would help women in terms of their overall well-being. But, most parents in the country preferred their daughters to get married as early as possible. Hence, instead of enacting the Act, the Centre could launch a nationwide campaign to create awareness of the ill-effects of early marriage. On the AIADMK’s charges that the DMK had failed to implement most of the promises made in its manifesto, Mr. Alagiri said the AIADMK was playing politics to be in the limelight. If the party wanted to protest, it should be against the BJP government at the Centre that miserably failed in all aspects of governance. It was because of aligning with the BJP that the AIADMK suffered defeat in the Assembly election, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tncc-chief-urges-state-government-to-rescue-farmers-from-debt-crisis/article37993928.ece
20 December 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||BDU staff exhort Governor to secure government funds||Bharathidasan University Staff Welfare Association (BUSWA) has urged the Governor and Chancellor to secure from the State government Rs. 18.36 crore spent on establishment of permanent buildings and other infrastructural facilities in eight constituent colleges. Bharathidasan University has borne the brunt of financial pressure after being allotted 10 out of the 41 constituent colleges. The university has to spend Rs. 1.5 crore every month from its own funds to meet the running expenditure including salary for teaching and non-teaching staff in the constituent colleges and other administrative expenses. Further, 12 affiliated colleges from the newly formed Mayiladuthurai district after bifurcation from Nagapattinam have been brought under the jurisdiction of Annamalai University from 2020-21. This has further caused deficit in revenue, adding to the financial burdern of Bharathidasan University, K. Panneerselvam, Secretary of BUSWA, said in a letter to the Governor. The financial burden of the university has been mounting due to these reasons, and the institution has been relegated to a “very weak” financial position. The deficit budget is making it difficult for the university to meet salary expenes of teaching and administrative staff, contractors and daily-wagers. The day-to-day administration of the university has been affected, Mr. Panneerselvam said. The university used to be financially stable in yester decades when it had affiliated institutions in various faculties inclujding Arts and Science, Engineering, Medicine, Teacher Education, Physical Education, Fine Arts and Music. The financial inflow to the university started declining steadily after the State government formed separate universities for the different faculties, Mr. Panneerselvam said. The letter also brought to the notice of the Governor the utilisation of university fund to the tune of Rs. 54 crore during 1988 for establishing Bharathidasan Institute of Technology, which was subsequently converted into Anna University-Tiruchi Campus. The BIT was handed over with new infrastructural facilities including administrative building, classrooms, laboratories, workshops, seminar halls and hostels for students. Reimbursement Though the State government promised to reimburse the amount that BDU has invested, it has not received any till now despite repeated requests to the Higher Education Department, the letter said.  The university has to spend Rs. 1.5 crore every month from its own funds to meet the running expenditure K.

It was losing weight since it reached the camp. It suffered from diarrhoea often. It was under the close surveillance of the forest veterinarians since it joined other elephants of the forest department in the camp. Acting on expert inputs, the elephant was shifted to ERRC, where the temperature was moderate. G. Kiran, District Forest Officer, Tiruchi, told The Hindu that Rohini had started mingling with other elephants kept for rehabilitation at the ERRC. As per the initial study of the animal behaviour, it had adjusted well to the new environment. The social interaction of the elephant was also good. “We closely monitor the health of Rohini.

Rajenthra Bhalaji in a cheating case. The police are trying to track Mr. Bhalaji, who is the AIADMK district secretary, with his mobile phone signal and those of his close associates. A police officer said the delay in getting the go-ahead for arresting Mr. Bhalaji, after the Madras High Court dismissed his anticipatory bail petition, gave him ample time to give the police the slip. Mr. Bhalaji, who had held the portfolio of Milk and Dairy Development, has been accused of having collected huge sums from several persons promising them jobs at Aavin. In a specific case, S. Ravindran, a Sattur resident, alleged that he had given Rs. 30 lakh to Mr. Bhalaji through the then AIADMK functionary, Vijayan Nallathambi, and a party worker, Mariappan, for placing his relative at Aavin between November 2020 and February 2021. Mr. Nallathambi filed a complaint, claiming that he had given around Rs. 1.60 crore to Mr. Bhalaji through his assistants, Baburaj, Balaraman and Muthupandi, for getting jobs for different persons. As the news of the dismissal of his anticipatory bail application reached him, Mr. Bhalaji, who was addressing a protest meeting at Virudhunagar on Friday, suddenly left the venue. “He changed three cars and took rural roads,” a police officer said. He made good of the opportunity and travelled some crucial distance without watched by the police. By the time the police launched the search, he had gone far away. However, police ruled out the possibility of Mr. Bhalaji having flown abroad. “He is so familiar that he cannot get into any airport without being noticed,” the officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/six-teams-on-the-lookout-for-former-minister/article37993823.ece

So sheep and goat penning is resorted to here. But a disease is spreading in these areas affecting both goats and sheep, resulting in mass deaths.

After the rains and flooding in Tirunelveli, many bridges have given way. There are potholes on every road and water is stagnating along with drainage water.

The bridge work on Thoothukudi-Tirunelveli highway near Pudukottai has been pending for so many years. The underpass there is full of potholes and dirty. It is very difficult to negotiate at night.

20 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||No end in sight to impasse at Chigarenahalli||With the impasse at Chigarenahalli garbage processing plant refusing to let up and at least three other processing plants currently non-functional, the civic body is staring at a garbage crisis yet again. Since November 20, local communities at Chigarenahalli have barred trucks from dumping waste at the plant citing pollution of water sources and several violations. The Bagalur quarry pit, a new one, which is ready may be put to use any day now, but that may not be enough. Though the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is confident of resolving the problem at Chigarenahalli, the protesters are adamant that they won’t let a single truck into the quarry. “We are tired of the empty promises the Government keeps making. BBMP claims they have spent Rs. 200 crore on development works in our villages as compensation. But we don’t see that. We are also demanding that the Anti Corruption Bureau take up a probe into this,” said Siddalingappa, president, Bhaktarahalli Gram Panchayat. The matter was recently discussed at the ongoing winter session of the Karnataka Assembly in Belagavi where Law Minister J.C. Madhuswamy promised a meeting with Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who also holds charge of the city. BBMP officials have decided not to dump waste at Chigarenahalli till the meeting. While Mr. Madhuswamy refused to commit that they would stop dumping waste, Congress MLA Krishna Byre Gowda suggested that the civic body dump it in an empty quarry pit instead. “It’s not that dumping in a quarry pit is acceptable, but that is at least better than this,” he said. The Bagalur quarry pit now readied, is in his constituency. Before the protests, the Chigarenahalli plant was taking 500 tonnes per day (TPD) of waste from Bengaluru. Since November 20, the city’s detritus has been diverted to the quarry at Mittaganahall. The quarry, which is now receiving around 3,000 TPD of waste, is also filling up fast. What has compounded the problem is that at least three plants - Subbarayanapalya, Seegehalli and Lingadheeranahalli - have not been functioning for nearly two years due to local protests and legal tangles in the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Most of the other plants - Chikkanagamangala, Doddabidarakallu, KCDC and Kannahalli - are also not functioning to their full capacity. As a result, segregation of waste, which has been stagnating at around 40% for years, is also not being leveraged for processing. While the BBMP collects over 1,200 TPD of segregated wet waste, only around 700 TPD is processed at the plants at present. The remaining 500 TPD is being dumped at landfills. “We are trying to revive all the plants that have recently been stopped. We are trying our best to not start a new quarry. But the quarry at Bagalur is ready to go and we can start dumping waste in a day’s time,” said Sarfaraz Khan, Joint Commissioner, Solid Waste Management, BBMP. It may not be smooth sailing, as local communities around the non-functional plants are also opposed to the BBMP restarting them. If the civic body fails to resolve the impasse over Chigarenahalli and the three waste processing plants, starting dumping waste at a new quarry will soon be inevitable.  (This is the first of a two-part series on solid waste management problems that the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike is facing)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-end-in-sight-to-impasse-at-chigarenahalli/article37993795.ece
20 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BMRCL takes up pothole repair on ORR stretch||Several stretches of the Outer Ring Road (ORR) that were in shoddy shape owing to potholes and craters are now getting fixed by Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL). The agency is implementing Phase 2A of Namma Metro project between Central Silk Board to K.R. Puram and will repair roads on the main carriage way ORR where metro work is in progress. Motorists have been demanding that authorities maintain the 17-km stretch after the condition of the road deteriorated owing to the heavy rains in November. BMRCL Managing Director Anjum Parwez said, “We are in discussion with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on fixing responsibility over who should take what repair work on the ORR stretch. In the coming days, we will sign an MoU with the BBMP. However, several stretches were in bad condition, we have taken up maintenance work for the benefit of motorists.” A source in the BBMP said that BMRCL has been asked to maintain the main corridor of the ORR till the project is completed, while BBMP will maintain service roads and footpaths. Due to the ongoing metro work, motorists have started using the bus priority lane to avoid traffic snarls. Deputy Commissioner of Police (East Traffic) K.M. Shantharaju said, “Due to metro work, motorists are allowed to use the priority lane between Central Silk Board and Iblur junction. But they are not allowed to use it from Iblur junction to the Lowry school. Transport vehicles with more than 10 seats ferrying employees have been exempted from the bus priority lane along the entire stretch”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bmrcl-takes-up-pothole-repair-on-orr-stretch/article37993798.ece
20 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Sudden rise in AEFI recorded in State since December 15||Karnataka recorded a sudden rise in the number of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) since December 15. According to data from the CoWIN portal, while 101 adverse events were reported on December 15, 82 were reported on December 16, 99 on December 17, and 78 on December 18. The number has consistently been in the range of 20-30 before that. Of the total 564 adverse events reported in December, 360 have been reported in four days since December 15. While State health officials attributed this to data entry errors on the portal, sources said this could be late audit and verification of the adverse events, mainly because of lack of evidence to establish the adverse events from the districts. According to data from the Health Department, the State has recorded a total of 3,066 minor, 54 severe, and 105 serious AEFI since January 16, when COVID-19 vaccination was rolled out till December 18. The 105 serious AEFI include 54 deaths following COVID-19 immunisation. However, officials said there is not enough evidence to establish that the deaths were due to vaccination. The highest number of adverse events have been reported from Dakshina Kannada and BBMP limits. While Dakshina Kannada has reported a total of 1,239 AEFI, BBMP has seen 566 adverse events. Of the 105 serious adverse events, 33 have been reported from BBMP. Arundathi Chandrashekar, State Mission Director, National Health Mission (NHM), told The Hindu on Sunday that the sudden rise was due to data entry errors, especially in BBMP limits. “The data entry operators have clicked on AEFI while generating old certificates (to collate data of those who are due for second dose) on the CoWIN portal in this one zone. We will have to write to the Government of India for correction once we collate the correct details,” she said, emphasising that most of the adverse events were mild fever, headache and anxiety. Mallesh K., chairperson of the State AEFI committee, said although the committee discusses all adverse events reported, the final conclusion to establish the cause of deaths can be done only after the districts submit detailed information about each case. Stating that the committee has met seven times in the last one year with the last meeting on December 3, Dr. Mallesh said more than 60 AEFI (pertaining to both COVID-19 vaccination and routine immunisation) were discussed during the recent meeting. “Sometimes in the absence of detailed information, we only discuss the adverse events but do not give reports on the cause till all information and investigation evidence is obtained. The spike on a particular day could be due to technical glitches,” said the doctor, who heads the Department of Paediatrics at Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI). Although 54 deaths following immunisation have been recorded, only 13 post-mortems have been done till last month. “This is mainly because families do not agree for post-mortems. We have been insisting on post-mortems of all deaths but have noticed that families, especially in rural areas, are reluctant,” he said. “Unless a post-mortem is done, it is difficult to establish the cause of death, especially if the deceased has comorbidities. In case officials are unable to convince the families for the post- mortems, we get the verbal autopsies done and mention our limitations in the reports that we send to the National AEFI committee,” added Dr. Mallesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sudden-rise-in-aefi-recorded-in-state-since-december-15/article37993791.ece

20 December 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Prohibitory orders in Belagavi extended till Wednesday||Belagavi city, which was tense after incidents of defacing the statue of Sangolli Rayanna and pelting stones at government vehicles in the wee hours of Saturday, remained calm on Sunday but for an attempt at protest despite prohibitory orders. As a precautionary measure, the police, who had imposed prohibitory orders in Belagavi till Monday morning, have extended it till 6 a.m. on Wednesday. A total of 110 persons have been booked so far in three cases. The police are on the look out for some more people involved in acts of vandalism in the city on Saturday. Security has been beefed up and additional forces deployed at strategic locations in the city as the ongoing Legislature session will resume on Monday after the weekend break. The incidents of Belagavi are expected to resonate in the session. On Sunday, when Karnataka Rakshana Vedike (T.A. Narayana Gowda faction) activists tried to take out a protest march to Angol, the place where the statue of Sangolli Rayanna (a 19th Century icon who fought the British) was vandalised, the police took them into preventive custody. KRV activists had begun a demonstration at Sangolli Rayanna Circle at Peeranwadi in Belagavi and wanted to proceed to Angol demanding action against the members of Maharashtra Ekikarana Samiti (MES), accused of indulging in defacement and attacks, and a ban on the organisation. As prohibitory orders are in force, the police did not allow them to continue their protest. When the situation threatened to go out of control, they took several activists into custody and dispersed the crowd. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and Home Minister Araga Jnanendra appealed to the people to maintain calm, disapproving of incidents of desecrating of statues of national heroes. Speaking to presspersons in Hubballi and his constituency Shiggaon, Mr. Bommai clarified that no one would be spared. He said arrests had been made in both in connection with the incidents at Belagavi and Bengaluru (where the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji was defaced) and a thorough investigation would be conducted. He said both Shivaji and Rayanna fought for the unity and freedom of the country and any attempt to divide the country using their names should be strongly condemned. The Chief Minister categorically stated that the government would not tolerate any act of violence, vandalism and any attempt to incite people in the name of language and disturb peace and harmony.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/prohibitory-orders-in-belagavi-extended-till-wednesday/article37993806.ece

Speaking to presspersons after performing go puja at Siddaroodh Mutt in Hubballi on Sunday, the Minister said that Pashu Sanjivini ambulance will be made avialable in each taluk. “Once a call is made to the helpline, veterinary health staff will rush to the place concered in an ambulance with scanning equipment, among others, and will provide treatment to livestock. At present, tendering process is on and in two-three months, it will be implemented,” he said. 40,000 calls The Minister said that after the promulgation of Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Act, around 40,000 calls on illegal cattle transportation have been received and based on tip-off, scores of cattle have been rescued. Over 500 cases have been registered so far, he said. On opposition to the Act, he said that some have approached court through public interest litigation petitions which have hindered the implementation of the Act. “However, we are hopeful that court will decide in our favour,” he said. Taking a dig at opposition parties seeking withdrawal of the Act, he said that these political parties have little regard for Gomata and are least concerned about protecting cow progeny.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pashu-sanjivini-launch-soon-prabhu-chavan/article37993966.ece

Speaking after unveiling the statue of Kittur Rani Chennamma at Sante Maidan in Shiggaon in Haveri district on Sunday, the CM said that there was nothing bigger than the love and affection of the people and he would work towards retaining the same. Mr. Bommai said that Kittur queen Chennamma never fought for expansion of her kingdom but fought for her people. “Every citizen fought like a soldier against the British and their fight should motivate all of us. We all need to work unitedly for ensuring overall development of the region,” he said. He said that Shiggaon and Savanur were well known for saints and visionaries. “The roots of their vision and views are all pervasive in the region. We need to follow their ideals and work towards common cause. In the coming days, statues of B.R. Ambedkar and Sangolli Rayanna would be unveiled,” he said.

20 December 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Burning of Kannada flag, defacing Rayanna statue condemned||Taking serious exception to the burning of the Kannada flag allegedly by MES activists in Kolhapur and the desecration of statue of Sangolli Rayanna in Belagavi, a resolution was passed seeking action against the accused during the 120th general body meeting of Karnatak Vidyavardhak Sangha in Dharwad on Sunday. In the first general body meeting after the recent election, it was resolved to meet Chief Minister Basvaaraj Bommai in Belagavi during the ongoing winter session to seek action against mischief mongers. The meeting had a noisy start, with some members making allegations of election malpractice and seeking detailed inquiry into process. They alleged that a committee should be formed to inquire into the issue and alleged that the number of votes counted had exceeded the number of votes polled. The senior members of the sangha had a tough time pacifying the agitated members. Subsequently some members wanted to stop conducting ‘Horanadu Kannadigara Samavesh’ (convention of Kannadigas staying outside the State) as it did not yield any good result and consumed lot of resources. They argued that lakhs were being spent on conducting the convention and instead it should be used for development government schools in border areas. Responding to their demand, member of the Executive Committee Basavaprabhu Hosakeri said that the new body was not hell bent on organising the convention. He explained that it was a dream project of former president Nadoja Patil Puttappa, who wanted to reach out to the Kanandigas residing outside the State. He assured the members that the new committee would soon deliberate on the matter and take a suitable decision. The meeting subsequently discussed reducing membership fee, increasing ‘mantaps’ (sections) from existing 9 to 12 so as to organise more fruitful events and deliberations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/burning-of-kannada-flag-defacing-rayanna-statue-condemned/article37993977.ece
20 December 2021||Hubballi,KARNATAKA||CM’s ‘posts not permanent’ remark raises eyebrows||Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai’s emotional speech in his constituency Shiggaon on Sunday night, in which he talked at length about the ephemeral nature of posts and titles, has raised eyebrows in political circles. Speaking at a public function in Haveri district on Sunday, Mr. Bommai teared up at one point as he said: “I may be Home Minister or Chief Minister outside this constituency. But for you, the people of my constituency, I will always remain Basavaraj. These posts are not permanent.” The tone and tenor of his speech is being interpreted in some circles as a hint of possible change of leadership yet again in the State. What accentuated it was a statement earlier by Industries Minister Murugesh Nirani who said that Mr. Bommai is “likely to become a Central Minister like his father the late S.R. Bommai.” However, after Basava Jaya Mrutyunjaya Swami, seer of Panchamasali Peetha, objected to the statement and said they wanted Mr. Bommai to be Chief Minister till 2023, Mr. Nirani hastily intervened to clarify that he was not referring to his present term.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cms-posts-not-permanent-remark-raises-eyebrows/article37993807.ece
20 December 2021||HYDERABAD,KARNATAKA||Sharmila blames KCR for farmer suicides||YSRTP president Y.S. Sharmila alleged that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is responsible for suicides by scores of farmers across the State. Beginning her Rythu Aavedana Yatra from Kanchanpally village in Kowdipally mandal of Medak district on Sunday by consoling the families of Mahesh, Gundla Srikanth and Bondla Shekulu at Lingampally, she said that these suicides are murders committed by the State government. “Mr. Rao is confusing farmers by shifting his stance on a regular basis. He suggested farmers to go for fine variety paddy. Then he said not to cultivate paddy at all. He says that paddy till the last grain will be procured then again he said that procurement centres will not be opened. How many times will he change his stance?” asked Mr. Sharmila wondering why the Kaleswaram project was constructed with about Rs. 1 lakh crore by getting loans and what was the purpose of it. Stating that several farmers have been committing suicides because of the lopsided policies of government, the YSRTP president asked how the Chief Minister can sign an agreement with the Centre that paddy will not be cultivated in the State. “If not paddy, what will the farmers cultivate? Who will buy those alternative crops? Is there any arrangement for that?” she asked adding that more than 200 farmers had committed suicide in the last 70 days, and went on to question the government as to who is responsible for it. ‘Pay ex gratia’ She demanded a payment of Rs. 25 lakh ex gratia to the families of farmers who committed suicide.  Farmers have a right to cultivate paddy as it has minimum support price (MSP) and it is the responsibility of the government to procure them. Y.S.

20 December 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Umesh Jadhav failed to deliver on poll promises: Koli leaders||Koli (Kabbaliga) community leaders condemned Umesh Jadhav, Lok Sabha member from Kalaburagi, and other BJP leaders for not keeping their promise to get the Scheduled Tribe tag for their community. “All the BJP leaders, especially Mr. Jadhav, had repeatedly promised during the last Lok Sabha elections to get ST tag to Koli community within three months of their party assuming power at the Centre. But, they did nothing to keep their promise even after years. Their promise, which they had made to get Koli community votes, turns out to be another election Jumla. The BJP betrayed the community,” Lachhappa Jamadar, State president of Koli-Kabbaliga Tribe Reforms Committee, said at a media conference in Kalaburagi on Sunday. Mahantesh Kaulagi, district president, Forum of Backward Castes, said that the community leaders, who were aware of the betrayal by BJP, were planning to take up the issue and mobilise community members for a bigger struggle for the cause. “We had started the struggle soon after we had realised the betrayal of BJP leaders. But, the outbreak of COVID-19 prevented us from going for larger mobilisations. Now, we are preparing for a bigger struggle. We will shortly mobilise two lakh community members in Kalaburagi to press for the demand,” Mr. Kaulagi said. MES ban sought Condemning the desecration of the Sangolli Rayanna statue in Belagavi, the leaders demanded the government book the culprits under stringent laws and ban the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES), which, they said, had been disturbing the peace in the State. “This is not the first time that the goondas of MES attacked the symbols of Kannada pride. The government book the culprits under sedition clause and impose a ban on MES that has been disturbing the peace in Belagavi,” Mr. Jamadar said. Mr. Kaulagi said that a protest rally would be held in Kalaburagi on Wednesday to condemn the incident and appealed to the people to participate in a big number.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/umesh-jadhav-failed-to-deliver-on-poll-promises-koli-leaders/article37993971.ece
20 December 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||‘Govt. looting vehicle owners’||B.R. Patil, former Deputy Chairman of Karnataka Legislative Council, alleged that the BJP-led State government was resorting to looting vehicle owners to fill its exchequer and asked the government to go begging instead of harassing people for minor violations. He also asked why the police ws not showing the same interest in curbing other illegal activities like gambling, illegal stand extraction, rapes on women and children, illegal sale of liquor and drugs and violations under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. “Police across the State are stopping all the vehicles on road and forcibly collecting fines for minor violations. It is learnt that each police station is asked to register 500 cases of violation every month and collect fines. There is no written order in this regard. But, the police are doing it on the oral orders of the higher-ups. In the Kalaburagi district, there are 40 police stations and the police teams from each station are on road harassing drivers and collecting fines. The police are not showing the same interest in curbing other crimes like gambling, murder, sexual abuse of women and children, illegal sale of drugs and liquor, illegal sand mining and violations under the Essential Commodities Act which are on constant rise. If the government has no money, it should go for begging instead of troubling people,” Mr. Patil said at a press conference in Kalaburagi on Sunday. The Congress leader also alleged that the police were specifically targeting vehicles from Maharashtra to extract money on the pretext of pretty violations. “Recently, the mother of a Congress leader died in Kalaburagi and many relatives from Maharashtra came for her last rites. They had to pay Rs. 20,000 to the police who had stopped them on the way,” Mr. Patil said. When asked about the Registrar (In-charge) of CUK writing a letter to Mohan Bhagwat, RSS chief, on the university letterhead seeking an appointment with the latter, Mr. Patil said that this was part of turning CUK into the hub of right-wing activities. “Mr. Bhagwat does not hold a constitutional position. Nor is he an educationist. I don’t understand why a Registrar of the university should meet him. If he meets on his personal capacity, nobody would have a problem. But, meeting as the Registrar is a problem. The CUK is slowly turning into a hub of RSS these days. Mr. Donur’s meeting with the RSS chief is a part of this larger design and I condemn it,” Mr. Patil said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-looting-vehicle-owners/article37993973.ece

Mr. Kharge wrote to Chief Minister, Public Works Minister and KPSC Secretary on Thursday stating the fact that over 500 students from Kalyana Karnataka missed the examination scheduled in the Bengaluru centre on December 14, 2021 as their trains, Solapur-Hassan Express, Bidar-Yeshwantpur Express and Udyan Express, were running late.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/decision-to-re-conduct-exam-welcomed/article37993965.ece
20 December 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Soon, two more platforms at Mangaluru Central Station||The construction of platforms 4 and 5 at the Mangaluru Central Railway Station will be completed by March 2022. This will address the shortage of platforms in the station pending for long, said Southern Railway’s Palakkad Divisional Railway Manager Trilok Kothari here on Sunday. Talking to reporters after the inauguration of a bottle-crushing machine installed at the railway station, Mr. Kothari said the construction of the new platforms will be taken up after the new pit line, which holds 24 coaches, under construction is ready. This new pit line is being constructed in lieu of the existing 18-coach pit line. A pit line is used for conducting maintenance of express and passenger trains. With two new platforms, the Manglauru Central railway station can handle more trains, Mr. Kothari said. On allowing the train from Vijayapura to Mangaluru Central, Mr. Kothari it has to be decided by the Railway Board. The official said changes in timetable of trains depends on availability of platform. Earlier, Dakshina Kannada Member of Parliament Nalin Kumar Kateel inaugurated the new bottle-crushing machine. The Malabar Gold contributed Rs. 2 lakh from their corporate social responsibility funds towards the installation of the machine.

Talking to reporters, Mr. Kateel said it was unfortunate that instead of paying respects to great leaders some groups were trying to defame them. The State government will not tolerate such actions and effective action will be taken against those who are involved in the incident. He said the State government is committed to protection of Karnataka, its language, culture and ethos. Condemning MLA and former Karnataka Legislative Assembly Speaker Ramesh Kumar statement in the floor of the house about enjoying sexual assault, Mr. Kateel said such words should not have been said by a senior leader like Mr. Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kateel-condemns-desecration-of-statue/article37994150.ece
20 December 2021||Mangaluru,KARNATAKA||Report on out-of-syllabus questions in PU mid-term exam after today’s meeting||The Deputy Director of Pre-University Department in Dakshina Kannada Jayanna will hold a meeting with subject experts on Monday and submit a report to the Department Director Snehal R. on out-of-syllabus questions asked in the English paper of the II PU mid-term examination in the district on Saturday. Ms. Snehal told The Hindu that action will be taken against persons who were responsible for such questions as each district had different question papers and they were not uniform. Preeti S., a II PU student from the city college, said that there were questions of about 15 marks that were from the syllabus that was not prescribed for the mid-term examination. Vijay K., another student, said there were some questions that were difficult to comprehend. “We hope the department will award marks for us and take action on those responsible for the same,” he said. A senior English lecturer from a city college said there were as many as three questions of four marks each and three questions of one mark each that were from outside the syllabus. Question Nos. 29 and 30 with two and four marks respectively were difficult for students to comprehend. The jumbled words given in Question No. 35 for one mark were not given properly and hence students could not write the correct sentence, he said. Another lecturer from the district said absence of punctuation marks in one question made it difficult for students to understand it. “There are issues concerning questions totalling to 25 marks,” he said and added that all these issues will come up for discussion on Monday. Mr. Jayanna said that students need not worry and their interests would be safeguarded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/report-on-out-of-syllabus-questions-in-pu-mid-term-exam-after-todays-meeting/article37994154.ece

20 December 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Varsity intake up by over 20% for UG courses||The intake in the University of Mysore for the first year of the undergraduate courses during the current academic year has increased by more than 20%. The classes, which are already underway since more than month, continues to see fresh enrolment and the figures are likely to increase, according to N.K. Loknath, Director, College Development Council. Nearly 29,000 to 30,000 students used to enrol for various UG courses of the varsity during a normal year. But COVID-19 and the abrogation of the II PU examination resulted in all students being promoted this year. Hence there is an increase in the number of students seeking enrolment for degree classes. To cope with this, the Government authorised the varsity to increase their intake by 20% and hence all colleges have also been given permission to enrol additional students and hence the strength has shot up, said Mr. Loknath. But the data from many colleges were yet to be received by the varsity and the last date for admission has been extended and hence the total student count in first year could reach almost 37,000 this year, Mr. Loknath added. However, this has not posed much of a burden on teachers as they will be handling a few additional students over and above the normal intake for this particular batch which enrolled during the current academic year (2021-22). Mr. Loknath said there were concerns over laboratory infrastructure to handle an increase in the number of students but the admission trend indicated a general preference towards commerce and computer applications rather than pure science. “Though the pure science courses are also full, there was no perceptible increase in their numbers so as to stretch the available laboratory infrastructure,” Mr. Loknath added. A general perception among the students is that a course in commerce and computer applications can land them in jobs unlike courses in humanities or pure sciences which have to be followed up by a master’s degree course or appear for competitive examination. The preference towards the two streams – commerce and computer applications – has seen a dip in admissions sought for certain combination of subjects offering courses in psychology, geography, optional English, optional Kannada etc. “However, there are no courses that are being abrogated due to poor intake. As per the varsity and the Government norms any course that has at least 15 students cannot be abrogated and all the combinations meet the minimum criteria,” said Mr. Loknath. The new batch which has been admitted is also the first to be offered courses as per the National Education Policy 2020. Apart from conventional classes sports and yoga is compulsory as there is emphasis on physical education. Besides, participation in cultural activities is also mandatory, he added. However, there has been criticism from a section of students organisation against the State Government for rushing through the NEP 2020 without discussions and elaborate preparations.  Though the pure science courses are also full, there was no perceptible increase in their numbers so as stretch to the available laboratory infrastructure N.K.

20 December 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘B’ register concept: MCC team visits Bengaluru||Elected representatives and officials of Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) visited Bengaluru on Saturday to study the concept of maintaining a ‘B’ register for properties in revenue areas of the city. The delegation comprising members and Chairpersons of MCC standing committees and Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) MCC Mr N M Shashi Kumar and other officials met officials of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) including its Joint Commissioner (Revenue) Venkatachalapathi to discuss the system of maintaining a ‘B’ register for collection of tax from revenue property owners. Mr Shashi Kumar told The Hindu on Sunday that there were a total of 61 revenue extensions in Mysuru, where more than 31,000 properties existed. Though the MCC was providing infrastructure and other civic services to the areas, the civic body was not receiving any tax from a majority of the property owners. A system of maintaining a B register for such revenue properties already exists in areas coming under BBMP limits since 1995, Mr Shashikumar said. The properties in revenue areas are entered into the B register and the owners are issued a certificate for payment of property tax. By opening a ‘B’ register, Mr. Shashikumar said the properties in revenue areas can be identified for collection of tax. The same B register will be useful when Akrama Sakrama, the long-pending scheme by the Government to regularise properties in revenue areas, is implemented in MCC limits, he said. Also, the MCC, which is not receiving any taxes from most owners of properties in revenue areas despite providing infrastructure and extending services, can mobilise funds for the civic body. The proposal of opening a B register was already discussed in the previous MCC Council meeting, where a decision was taken to gather information by visiting the BBMP. The MCC officials were working on calculating an estimate of the tax the civic body can raise from the properties in revenue extensions. The proposal will be discussed again in the MCC council meeting and sent to the Government for permission to start a ‘B’ register. The proposal will be implemented after receiving an approval from the State Government. The MCC, which has around 1.85 lakh taxable properties, had set a target of collecting Rs 188 crore from property tax and khatha transfer during 2021-22. However, the MCC remains cash strapped with contractors, who had executed the civic body’s work, complaining of delay in clearing their bills while the general public laments about the deplorable condition of roads in many parts of the City.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/b-register-concept-mcc-team-visits-bengaluru/article37994167.ece
20 December 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Conference on agricultural issues||A State-level conference will be held in the city on December 26 to deliberate on key issues in the farming sector. It is being organised by Karnataka State Sugarcane Cultivators’ Association and will have stakeholders and experts’ participation from across the State. The conference is being held to mark Kisan Diwas which is celebrated in India on December 23 in memory of Charan Singh, India’s fifth Prime Minister. Kurubur Shanthakumar, association president, said agricultural sector in the country was in crisis and was no longer economically viable for farmers. The cost of cultivation has gone up but there was no proportionate increase in farmers’ income. Hence, many were abandoning the occupation. This would seriously impact the food security of the country. He said there was fragmentation of land holding and increase in the number of farmers with small-sized lands which was also responsible for making farming unviable due to lack of economics of scale. There was also a decline in soil fertility adding to the cultivation cost. The farmers were plagued by climate change and vagaries of nature while market forces had a direct bearing on the price of produce. The conference will take stock of some of the issues and conceive solutions to ameliorate the problems. On land fragmentation that was making farming unviable, Mr. Shanthakumar said the experts will be asked to prepare a broad outline on taking up collective farming. Efforts will be made to shift farmers from chemical-based farming apart from encouraging them to take up multi-cropping to reduce loss owing to market forces, he added. Mr. Shanthakumar said in view of emerging shortage of labour for agriculture, the conference will urge the Government to make available mechanized contraptions. It will urge authorities to open up centres providing agricultural equipment for lease or rent across the State. There was lack of storage facilities to stock bumper crop and the Government would be urged to create more.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/conference-on-agricultural-issues/article37993975.ece

Sudarshan on Sunday called upon people from all walks of life to join the padayatra from Mekedatu to push the BJP Government in the State to take up the reservoir project. Addressing a press conference in Mysuru, Mr. Sudarshan, a former Chairperson of the Legislative Council, who is also co-chairman KPCC’s Media and Communication Wing, said the padayatra, which is tentatively scheduled to begin from Mekedatu on January 9 was a non-party affair. He extended an invitation to achievers from all walks of life to join to help realise the development goal of Karnataka to help build a balancing reservoir at Mekedatu, which will not only help generate electricity, but also provide drinking water to many parts of Karnataka, particularly the Cauvery water-starved parts of Bengaluru. He said the padayatra will help build pressure on the BJP Government in Karnataka, which has displayed a lack of political will to take up the project. He said there was no reason for Tamil Nadu Government to oppose the project. KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar, who is scheduled to offer pooja at Talacauvery on December 24, will make an official announcement on the padayatra during his visit to the region. The padayatra will continue for about 10 to 12 days, he said. KPCC spokesperson M. Lakshmana, also at the press conference, said the project does not affect Tamil Nadu’s interests. He said the padayatra was being taken up on a non-party basis and invited members of JD(S) and BJP to join in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/padayatra-from-mekedatu-may-start-on-january-9/article37993976.ece

20 December 2021||December 20 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Corridors||Two Cabinet Ministers in the State BJP Government – Minister for Youth Empowerment and Sports K.C. Narayana Gowda and Health and Family Welfare Minister K. Sudhakar – are often at loggerheads. In the latest instance, what got Mr. Gowda’s goat was a statement by Mr. Sudhakar on the party’s electoral defeat in Mandya in the Legislative Council elections. “It is unfortunate that the BJP candidate was defeated in Mandya. We will introspect on the defeat in the party forum,” said the Health Minister. An irked Mr. Gowda hit back. “Who is Mr. Sudhakar to comment about the defeat in Mandya? Let him speak about his Chickballapur constituency,” he said. Explaining reasons for the BJP’s defeat, Mr. Gowda claimed that it was all because the Congress candidate spent loads of money. In November, both Ministers, who joined BJP in 2019, indulged in a verbal duel over sanctioning of health projects. Mr. Gowda pulled up Mr. Sudhakar at the Cabinet meeting for diverting developmental projects to Chickballapur district represented by the latter.   Former Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar’s insensitive and crass remarks on rape hit national headlines recently. However, another statement made by none other than Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai in the ongoing Winter session, not respectful to womanhood, hardly drew any attention. It happened when the Chief Minister tried to be “witty” while replying to a question raised by party colleague Ayanur Manjunath. Mr. Manjunath had a question on childcare leave and maternity leave facility meant for women employees of the State Government. He said that if all women employees in one of the departments, go on maternity leave at a time, the administration would suffer and the public would undergo “delivery pain”. The Chief Minister then sought to know if there was “any mechanism” to ensure all women employees of a department go on maternity leave at one time and also asked whether Mr. Manjunath would take responsibility for it. Mr. Manjunath said that Mr. Bommai was adept at diverting the issue by making such remarks, as he had close association with former Chief Minister the late J.H. Patel, known for his quick wit. What exactly constitutes “wit” is a debatable question, but there was no reaction to this banter either inside or outside the House.   Is Belagavi city free of COVID-19? One would get such a doubt, considering hardly anyone wears mask in this border town though public spaces remain crowded. What’s more, even officials who have to enforce compulsory mask wearing, are often seen without them. Political leaders, who pontificate on the need to follow COVID protocol, too have become complacent. This is the situation even though Belagavi, being a border district with Maharashtra, needs to exercise more caution. The fact that the Winter session is currently on in the city appears to have made little difference. Nagesh Prabhu Sathish G.T. B.S.

20 December 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Murders: Alappuzha on edge||Alappuzha district on Sunday woke up to a rude shock, with the news of gruesome killings of two State functionaries of the SDPI and the BJP sending shivers across the district. Murders of this kind are not common in the district. However, in the last 10 months, it has witnessed at least three high-profile ‘communally tinged political killings’, which, according to observers, are an indication of a deeper malady. February murder Observers see deliberate attempts to whip up communal tensions in several pockets of the district by the Sangh Parivar and Muslim outfits such as the SDPI. Besides the twin murders, Nandu, an RSS worker was murdered allegedly by SDPI men at Vayalar in February this year. Though the police are yet to establish a clear motive behind the murder of SDPI State secretary K.S. Shan on Saturday night, sources said they suspect it to be an act of revenge for the killing of Nandu. Chain reaction Following the assassination of the SDPI leader, there were calls on social media for retaliation. The police suspect the death of Shan led to a chain reaction, resulting in the killing of Ranjith Sreenivas. Ever since Nandu’s murder, there has been tensions between RSS and SDPI workers in the district. Both the CPI(M) and the Congress party have alleged that the RSS/BJP and SDPI were engaged in violence to tear the communal fabric of the district. The police have come in for heavy criticism for failing to prevent the murders, especially the second one. Critics say the police failed to understand the mood and initiate measures to check further violence following the killing of the SDPI leader. However, the police top brass denied any laxity on the part of the force. Following the twin murders, security has been beefed up across the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/murders-alappuzha-on-edge/article37994120.ece
20 December 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Mankulam’s travails with health care||Tucked away from the Kochi-Dhanushkodi national highway in Munnar region, Mankulam is one of the last settlement areas in Idukki where farming is a vital occupation. Lush tea plantations and proximity to the forest has made the village a good tourist destination as well. Mankulam has a prominent section of tribal communities that follow traditional farming. Lack of basic health facilities has always dogged the village, even as residents have been moving from pillar to post, demanding a hospital. As per official data, Mankulam has a population of 9,300, with 40% of them belonging to tribal communities spread over in 13 settlements. For all medical needs, residents here resort to a primary health centre (PHC) manned by a single medical officer. For those in remote tribal settlements, reaching the PHC is an uphill task. Also, the services offered are limited to basic health care. The nearest towns are Adimali and Munnar, both over 30 km away. “In case of an emergency, we have to reach Adimali or Munnar to go to either Kottayam Medical College or Theni Medical College. The demand for basic facilities and upgrading the PHC is long-standing,” says Vinodkumar, a resident. Tough terrain Due to the difficult terrain and lack of public transport system, tribespeople living in interior areas walk several kilometres to reach the PHC. There is no facility for specialised treatment and many are sometimes forced to make use of home remedies to avoid travelling to Adimali or Munnar. Pregnant women often need to seek help from their village elders. “If you conduct a survey on the health condition of the tribespeople, you will discover several cases of poor health and malnutrition,” says Vinodkumar, adding that there is utter negligence on the part of the authorities in holding health camps and diagnosing diseases at early stages. According to Tijo P. Jose, former medical officer of the Mankulam PHC, the geography of the village is a major hurdle for the villagers to avail themselves of medical care. Many children from tribal communities face malnutrition. “We often visited the tribal settlements and provided emergency treatment to those needing it. Without proper roads and travel facility, we had to walk five to six hours to reach the settlements,” says Mr. Jose, adding that the PHC needs to be upgraded. “I was the only doctor in that village for the last two years when I served in the PHC. I had to treat people while taking rest due to a hand injury,” he says. Man-animal conflicts Most tribespeople never receive proper treatment for their illnesses. Moreover, incidents of man-animal conflicts, which often require immediate care, are quite high at Mankulam. According to the villagers, a woman doctor is presently in charge of the PHC. If the facility is upgraded, the government can appoint more doctors and other paramedical staff, they say.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mankulams-travails-with-health-care/article37994109.ece

Satheesan will open a protest against the artificial inland waterway project on Tuesday here. The protest is organised by Anti Artificial Inland Waterway Committee. K. Vijayrajan, chairman of the committee, said the waterway was being constructed by digging through hills and markets from Mahe to Valapattanam in Kannur, giving the impression that it was part of the National Waterway. The project is intended to be implemented with private participation. However, no detailed project report or social or environment impact assessment has been done, he added. According to the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre, groundwater is the main source for the waterway project, said committee patron Vinod Payyada. There are reports of declining groundwater table in the project area. Freshwater availability in Kannur district will be jeopardized if groundwater is drained to a depth of four metres for the waterway, he said. Instead, the plan is to pump seawater. In that case, the permanent saline water at a depth of four metres will also end up in a disaster. The committee pointed out that the project was against the Land Acquisition Act of 2013. The project will have serious impact on the environment, it said. The depletion of groundwater table along with saline intrusion into wells and farms will severely impact freshwater availability in Kannur. The waterway, which passes through rich agricultural land, will destroying the agriculture sector. Besides, hundreds of families will be evicted, the committee observed. It warned of intensifying protests if the government went ahead with the project. Hundreds of people will line up in Panoor, Kadambur, Attadappa, Kappad, Chala, Mathukoth and Illikunnu areas on Tuesday as part of the agitation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/satheesan-to-open-protest-against-artificial-inland-waterway/article37994027.ece

20 December 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Delay in payment of pension cannot be justified, says panel||Holding that the right to receive pension is not dependent on the whims of any authority, the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has observed that there is no justification for either a delay in disbursement of pension or retaining a portion of pension of the retired cooperative bank employees by the Kerala State Cooperative Employees Pension Board. The commission, headed by Justice K. Surendra Mohan, made the observation while dismissing an appeal filed by various cooperative banks and the pension board against district consumer forums’ orders to pay full pension to retired cooperative bank employees. The commission upheld the forums’ orders. The commission observed that as reiterated by the apex court and the High Court, “the right to receive a pension is a right that flows from the status of the pensioner as an employee.” Sole exception The stand of the pension board that the arrears of pension withheld by it unjustifiably could not be returned could not be countenanced, the commission said. The pension or any portion of it could be withheld only in cases where in departmental or judicial proceedings initiated against an employee, he has been held guilty of misconduct in the discharge of his duties. No such situation exists in these cases, the commission said. Pension board’s duty The pension scheme conferred sufficient powers on the pension board to recover the contributions payable by the employers who delay such payments. The board was duty-bound to ensure speedy settlement of claims and sanction of pension. However, in these cases, the board had not discharged the duty promptly and efficiently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/delay-in-payment-of-pension-cannot-be-justified-says-panel/article37994065.ece

20 December 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Corpn. council session on waste management may be stormy||The special session of the Kochi Corporation Council to be held on Monday is likely to be a stormy one with the Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) councillors likely to hold the civic administration accountable for its various acts. The stance of the Communist Party of India (CPI) that the civic body needs to retender the bid for running the existing waste treatment plant has added power to the UDF campaign that all is not well on the waste management front. The CPI is of the view that the technical bid submitted by the agency, which was selected for the job, was faulty and hence unacceptable. The civic administration needs to float the bid once again. The CPI had raised the issue at an earlier meeting of the council, said a party leader. However, the CPI leaders are hopeful that an amicable settlement will evolve at the parliamentary party meeting of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) to be held on Monday at 11 a.m. If the ruling dispensation failed to iron out the issues at the meeting, the CPI would stick to its stand in the council meeting, said a party councillor. The UDF councillors would raise the issue of “the civic administration and the government keeping the Kochi Corporation Council in the dark” on a series of issues related to Brahmapruam land and waste management, said Congress leader Antony Kureethara. The Mayor and the State government had been regularly bypassing the Corporation Council on a host of sensitive issues, he said. The agreement for allotting the land of the civic body at Brahmapuram for the waste-to-energy plant was signed by the State government and the Corporation Secretary. However, no communication was shared with the Corporation Council. Even the Secretary did not bother to inform the council, he added. Mr. Kureethara said even the CPI, a constituent of the ruling dispensation, had shared the views of the Opposition councillors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-council-session-on-waste-management-may-be-stormy/article37994053.ece

In the absence of general coaches, many passengers are forced to stand for hours and travel, including in corridors and on steps of trains, says J. Liyons, secretary of the organisation. Many coaches are crowded, even as vacant seats abound in several others. All this lays bare the Railway’s claims of the need for physical distancing and adhering to the COVID-19 protocol. Even worse, the State government and people’s representatives are maintaining silence, despite the agony of passengers, he says. Many short-distance and MEMU services have not been restored, while commuters who are forced to travel in reserved coaches, especially at night, are being penalised. Short-distance trains are being detained for goods and bi-weekly express trains to pass by. Many idling coaches are rusting in yards. All this indicated the stepmotherly treatment being meted out to season-ticket holders, he says. Railway sources say the concerns of passengers will be addressed in a time-bound manner. Steps will be taken to improve the condition of coaches and to ensure their cleanliness. The number of stops is being reduced to speed up train movement, they add.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/train-passengers-forum-warns-of-stir/article37994030.ece

Rajeeve said here on Sunday that there would be no blanket protection for public sector undertakings (PSUs) in the State. The PSUs must prove that they were competitive and should run profitably to be protected by the government, he said. The government is of the view that PSUs must be protected. PSUs provide an alternative to other approaches to economic development and running of business establishments. However, they must run on profit, for which the government would support modernisation to enhance competitiveness, he said at the inauguration of the Kerala Bamboo Festival here. Master plans He said all 41 PSUs in the State, including the Kerala State Bamboo Corporation, had prepared master plans to enhance their businesses. On the basis of the plans, a project management facility would come up in Kochi, and it would operate under seven different sections, including finance and marketing, said the Minister. Master plans would also be prepared for the cashew and coir sectors, as they too had been brought under the Industries department, he added. Detailed project reports, containing action plans for short, medium and long terms, would be prepared based on the master plans for PSUs, he said. A focus area of department was to improve the marketing of traditional products, including those made of bamboo. Setting up of a permanent exhibition facility and online marketing are issues being addressed by the Minister on a war footing. Bamboo products were sold mostly at festivals and melas. There would soon be five permanent centres, including at Munnar, Thekkady, Kothamangalam, and Mananthavady, for sale of bamboo products in the State, said the Minister. Arrangements would also be made to ensure there was space for exhibition and sale of bamboo products in all government showrooms, said Mr. Rajeeve.

The 37-year-old was taken into custody by the special investigation team following his arrest on Saturday in three other similar arson cases. ‘Strong evidence’ A senior officer with the Special Investigation Team said the man was nabbed on the basis of strong incriminating evidence including forensic findings and visuals from closed-circuit television cameras. He also ruled out any other sabotage attempt in the incident as alleged by some of the people’s representatives and government officials. Soon after the incident, which took place on December 17, the police had zeroed in on the man and interrogated him in detail. It was a group of local merchants and people’s representatives who noted the suspicious presence of the man in all the previously reported incidents. According to police sources, he had the quirky habit of writing something in different languages at the crime spots. He had also maintained an active Facebook account, which would be examined by the hi-tech crime inquiry cell. The support of a medical team would also be sought to examine him as he had shown behavioural disorders and made contradictory statements, they said. A Circle Inspector associated with the investigation said the man’s Kerala connections and family whereabouts would be examined in detail. “Though he claimed that he was from Andhra Pradesh, we wanted to verify it. To begin with, the statement of one of his relatives now staying at Vadakara has been recorded by our team,” he said. The building, which was destroyed in the incident, was a heritage structure with over 100 years’ history, sources said. As many opposed its reconstruction citing the heritage status, the Revenue Department had decided to restore the old structure with some additional facilities. According to police sources, the man entered the compound in the name of burning waste. Revenue Department officials said they were yet to assess the total loss and the details of files destroyed in the incident. e-files available According to them, a temporary office will start functioning at Vadakara on Monday along with help desks to address public concerns. Details of e-files available will be reported to the Revenue Department soon for proceeding with the recovery of lost files, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/man-held-in-connection-with-taluk-office-fire/article37994044.ece
20 December 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Renovated Palayam subway opened to public||The renovated subway under the busy Palayam Junction in Kozhikode is set to be the new favourite selfie spot for people in the city. Art works, including graffiti and doodles, adorn the walls of the subway, which was thrown open to the public on Sunday. The Palayam subway was the first of its kind in the State, which was commissioned in 1980 when former Deputy Mayor P.M. Aboobacker was the Public Works Minister. But it had to be closed down for more than two decades, as it became unusable and efforts to renovate it had failed. The subway became a haunt for miscreants later, forcing the Kozhikode Corporation to close the gates of the facility eventually. The renovation was undertaken by Maxsol Ad Solutions, with a maintenance contract for 10 years. “When we took over, this place was filled with garbage and stagnant water. It was an uphill task from there,” said Praveen Kumar K.S, project manager of Maxsol. Art works on the walls of the subway follow black-and-white theme with colour codes for each exit. The main entrance near the Palayam bus stand has a unique vine and flowers pattern, which is a smart way of hiding the pipeline from the motor to flush out water from the subway. Doodle works feature faces of prominent cultural leaders of the city as well as art forms. An installation of a dhow (Uru) made of nails is one of the main attractions inside the subway. A portrait of P.M. Aboobacker has been drawn on one corner of a wall. Several paintings by students of Universal Arts have been put up on the walls, as an exhibition. “There are plans to organise art exhibitions here regularly. Interested artists can approach the Kozhikode Municipal Corporation,” Mr. Kumar said. The new design of the subway is by architect Ashwin, while the art works were prepared by a group led by artist Prajeesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/renovated-palayam-subway-opened-to-public/article37994035.ece

20 December 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Ensure uniform stipend for medical interns: MP||Binoy Viswam, Rajya Sabha MP, has urged Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya to ensure equity in payment of internship to medical students in private and government medical college hospitals (MCHs) across the country. In a letter to the Minister, Mr. Viswam said that the National Medical Commission’s Draft Regulations on Compulsory Rotating Internship, 2021, issued on April 21 and gazetted on November 18, had said that all interns shall be paid stipend “as fixed by the appropriate fee fixation authority as applicable to the institution/university/State.” Ambiguity “The phrasing of this provision allowed for great ambiguity and arbitrariness. It may also result in management of private colleges denying stipend to the interns as they have complete discretion without any safeguarding mechanism. The ramifications of the same are already being seen in colleges across the country as great variance exists in stipend amounts being paid in government colleges as opposed to private colleges,” he pointed out. A right, not charity Mr. Viswam said that medical profession was an extremely strenuous and highly specialised field that required individuals to dedicate their lives in the service of others. “As part of medical professionals’ education, they are required to undertake internships across various settings. In this context, a stipend is paid as a matter of right and not charity. It is essential that parity and equity be maintained across all medical institutions, whether run by private bodies or by the government,” he said. The MP requested the Minister to consult with all stakeholders, including State governments, medical college managements, medical professionals, and students to formulate a policy that ensures equity among medical students. A uniform stipend to all interns would ensure that, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ensure-uniform-stipend-for-interns-mp/article37994112.ece

P. Mohanan, CPI(M) Kozhikode district secretary, said that some pro-Hindutva profiles in the social media had justified the murder citing a news report on a web portal that maligned Krishnapriya and her family. Some voice clips of conversations with the girl’s parents, recorded before the murder, were used in the news report. Mr. Mohanan alleged that Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh members could have helped Nandu.

Officials of the Travancore Devaswom Board said the devotees would be permitted to take the route in strict adherence to the COVID-19 protocol. Prior to opening the route, a joint team of revenue and forest officials had inspected it to assess its condition, besides the threats posed by wildlife. Sangh Parivar organisations had staged a protest at Erumeli some days ago demanding to open the route. The route The forest path, which takes the Karimala-Valiyanavattom-Cheriyanavattom-Pampa-Marakkoottom route, used to receive a good number of pilgrims every year till the authorities closed it in 2020 in view of the pandemic situation. Of this, the opening portion of the route from Koyikkakavu temple to Kalaketty is under the Kottayam Forest Division while the remaining portion is part of the Periyar Tiger Reserve (West). Meanwhile, the authorities have also decided to increase the daily limit of pilgrims to 60,000 from the current 45,000. The move follows a sharp surge in daily footfalls at the temple. 8.11 lakh so far As per official estimates, 8.11 lakh devotees visited the temple till Sunday morning. Of this, Saturday (December 18) reported the highest number of visitors for a single day — 42,870. The income during the season rose sharply to over Rs. 55 crore. The numbers, though pale in comparison with the ones in the pre-pandemic days, still mark a major improvement over the scaled-back season the previous year. The overall income during that season, when the overall footfall had stood less than one lakh, had dropped sharply to Rs. 21 crore as against the Rs. 270 crore in 2019-20. The TDB hopes the numbers will rise further on the occasion of the Mandala puja on December 26.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sabarimala-forest-path-to-be-opened/article37994032.ece

20 December 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Share a bike and save energy||The Energy Management Centre, Kerala (EMC), the Power Department agency which promotes energy conservation and acts as the lead entity for the ‘Go Electric’ e-mobility campaign in the State, has proposed ‘Public Bike Sharing’ (PBS) schemes as a clean and green solution for short-distance city travel. Urban locations PBS will be piloted in Thiruvananthapuram city with non-geared and geared bicycles and e-bikes. The service can be extended to other urban locations if the response is encouraging, EMC director R. Harikumar said. On the lookout for service providers, EMC is also planning to get startups on board the initiative, he said. Increasingly popular in many cities as a healthy, affordable and sustainable mode of travel, PBS systems allow users to borrow bicycles - usually for a small fee or free of cost - for short periods. The two-wheelers can be accessed and dropped off at racks set up at various points across a city. In Thiruvananthapuram city, EMC’s target users include daily commuters such as office-goers and students who can use the facility for first or last-mile connectivity, and tourists. The service will be on offer for a reasonable user tariff. In addition to improving first and last-mile connectivity, a thriving PBS system can extend the reach of city transportation, reduce overcrowding in public vehicles and improve the urban environment, according to the EMC. Encouraging ‘green mobility’ aside, non-motorised transport (NMT) options also help to transform the nature of short-distance travel. “NMT has gained prominence as a viable alternative to complete the first and last mile within the urban cores. Some Indian cities have borrowed from experiences of cities in Europe, North America and Asia to initiate similar Public Bike Sharing (PBS) schemes, as an integral part of their mobility solutions for the city,” the agency observed in an EoI invited from service providers last month. Prime objective Further, the National Urban Transportation Policy has as its prime objective “safe, affordable, quick, comfortable, reliable and sustainable access for the growing number of city residents to jobs, education, recreation and such other needs within our cities,” EMC noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/share-a-bike-and-save-energy/article37994238.ece

The Minister made the announcement after a meeting held on Sunday to discuss development projects in the Thiruvananthapuram Assembly constituency. Imperative Mr. Raju will meet the NHAI chairperson in New Delhi to discuss the matter. Sunday’s meeting concluded that a flyover was imperative to resolve the knotty traffic issue at Eenchakkal, the Transport Minister said. Situated on the busy Kazhakuttam-Mukkola national highway stretch, the junction serves as an important entry point to the capital city. Roads leading from East Fort, Vallakadavu, Attakulangara and the Pettah-Eenchakkal road converge on it. Negotiating the junction has become a veritable ordeal for motorists, especially during the peak hours. Although a vehicular underpass had been planned at Eenchakkal as part of the development of the NH stretch, it was dropped following local protests. On Sunday, the Transport Minister drew attention to an earlier demand for a flyover at this location. Meanwhile, the police informed the meeting that the feasibility of re-routing vehicles through smaller roads in the area also would be explored. Elected representatives, Transport Secretary Biju Prabhakar, officials from the police department, NHAI and the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation and the local residents’ association representatives attended the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-to-move-for-flyover-at-eenchakkal/article37994242.ece
20 December 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Online extortion racket: 3 from Rajasthan arrested||The Thiruvananthapuram city cyber crime police have arrested three men hailing from Rajasthan who allegedly operated an online racket and extorted large sums of money from youngsters in Kerala. The accused forged online friendships with their unsuspecting victims by sending them explicit pictures of women and then blackmailing them into parting with the money, City Police Commissioner Balram Kumar Upadhyay said on Sunday. The police identified the men as Vallabh Patidar, 23, Ashok Patidar, 26 and Nilesh Patidar, 19. According to the police, several persons in Kerala had fallen prey to their racket. The Thiruvananthapuram City Cyber Crime Police Station registered a case two months ago and launched an investigation after a victim from Thiruvananthapuram lodged a complaint saying he had lost Rs. 10 lakh. The victims were mostly young people attending online classes who responded to pop-ups containing explicit pictures and messages, according to the police. Once their victims were trapped, the accused blackmailed them and extorted money by threatening them with legal action on the pretext that they were cyber wing officials of the CBI. They also threatened the victims saying that their details would be published online. The trio led a luxurious lifestyle travelling to tourist resorts in various States by sourcing identification documents from tribals in Rajasthan, the police said. Tracking emails and transactions made via digital wallets, the police discovered that the trio frequently travelled from Udaipur, Dungarpur and Banswara districts. Special team A special investigation team led by T. Shyamlal, Assistant Commissioner and Station House Officer, city cyber crime police station, camped in Rajasthan for nearly a week to pursue the investigation in collaboration with the police officials there. The accused were finally tracked down and nabbed from the villages of Talora, Indora and Doli. The accused were produced before the Thiruvananthapuram Judicial Magistrate’s Court and remanded.

20 December 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||KSFDC finalises 4 films for funding||The Kerala State Film Development Corporation (KSFDC) has finalised the four films that would get funding this year as part of the State Government’s steps to promote films by women directors and those directors from the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe categories. Though the Corporation had finalised three of the films earlier this month following a long, three-tier judging process, there was a tie over the second film in the women directors’ category. Five-member jury The five-member jury headed by screenwriter John Paul, who evaluated the scripts, had given the same marks for Inheritance by Indu.V.R and Puthankacheri Post by P.Sreedevi. Following this, the scripts were evaluated by another jury consisting of filmmakers and writers, sources said. The second jury’s choice of Indu.V.R's script Inheritance was announced on Saturday. Earlier, B 32 Muthal 44 Vare , written by Sruthi Namboothiri, was chosen as the first film in the women directors' category. Ariku , written by V.S.Manoj and Pirathi written by Arun.J.Mohan, will be getting funding in the SC/ST. Upto Rs. 1.5 crore Each of the films will be provided funding of up to Rs. 1.5 crore. Meanwhile, the first of the films made under the initiative which was launched last year, are set to make a tour of the festival circuit and get theatrical releases. Nishiddho directed by Tara Ramanujan will feature in the competition category at the International Film Festival of Kerala in February and a few other festivals, while Divorce directed by Mini.I.G will be getting a theatrical release. Speaking to The Hindu , KSFDC Chairman Shaji.N.Karun said that the Corporation is currently in talks with distributors. “This initiative was launched as part of the State Government’s measures for women empowerment and increasing inclusivity. It was expanded this year to include Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe filmmakers as the presence of these communities in Kerala cinema is still low, compared to States like Tamil Nadu. Our responsibility in this is high, as the content should have quality and the films that are produced should get enough theatres. In addition to the Government-run theatres, we are looking at around 50 theatres for the release of these films in the State and some more in the metro cities outside Kerala,” said Mr.Karun. The budget for promotion was taken from the fund allocated for each film last year. The KSFDC has now put forward a proposal to the Government to set aside separate funds for promotion of the films. The selected filmmakers have a tight schedule ahead as they are required to complete the shooting before the end of the financial year. This year, a total of 79 submissions were received in the SC/ST filmmakers’ category and 41 proposals in the women filmmakers’ category. Narrowed down The list was further narrowed down based on a treatment note submitted by the aspiring filmmakers. In the final stage, a total of 29 filmmakers from both categories submitted their scripts for evaluation, from which four were selected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/four-films-selected-for-ksfdc-funding/article37993573.ece
20 December 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Omicron: time to extend surveillance to community||It is high time the State shifted the focus of surveillance for Omicron virus variant from travellers to the community as the virus variant has already been identified in travellers from nations not deemed as “high risk” as well as their contacts. Given the high vaccination background in Kerala, it is very much possible that the variant is already circulating in the community, resulting in plenty of mild or asymptomatic infections, experts said. “Focussing all our efforts on whole genome sequencing of samples from airports alone is a waste of resources as this will not help in estimating the basal prevalence of Omicron in the community or its growth trends. The variant is highly transmissible and can put a significant amount of stress on the health system by putting a large number of people in hospitals in a short time. It thus calls for a fast response and a clear plan of action,” said Vinod Scaria, senior scientist, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi. High immune escape The variant has high immune escape potential, evading both monoclonal antibodies and antibodies generated by vaccines or previous infection. Vaccination, while it is still effective in reducing disease severity, may not be absolute. Now that the variant is already in the community and given that the doubling time is just two days, accelerating vaccination will in no way help reduce transmission speed, experts say. Also, with a significant degree of immune escape, much higher levels of re-infections are being seen with Omicron (8% to 9%) than Delta (around 1%). This means that the huge pool of vaccinated people are also susceptible to infection. Kerala would do better by impressing upon the public, the importance of stricter adherence to non-pharmacological interventions such as masking (the emphasis on high-quality ones) and better ventilation, Dr. Scaria said during a discussion organised by the Health department here on Saturday. Uncertain The latest update issued by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), in the U.K., said that “precise vaccine efficacy against severe disease and death from Omicron remains uncertain due to the small numbers of severe outcomes to date. Duration of vaccine efficacy also remains uncertain.” SAGE has warned that nosocomial transmission (within hospitals) is a huge risk with Omicron. Epidemiologists here have suggested that clinicians should have a role in deciding which samples should be sent for genomic sequencing (on the basis of severity or unusual symptoms) so that one can identify specific symptoms linked to Omicron “Going forward, whether the reality will play out exactly as the Delta template or not is not known yet. A cautious and calibrated approach, with a firm ear to the ground is what is needed,” a public health expert said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/omicron-time-to-extend-surveillance-to-community/article37994079.ece

Like many other differently abled children unable to go to school, this Class V student would see his friends, teachers, and people’s representatives drop in once a month as part of the Samagra Shiksha’s ‘Changathikkoottam’ programme that was aimed at improving their confidence and social skills and bringing them into the mainstream. ‘Changathimarkoppam’ Now, Samagra Shiksha’s Kilimanoor block resource centre (BRC) has launched ‘Changathimarkoppam’, an extension of ‘Changathikkoottam’, to gradually bring such children to school, introduce them to the school environment, and facilitate their interaction with their peers. Objective The objective is to get them to school once a month at the beginning, increase it to once or twice a week, and then fully integrate them into the school environment as part of inclusive education. Of the nearly 60 differently abled children in the subdistrict limits who are provided home-based education, Arun and three other children were the first to be brought to school as part of ‘Changathimarkoppam’. He reached school in the grama panchayat car along with health workers. Fellow students, teachers, and BRC officials were present. Unforgettable Ashadevi O., Headmistress, Vivekodayam Upper Primary School, Vellalloor, says seeing Arun’s eyes light up when he reached the school was one of the most unforgettable moments of her teaching career. “Till now, he had only heard of school from his sister. The pandemic worsened his isolation in his small house. But seeing him in school was great,” she says. Ms. Ashadevi points out that many of these children hail from financially backward families and hence the challenges in bringing them to school are bigger. The programme, though, will benefit the children, she says. Like Arun, Salman of Pulimath grama panchayat, Mahadevan of Kilimanoor grama panchayat, and Sangeerthana of Karavaram panchayat also attended their respective schools. Good response Kilimanoor BRC officials say the response from the parents too has been positive.

20 December 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||A political storm in State||On Sunday, the State woke up to the grainy surveillance camera capture of two targeted political killings in Alappuzha. The monochrome surveillance footage spread rapidly in the local television news media, mobile phone messaging apps and social media platforms. The tit-for-tat political murders had extinguished the lives of two ideologically opposed young politicians, one from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the other from the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI). As per the latest police analysis, both leaders appeared caught unawares and seemed easy pickings to settle long-standing political scores. The murders sparked off a wave of outrage, partly directed at the district police. Opposition charge Congress leader and former Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala pointedly asked why the local law enforcement had not swamped the streets with officers soon after the first murder, given the communal implications of the crime. Soon, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan condemned the crime. He urged people to isolate the forces that seek to spread hate and terror in the community. He also promised resolute legal action against the perpetrators. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president K. Sudhakaran said the police had repeatedly failed to act on incendiary speeches and inflammatory sloganeering by fundamentalist outfits. The government had given free rein to extremist elements for short-lived political gain. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan said the Alappuzha murders were the latest fall-out of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] attempt to woo extremist organisations and influencers. He said Mr. Vijayan had termed the tactic “lovingly as social engineering”. The process had begun in the run-up to the 2021 Assembly elections. The United Democratic Front asked the BJP and the SDPI to forsake the path of violence. BJP allegation BJP State president K. Surendran said the CPI(M) used the SDPI and Popular Front of India (PFI) as a cat’s paw against nationalist parties. He said the organisations accorded arms training to their cadres and operated like secretive terrorist organisations. The government should hand the investigation to national agencies and declare the murder an extremist act. BJP leader Subramanian Swamy demanded the government ban the SDPI and the PFI. Union Ministers of State and BJP leaders V. Muraleedharan and Rajiv Chandrasekhar urged an end to the reign of terror against their party workers. SDPI State president Muvattupuzha Ashraf Moulavi blamed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for the murder of his party leader in Alappuzha. He deemed the RSS a threat to public peace.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-political-storm-in-state/article37994069.ece

Sivankutty has flayed the central government move to open up the country’s space sector to private players. Inaugurating the 39th annual meet of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Staff Association here on Sunday, Mr. Sivankutty called the move to ‘privatise ISRO’ dangerous. The Central Government has kicked off privatisation in the strategically-important institution under the pretext of Atma Nirbhar Abhiyaan. Any move to throw open the national space agency and its facilities, painstakingly built over the decades with the taxpayer’s money, to capitalist forces in the name of privatisation can in no way be justified, Mr. Sivankutty said. Contributions made by ISRO to the growth and progress of not just the industrial sector by the Indian economy as a whole are not small. The space agency operates with the support of public sector as well as numerous private industries. The Space Activities Bill will nullify the edge enjoyed by ISRO in the space sector, Mr. Sivankutty alleged. He called upon workers to unite against the move. The LDF Government has adopted the stand that anti-labour policies of the Centre will not be enforced in Kerala. It is in this context that Kerala stands as a model for the country, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/move-to-privatise-isro-dangerous-sivankutty/article37994128.ece

Specially designed handloom woven materials will be showcased during the Oscar awards event. As representatives from many countries arrived at the Oscars, this would give visibility, acceptance, and markets for handloom in these countries. Conventional handloom dhoti and sari, she said, were not in use in other nations. Hence, the weavers needed to be trained in customised designer wear acceptable in these countries and ensure them global markets, Ms. Jon said. Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan said several measures were being taken for the revival of the handloom industry in association with CISSA (Centre for Innovation in Science and Social Action). “The new generation is reluctant to take up weaving. Our mission is to allay their apprehensions. The State capital is on the path to development. And our aim is to explore those avenues for the welfare of the handloom industry. More plans are in the pipeline in association with NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development),” the Minister said. Voluntary Ms. Jon is voluntarily extending her initiatives for the development of Balaramapuram handlooms in an effort spearhead by CISSA, a statement here said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sanjana-jons-docu-to-promote-handlooms/article37994116.ece

20 December 2021||Thrissur,KERALA||Hope Fest to replace theatre fete this year||The Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi’s three-day theatre festival ‘Hope Fest’ will begin on December 29. The festival will replace the more elaborate International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK) this year, as COVID-19 restrictions are in place. The Hope Fest will have national and international plays with a duration of less than 60 minutes. The plays will be organised in various stages of Sangeetha Nataka Akademi, named after theatre personalities who died recently, from December 29 to December 31. The Hope Fest has been planned on the theme Pandemic Theatre and 19 short plays will be staged. Difficulties “The plays, created within the limitations of the pandemic, have been presenting the challenges of the current time. Though the Akademi started preparations for the ITFoK following repeated requests from the cultural personalities, it was difficult to organise the ITFoK in a full-fledged manner. The Hope Festival will utilise the scope of music and digital media,” according to Prabhakaran Pazhassi, secretary of the Akademi. People can take passes for festival online and offline for free, he said. Names of venues The venues of the festival will be named after theatre persons who passed away recently such as P. Balachandran, K.K. Rajan, A. Santhakumar, Rajeev Vijayan, Dr. Jose George, Anil Nedumangad, and Kozhikode Sarada. A photo exhibition, in connection with the festival will be organised from December 25 to January 5 on the premises of the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi. The exhibition will have selected photos of all the 12 editions of the ITFok from 2008, said Mr. Pazhassi. A cultural meet “The festival is an attempt to rejuvenate the theatre sector from the challenging times of the pandemic. Hope Fest is not ITFoK. It is a cultural meet being organised as it is not possible to conduct the ITFoK due to the challenges posed by the pandemic,” the Akademi secretary said. Not only theatre and music, other art forms too will be showcased in the festival, he added. “As there was no time for inviting entries, only curation was possible for the Hope Festival. Though it will not be parallel to the ITFoK, Hope Fest also can be organised as an annual year-end festival, which will provide space for artistes from across the country. If we can plan it in advance, the selection process can be more transparent and democratic,” Mr. Pazhassi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hope-fest-to-replace-theatre-fete-this-year/article37994246.ece

SDPI Kerala secretary K.S. Shan, 38, and BJP leader Ranjith Sreenivas, 40, were brutally murdered in a span of less than 12 hours by assailants in separate incidents. While Shan was attacked by a gang at Kuppezham Junction in Mannancherry on Saturday night, Sreenivas, OBC Morcha State secretary, was assaulted in his home at Vellakinar in Alappuzha on Sunday morning. 50 persons in custody The police suspected the ‘political killings’ were connected. Harshita Attaluri, Inspector General of Police, said that 50 people were taken into custody in connection with the murders. However, no arrest was made as of Sunday evening. The police said they had collected CCTV footage of the attack on Shan from the spot and visuals of assailants reaching the house of Sreenivas on motorcycles. The investigators had also taken an SDPI-owned ambulance into custody. In the backdrop of the violence, District Collector A. Alexander clamped prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Cr.PC in the district for Sunday and Monday. While the SDPI alleged that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was behind the attack on Shan, the BJP blamed the SDPI for the murder of its leader. According to the police, the attack on Shan occurred around 7.30 p.m. He was heading home on his motorcycle when a car rear-ended the two-wheeler. A group of persons came out of the car and attacked him with iron rods and other weapons, the police said. He was first admitted to a hospital in Alappuzha and later shifted to another hospital in Kochi where he succumbed to his injuries around 11.30 p.m. The police said the car used by the gang was taken on rent. Two persons who arranged the vehicle for the assailants were taken into custody. Sreenivas, a lawyer, was hacked by a group of attackers around 7 a.m. when he was about to go for a morning walk. According to the police, eight of the 12 people who reached on motorcycles barged into his house and brutally hacked the BJP leader in front of his mother.

United Citizens Forum on Sunday took strong objection to the Anantapur Municipal Corporation’s decision to serve notices to impose Property Tax as per G.O. 198, which according to its leaders is arbitrary as the quantum of the hike has not been mentioned in it. At a press conference here on Sunday, forum general secretary A.G. Rajmohan said that since the municipal authorities were ready with special notices imposing the new property tax, they have conveyed their objections to the Chief Minister, Municipal Administration Minister, Principal Secretary Municipal Administration and Director of Municipal Administration. The forum leaders said that the notice says the revision in tax was based on Act 44 of 2020, but nowhere in the notice was the exact amount that the property owner is supposed to pay was shown except for a uniform hike imposed on the existing tax based on House Rental Value, which misguides the public. Forum president Rasool said that when writ petitions were pending before A.P. High Court judge, serving notice would be arbitrarily and improper on the part of the government. Forum Secretary S. Nagendra said people would react according to the actions of the government unless the system of assessing tax was reversed to the Rental value base. The forum has demanded that the government repeal the amendment Act no 44 of 2020, and cancel the G.O. no.198 and stop serving special notices till the matter was decided by the High Court and implement the system of assessing property tax based on Rental Value.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/property-tax-notices-served-arbitrarily-forum/article37993610.ece

The police identified the group after analysing CCTV footage and questioning a few people who were reportedly circulating video clips of the incident on social media along with inflammatory messages. The seven men are mainly autorickshaw and taxi drivers. “It was a planned act carried out in retaliation to the burning of the Kannada flag in Kolhapur, Maharashtra,” said a police officer. The prime accused has been identified as Chethan Gowda. The others are his associates and they have been identified as Gurudev Narayana Kumar, Naveen, Vinod, Arun, Darshan, and Yogesh. They did a recce of the city and identified the Shivaji statue as a target, the police said. The accused arrived in a car, two autorickshaws, and three bikes early on Friday with black paint and a ladder which they used to reach the statue to deface it. Naveen recorded the act on his mobile phone and circulated it on social media, according to the police. This enabled the police to track them down. They arrested Naveen and based on his statement the others were taken into custody. “The accused confessed that they had committed the offence in retaliation to the Kolhapur incident but this has led to a law and order problem and caused hatred between two communities,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) M. N. Anucheth. Following the incident in Benglauru, protests erupted in Belagavi where a statue of freedom fighter Sangolli Rayanna was defaced on Saturday. Prohibitory orders, imposed on Belagavi, have been extended till December 22.

20 December 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Refrain from liberal use of pesticides, ryots told||Horticulture scientists on Sunday cautioned mango growers against indiscriminate use of pesticides as this would adversely impact the chances of exports to foreign countries. Officials of the Horticulture Department, in association with the Tirupati-based Citrus Research Station, organised the first round of interaction session and awareness programme with mango growers here. Deputy Director (Horticulture) B. Srinivasulu said that the mango exports had suffered last season (May-July) due to the presence of pesticide residues in the produce. ‘Go for organic’ Instead of using pesticides, farmers were asked to go for organic way of cultivation as this would not only result in high yields but also enhance the prospects of exports and profits. The official said that with copious rains in November this time, there was no need for mango growers to use an overdose of pesticides or inorganic fertilizers. “With organic manure and judicious use of pesticides, the growers could reap rich yields with superb fruit quality. Unfortunately, some farmers use pesticides indiscriminately hoping to get high yields. This eventually will lead to a failed scenario when it comes to exports, which requires maintenance of international standards,” Senior Entomologist (Citrus Research Station) D. Srinivasa Reddy said, adding that as the flowering season had started in the Chittoor district, the farmers should be careful in the use of pesticides. “This year, the cultivation is spread over 1.17 lakh hectares in Chittoor district, of which 80,000 hectares were used in harvesting the ‘thothapuri’ variety meant for supply to as many as 28 pulp industries. This time, we are expecting about 7 lakh tonnes of yield,” Mr. Srinivasulu said. A series of awareness camps for the farmers would be organised where scientists from the YSR Horticulture University will participate and interact with farmers, the official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/refrain-from-liberal-use-of-pesticides-ryots-told/article37993612.ece

A delegation of farmer leaders, led by the party farmers’ wing’s State president M. Srinivasa Reddy, urged the YSR Congress Party government to provide seeds free of cost to the affected chilli growers and other farmers so that they can raise Bengal gram and other crops during rabi. Chilli growers in the districts of Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam and Kurnool had lost heavily because of pest attacks following the unabated rain, he said and lamented that the agriculture department officials had not even made a visit to the affected farms to study the cause of the pest attack and suggest remedies. He added that farmers feared raising crops as they repeatedly suffered losses because of excess rainfall during the Jagan Mohan Reddy regime. Financial aid Each of the affected farmers should be provided with a financial assistance of Rs. 50,000 to begin winter crop cultivation to make good the losses, said TDP farmers’ wing Bapatla Lok Sabha unit president K. Venkaiah after giving a patient hearing to a group of farmers in Posapadu village, near Inkollu, in Prakasam district. ‘Govt.’s failure’ Mr. Srinivasa Reddy alleged that the farmers across the State were in dire straits because of the utter failure of the YSRCP government to anticipate the flood flow in major rivers, including Penna, which were in spate. Sudden release of huge quantity of flood brought misery to the farmers in the State, he said. Recalling the rain-related incidents of last month, he said that had the water been released from the Annamayya project in time, a disaster could have been averted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-urged-to-bail-out-rain-hit-chilli-growers/article37993753.ece

Hence, the force has deployed in strength in localities with a history of communally tinged political violence to prevent vested interests from weaponising the “dangerous mood.” State Police Chief (SPC) Anil Kant said the police would not allow political violence to spin out of control. “We are moving fast and hard for the custody of potential trouble makers,” he said. Mr. Kant announced the formation of a special team under Additional Director General of Police (ADGP), Law and Order, Vijay Sakhare to investigate the case. Police pickets The police have posted pickets in sensitive localities in front of BJP and SDPI offices. Inspector General of Police Harshita Attaluri was camping in Alappuzha. An investigator said the twin murders had the imprint of a mafia-style hit-and-run operation. For one, the police suspect that the assailants had used an ambulance to carry out the hit on BJP leader Ranjith Sreenivas. Hours earlier, unknown persons had supposedly used a car to ram the scooter ridden by SDPI State secretary K.S. Shan before hacking him to death, according to the police. Mobile phone activity The police have sent mobile phone activity in the locality of the killing for forensic analysis, hoping the cyber examination would yield some clues regarding the identity of regular contacts of the assailants. Plainclothes squads were afoot collecting intelligence as the murder investigation readies to extend itself to other States. An investigator said the police were also verifying whether a Kannur-based BJP leader in Alappuzha had incentivised the assailants to kill Shan. The SDPI had raised such an allegation. Moreover, the police view the murder of Sreenivas as a retaliatory strike.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-plan-preventive-detention/article37993572.ece
20 December 2021||Tirumala,ANDHRA PRADESH||Pandemic hits TTD with fall in revenue in 2021 too||2021 was a difficult phase for the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) which reeled under the impact of COVID-19 pandemic for the second consecutive year. The hope of revival of economic resources faded with the second wave of pandemic hitting in April. There was a drastic decline in the footfall and a sharp fall in hundi collections, the main source of income for the TTD. The daily issuance of sarva darshan tokens were slashed from 30,000 to 15,000 in the last week of March and on April 12, a total ban was imposed on their issuance. Similar was the case with the online special entry darshan tickets which were restricted to a meagre 5,000 per day till August after which it was slightly enhanced to 8,000 a day. Restrictions were also imposed on trekking routes and services of Srivari sevaks were temporarily discontinued. The decision to allow devotees to take part in the arjitha sevas in limited numbers from Ugadi was deferred indefinitely. The restrictions in permitting devotees for darshan of Lord Venkateswara had an adverse effect on temple hundi. The hundi income plunged to Rs. 62.62 crore in April from Rs. 105 crore the previous month. However, the decision to enhance the number of pilgrims for the darshan from the last week of September and opening of the footpath routes led to a gradual increase in the hundi income, currently put between Rs. 75 crore and 80 crore. The limiting of the budget estimates to Rs. 2,937.82 crore for the current financial year as against Rs. 3,309 crore in 2020-21 speaks about the impact of the pandemic on the TTD revenues. Meanwhile, torrential rains in mid-November that battered the hill temple compounded the woes of the TTD. Due to the intensity of the problem caused by the cloud burst, ghat roads and footpath routes had to be closed and the devotees were requested to defer their pilgrimage. The TTD was also in the news when the High Court suspended two GOs facilitating the nomination of 52 members as special invitees in the newly constituted trust board in September.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/in-2021-too-pandemic-hits-ttd-with-fall-in-revenue/article37993565.ece
20 December 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Holy trek from Tallapaka enters Chittoor district||For the 19th consecutive year, devotees from Tallapaka in Kadapa district embarked on their holy trek to Tirumala via Mamandur, the ancient route taken by saint poet Tallapaka Annamacharya in the 17th century. The trek assumes significance this year in the wake of the decision by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) to consider developing this route as the third motorable road to reach the abode of Lord Venkateswara. The team led by former Rajampet MLA and Zilla Parishat Chairman Akepati Amarnatha Reddy that started the trek after offering prayers at Tallapaka on Friday afternoon, is expected to reach Tirumala by Monday afternoon, by covering nearly 110 km on foot. The devotees entered Chittoor district near Kukkaladoddi on the Tirupati-Kadapa highway on Sunday, where they will stay for the night. On Monday, they will start climbing the rocky terrain from Mamandur to reach Gogarbham area of Tirumala by afternoon. It is an annual practice for the devout to start with smaller numbers, which will swell as the yatra progresses. Nearly 2,000 devotees are expected this year. Mr. Amarnatha Reddy said he expected the TTD to develop the road at the earliest, so that they could climb the hills in a comfortable manner for their 20th year (2022).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/holy-trek-from-tallapaka-enters-chittoor-district/article37994190.ece

20 December 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Huge scope to save energy: official||By implementing basic energy conservation measures, Andhra Pradesh can reduce power consumption by at least 1,700 million units (MU) per annum and save over Rs. 1,000 crore, says A. Chandrasekhar Reddy, Chief Executive Officer of A.P. State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM). Speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of a seminar organised as a part of the Energy Conservation Week-2021, Mr. Chandrasekhar Reddy said, “The demand in the State for the year 2022-23 is 66,530 MUs. There is a potential to save 17,085 MUs. Even if we can save 10% of it, that is, 1,700 MUs, it makes a huge difference.” “The cooperation of key stakeholders, who include government departments, public and private organisations, and domestic users, is key to achieving the targeted savings,” he said. Keeping this in view, the governments had laid special focus on enhancing energy efficiency, he added. ‘Significant progress’ “A.P. has already made significant progress towards energy efficiency by achieving ultimate results in the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme, which is a market-based compliance mechanism,” Mr. Chandrasekhar Reddy said. “The State has covered 30 energy-intensive industries under PAT Cycle-2 in a span of three years under the supervision of the APSECM with a compliance of 0.295 Mtoe (Millions of tonnes of oil equivalent), resulting in energy savings (3,430 MU) worth about Rs. 2,185 crore as per the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE),” Mr. Chandrasekhar Reddy said. “The State has so far saved 5,600 MUs worth Rs. 3,800 crore by implementing schemes such as UJALA, PAT and LED street lighting,” he added. Besides, the State had also saved Rs. 2,500 crore by purchasing power in the spot market at cost-effective prices and implementing other best practices. ASCI report Citing the report of the Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI), Mr. Reddy said there was a huge scope to save 888 MUs worth Rs. 565 crore in the government buildings alone by implementing energy efficiency measures. Mr. Reddy said that the APSECM was focusing on reaching out to every individual and creating awareness on the need for energy conservation. “One need not compromise in consuming power when required, but it should not be wasted. It is the responsibility of every individual to strengthen the sector by way of energy conservation practices,” Mr. Reddy said. “In fact, energy conservation should be a part of our lives. Nature is the supreme in the universe and humans have to support and strengthen it by protecting the environment,” he said. “It takes about 800 grams of coal to generate one unit of power and 700 grams of carbon dioxide is generated while generate one unit of power,” he added. “Increasing demand for power is an indication of progressing economic activity,” he observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/huge-scope-to-save-energy-official/article37994197.ece
20 December 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||For the love of books||The premises of Sarvottama Grandhalayam run by the Andhra Pradesh Library Association (APLA) near Benz Circle in the city has turned into a book-lovers’ paradise. Throngs of bibliophiles, a majority of them youngsters, swarmed the place where a ‘Book Mela’ is being hosted by the association members. The three-day free distribution of books, starting from Saturday, evoked an overwhelming response with people of all age groups and sections visiting the place to pick two books of their choice from the ‘depository of knowledge’. The event was inaugurated by former national president of Indian Medical Association G. Samaram. Different genres of books on social issues, philosophy, spiritualism, art and architecture, comic books, poetry, classics, biographies and autobiographies, history, fairy tales, self-help, memoirs and science fiction are stacked neatly in rows of tables to be given to the visitors. Each visitor can pick any two books and books related to engineering, pharmacy and medicine courses are being given only to students who produce their identity cards. On Sunday, the place was chock-a-block. The organisers repeated their requests to people who had already made their selection of books, to leave the place and make way for those waiting for their turn to enter the room. Informing that more than 60,000 books were being distributed this year, Raavi Sarada, general secretary of the association, said on Sunday alone, nearly 3,800 people carried home some 8,400 books. This is the sixth year in a row that the association is organising the event. “Commemorating the World Book Day on April 23, we started free distribution of books in 2015 to promote book-reading, especially among the younger generation. The size of the crowds at the venue took me by surprise and I was convinced that all hope is not lost, even in this digital era as a good number of people still prefer the old-fashioned print,” said Ms. Sarada. Encouraged by the response, Ms. Sarada made it an annual event and scaled up the size of the collection of books distributed during the ‘mela’ days in the consecutive years. But the organisers realised that many book aficionados gave the event a miss to avoid the extreme summer heat of April. “To make it convenient for people to visit, we shifted the ‘book mela’ to December,” she explained. The Library Association also sends piles of books to its branches in all the 13 districts of the State to pave the way for quick spread of knowledge in all directions. It also introduced the concept of ‘Book Hundis’ to collect books from donors. “Like the temple hundis where devotees offer money, our hundis propel spread of knowledge,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/for-the-love-of-books/article37993756.ece
20 December 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Help save power, environment’||The AP State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM) Chief Executive Officer and AP Transco executive director D. Chandrasekhar Reddy has called upon students to devote at least five minutes of their time every day for the sake of environment. Mr. Chandrasekhar Reddy was speaking at a seminar on ‘Role of Energy Efficiency in Addressing Climate Change’ organised by the AP SECM and The Hindu in collaboration with V.R. Siddhartha Engineering College as part of the Energy Conservation Week-2021 here on Sunday. “Apart from concentration on education, sports and other activities youth should also dedicate at least five minutes in a day to think about what they can do for the environment and implementation of environment-friendly initiatives,” he said. One should be self-motivated to conserve power by following simple energy saving tips like avoiding wastage of power by switching off fans and lights when not in use and setting air-conditioner at 24 degrees Celsius, he said. “Even a small effort by every individual can have a major impact on the ecology. The need of the hour is adopting the latest technologies and practices to improve energy efficiency. Saving one unit of electricity reduces the emission of carbon dioxide by 700 gram. Energy efficiency alone could address 50% of the climate change issues,” he said. Through energy-efficiency services the State government saved about 5,600 million units of power, he said. VRSEC dean, Student Affairs, B. Panduranga Rao explained the energy-efficiency practices to the students. He said proper lighting and ventilation in a building would reduce the usage of electricity. Mr. Rao said that all the buildings, including colleges should have rainwater harvesting pits. He said rivers, canals and other water bodies should be protected from pollution.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/help-save-power-environment/article37994196.ece
20 December 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Jagan’s prohibition promise now a far cry’||TDP leader and former Excise Minister K.S. Jawahar has accused the State government of playing “dangerous games” with the health and lives of the people by adopting “illogical policies regarding manufacturing and sale of liquor.” Addressing the media on Sunday, Mr. Jawahar said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had come to power by promising total prohibition if voted to power. But the YSRCP government was treating Excise as the main source of revenue. Initially, the government increased liquor rates on the pretext that it would discourage drunkards, he said. “Now, it is bent on reducing the rates to boost sales and revenue,” he added. The opportunistic policies of the Chief Minister were exposed with frequent changes in his stand on liquor sales, he charged. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had made tall claims on prohibition in a phased manner and increased the rates of liquor gradually, Mr. Jawahar said. Terming as unfortunate the government’s calculation of earning Rs. 10 crore per hour, Rs. 245 crore per day and Rs. 7,600 crore per month out of liquor sales, Mr. Jawahar said the “quality brands” that were available during the TDP regime were being brought into State again. Why were they not allowed in the first place by the YSRCP government, he sought to know. With a change in the policy, the YSRCP government was, in a way, accepting that the previous government’s policy was good. “It is now clear that prohibition is beyond the capability of Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/jagans-prohibition-promise-now-a-far-cry/article37994202.ece

Over 13 cows had died allegedly due to lack of water and fodder at the ashram on December 17.

20 December 2021||VIRUDHUNAGAR,ANDHRA PRADESH||6 teams look out for former Minister||Six teams of the Virudhunagar district police have fanned out to different parts of the State and Bengaluru in search of former Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji in a cheating case. The police are trying to track Mr. Bhalaji, who is the AIADMK district secretary, with his mobile phone signal and those of his close associates. A police officer said the delay in getting the go-ahead for arresting Mr. Bhalaji, after the Madras High Court dismissed his anticipatory bail petition, gave him ample time to give the police the slip. Mr. Bhalaji, who had held the portfolio of Milk and Dairy Development, has been accused of having collected huge sums from several persons promising them jobs at Aavin. In a specific case, S. Ravindran, a Sattur resident, alleged that he had given Rs. 30 lakh to Mr. Bhalaji through the then AIADMK functionary, Vijayan Nallathambi, and a party worker, Mariappan, for placing his relative at Aavin between November 2020 and February 2021. Mr. Nallathambi filed a complaint, claiming that he had given around Rs. 1.60 crore to Mr. Bhalaji through his assistants, Baburaj, Balaraman and Muthupandi, for getting jobs for different persons. As the news of the dismissal of his anticipatory bail application reached him, Mr. Bhalaji, who was addressing a protest meeting at Virudhunagar on Friday, suddenly left the venue. “He changed three cars and took rural roads,” a police officer said. He made good of the opportunity and travelled some crucial distance without watched by the police. By the time the police launched the search, he had gone far away. However, the police ruled out the possibility of Mr. Bhalaji having flown abroad. “He is so familiar that he cannot get into any airport without being noticed,” the officer said. Plainclothesmen were also keeping a close watch at all airports in the State. Six teams, including two Deputy Superintendents of Police and six Inspectors, were conducting the search. The police want to arrest him before the Supreme Court takes up his anticipatory bail application.  A police officer said the delay in getting the go-ahead for arresting former Minister K.T.

The lowest temperature recorded in January, at Chintapalli, is: 0° degree Celsius on January 6, 1992, 1° C on January 5, 1999, January 17, 2003 and January 15, 2012, and 1.5° C on January 3 and 4, 2008. The temperatures on all these occasions at Lambasingi are estimated to be sub-zero. While tourists coming on short trips are enjoying the chilly weather, the local people are finding it hard to perform their daily chores in the biting cold. “The sun can be seen up in the sky only after 9 a.m. and goes down by 4 p.m. in winter. We can’t use hot water for every need, and touching normal water is like putting our hand in the freezer,” says R.V. Ramanamma, a teacher at Chowdupalli school of Chintapalli mandal. “The low temperatures in the Agency areas of Visakhapatnam is a common feature every year. The dry and cold northerly winds coming from the Himalayas and north India are sweeping across the country, including Andhra Pradesh and Telangana States, the drop in temperature with increasing height, and radiation cooling effect during nights are the reasons for the dip in temperatures,” says P.V. Rama Rao, a retired Director of the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Meanwhile, the IMD has reported that the minimum temperatures are likely to be 1 to 2° Celsius below the normal across Andhra Pradesh till December 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/agency-in-grip-of-biting-cold/article37994207.ece

20 December 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||When Maoists had to beat a hasty retreat from AOB||The year 2021 has been the worst for the banned CPI(Maoist) ever since it has started extending its reach in the Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) region early in the 1980s. Compared with the year 2016, when it had lost over 30 cadres and a few key leaders in the Ramaguda encounter, the movement has suffered a number of setbacks this year, which include the death of key leaders, surrenders, and arrests. The surrenders have exposed their vulnerability, the deepening divide between the tribal and non-tribal leadership, and the growing disillusionment among the cadres. The documents seized from the sites of encounter and from the arrested leaders suggest that for the first time since the 1980s, the Maoists are on the run from the AOB region. Key leaders such Aruna, Gajarla Ravi alias Uday, and Kakuri Pandana alias Jagan have fled the region to take shelter in the Dandakaranya region. As a result, the responsibility of taking forward the movement has been left to a couple of ACM-rank cadre such as Kora Nageswara Rao and Ashok. The death of Central Committee member Akkiraju Haragopal alias Ramakrishna alias RK due to illness in October this year was a big blow to the movement. His death created a leadership void, as he was the last of the leaders who had commanded considerable respect from the tribal people. The surrender of senior leaders Muttannagari Jalandhar Reddy alias Krishna, Chikkudu Chinna Rao alias Sudheer, and others such as Sreenu and Swarna was a big blow to the movement in the AOB region, said Superintendent of Police, Visakhapatnam, B. Krishna Rao. Deepening divide Sudheer, at the time of his surrender, had not minced words while explaining the growing discord between the tribal and non-tribal leaders, and the high-handedness of the non-tribal leaders. “In all, about 12 to 13 leaders have surrendered this year,” DIG, Visakhapatnam Range, L.K.V. Ranga Rao, said. The District Police were also successful in arresting about 14 to 15 key members this year, who included Rame and Devi. They apart, the Odisha police had arrested Dubashi Shankar alias Mahender, a key member of the Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee (AOBSZC). “The number of arrests by both A.P. and Odisha in the AOB region could be close to 30,” said a senior officer from the Intelligence wing (Extremism). Teegalametta encounter Post the encounter at Ramaguda in which 31 Maoist had been killed and the entire MKVB division was almost wiped out, the encounter at Teegalametta in Koyyuru in June this year was the biggest in the AOB region. Six Maoists were killed in the encounter by the Greyhounds, who included a few key operatives such as Ranadev alias Arjun (DCM), Sande Gangiah alias Ashok (DCM), and Santu Nachike (ACM). There were more than five exchanges of fire in the forested areas of the AOB. With the security forces making deep inroads into the Maoist strongholds, the Left Wing Extremists (LWEs) were forced to flee to the safer zones in Dandakaranya. Eroding support base “But now, the movement is at the low ebb in the AOB region. There is no fresh recruitment. The tribal people are shunning the Maoists and are seeking development. The ‘Andhra Model’ of taking development to the doorstep of the tribal people is weaning them away from the Maoists. The LWEs are fast losing their base,” DGP Gautam Sawang had told The Hindu .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/when-maoists-had-to-beat-a-hasty-retreat-from-aob/article37994192.ece
20 December 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Govt. failed to implement prohibition’||Telugu Desam Party (TDP) Mahila Wing State president V. Anitha criticised the State government’s decision to rationalise VAT and additional excise duty on liquor. Alleging that the YSR Congress Party government has completely failed in implementing its promise on prohibition, she said that the government was extorting money from the poor and playing with their health by selling cheap and spurious liquor at higher prices. Addressing a press conference at the TDP office here on Sunday, Ms. Anitha said that last year Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had claimed that he has increased the prices of liquor to introduce total prohibition and keep it out of the reach of the common people. But, the fact was that the State Government has made crores of rupees through liquor sales, she said. She alleged that the government has fixed sales targets for the officials and the targets were reviewed by IAS officers from time to time. She also questioned the inability of the government in facilitating online payment at the wine shops. The hike in the price of liquor saw a steep increase in ID arrack consumption and ganja smuggling. She alleged that many people who had consumed liquor brands, sold by the government, have suffered severe health ailments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-failed-to-implement-prohibition/article37994223.ece

20 December 2021||Visakhapatnam,ANDHRA PRADESH||YSR Congress government responsible for shelving Amaravati ORR project, alleges TDP||The 189-km Outer Ring Road (ORR) in Amaravati, proposed by the Chandrababu Naidu government, could have ensured progress of the State but the YSR Congress Party government is responsible for shelving the project, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) spokesman K. Pattabhi Ram has said. Addressing a media conference here on Sunday, Mr. Pattabhi Ram referred to the fast-paced growth of Hyderabad after the construction of the ORR there. It was the vision of N. Chandrababu Naidu, as the then Chief Minister of combined A.P., was responsible for the rapid growth of Hyderabad over a short period of time, he said. He explained that post-bifurcation of the State, Mr. Naidu had envisioned the growth of Amaravati by the construction of an ORR connecting Vijayawada, Guntur and Tenali. He had strived to get funds to the tune of Rs. 17,761 crore for the project but now the YSR Congress Party government has told the Centre that the project was not required. Responding to the question raised by TDP member Kanakamedala Ravindra in the Rajya Sabha, Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari had replied that the State government has said that 90-km of bypass road was enough. Mr. Pattabhi Ram said that it was nothing but sacrificing the interests of the State. The outer ring road project was designed to connect 87 villages surrounding Krishna and Guntur districts. It was clearly mentioned in the project report that Rs. 4,000 crore would be required for acquisition of 3,404 hectares of land and the 189-km project was proposed to be completed in three phases. On March 14, 2016, the Central Government had declared that it was committed to the construction of the ORR. Mr. Nitin Gadkari had again said on March 5, 2020 that the State had written to the Centre that this project was not needed. Mr. Pattabhi Ram alleged that the Jagan Mohan Reddy government was responsible for the Lu Lu Group, Adani Data Centre and HSBC leaving Visakhapatnam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysr-congress-government-responsible-for-shelving-amaravati-orr-project-alleges-tdp/article37994222.ece

The arrest of Central Committee and Polit Bureau member Prashant Bose and the expelling of another Central Committee and Polit Bureau member Kobad Ghandy were being considered as huge setbacks. Prashant was arrested along with his wife Sheela Marandi, also a CC member. With the expulsion of ideologue Kobad, the ideology and purpose of the movement has come under scanner. The death of CC members such as RK and Haribhushan, who was the secretary of Telangana State Committee, are also being considered as setbacks. The killing of CC member Milind Teltumbe along with 25 others in the Gadchiroli encounter was a major blow. Milind Teltumbe was the head of the Maharashtra - Madhya Pradesh - Chhattisgarh region. He was entrusted with the task of reviving the movement in the tri-junction.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/on-the-back-foot-in-red-corridor-too/article37994193.ece

20 December 2021||VIZIANAGARAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Skill-oriented education system possible only with NEP-2020’||Vice-Chancellors of various universities and retired IAS officers strongly felt that the Indian education system should ensure the overall development of students while making them understand the importance of Indian culture, tradition and philosophy. They felt that speedy implementation of National Education Policy-2020 would provide skill-oriented education and enable youngsters to study the subjects of their interest. Various issues were deliberated upon on the second day of Vidya Bharati-Akhila Bharatiya Shiksha Samsthan’s Akhila Bharatiya Karyakarini Bhaitak, the national executive body meeting, at Pakalapati Sanyasi Raju school here on Sunday. Vidya Bharati, which provides education to 34,65,631 students through its 12,828 schools across India, is keen on immediate changes in the curriculum in educational institutions in tune with NEP-2021. All India president of Vidya Bharati Doosi Ramakrishna Rao took the opinions of the Central Tribal University Vice-Chancellor and member of NEP-2021 T.V. Kattimani, Tripura Central Tribal University Vice-Chancellor Ganga Prasad Prasian, former Andhra University vice-chancellor G. Nageswara Rao, former IAS officer C. Uma Maheswara Rao and others during the meeting. While lauding the NEP, they wanted the changes in the curriculum to be implemented from the academic year 2022-2023 so that youngsters would get a chance to choose their subjects of interest from other branches also. Dr. Kattimani reportedly told the meeting that a lot of exercise was done before finalising the draft of NEP. On behalf of the executive body, Mr. Ganga Prasad told The Hindu that necessary changes in the curriculum in all schools apart from Vidya Bharati educational institutions, was the need of the hour. He said that skill-oriented education would make children confident and self-reliant in future.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/skill-oriented-education-system-possible-only-with-nep-2020/article37994186.ece

20 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘All Omicron patients stable, symptoms mild’||Along with growing concerns over the newly-detected Omicron cases in the State, there is also curiosity tinged with anxiety regarding the different ways in which one may have contracted the coronavirus variant, the people they have come in contact with and especially, their health status. Director of Medical Education K. Ramesh Reddy said that health condition of all the patients with Omicron is stable and that they have only mild symptoms. However, senior doctors have stressed that it is imperative to maintain all COVID precautions since the variant might become virulent (severe) if it gets a chance to replicate. PHFI’s IIPH-Hyderabad director G.V.S. Murthy concurred, adding that most mutations occur when viruses pass through human beings repeatedly as they try to survive better by adapting to the human host. “When people do not protect themselves, mutation may become more serious. As of now, presentation of Omicron in people has been mild to moderate, and does not require hospitalisation. As with any COVID infection, it might become severe if a person has co-morbidities, or has high exposure to the virus or has not been vaccinated,” said Dr Murthy. Senior doctors have reiterated the importance of precautions such as wearing face masks, vaccination and avoiding mass gatherings to keep severe/ dangerous possibilities at bay. A total of 20 cases of the variant had been detected in the State till Sunday night, excluding a boy who was in transit and left for Kolkata, West Bengal. All of them were admitted to Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS), Gachibowli. Since the variant is new and being studied across the world, health condition of the patients at TIMS is being closely monitored. Healthcare workers have collected various details such as age, COVID vaccine doses, dates of vaccination, if there are experiencing any symptoms such as respiratory distress and fever, etc. Their vitals are checked regularly too. “None of them have respiratory disease. Symptomatic treatment is being provided to them. We are also focusing on containment of the variant,” said Dr Ramesh Reddy. Most patients are young, the maximum age being 40. Doctors said that the real virulence of Omicron will be known if people of various age groups, including the elderly, contract the variant/ State Health staff have been on the task of tracing all contacts of Omicron patients to contain the spread. However, the possibility of it spreading at a faster rate is not ruled out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/all-omicron-patients-stable-symptoms-mild/article37993991.ece
20 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||State seeks more changes in KRMB purview schedules||Telangana Government has sought more modifications in the gazette notification on the purview of the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB), this time asking for showing two components of Kalwakurthy Lift Irrigation Scheme as one since it is one project, and remove component 1.15 from Schedule 1 and 2. In a letter addressed to Chairman of the river board, M.P. Singh, Engineer-in-Chief (Irrigation-General) of Telangana C. Muralidhar pointed out that in Schedule 1 and 2 included in the gazette notification published on July 15, it was shown Kalwakurthy LIS pump house and other supplementary works as item 1.14 and Kalwakurthy LIS-Additional 15 tmcft pump house and other auxiliary works as item 1.15. However, the fact remained that Kalwakurthy LIS was not enhanced to utilise additional 15 tmc ft water against the original scope of the project but it was earmarked by Telangana government to commensurate with the ayacut envisaged by the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh Government. The fact was already clarified to the river board several times, including through a letter dated June 3, 2020. Requesting the board chairman to get the component 1.15 deleted in the two Schedules of the gazette notification, the ENC explained that Kalwakurthy LIS was taken up by the erstwhile AP government in December 1997 to irrigate 2.5 lakh acres in the erstwhile Mahabubnagar district by lifting 25 tmc ft water from Srisailam reservoir. Later the ayacut was increased to 3.65 lakh acres by issuing various GOs and Memos without increasing the water utilisation to commensurate with the ayacut. As part of re-engineering projects taken up by the Telangana government, the water requirement was enhanced from 25 tmc ft to 40 tmc ft in proportion to the ayacut increased by the erstwhile AP Government. Further, Telangana was also seeking for allocation out of 75% dependable flows before the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-II (Brijesh Kumar Tribunal). Explaining the facts in detail, Mr. Muralidhar wrote that the erstwhile Hyderabad State had contemplated construction of Upper Krishna Project extension, Bhima Project and Tungabhadra Left Bank Canal extension with provision to irrigate vast areas in old Mahabubnagar district by gravity with 174.30 tmc ft water utilisation. However, the erstwhile AP did not pursue those projects with the Centre and KWDT-I and the fact was also noted by KWDT-I. The erstwhile AP Government had sanctioned investigation for Kalwakurthy LIS following continuous agitations by farmers of the area in June 19784 and had given administrative nod for the project in May 2003. Later, the erstwhile AP Government had also enhanced the ayacut first to 3.4 lakh acres and later to 3.65 lakh acres without mentioning water requirement with analogy to use 1 tmc ft water to irrigate 10,000 acres ayacut. Accordingly, the Telangana Government had enhanced water utilisation from 25 tmc ft to 40 tmc ft to commensurate with the ayacut in September 2015 and in now way item 1.15 in the two Schedules was a separate project, the ENC said. Similarly, the water drawal level for Kalwakurthy LIS was put at 800.52 ft level of Srisailam since it is in-basin project and for Telugu Ganga, Handri-Neeva, Galeru-Nagari and Veligonda projects it was put at 885 ft level as they are outside basin projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-seeks-more-changes-in-krmb-purview-schedules/article37994010.ece
20 December 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||RGIA immigration officials sniff out ‘dubious’ travellers||Immigration officials of Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) have become too familiar in differentiating between passengers who genuinely travel and those who adopt various dubious methods of travel. A woman wearing a turmeric-laced cotton thread ( pasupu thadu ) around her neck as a symbol of her married status and clad in a simple old saree, and a man wearing old clothes and a pair of rubber slippers, are a sure-shot find of those travelling on suspected documents. People travelling to the Gulf on forged visas have been significant and continuously worrisome, a senior immigration official said. The recent detention of 44 women who were set to board a flight to Kuwait, at RGIA, has once again proved that fraudulent travel agents from across the country have made Hyderabad their main base to traffic people, especially women to Gulf countries. The agents involved in trafficking people to various countries for ‘cheap labour’ are mostly from Mumbai with a vast and well-oiled network across the country. The agents in connivance with ‘khaleefs’, in common terms employers, apply for visit visas and later, forge them as employment visas, before handing over passports and tickets to the victims. The agent charges at least Rs. 50,000 per person; the amount varies from country [in which work is sought] to country. “They travel to other countries on visit visa for work purpose. However, a large number of passengers, the majority of them being women, won’t be aware of the fraud and become illegal immigrants there,” he said on condition of anonymity. He added that each day, hundreds of passengers travel on forged visas, but their current mechanism doesn’t allow them to verify every ‘suspicious’ passenger. “Moreover, the passengers are let off on humanitarian grounds too,” the officer said. Daily wage earners, in particular, are being trafficked to Dubai, Kuwait, Qatar and other Gulf countries with the promise of hefty wages. Most of them hail from northern districts of Telangana, Godavari and Rayalaseema districts in Andhra Pradesh, and a large group from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The entire fraud is to avoid paying the security deposit to the Protector of Emigrants, which the employer must deposit with the Indian Embassies or High Commissions in the respective countries.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rgia-immigration-officials-sniff-out-dubious-travellers/article37993999.ece

The CJI, in the same breath, also flagged the urgent need for introduction of practical courses, which would allow law students to interact with people and learn about their issues at the grassroots level. “Graduating students are accustomed to only considering legal problems in a theoretical manner. I also find that very few who graduate from National Law Schools are interested in joining litigation or taking up public causes, let alone practise at the district level,” he observed. Addressing graduates of NALSAR University of Law at its 18th annual convocation here on Sunday, Justice Ramana said his journey and the experiences, from appearing before a tahsildar in a tenancy matter, the tax authorities, stamp registrar, magistrate court and munsif court, and as a commissioner in the first assignment, shaped his understanding of the system and the people. “It seems there is a fascination to only practice before the Supreme Court and High Court while completely ignoring the importance of trial courts. To succeed in trial advocacy, one requires a separate skill set. Considering the highest pendency before trial courts, there is both demand and need for specialised lawyers,” he pointed out. On unravelling the truth and doing justice as the motto of law, Justice Ramana urged the graduates to “quest for truth in this world of illusions”. “Being the guardians of freedom, justice, equality and ethics, you cannot allow narrow and partisan views to dominate the nation’s thought. Students are known for their readiness to fight for all the right causes because their thoughts are pure and honest. They should be at the forefront to question injustice. We need leaders for tomorrow to rise from these grounds,” he said. Speaking of the importance of law, its application and the way law practitioners should conduct themselves, Justice Ramana, in his address, quoted philosophers Aristotle and John Rawls, Justice M.C. Chagla, and Telugu author Rachakonda Viswanatha Sastry. Justice Ramana, along with the University’s Chancellor and Telangana High Court Justice Satish Chandra Sharma, Vice-Chancellor Faizan Mustafa, Ministers A. Indrakaran Reddy and Ch. Malla Reddy, gave away the degrees and medals to the graduates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/urgent-need-for-practical-courses-for-law-students-cji/article37993990.ece
20 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||KCR abusing Centre because of Huzurabad defeat: Kishan||Union Minister for Tourism, Culture & North East States Development G. Kishan Reddy urged the State government to expedite paddy procurement for the season as another 14.25 lakh metric tonnes are yet to be procured with 30.50 lakh MTs done till date. “We have already extended the date till December 31 and if necessary, provide more time so that the paddy reaches the Food Corporation of India (FCI) centres here,” he said, on Sunday. “Instead of rushing his ministers to New Delhi and abusing the Centre day in and out, it will be better if Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao focuses on procurement for the season. The government here has signed an agreement for procurement of 27 lakh MTs and this was enhanced to 44.75 lakh MTs., including raw rice as well as boiled rice, on its request,” he told a press conference at the party office. The Minister said the Centre has not yet decided any procurement targets for the next agriculture season and it will be taken up between April-June, therefore, there is no point in taking up cudgels against the Centre based on “false assumptions” as there will be no winners in this attritional war, but farmers will suffer as a result, he said. “The problem is with the boiled rice and FCI has stocks up 20 lakh MTs. Not a single family in Telangana consumes this variety, and other States like Kerala and West Bengal have become self-sufficient, but we are ready to assist the government in finding a solution and in crop diversification. Let Mr. Rao call for a meeting of political parties and farmers organisations," he maintained. Mr. Reddy said the rice research institute here is working on a new variety seed which germinates faster and gives more yield. Technology upgrade of the rice mills too is necessary. "Is the TRS government ready with necessary infrastructure if raw rice is grown everywhere?," he questioned. The Chief Minister has begun to target the Centre as soon as his party faced a historic defeat in Huzurabad. Unable to digest this development, MR. Rao has been resorting to a vicious propaganda war against the BJP government at the Centre, not even sparing Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I have never seen a Chief Minister speaking against the Centre in such terms,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/expedite-procurement-of-paddy-telangana-told/article37993745.ece
20 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BIE on the back foot over Inter results||After record number of failures in the first year Inter exams this year, the government fears a repeat of student suicides, going by the outrage generated and three students already ending lives allegedly after failing in the first year exams. Only 49% students cleared the exams and this is the lowest ever since the formation of Telangana. The results also showed that there was no leniency in the valuation of the answer scripts going by the steep fall in the pass percentage. These students who entered college life for the first time had to come to terms with the examinations conducted in unusual circumstances – first taking the exam without attending a single class and later attempting a very different exam from what they had given earlier in 10th class. Online classes The conduct of exams itself was a controversy as the students had not attended a single class of first year and there was no assessment of their learning capabilities after they were forced to take online classes only due to the pandemic. But officials argued that the exams were necessary as the marks would be the base for final results in case the second year exams are not conducted due to unforeseen situation in the pandemic. However, there is a blind belief among the officials that online classes had indeed succeeded, but the results in the government colleges where the pass percentage is said to be astonishingly less showcase how the students failed to come to terms with technology teaching. The students who are now in second year were asked to take the exams in the normal mode and many believed the valuation wouldn’t be strict given predicament of the students. Sources in the BIE say out of the 2.35 lakh students who failed, at least 1.75 lakh are from the government colleges and some government colleges have registered less than 10% passes. The BIE has also not officially released the data of the government colleges this year unlike the previous years, fearing protests from parents and students. The biggest disadvantage these students face is that there is no second chance for them now and to go relatively stress-free to face the second year exams in April next year. BIE secretary Omer Jaleel said all those who failed have to write the backlogs along with second year exams, likely to be held in April 2022. This would be adding to the already stressed students, say the parents of those who failed. BIE officials have not discussed the issue with any parent group or lecturer organisations that accuse it of being insensitive and working in a shell, totally cut off from teachers and students, they add.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bie-on-the-back-foot-over-inter-results/article37994228.ece
20 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Uniform rules sought on money seized during polls||The Forum for Good Governance (FGG) has urged the Election Commission of India (ECI) to ensure that clear-cut guidelines are issued to for money seized during elections. The money seized should be deposited in the court and an FIR should also be filed, making the contesting candidate an accused, it said in a communication sent to the ECI. Forum secretary M. Padmanabha Reddy informed that there are no uniform procedures currently to deal with cases of distribution of money to the voters in the elections. Giving a specific example of the recently held bypoll to the Huzurabad assembly constituency which was won by the BJP, he said analysis by the FGG had shown that there were 94 cases where money was seized to the tune of Rs. 380 lakh. Yet, only in five of the 94 cases, an FIR was issued and in 89 others, no case was registered and money was returned to the person from whom it was seized. Even among the five cases, two were booked under the Gaming Act, leaving three cases only booked under Section 171 E (punishment for bribery) with amount involved being Rs. 18 lakh. Mr Reddy said no case was made out against the contesting candidates and the Telangana chief electoral officer’s statement that Rs. 3.5 crore was seized during the elections was far from the truth. He charged that about Rs. 6,000 was distributed for each vote and there were protests by those who did not receive the money or got less, he said. The secretary claimed that roughly Rs. 300 crore was distributed by all the political parties for purchasing voters. However, inaction by the election officials has put the entire election process in a ‘bad light’, the communication added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/uniform-rules-sought-on-poll-money-seized/article37993995.ece
20 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Insurance company told to compensate customer||More than six years after a complainant’s cashless hospitalisation treatment claim was wrongly rejected, the Telangana State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission came down heavily on an insurance company for its error and awarded Rs. 1 lakh as compensation. The Commission Bench comprising Justice M.S.K. Jaiswal and member Meena Ramanathan was dealing with a complaint filed by Shyam Murali, his wife K.N. Ratna and their son, a minor. The opposite parties were New India Assurance Company Limited (NIACL), MD India Healthcare Services (TPA) Private Limited, and Citibank. The complainant stated that on November 30, 2015, he suffered acute fibrile illness and was admitted in Care Hospital, Musheerabad. He produced the medi-claim card for cashless treatment, but after three days his claim was rejected. The TPA stated that cashless hospitalisation was denied on account of the policy status being cancelled. After being discharged, the complainant sought an explanation for the rejection from the opposite parties. In a response, they stated that the cancellation of his personal accident policy was mistaken for cancellation of the mediclaim policy, which led to the request being denied. They added the mediclaim policy was active, and that hospital expenses would be considered once a reimbursement claim is made. For their part, NIACL contended that they neither refused to pay treatment expenses, nor repudiated the claim, and added that they were waiting for documents such as medical bills, receipts and discharge summary to be submitted to them. While the TPA did not file a written version, Citibank stated that the complaint against them be dismissed since no allegation was made against them. Taking the evidence and arguments placed on record into consideration, the Commission stated that the complainant had to “suffer undue anguish and humiliation as the insurance cover was wrongfully deprived by” NIACL and the TPA. “Denying such a facility to which the complainant is entitled to amounts to deficiency whether it be due to any inadvertent mistake or otherwise,” the Commission, in its order, stated. While describing the complainant’s claim of Rs. 43 lakh towards compensation as “exaggerated”, the Commission maintained NIACL and TPA “failed to provide the complainants with necessary security despite having the coverage of cashless facility and for the ignominy suffered, the complainants should be reasonably compensated.” The Commission directed NIACL to pay Rs. 1 lakh compensation within two months, and complainant to submit his claim form.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/insurance-company-told-to-compensate-customer/article37994232.ece
20 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Land acquisition for Gouravelli project almost over||Finally, land acquisition for Gouravelli project located in Akkannapet mandal of Siddipet district is nearing completion. Majority of farmers have sold their land to the Telangana government at a consent price of Rs. 15 lakh per acre, the highest price officially offered, under the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme (KLIS). Land acquisition for the project started as early as 2008 during the tenure of the late Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. In the first phase, as much as 1,923.12 acres was acquired by the government for construction of 1.4 tmc ft capacity Gouravelli reservoir, as part of Jala Yagnam in 2008-09. However, like all other irrigation projects, this one also faced hurdles and was set aside. As part of redesigning of projects by the TRS government after it came to power in 2014, the project capacity was increased to 8.2 tmc ft. Hence, an additional land of 1,993.87 acres was required by the government and a notification was issued in this regard. But, farmers from about 272 acres did not want to sell their land to the government demanding higher compensation. And they even approached the High Court. On several occasions, they had stopped the works and filed complaints with officials alleging that works were progressing without their consent. Before jumping into politics, former Collector of Siddipet and present MLC P. Venkatrami Reddy addressed the issue by convincing farmers to sell their land and made them agree for a price of Rs. 15 lakh per acre. He had even promised Rs. 6 lakh for those who have crossed the age of 18 years. On Saturday, Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) of Husnabad presented a list of those who crossed the prescribed age limit and pasted a copy in the panchayat limits. “Here is the list of 324 people who crossed the age of 18 years between 01-01-2015 and 15-10-2021 at Gudatipally, Tenugupally and Somaji Tanda. The list is being pasted at the panchayat office. If anyone eligible finds his name missing, he can approach the mandal revenue officer at Akkannapet and submit a representation,” read the notice by RDO. “Except around 100 acres, the entire land acquisition process is complete. Officials have also issued a list of those who are above 18 years. However, regarding this, no GO has been issued. MLA V. Satish Kumar has promised double bedroom houses also, but we cannot trust anyone till we get them,” Sarpanch Baddam Raji Reddy said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/land-acquisition-for-gouravelli-project-almost-over/article37994234.ece

TSTDJAC chairman Shaik Salauddin said, “Drivers have to fork out for petrol, insurance, car repairs, and loan repayments out of their own pockets.” He claimed that cab aggregators have been changing their incentive structure and that has led to a significant cut in drivers’ hourly rates. “The rising cost of fuel and dipping fare rates force drivers to take certain decisions, which may seem irresponsible and frivolous for the customer but at times, means a critical choice for the driver to save time and money,” he said, adding that it has become difficult for them to eke out a livelihood. Mr. Salauddin said that cancelling rides of female passengers may seem misogynistic, but claimed that some drivers have been falsely implicated in cases of harassment. “Though drivers’ ‘stories’ should not be considered true or be accepted on its face but on proper scrutiny, it was found that these incidents and circumstances have actually happened to them,” he stated. “In most airports, parking fee for commercial vehicles is high. A few drivers take month-long passes to operate exclusively, and this puts them in competition with other drivers who are on the lookout to solicit passengers searching for a ride after arrival. This creates issues for customers looking for rides to and from airports.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cab-drivers-jac-defends-cancellation/article37994005.ece

Kishan Reddy questioning his knowledge about agriculture and asking him whether he had ever practised farming by terming him as a person who does not know much about agriculture ( eddu, evsam teluvanodu ). In response to such taunts by TRS leaders, Mr. Kishan Reddy had thrown a challenge, while speaking to mediapersons at Delhi, at TRS president and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao asking the latter whether he (KCR) was game for ploughing land with a pair of work-bullocks as he (Kishan Reddy) was ready for it!    Last week saw Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao nominating chairpersons for 10 State-level corporations. They included two leaders who were renominated to their posts after a gap at the end of the term. One of them Vanteru Pratap Reddy, who was renominated to forest development corporation, was a rival of Mr. Rao in two elections from Gajwel Assembly constituency. Mr. Reddy lost to Mr. Rao as TDP candidate in 2014 and again as Congress candidate in 2018. After his loss the second time, Mr. Reddy joined the TRS and was rewarded with chairmanship of a corporation for a two-year term which expired a few months ago. He has been retained in the post now.   The ongoing Hyderabad Book Fair was a windfall for book lovers in the city.

Accused officer So far, at least 10 people, including two doctors, have been arrested in the case pertaining to the theft of Rs. 30 crore from the office of a private firm in Sector 84 in August. IPS Dheeraj Setia is also accused of illegal gratification in return for a cover-up. Mr. Setia, who was posted as Gurugram Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) at the time of the heist, has already been suspended. Issuing the arrest warrant against Mr. Setia, Additional Sessions Judge Jasbir Singh said the “perusal of police file further suggests that investigation has stuck at Mr. Setia.” The investigating agency has neither probed the role of any junior officer nor any senior police officer of Mr. Setia. Mr. Singh added that the approach of the probe agency was “quite inert and soft”, which was nothing, but inaction, whether innocent or blameworthy. The court, in its eight-page order, said the perceived commitment and sincerity in carrying out the investigation qua the involvement of public persons, “is very well reflected and the same is commendable” but the needle of suspicion is also noticeable when it comes to the investigation of role of local police officers, including Mr. Setia. Destroy evidence It pointed out that the investigating agency, instead of taking quick and swift action as was done in the case of other accused, remained silent for around two weeks and gave sufficient time to Mr. Setia, which could be utilised by him in managing the things, including destroying the evidence. The order said the circumstances of the case suggested that Mr. Setia might have tried to cover up the theft with the active concurrence of his superior officers and with the active involvement, by way of arm twisting, of his junior Crime Branch officers. The court said the investigation should not halt at the DCP, and every bit should be done to nail the truth by conducting an “impartial, fearless and thorough investigation”. As per the prosecution, one of the prime accused in the case, a doctor, Suchender Jain Nawal, gave a bag containing 3 kg gold besides $1,35,000 to Mr. Setia to cover up the case. The police officer raised his hands when the matter became public returning the kickbacks, but still kept $2,000, for the help already extended in covering up the matter.  Every bit should be done to nail the truth by conducting an “impartial, fearless and thorough investigation District and Sessions court||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/stf-probe-into-role-of-police-in-gurugram-heist-quite-inert-soft/article37993901.ece
20 December 2021||JAIPUR,||Thar desert expanding fast with land degradation, finds study||Along with the gradual destruction of the Aravali ranges, the mighty Thar desert in western Rajasthan is expanding fast because of migration of people, changes in the rainfall pattern, spread of sand dunes and unscientific plantation drives. The degradation of land is posing a threat to the desert ecology, while the climate change has contributed to the spread of arid region. With these findings, a study on desertification of Thar region conducted by the Central University of Rajasthan has predicted that the sandstorms from the desert will travel as far as the National Capital Region (NCR) in the years to come. The sandstorms will become intense with the erosion of Aravali hills, which act as a ‘natural green wall’ between the desert and the plains. The study was undertaken as part of an assessment of the environmentally sensitive areas within the framework of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). The scientists associated with the project studied the climate and vegetation in Thar, which is the word’s ninth largest hot subtropical desert, to understand the desertification process. Loss of Aravalis Laxmi Kant Sharma of the Central University of Rajasthan’s School of Earth Sciences, who along with two other scientists undertook the study, told The Hindu that the loss of Aravali hills because of unchecked mining activities would result in the sandstorms travelling to NCR and Delhi. “The suspended particles from the arid region are contributing to air pollution in NCR. The sandstorms will hit this area because of the desert expanding in the eastern direction,” Dr. Sharma said. Since no mechanism has evolved so far to control the spread of sand dunes, the desertification will make an impact on the Aravali ranges’ northern part as an ecotonal area, acting as transition zone between the ecological systems. Dr. Sharma said the over-exploitation of resources had led to reduction in vegetation cover in the areas adjacent to the Thar desert, contributing to its expansion beyond four districts in western Rajasthan. The study, which focused on Barmer, Jaisalmer, Bikaner and Jodhpur districts covering more than 50% of Thar desert, found that Jodhpur, situated near the Aravali hills, had witnessed a slow speed of desertification. It also found that the vegetation cover and waterbodies had increased in the area in the last 46 years and the complex sand region had decreased by 4.98%. Dr. Sharma said new plans should be evolved for conservation of the Aravali ranges to stop the desertification towards eastern parts of the State. The study was published recently in the prestigious Journal of Arid Environments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/thar-desert-expanding-fast-with-land-degradation-finds-study/article37993915.ece

He asked the Government to provide a time frame within which recommendation for appointment of the chairperson of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission will be imparted. Expressing concern over “dithering stance @MamataOfficial over appointment of Chairman State Human Rights Commission” in a tweet, the Governor said, “must take note @IndiaNHRC finding that in state there is ‘law of ruler, not rule of law’ and endeavour to salvage situation.” A fact-finding committee, appointed by the National Human Rights Commission, on alleged post-poll violence in the State, had in July said the situation in West Bengal was a “manifestation of law of the ruler instead of rule of law”. The NHRC panel was constituted following an order by a five-judge Bench of the Calcutta High Court. The State Government has sought appointment of retired IPS officer Naparajit Mukherjee, a member of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission, as the acting chairperson of the body. In a communication to the Government, the Governor said the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, provides that a State commission shall consist of a chairperson who has been a Chief Justice or a Judge of a High Court, while one member would be a former Judge of a High Court or a District Judge in the State and one from amongst persons having knowledge of matters relating to human rights. Of all the three members, including the chairperson, two are drawn from the judiciary or with judicial background, Mr. Dhankhar said. Sole member “The situation as reflected is that the present chairperson demits office on December 20, 2021, and this leaves the commission with sole member - Shri Naparajit Mukherjee”, he said, adding that the commission thus will be without any member drawn from the judiciary or with judicial background, The Governor also claimed that the State Government was in the know right from the time Justice (retd) Girish Chandra Gupta took charge of the office that the post of the State’s human rights commission chairperson will fall vacant on December 20.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/governor-raises-concern-over-bengal-govts-dithering-stance/article37994091.ece

20 December 2021||lucknow,||Yogi getting my telephones tapped: Akhilesh||Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday accused Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of getting his telephones tapped and listening to the conversations every evening. Interacting with reporters a day after some SP leaders’ offices and residences were raided by the Income Tax Department, Mr. Yadav claimed the BJP was wary of its impending defeat in the upcoming assembly polls. The BJP government would be increasingly misusing various enforcement agencies to persecute his party's leaders in the coming days, he alleged. “All our telephonic conversations have been heard. This '’nupyogi’ Chief Minister himself listens to the recordings of some people every evening,” the Samajwadi Party chief alleged. He also asked reporters to “remain alert, if you are speaking to me”. The Yogi Adityanath government is running a WhatsApp University in the State, Mr. Yadav said derisively. The entire country knows that whenever the BJP is about to lose an election in any State, the “frequency of the misuse” of various enforcement agencies by the BJP rises, the former Chief Minister claimed. “The BJP is following the Congress' way. Like the Congress, it is rearing to use the Central agencies to instil fear (in rival political parties),” Mr. Yadav said. Meanwhile, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, when asked about the IT department raids against Samajwadi Party leaders, said, “I cannot comment on this, but the Government misuses the agencies. But, this was in my own case.” “This is the Government's way to harass the opposition leaders. They use agencies to do so. It's nothing new, we are seeing this for the past seven years.” About the phone tapping allegation, she said, “What is the job of a Government? To listen to the problems of the public, understand them and stop atrocities. Instead, this Government is tapping phones of the opposition.” According to SP sources, the IT department searches were conducted on Saturday at the residences of party spokesperson Rajiv Rai in Mau, Jainendra Yadav, who was the OSD when Akhilesh Yadav was the Chief Minister, in Vinay Khand at Gomti Nagar in Lucknow, businessman Rahul Bhasin in Lucknow and of contractor Manoj Yadav in Mainpuri. IT officials did not comment on the searches. SP spokesperson Rajiv Rai has alleged that the searches were “politically motivated”. Mr. Yadav said, “Seeing the atmosphere in the State, I can say the Yogi Government will not last. People have made up their minds for a 'yogya' (able) government. No government could be more 'unupyogi' (useless) than this. It has ruined Uttar Pradesh.” He also claimed the recent visits of Chief Ministers and Deputy Chief Ministers of the 12 BJP-ruled States to various places in Uttar Pradesh, including Varanasi and Ayodhya, was due to the saffron party's “fear of an impending defeat in the upcoming Assembly elections”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/yogi-getting-my-telephones-tapped-akhilesh/article37994093.ece
20 December 2021||MYSURU,||Excess rain affects bird migration to Karnataka||Heavy rains across Karnataka during October and November this year have affected the winter migration of birds that otherwise used to flock in large numbers and roost in the water bodies of the State before flying out again during the onset of summer. The rains during the two months were the highest in the last 50 years and helped fill up the reservoirs and water bodies. But not all species of birds prefer a habitat replete with water except those that tend to swim or dabble like ducks. “We are witnessing a dispersal of bird population and the groups have scattered to different places in search of a more suitable habitat mainly marshy lands. Hence the bird count is low in the lakes that are full to the brim during this season,” said K. Manu, an ornithologist with more than 30 years of field experience. The winter migration normally commences in October and peaks during December-January. “But we are yet to see the avian beauties from Eurasian region even as late as in the third week of December,” said D. Rajkumar of Wildlife Conservation Foundation. The bar-headed Geese, which flies across the Himalayas from southern China and Mongolia, are yet to be sighted in large numbers either in Hadinaru near Nanjangud or Sira in Tumakuru. These birds tend to have a stopover in the wetlands around Vijayapura and the backwaters of Ghataprabha before heading towards southern parts of Karnataka. Teals, pin-tailed ducks, Gargini, Coot, Sandpipers, common pochards are a few other species that roost in State during winter. A majority of the winter migratory birds are waders and prefer the shallow and stagnant waters of a lake with hydrophytes or vegetation that draw insects and facilitate larvae formation. A stagnant and shallow pool provides a rich source of food for wading birds. But heavy rains and continuous inflow of water into lakes do not allow for their formation and this will benefit only the fish-eating birds, according to the bird watchers. Another scenario common across the State was the so-called lake development projects and use of excavators during desilting exercise which was forcing the birds to abandon such habitats. Mr. Rajkumar added that dredging results in disturbance of the shoreline and creation of artificial depth to hold more water, which dissuades the long-legged birds from settling in such aquatic systems.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/excess-rain-affects-bird-migration-to-karnataka/article37993571.ece
20 December 2021||New Delhi,||Capital losing its trees to concretisation, rule violation||Despite standing guidelines and rules banning concretisation around trees in the Capital, callous civil works undertaken by the authorities have caused extensive damage to several trees on the pavements of Delhi. One such activity of indiscriminate concretisation around trees in Vikas Marg area was brought up by environmentalists before the Delhi High Court, prompting it to issue contempt notices to the Delhi Government and other local bodies earlier this month. Another petition was filed before the High Court by environmental activist Bhavreen Kandhari over the concretisation around 549 trees on the streets of Vasant Vihar, which is under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department. The High Court, noting that “preservation of fully grown trees is an absolute necessity especially because compensatory afforestation can never replace the lost green cover of a neighbourhood”, had directed the authorities to take appropriate action. It had also observed that “compensatory afforestation ordinarily happens along the borders of NCT of Delhi, which would have no effect whatsoever on the affected neighbourhood, for almost two generations”. Following the court’s warning, the authorities have acted swiftly and are in the process of removing concrete from around the affected trees in Vasant Vihar. However, environmental activists say this is an endemic problem across the city that needs better deterrence. Laws and regulations Advocate Aditya N. Prasad, who represented both petitioners — Neeraj Sharma (Vikas Marg case) and Ms. Kandhari — said there are a plethora of orders from the courts to keep areas around the tree trunk concrete-free. He referred to the Delhi Preservation of Tree Act 1994, which puts restrictions on felling and removal of trees without the permission of the Tree Officer, Department of Forests. The law also made illegal tree felling a punishable offence with up to one-year imprisonment. In 2000, the Urban Greening Guidelines came, which required one to leave six inches of areas un-cemented around the trunk of trees. This was increased by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2013, when it ordered that the space around trees must be concrete-free by one metre. Why leave open space? C.R. Babu, professor emeritus at the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystem in Delhi University, said, “we need open space around a tree’s base, so that it is able to take nutrients, conserve the nutrients, [undergo] good aeration — all of which contribute to the good health of the trees.” If the roots are not given breathing space, they will decay and easily get infested, Mr. Babu explained. “The nutrients around the trees need to be recycled, but if they get washed away due to concretisation, the trees will get nothing,” Mr. Babu said, adding “therefore, even one metre in cases is not adequate”. “If we can have a two-metre wide opening around the roots of trees, that would promote the health of the trees,” Mr. Babu said, stressing further that there is a direct correlation between the longevity of trees and the open space around their roots. Value of a tree In 1979, a study published in the Indian Biologist by T.M. Das of Calcutta University pegged the value of a tree during its lifespan of 50 years at Rs. 15,70,000, calculated at the market rate that prevailed in 1979. Over three decades later, Mr. Das re-evaluated all the calculations of the original papers as per the current market rate. For the study, a ‘Pipul’ tree, which grows luxuriantly with an average weightage of 6 tonnes was chosen. Mr. Das calculated the various environmental benefits received during its 50 years of growth at Rs. 3.55 crore. This estimation is also applicable to other tree species with identical tonnage, the study said. Better implementation of rules While there is no dearth of rules and court orders banning concretisation around the trunk of trees, environment activist Ms. Kandhari said the problem arises when it comes to their implementation. “Firstly, why is the concretisation being allowed, whether it is residential, or footpath,” Ms. Bandhari asked. She said sensitisation of the officials of local bodies such as the Public Works Department, municipal corporations, and police was important. “Secondly, they have to enforce the 2013 order of the NGT. If they are enforcing that, no trees will get concretised. And where the orders are violated, there should be strict action, so that people stop doing that.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/capital-losing-its-trees-to-concretisation-rule-violation/article37993898.ece
20 December 2021||New Delhi,||The Capital’s tryst with dengue||As cases of dengue in the Capital witness a dip in numbers with temperatures dropping, this season’s caseload and death toll (till December 11) — which stands at 9,260 and 15 respectively — remains the highest since 2015 when the city recorded 15,867 cases and 60 deaths. While the official death toll for the current season stands at 15, a senior official at the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), which is also the nodal agency for data collection, confirmed, “There are more deaths due to dengue, and they are yet to be declared because these cases are under investigation.” On November 7, The Hindu reported that three dengue deaths — according to the documents accessed — at the Centre-run Safdarjung Hospital were not reported by the civic authorities. Previously, a senior official at the hospital had confirmed that “at least one death of a Delhi resident” due to the vector-borne disease was recorded at the hospital. According to a civic report, as of December 11, none of the 15 victims was admitted to Safdarjung Hospital. Awareness campaigns While the Delhi Government’s 10-week-long anti-dengue initiative — titled ‘10 Hafte 10 Baje 10 Minute’ which first kicked off in 2019 — was aimed at building awareness among people and to help prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases, doctors in the city said that the prolonged rain this season was among the “prime reasons” for the increase caseload this year. Delhi’s three municipal corporations — North, South and East — had also announced heightened sanitation and fogging drives as a response to the surge in cases. However, according to Sanjay Mintoo, nodal officer for vector-borne diseases at the city’s Kasturba Hospital, awareness campaigns serve as a “larger solution”. “Dengue mosquitoes breed in clean water, so sanitation drives do not serve as a complete solution. It is unlikely that authorities can enter every household and check stagnant water where breeding is possible. That is why creating awareness and public education can help solve the spread of the disease because it is the people who need to keep a watch within their households,” said Mr. Mintoo. According to S.P. Byotra, senior consultant and chairman of the Department of Medicine at Ganga Ram Hospital, the vector-borne disease (dengue) has a cyclic trend which can lead to an increased surge in cases “every three to four years”. He added, “The dengue virus has four serotypes, and an infected person is immune to the serotype that he or she is infected with after they recover. But that does not mean that they are immune to the other serotypes. Apart from the rain, there is a high possibility that the increased breeding this season brought along a spread of multiple variants which was very rare to come across in the last two years.” This season, north Delhi recorded the highest number of cases at 2,587, followed by south Delhi with 2,493 cases and east Delhi with 1,090 cases. More than half of Delhi’s dengue cases for this season were recorded in November — 6,739 cases; prior to which the caseload for the season stood at 1,537. ‘Backlog cases’ A senior SDMC official said the increased caseload in November included “backlog cases from hospitals” which came to light only after vector-borne diseases were notified by the Delhi Government under the Epidemic Diseases Act. “During the early stages of this year’s COVID-19 lockdown, our officials did not get easy access to check smaller pockets where mosquito breeding was taking place. Another reason for the spike was also that two to three serotypes of the virus were circulating simultaneously, which led to more cross infections and serious cases. Many patients from the NCR region had also come to Delhi for treatment which added to the patient load at the hospitals,” the senior SDMC official said. “I will agree to some extent that case reporting in the country is not regular unless the situation intensifies. The dengue deaths are possibly higher than what the official count states; there are smaller pockets in the city where cases are not recorded regularly and I feel there is under-reporting,” said Dr. Byotra. With the Capital recording 285 cases of dengue and no deaths over the past week (till December 11), according to a civic report, doctors and civic body officials stated that cases will further dip as low temperatures are not suitable for mosquito breeding. However, Mr. Mintoo emphasised that creating public awareness will serve “as the core solution” to prevent similar outbreaks in the future. He added, “The Government and civic authorities have a proper system in place, and despite a few shortcomings, they are able to execute their duties to a certain extent. But unless the public is not educated, nothing much will change. Something as small as ensuring that there is no water collection in cooler trays and small pots goes a long way in preventing mosquito breeding.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/the-capitals-tryst-with-dengue/article37993909.ece
20 December 2021||New Delhi,||Civic bodies helping ‘parking mafia’: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday alleged that the BJP-governed municipal corporations have sold 13 multilevel parking complexes at throwaway prices to the “parking mafia”. AAP leader Atishi said that to help the “parking mafia”, the corporations have also waived property tax of these parking complexes incurring losses in crores. She said that over Rs. 30 crore could have come to the exchequer if these 13 parking lots were sold properly. Source of revenue “A few days ago, we observed that the 13 multilevel parking complexes were auctioned off to private mafia at odd prices below the market rates. Clearly, they [BJP] are acting out of fear and haste as they are well aware that they are going to be ousted from power in the municipal polls. Hence, they have decided to sell as many assets of the corporations to private players as they can,” Ms. Atishi said. “One of the major revenue sources for the municipal corporations is through parking and it plays a significant role in its budget. However, every kind of illegality and malpractice has plagued Delhi’s parking policy. This is why the income which should be generated through parking for all three civic bodies, doesn’t reach the corporations’ vault. The money which should be put towards paying the workers’ salaries goes into the pockets of the BJP leaders,” she said. This is why the distressed workers under the corporations have been going on strikes every two-three months, the AAP leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/civic-bodies-helping-parking-mafia-aap/article37993899.ece

The data, till October 15, showed that cases of snatching have increased. While six cases were reported last year, 12 cases were lodged this year. Kidnapping cases have also seen a rise with seven such cases being reported this year, compared to two cases recorded last year. Other thefts The data also showed that apart from motor vehicle and house theft, other theft cases have also recorded a rise from 44 to 68 cases. While there were two murder cases this year, compared to one reported last year, only one rape incident was registered this year, similar to last year. Meanwhile, the total IPC crimes committed across police stations have also increased from 75 to 118 cases this year, the data further showed. However, the percentage of cases solved has seen an increase. According to the data, 550 cases were solved this year whereas 485 were solved last year. Sensitive zones According to a senior officer, the Delhi police in coordination with the Railway Protection Force have been monitoring all the sensitive zones across the railway stations which are prone to snatching or robberies. “We have round-the-clock security arrangements at every platform and on station premises due to which the crime rates across railway stations have decreased to a great extent,” he said. The officer also said that police personnel have been trained to identify persons who enter railway stations without tickets and also deploy officers in trains to keep a tab on suspicious persons.

20 December 2021||New Delhi,||Man arrested for duping people with fake notes||A 30-year-old man was arrested for allegedly cheating several people on the pretext of exchanging fake high-value foreign currency notes with those of Indian currency. He used to lure them to buy the amount at half the price and then flee with the money in Shahdara district, the police said. DCP (Shahdara) R. Sathiyasundaram said the case came to the fore when around 7.40 p.m., they heard a commotion at Pushta Road. Later, the police apprehended the accused, Mohammed Alamin, 30. The complainant approached the police and said that he was an e-rickshaw driver and had met the accused on December 15 at Pushta Road. The complainant alleged that the accused had befriended him and told him that he had found Dirham currency notes outside his house. He said that since he was unable to sell them to anyone he would sell them to the victim for half the price which would be profitable to him. He allegedly lured him to believe that the currency was of a high value of Rs. 2 lakh. The complainant believed him and arranged for Rs. 10,000. The DCP said the complainant paid the accused Rs. 10,000. “When the complainant told the accused that he wanted to check the notes, the accused tried to flee with the money,” the DCP said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/man-arrested-for-duping-people-with-fake-notes/article37993893.ece

20 December 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi records 107 new cases, highest in over five months||A total of 107 new COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 24 hours — the highest in close to six months — taking the total number of cases to 14,42,197, as per a bulletin released by the Delhi Government on Sunday. On June 25, the city had recorded 115 cases. A total of 61,905 tests were conducted in a day and the test positivity rate was 0.17%, which is also the highest in more than five months, the bulletin said. There were no COVID-19-related deaths in 24 hours and the total number of fatalities stood at 25,101. Of the total cases, 14,16,556 people have recovered and there are 540 active cases. Doctors continue strike More than 5,000 resident doctors of the Central Government-run Safdarjung Hospital, RML Hospital, and Lady Hardinge Medical College and the Delhi Government-run LNJP Hospital and GTB Hospital boycotted work for the third day on Sunday, except for COVID-19 duty, as a protest against the delay in PG NEET counselling, the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) said. “About 5,000 resident doctors boycotted all routine and emergency work, except for COVID-19 duties. The counselling for PG admission is still stuck,” Dr. Manish, president of FORDA, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/delhi-records-107-new-cases-highest-in-over-five-months/article37993904.ece
20 December 2021||Panna (M.P.),||Indian desert cat spotted in M.P.’s Panna Tiger Reserve||An Indian desert cat has been spotted for the first time in Madhya Pradesh’s Panna Tiger Reserve (PTR), a senior forest official claimed. “A tourist has shared the pictures taken by him of an Indian desert cat in the reserve's Akola buffer zone of the reserve recently during the night safari,” PTR’s field director Uttam Kumar Sharma said on Saturday. As the name suggests, this cat is found in deserts and can survive without water. The toes of the species have cushion like hair which help it balance the fluctuating desert temperatures, the official said. He said the presence of this wild cat was not reported in the PTR’s records earlier. “The name of the Indian desert cat was mentioned in old documents of the PTR, but the photographic presence of this species was not recorded earlier,” the official said. He said earlier, the presence of a desert cat was recorded in the State’s Nauradehi sanctuary. “We are looking for documents to ascertain where its presence was recorded earlier in Madhya Pradesh,” he said. The official also said the presence of the desert cat in the PTR indicates that the number of species of various wild animals is increasing in the reserve due to security being heightened in its forest areas. In August this year, a fishing cat, one of the endangered animals in India, was spotted in the PTR, State Government officials earlier said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/indian-desert-cat-spotted-in-mps-panna-tiger-reserve/article37994095.ece

20 December 2021||patna,||Young candidates sweep Bihar panchayat elections||The recently concluded three-tier panchayat polls in Bihar set many examples. The most noteworthy of them being nearly 90% of the newly-elected representatives were young new faces in the age group of 21-30 years. The State Election Commission, for the first time, had also used Biometric system, Electronic Voting Machines and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) machines to check vogus voting, rigging and other malpractices in counting of votes. “The interesting feature of this panchayat polls was that the people preferred to elect new faces in large number instead of old incumbents. Nearly 90% of the newly elected panchayat representatives are new faces and come from diverse backgrounds - from MBA degree holders to labourers to engineers to athletes”, State Election Commissioner Deepak Prasad told The Hindu . However, he added, the poll panel was yet to come out with the complete profile of the winning candidates and other datas of the polls. “But, very soon we’ll be able to compile the detail features of the polls and come out with it”, Mr. Prasad said. The 11-phase panchayat polls in Bihar were held from September 24 to December 12 for 2,55,000 posts in three-tier rural local bodies. “We voted in the panchayat poll this time to change our mukhia who was engaged only in minting money and taking cuts in welfare schemes meant for the villagers. We votes for a young face and made him win the poll”, said Ashok Kumar and his brother Vijay Kumar Singh from Bhojpur. The pre and post poll incidents of violence and killings were reported but they had no impact on the conduct of peaceful poll, said Mr. Prasad. Impressed with the manner in which panchayat polls were conducted in Bihar, Puducherry State Election Commissioner Roy P. Thomas visited Bihar and stayed in the State for six days to study the method of using Biometric and EVMs in panchayat polls. “Bihar has set an example in conducting panchayat poll by using digital technology. The local bodies election in Puducherry is going to be conducted soon and we’re exploring the possibility of using biometric systems for the voters authentication and other digital methods in counting”, said Mr. Thomas. Election for over 8,300 rural panchayats and 143urban bodies were held for the posts of mukhias, sarpanchs, zila parishad members, panchayat samiti members and ward members. The term of the panchayat bodies mandated for local governance, though, had expired on June 15 this year but the polls were not held due to COVID-19 pandemic. The State Government, later, had brought an ordinance to run the panchayat bodies through advisory committees. The youngest mukhia elected in the panchayat polls this time is Anushka Kumari from Kushahar panchayat of Sheohar block in Sheohar district. A graduate from Bengaluru, Anushka said she fought the poll to “contest corruption at local level and myriad problems in villages”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/young-candidates-sweep-bihar-panchayat-elections/article37994094.ece
20 December 2021||Pune,||Shivaji statue vandalism: Shiv Sena, NCP hit out at Modi, Shah||A day after a statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji was allegedly desecrated in Bengaluru, the Shiv Sena launched protests across Maharashtra against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Government in Karnataka while calling for the resignation of Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) — the Sena’s ally in the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi government — joined in as well, with particularly intense protests being witnessed in Mumbai and Pune cities as activists from both parties raised slogans against Mr. Bommai and the Karnataka Government. Hitting out at the BJP leaders and their “acolytes” for remaining silent, Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not taking action against the Karnataka BJP’s leadership which permitted the desecration of the Shivaji statue to take place. “Chhatrapati Shivaji not only expressed the dream of Swarajya but made it come true. If the great king is being insulted in the land of a BJP government with its blessings, then why is the Prime Minister of the country silent? We are very angry about this affair yet we are expressing our anger in a restrained manner,” Mr. Sawant said. Calling the BJP’s top leaders ‘hypocrites’, Mr. Sawant pressed them to take action against Mr. Bommai by demanding the Karnataka CM’s resignation, else warned that the Sena’s ire would spill over in street agitations. “How dare Mr. Bommai dismiss this incident [statue vandalizing] as ‘trivial’…the Sena demands his immediate resignation,” said the Sena leader. Meanwhile, NCP party workers condemned the Bengaluru incident and protested against Home Minister Amit Shah’s visit to Pune, where the latter laid a foundation stone to a Shivaji statue in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). The NCP said that Mr. Shah and the BJP were merely using Chhatrapati Shivaji for ‘political convenience’ and chastised the Home Minister for refusing to condemn the Karnataka BJP government. Earlier in the day, NCP activists protested outside the PMC building holding placards, demanding that Mr. Shah turn back.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/shivaji-statue-vandalism-shiv-sena-ncp-hit-out-at-modi-shah/article37994097.ece

20 December 2021||HONG KONG,||Low turnout for Hong Kong ‘patriots’ polls||Low turnout and indifference among registered voters marked Hong Kong’s first elections since Beijing’s radical overhaul of the Special Administrative Region’s electoral system. Polling booths in the SAR on Sunday saw trickles of voters coming in through the day, but none of the long lines and intense campaigning that were a trademark of past elections in Hong Kong. As of Sunday evening, the turnout was down by more than 40% from the last election in 2016. Sunday’s polls to elect Hong Kong’s Legislative Council (LegCo) for the next four years were the first since Beijing passed legislation in March that gives it greater control. LegCo was expanded from 70 to 90 members, while the number of those directly elected was reduced from 35 to 20, thus giving voters less of a direct say in Hong Kong’s governance. Of the remaining 70, 40 are chosen by a new 1,200 member Election Committee while 30 are from what are called functional constituencies representing a range of industry, trade and other broadly pro-establishment interest groups. The other major change was the setting up of a candidate eligibility review committee to screen those running for office, part of Beijing’s move to ensure only “patriots” could govern Hong Kong. The changes, including the passing of new national security legislation last year, all but decimated Hong Kong’s once-vibrant pro-democracy camp, most of whose members were either arrested for their role in the 2019 protests, unable to contest, moved overseas, or simply gave up political life. ‘No real choice’ As of 8.30 p.m. on Sunday, two hours before polls closed, the turnout was 27.92%, on track to record the lowest figure since Hong Kong’s handover in 1997. According to government figures, 1.24 million people had cast their vote, down by 44% from what was seen at the same stage of polling in the last LegCo election in 2016. While a breakdown of voters by age wasn’t immediately available, the wide sense was that many young voters had stayed away. Mostly middle-aged and elderly voters were seen in two polling stations visited by The Hindu on Sunday. On the promenade abutting the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Park, one of the polling stations, two young registered voters said they would not vote because the polls were “fake” and there was “no real choice” among the candidates. Local newspapers quoted others who said they voted out of a sense of “civic duty” even if they were uninspired by the choices, which led to the turnout somewhat exceeding the worst expectations. The lack of enthusiasm was a sharp contrast from the district elections held in late 2019, in the immediate aftermath of the youth-driven protests calling for full democracy. The months-long protest movement brought millions to the streets and frequently descended into violence between protesters and the police. While Beijing blamed foreign forces for orchestrating the unrest, the pro-democracy opposition swept the district polls in late 2019 that were seen as a referendum on the protest movement. In a bid to boost turnout this year, authorities took the unprecedented step of making all public transport free on Sunday, although the move seemed to have backfired with packed trains and buses leading to crowds gathering at some of Hong Kong’s most popular public attractions, but not at the polling stations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/low-turnout-for-hong-kong-patriots-polls/article37993516.ece
20 December 2021||Khartoum,||Protests in Sudan mark uprising anniversary||Tens of thousands of Sudanese protesters rallied on Sunday to mark three years since the start of mass demonstrations that led to the ouster of strongman Omar al-Bashir, as fears mount for the democratic transition. Security forces fired tear gas at protesters in the capital Khartoum, chanting slogans against the current military chief, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who led a coup on October 25. “The people want the downfall of Burhan”, protesters shouted. The generals had initially detained civilian leader Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok for weeks under effective house arrest, but reinstated him on November 21. Mr. Hamdok, who has argued he wants to avoid bloodshed, warned late Saturday of “the country’s slide toward the abyss,” urging restraint from the protesters. Protest organisers have however vowed, in a key slogan, “No negotiation, no partnership and no legitimacy”. December 19 has a particular resonance in Sudanese history. Not only was it the day in 2018 when thousands launched mass protests that ended Bashir’s three decades in power, it was also the day in 1955 when Sudanese lawmakers declared independence from British colonial rule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/protests-in-sudan-mark-uprising-anniversary/article37993521.ece

It said the trove of confidential documents covering more than 1,300 reports of civilian casualties undercuts the government’s portrayal of a war fought with precision bombs. Pledges of transparency and accountability, it said, had regularly fallen short. “Not a single record provided includes a finding of wrongdoing or disciplinary action,” the paper reported.

The decision is a response to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, which forced London’s mayor Sadiq Khan to declare a “major incident” on Saturday in the British capital. The change, which takes effect on Sunday at midnight, means arrivals from Britain will have to observe a two-week quarantine regardless of whether they are vaccinated, said the country’s health agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). The U.K. is now considered a “variant zone” of COVID-19, a category reserved for nations where the risk is the highest. It reported over 12,000 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant on Sunday, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 37,101. Several other European countries, including France, have already taken steps to limit the entry of travellers from the U.K.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/germany-places-uk-on-high-risk-list/article37993517.ece

More than 3,00,000 people fled their homes and beachfront resorts as Typhoon Rai ravaged the southern and central regions of the archipelago. The storm knocked out communications and electricity in many areas, ripped off roofs, damaged hospitals, toppled concrete power poles and flooded villages. The toll was likely to rise as disaster agencies assessed the full extent of the storm’s aftermath across the vast archipelago.

20 December 2021||December 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Reality checks for the Opposition’s unity project||Ever since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept the 2019 Lok Sabha election for a second term in office, the nation has witnessed a great deal of churn in politics, both at the national and State levels. Many aspects concerning Indian politics have seen changes, and many previous concepts have been rendered obsolete, though leaders and parties still find it difficult to shake off their past attributes and beliefs. It is not that the nature of politics itself has changed, but mainstream parties — essentially those in the Opposition — are unable to decipher the nature of the changes taking place. The ground reality The Congress, for instance, is unable to shake off a belief that it is the obvious choice to lead any Opposition combination. While other parties might have accepted this in the past, increasingly, quite a few of them have made it clear that they do not any longer see the Congress as the lead player. However, to assume, therefore, that the party is in terminal decline would be a case of being unable to see the wood for the trees. For its part, the Congress still has a vote bank spread across different States in the country (totalling a little over 20). Excessive procrastination on future strategies is, however, sapping the vitals of the party. It has yet to produce an alternative model to reverse the current trend. The unpleasant truth (for the Opposition) is that since 2014, when the BJP captured power, they have been divided, weak and ineffectual. Lack of a proper strategy, together with unwillingness on the part of individual Opposition parties to make a realistic estimate of their strengths and weaknesses, accept the current reality, and demonstrate a willingness to support other Opposition parties and groups which may have somewhat greater acceptability, are the main reasons why the Opposition is in dire straits today. Of late, a measure of realism does seem to have crept into this debate, but not within the Opposition parties themselves. Individual parties are yet to make a realistic estimate of their strengths and weaknesses. What has also not been catered for is that many parties are little known outside their States. Consequently, despite all the current talk of Opposition unity, there is no common thread that binds them, other than a strong dislike of the policies and attitudes of the ruling party at the Centre. Of all the Opposition parties, it is the Congress, which perhaps, still has some acceptance across the nation. It has not, however, been able to convince other Opposition parties that, even though its influence today is limited to certain segments and territories, it still has an intrinsic ability to emerge as a coordinator of Opposition unity. While smaller Opposition parties are, perhaps, willing to acknowledge this, the bigger parties are unwilling to ascribe a leadership role to the Congress. More about the TMC This situation has existed for some time, but latterly, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader, Mamata Banerjee, has been openly ventilating the opinion that the Congress has become a moribund organisation. In the aftermath of a spectacular victory in the Bengal Assembly elections earlier this year, Ms. Banerjee appears to have taken upon herself the role of rallying the Opposition against the BJP, without formally announcing herself as its leader. While, there has been a great deal of praise and encomiums for the manner in which Ms. Banerjee defeated the BJP in West Bengal, there is little evidence that the Opposition is willing to unite under her umbrella. More problematic is that rather than emphasising Opposition unity, her attempts seem to be more directed at marginalising the Congress. The Opposition, thus, only seems more divided than before. The path for the UPA Instead of putting forward a shared story which the country could endorse as a counter to the BJP’s single point rhetoric, the Opposition today only looks confused. Moreover, all their differences are on public display today. With the TMC targeting the Congress, the latter has retaliated, accusing Ms. Banerjee of having a ‘fascistic mindset’ and being a ‘political opportunist’. The TMC’s tactics of poaching legislators from other parties, mainly the Congress, is not helping matters. This display of disunity among the Opposition has put into the shade what might have been a promising opening for Opposition unity initiated by Congress President, Sonia Gandhi very recently (December 14, 2021) — at which the Nationalist Congress Party, the CPI(M), the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the Shiv Sena and the National Conference were present, but not the TMC. On display today for one and all, is, therefore, Opposition disunity rather than Opposition unity. Unless the Opposition has a death wish as far as unity is concerned, it is, hence, imperative that each and every constituent part recognises the criticality of Opposition unity. What has to be kept in mind is that each constituent party has certain inherent strengths which contribute to the overall capability and strength of any union. Admittedly, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) is much weaker than what it was previously. The UPA ‘core’ which previously comprised the Congress, the CPI and CPI(M) and some other secular democratic parties has lost much of its elan since the first decade of this Century, but it is far from a liability as Mamata Banerjee seems to believe. It remains relevant, provided each constituent recognises what needs to be done — something on the lines of a modern day Common Minimum Programme. For a start, all Opposition parties included in this group must recognise that the balance of power has tilted very substantially in favour of the BJP, whatever be its shortcomings or the extent of unhappiness with some of its policies. It is possibly the only national level party which has an unchallenged leader. Its politics — which is a mixture of majoritarianism and hyper nationalism — has found ready acceptance among sizable sections of the populace, irrespective of whether this is best suited to today’s circumstances. In effect, the BJP has no peer competitor. This state of affairs may not be truly visible in the rear view mirror of politics to many of the Opposition parties, but it should induce a degree of sobriety when reflecting on how Opposition unity is to be achieved. To achieve the desired level of unity, and hope for success, the combined Opposition must not only admit to this reality but also to the fact that contemporary policies is not a zero-sum-game. The Congress, perhaps more than any other party in the Opposition, needs to avoid clinging to images of an earlier period and should ensure that the chasm between it and potential allies does not widen any further. This may need casting aside many past perceptions, as also clinging to impressions of a world that has since vanished. Other Opposition parties such as the TMC, must not overestimate their strength, merely because of achieving success in one or two States. Instead, they should work hard to assemble and strengthen alliance partnerships with a view to creating a strong phalanx against the BJP Towards a construct Conquering the BJP will not be an easy task. Any anti-BJP coalition will need the right set of partners — partners who can bring in additional votes and do not constitute a risk to Opposition unity. It would entail a liquidation of wrong beliefs and assumptions — an alliance that can stand up to any kind of ‘stress test’ that the ruling BJP can be expected to employ to undermine Opposition unity. In the prevailing circumstances, viable Opposition unity is possible only if there is honest recognition of what may be termed as ‘areas of influence’ of each party — the TMC in Bengal, the DMK in Tamil Nadu, the Left in Kerala, the Congress in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, etc. Any hope of Opposition unity will rest on acceptance of this principle of ‘areas of influence’. Within this construct, each party will have a certain pre-eminence. Merely beating the drum of Opposition unity against the ruling BJP is not enough, and is unlikely to produce results. In short, for Opposition unity to succeed there has to be ‘the rhetoric of transformation but [also] the reality of accommodation’ as Fareed Zakaria had once opined in a totally different context.

20 December 2021||December 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Can India become a technology leader?||Every time a technology giant chooses an India-born techie as its leader, there is a justifiable swelling of pride in the country, but also some disappointment. Despite having so many celebrated technologists around the world, why is India still not a major player in technology? India has the potential to occupy the upper echelons of the global technology ladder if only it identifies its shortcomings and acts upon them urgently. The popular narrative is that India’s failures are linked to its inability to make use of the market-driven growth opportunities. The country’s earlier commitment to planning and the public sector continues to damage its chances, so the argument goes, even after the 1991 economic reforms. And so, the talented left the country in droves for the U.S. Indeed, as of 2019, there were 2.7 million Indian immigrants in the U.S. They are among the most educated and professionally accomplished communities in that country. An invisible hand No doubt, the U.S. is a country of fabled opportunities. However, what is less known is than an invisible hand of the government has been there to prop up each of the so-called triumphs of enterprise and the free market. Research by Mariana Mazzucato shows that the state has been crucial to the introduction of the new generation of technologies, including the computers, the Internet, and the nanotech industry. Public sector funding developed the algorithm that eventually led to Google’s success and helped discover the molecular antibodies that provided the foundation for biotechnology. In these successful episodes, the governmental agencies were proactive in identifying and supporting the more uncertain phases of the research, which a risk-averse private sector would not have entered into. The role of the government has been even more prominent in shaping the economic growth of China, which is racing with the U.S. for supremacy in technology. A little over a decade earlier, China was known for its low-wage manufacturing. Even while being hailed as the ‘factory of the world’, China had been stuck at the low value-adding segments of the global production networks, earning only a fraction of the price of the goods it manufactured. However, as part of a 2011 government plan, it has made successful forays into ‘new strategic industries’ such as alternative fuel cars and renewable energy. The Chinese experience China’s achievements came not because it turned ‘capitalist’, but instead by combining the strengths of the public sector, markets and globalisation. China’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were seen as inefficient and bureaucratic. However, rather than privatising them or letting them weaken with neglect, the Chinese state restructured the SOEs. On the one hand, the state retreated from light manufacturing and export-oriented sectors, leaving the field open for the private sector. On the other, SOEs strengthened their presence in strategically important sectors such as petrochemicals and telecommunication as well as in technologically dynamic industries such as electronics and machinery. When India inaugurated planning and industrialisation in the early 1950s, it was possibly the most ambitious of such initiatives in the developing world. Public sector funding of the latest technologies of the time including space and atomic research and the establishment of institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) were among the hallmarks of that effort. Many of these institutions have over the years attained world-class standards. The growth of information technology and pharmaceutical industries has been the fastest in Bengaluru and Hyderabad. However, the roadblocks to progress have been many, including India’s poor achievements in school education. In 1991, when India embraced markets and globalisation, it should have redoubled efforts to strengthen its technological capabilities. Instead, the spending on research and development as a proportion of GDP declined in India from 0.85% in 1990-91 to 0.65% in 2018. In contrast, this proportion increased over the years in China and South Korea to reach 2.1% and 4.5%, respectively, by 2018. Supply and demand factors Despite the setbacks, India still possesses favourable supply and demand factors that can propel it into the frontlines of technology. The number of persons enrolled for tertiary education in India (35.2 million in 2019) is way ahead of the corresponding numbers in all other countries except China. Further, graduates from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) programmes as a proportion of all graduates was 32.2% for India in 2019, one of the highest among all countries (UNESCO data). Without doubt, India needs to sharply increase its public spending to improve the quality of and access to higher education. An overwhelming proportion of tertiary students in India are enrolled in private institutions: it was 60% for those enrolled for a bachelor’s degree in 2017, while the average for G20 countries was 33%, according to OECD. India — which will soon have twice the number of Internet users as in the U.S. — is a large market for all kinds of new technologies. While this presents a huge opportunity, the domestic industry has not yet managed to derive the benefits. For instance, the country is operating far below its potential in electronic manufacturing. Electronic goods and components are the second largest item, after oil, in India’s import bill. Also, the country’s imports are almost five times its exports in this industry (based on 2020-21 data). High-value electronic components needed in the manufacture of, say, mobile phones are technology- and design-intensive. Big multinational companies control these technologies and corner the bulk of the revenues. China has used its large market size as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the foreign firms: stay in our markets only if you localise production and share technologies with the local firms. Meanwhile, there have been aggressive efforts to enhance China’s own technological strengths through its research institutions and SOEs. The ‘Make in India’ initiative will have to go beyond increasing the ‘ease of business’ for private industry. Indian industry needs to deepen and broaden its technological capabilities. This will happen only if universities and public institutions in the country are strengthened and emboldened to enter areas of technology development for which the private sector may have neither the resources nor the patience. Over the last three decades, PSUs in India have been judged mainly on the short-term fiscal benefits they bring. Instead, they should be valued for their potential long-term contributions to economic growth, the technologies they can create, and the strategic and knowledge assets they can build. A strengthened public sector will create more opportunities for private businesses and widen the entrepreneurial base.

20 December 2021||December 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Testing the red lines in the Iran nuclear talks||Months after Iran’s presidential elections in June, multilateral nuclear talks have started once again in Vienna with a new Iranian negotiating team. Iran’s chief negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani reportedly introduced demands that in effect cancelled understandings reached in previous rounds of negotiations in June concerning a renewed Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). As a matter of fact, a report by a nonpartisan organisation points out that Iran began exceeding JCPOA limits on both its allowed stockpile and level of enrichment a year after the Donald Trump administration withdrew from the deal in May 2018 and began re-imposing economic sanctions. What Iran and the U.S. say For the time being, the new round of Vienna talks seems to have no positive outcomes. Both sides are completely intransigent and want the other party to back down and make concessions before they will move. Iran insists on all sanctions being lifted, while the Americans are asking Iran to return to reduced enrichment of uranium and accept full International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections. According to some analysts, the current impasse is not due to two factors. First and foremost, Iran is playing the North Korean card, while moving toward leaving the economic sphere of the United States and Europe and joining China and Russia. On the other hand, the Americans do not have a very clear direction for Iran’s future, especially because the U.S. President, Joe Biden, is refusing to commit his administration to lift sanctions on Iran during the remaining years of his presidency. Europe’s line As for the Europeans, thus far they have been almost non-existent in these new talks. Even so, Enrique Mora, Deputy Secretary General/Political Director, European External Action Service, who coordinates talks between Tehran and six powers on reviving a 2015 nuclear pact seemed to be very positive about the way the negotiations had started. According to him: “the P4+1 must “fully take into account” the political sensibilities of the new Iranian administration”, while the Iranian delegation has recognised “the work we have done in the past six rounds and the fact that we will build on this work going ahead”. Despite Mr. Mora’s positive remarks, it seems that the Europeans are trying to salvage the deal as quickly as possible, as Iran ramps up uranium enrichment. But at the same time, they seem not to be forceful mediators in these talks, given that there are the Chinese and the Russians, who are in favour of the Iranians. Chinese remarks The Chinese comments about the “nuclear hypocrisy” of the West suggested that it is sympathetic to the fundamental arguments of the Iranian negotiators, that has been dealt a fundamental injustice by the U.S. — an injustice in which the Europeans have been complicit. Unsurprisingly, while the Iranian negotiating team believes that time is running out for the U.S., the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has warned Iran that “the hour is getting very late” to return to the nuclear deal. However, he also added that “it is not too late for Iran to reverse course to save the deal aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear capabilities, in exchange for an easing of sanctions from Washington”. Tehran’s stand, Israel’s view All in all, the new Iran nuclear deal presents itself as a path paved with uncertainties. It looks like Iran has headed into the present nuclear talks in Vienna armed with a new general nuclear strategy. Indeed, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s demands have consistently centered on full sanctions removal. But, at the same time, the newly elected government headed by Ebrahim Raisi has repeatedly proclaimed that nothing is agreed on unless everything has been agreed on. It seems that the Raisi government is testing international red lines, and trying to leverage Iran’s expanding nuclear programme to produce more concessions from the international community, without paying significant costs. As a result, there is an increasing pessimism on whether the Iran nuclear deal can be revived. The fact that Iran has begun using advanced centrifuges to pursue 20% uranium enrichment at the underground Fordow facility is making the IAEA very nervous. Meanwhile, Israeli officials have been pressing European governments and the U.S. on a real Iranian nuclear threat. However, according to the former Israeli Defence Minister, Moshe Ya’alon, “The main mistake of the last decade was to quit the deal during the Trump administration.” However, let us not forget that the Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennet, declared openly in late November that, “The mistake we made after the first nuclear deal in 2015 will not repeat itself.” He recently asked Washington to start using “a different toolkit against Iran’s forward gallop in the enrichment sphere”. No doubt, Israel continues to see the Islamic Republic of Iran as an existential threat. From the Israeli point of view, this threat can be justified notably by Iran’s current hegemonic military drive into the Levant. All this does not necessarily mean that Israel has a plan to act militarily against Iran, but the situation is far from encouraging for the Israelis. Whatever it may be, the key question remains this: whether the nuclear negotiations in Vienna could become substantive or collapse with no results. No one has the answer to this question yet. But one thing is certain: Iran and the U.S. will both fail if they try to corner each other with a “Trumpian” attitude. After all, if the JCPOA is a complex affair, it is because diplomacy is all about complexity management.

20 December 2021||December 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Neither ban nor regulate crypto||“India has officially adopted bitcoin as legal tender,” tweeted the Prime Minister at 2 a.m. on December 12. The suddenness of the announcement, its timing and mode of communication would have shocked any nation. But he had made a similar announcement at 8 p.m. on November 8, 2016, declaring that all Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes would no longer be legal tender. So, introducing a new legal tender arbitrarily was not beyond the realm of possibilities. Fortunately, the tweet was deleted later citing “technical compromise”. Conspiracy theories aside, the nation’s currency is a very serious matter. Today, I can sell you my painting and accept cryptocurrency in return, just as I can also accept peacock feathers. It is a private transaction between consenting Indian adults and the government should not be involved. Nearly 15 million Indians are supposedly investing in and betting on cryptocurrencies, the value of which swings wildly, purportedly putting these investors and the financial system at risk. So, the government has to formulate a policy goes the argument. The question of trust But why are 15 million Indians gambling on cryptocurrencies? In the hope that its value will keep rising. This hope is based on the ultimate belief that they will be socially accepted as a valid medium of exchange. If I buy a cup of coffee, the shop will accept bitcoin only if they can use it to buy coffee seeds from the planter who in turn will accept bitcoins only if she can use it to buy fertilizer for her coffee plantation. Cryptocurrencies can become an acceptable medium of exchange only when each person in society trusts that the next person will accept it. Or if the government explicitly induces trust in them, as with paper currency. Currency essentially represents trust in society. Some ‘cool’ technology cannot manufacture social trust. If anything, social media companies have proven how if engineers are allowed to run amok, they can wreak havoc in society. As John Maynard Keynes said, “There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning society than to debauch the currency”. The government has to make it clear that India will not legitimise cryptocurrencies, which means they cannot be exchanged for rupees in a bank. This will dampen the enthusiasm for investment and speculation. After all, the value for cryptocurrency stems from the hope that it will eventually be a socially accepted medium of exchange or legal tender. It requires a global compact of all major nations to jointly resolve to not accept cryptocurrencies as currencies, which is where we seem to be headed. Inevitably there will be some nation that will stay out and allow a loophole. For now, the Indian government must be explicit that India will never recognise cryptocurrencies as currency. Problem of regulation Some experts advocate regulation of cryptocurrencies. Implicit in this prescription is that the government should accord cryptocurrencies the status of a ‘financial instrument’ since only recognised instruments can be regulated. This can be a penny-wise and pound-foolish move. The argument for regulating cryptocurrencies is the notion that millions of investors indulge in risky cryptocurrency trading which can cause losses, increase volatility, spur shadow finance and pose a systemic risk. This advice is subconsciously triggered by the hangover of the 2008 financial crisis caused by mortgage trading. Fear of a systemic risk has already led the world down a dangerous path of excessive financialisation, reckless money supply and Wall Street control of economic policy, leading to huge disparities in societies. We cannot fall prey to it once again. If the government recognises cryptocurrencies as ‘assets’ and a regulator is established to supervise this, it runs the ‘moral hazard’ risk of signaling official sanction to speculators and implying government protection. This could perversely lead to more people trading in cryptocurrencies. India does not have the resources and governance capacity to set up a new regulatory infrastructure to oversee the interests of speculators gambling in cryptocurrencies today or peacock feathers tomorrow. By eschewing responsibility for cryptocurrencies, the government can send an unambiguous signal that those indulging in cryptocurrencies do so at their own risk. When it becomes very clear that the government will neither legalise nor regulate cryptocurrencies in India, speculative activity will reduce eventually, even if few investors lose in the process. Blockchain can be a powerful technology with many applications that must be encouraged; just not as a nation’s currency. It is neither feasible nor wise to ban or regulate cryptocurrencies. Make it categorically clear that India will never permit cryptocurrencies to be currency and stop there.

20 December 2021||December 20 2021 00:00 IST,||The fight for Veda Nilayam||Veda Nilayam, the home of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in Chennai’s upmarket Poes Garden and a hub of political activity for over 25 years, is in the news again. On November 24, the Madras High Court quashed the previous AIADMK government’s decision to acquire the property of the late leader for converting it into a memorial. Its judgment was based on several grounds, one of which was that the acquisition “cannot be said to involve a ‘public purpose’ in law.” On December 10, Chennai Collector J. Vijaya Rani handed over the keys to the residence to J. Deepa and J. Deepak, niece and nephew of Jayalalithaa and children of her only sibling, Jayakumar [who died in 1995]. Ms. Deepa and her husband then promptly visited Veda Nilayam to take possession of the property. Five days later, the Court permitted the AIADMK and former Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam to prefer third party appeal against the Court’s verdict. It all began with the demand by sections of the party to turn Veda Nilayam into a memorial after Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016. In the run-up to the August 2017 unification of two groups led by O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami, both former Chief Ministers and now co-ordinator and co-coordinator, respectively, the former had even made it a condition for the unification. Mr. Palaniswami, then in power, had obliged his predecessor by making an announcement. But Mr. Deepa and Mr. Deepak opposed the move to acquire the property. In May 2020, Mr. Palaniswami got a law enacted to establish a foundation to run the affairs of the memorial, which was to display 8,376 books belonging to Jayalalithaa, among other things. Ms. Deepa and Mr. Deepak had every reason to be sentimental about Veda Nilayam which was jointly purchased in July 1967 by their aunt, Jayalalithaa, and grandmother, Sandhya, who had acted in many feature films, for about Rs. 1.32 lakh. Before her death in November 1971, Sandhya had, through a will, bequeathed her share of the property to her daughter. Jayalalithaa’s niece and nephew had even submitted before the High Court in a case on their status of being legal heirs that they were “born and brought up” at the Poes Garden residence. They also had the legal backing to stake claim, being the former Chief Minister’s only legal heirs. In May 2020, the High Court clarified that they were the legal heirs as per the Hindu Succession Act and were entitled to succeed to Jayalalithaa’s estate, modifying their original status as Class II legal heirs. After visiting the house for the first time following her aunt’s death, Ms. Deepa said she wanted to make Veda Nilayam her home. However, she complained that “many elements in the home are missing.” More importantly, in the light of Veda Nilayam being attached by the Income Tax Department since March 2007, the legal heirs have to settle first Jayalalithaa’s tax liabilities, which, according to the acquisition award of July 2020, accounted for about Rs. 36.8 crore. The Land Acquisition Officer had calculated the amount of compensation as nearly Rs. 68 crore for the acquisition. The AIADMK, which is keen on turning the property into a memorial, has sought the cooperation of Ms. Deepa and Mr. Deepak in the matter. Also, what is little known is the plan of V.K. Sasikala, who served as Jayalalithaa’s aide for over 25 years and functioned as interim general secretary of the party briefly after the death of the former Chief Minister. In August 2020, her property, an under-construction structure and situated across Veda Nilayam, was attached by the IT authorities under the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016. Regardless of what happens next, Veda Nilayam is certain to be in the news for many years to come. ramakrishnan.t@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-fight-for-veda-nilayam/article37993509.ece
20 December 2021||December 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Persist with probe||It is difficult to disagree with the argument that there cannot be a parallel probe by any inquiry commission into the allegations of unlawful surveillance using the Pegasus spyware after the Supreme Court ordered an independent inquiry. It is no surprise, then, that the top court has stayed the functioning of the Commission constituted by the West Bengal government and headed by retired judge, Justice Madan B. Lokur. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had taken note of the allegations of surveillance that possibly targeted personages in West Bengal, and was on good legal ground when she took the first legal step towards unearthing the truth. It was a step that was warranted by the circumstances then, given the Union government’s refusal to acknowledge that it possessed such spyware or whether those identified by an international media investigation as targets were subject to any sort of surveillance in the country. Reports by an international consortium of journalists said that 300 out of 50,000 likely targets of Pegasus spyware were Indians. Subsequently, the Government also refused to cede any ground in the Supreme Court, and declined to give a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ reply to the Court’s questions. Stonewalling attempts to raise it in Parliament and sticking to its guns in Court, the Government inevitably invited an order from the Court for an independent investigation. It is significant that the Bench, headed by the Chief Justice of India, N.V. Ramana, ruled that the bogey of national security was not an adequate reason not to have a credible inquiry into the allegations. A fresh report suggesting that Pegasus was used to target jailed activist Rona Wilson’s mobile phone underscores the urgent need to persist with the investigation into the illegal use of the spyware in India. U.S. forensic investigation company Arsenal Consulting has said Mr. Wilson’s phone was attacked as many as 49 times and it was successfully infected by the time he was arrested in June 2018 for alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon case. Earlier, the firm had claimed that NetWire, a remote access Trojan, was used to plant letters on Mr. Wilson’s computer. Advocate and co-accused Surendra Gadling was also targeted in the same manner. These developments raise suspicion about the genuineness of the evidence being relied upon to try him and others for an unsubstantiated Maoist plot. There is little doubt that the Court-ordered probe by experts supervised by a panel headed by the retired Supreme Court judge, Justice R.V. Raveendran, should be taken to its logical conclusion and the country be told whether Pegasus, or any other spyware, was used to infect mobile phones and other devices of lawyers, activists and journalists, among others. There is much riding on this judicially overseen inquiry, and it behoves the government of the day to extend its full cooperation and not pose any impediment to its independent functioning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/persist-with-probe/article37993498.ece
20 December 2021||December 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Age and marriage||Good intent does not guarantee favourable outcomes. Coercive laws without wide societal support often fail to deliver even when their statement of objects and reasons aims for the larger public good. Within days of the Union Cabinet approving a proposal to raise the age of marriage for women from 18 to 21 years, the same age as for men, the Government listed it for legislative business in Parliament this week. If passed, various personal and faith-based laws which govern marriages in India now, including The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the Special Marriage Act, 1954, and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, will have to be amended. In her Budget speech last year, Finance Nirmala Sitharaman had announced that the Government would set up a task force to look into the age of a girl entering motherhood with an aim to lower maternal mortality rates, improve nutrition levels as well as ensure opportunities to women to pursue higher education and careers. With these targets in mind, a panel headed by former Samata Party chief Jaya Jaitly was set up in June last year. The panel submitted its report in December 2020. Though the objective looks good on paper, merely raising the age of marriage without creating social awareness and improving access to health care is unlikely to benefit the community it wants to serve: young women not yet financially independent, who are unable to exercise their rights and freedoms while still under the yoke of familial and societal pressures. According to Ms. Jaitly, raising the age of marriage is one of its recommendations, which include a strong campaign to reform patriarchal mindsets, and improved access to education. As per the National Family Health Survey (2019-2021), 23.3% of women aged 20-24 years married before 18, which shows that the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, has not been wholly successful in preventing child marriages, especially among the poor. Women’s rights activists point out that parents often use this Act to punish their daughters who marry against their wishes or elope to evade forced marriages, domestic abuse, and lack of education facilities. Hence, within a patriarchal setting, it is more likely that the change in the age limit will increase parents’ authority over young adults. A good, but not easy, way to achieve the stated objective is to take steps to counsel girls on early pregnancies, and provide them the network to improve their health. The focus must be on creating social awareness about women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, and ensuring girls are not forced to drop out of school or college. Laws cannot be a short cut in the path to social reform.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/age-and-marriage/article37993499.ece

The cryptic announcement, made by an official spokesperson in Rawalpindi, said Gen. Yahya Khan “has decided to resign his office as soon as he hands over the government to the representatives of the people tomorrow.” Radio Pakistan broke into an Urdu bulletin with the word from Rawalpindi, which came after Air Marshall Asghar Khan, former Air Force Chief, made a public demand that Gen. Yahya Khan and other junta members be tried in public. The Pakistan People’s Party Chairman, Mr. Bhutto, who now appeared certain to head the new regime, was on his way home after a meeting with President Nixon to Washington when the Rawalpindi announcement came. Earlier, during a halt in London where he met the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, Mr. Bhutto had said the situation in Pakistan was “very grim and very bad” and Gen. Yahya Khan “must be feeling cornered.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/yahya-to-quit-power-transfer-to-day/article37993507.ece
20 December 2021||December 20 2021 00:00 IST,||ASK US||Q.I am a 40-year-old central government male employee married and with two children. I was lured into a life insurance plan that makes me pay about Rs. 8,500 per month (since 2019) for a not-so-lucrative sum assured. Having learned about investments recently, I wish to discontinue the endowment plan and switch to a term plan that has a much higher sum assured for a lesser premium. Please advise. I have a home loan. So, I am not in the plan for tax benefit SREEJITH S S A.This is the sad story one hears all the time. Taking the wrong policy due to a combination of pressure from the salesperson, insufficient research at the right time and maybe, time pressure to catch a tax deadline is common. Mixing risk cover and investment is inefficient and your idea of discontinuing the endowment and going in for a term policy is a sound strategy. Here are some inputs for you to carry this out: Understand the term policy concept first. You get only death cover, there is no maturity value at the end of the policy term. Miss a single instalment and the policy is gone. You will get a higher premium commensurate with your age if you start a new policy. Take the term policy first before discontinuing your endowment so that your security is, well, secure. If you have paid a pre-determined number of premium instalments, your endowment policy would be eligible for surrender/ becoming paid up. The former means your coverage ceases and you can get a residual value of your premium back. The latter means you need not pay any more premiums but the coverage continues for the policy period at a proportionately reduced sum insured. Consider paying premiums till the policy acquires this status. If not you lose the premiums already paid. Whatever you lose, please don’t lose the lesson that research is better done before buying a policy rather than after. Q.I work in a PSU bank and have corporate health insurance for Rs. 3 lakh provided by my employer. I have purchased family floater health insurance for Rs. 10 lakh for me and my younger brother and have a separate individual top-up of Rs. 10 lakh from same insurance company with a deductible of Rs. 3 lakh. Please clarify the following: 1) How to claim for top-up if Rs. 10 lakh sum insured of primary insurance (family floater) gets exhausted 2) As under both the policies (top-up and family floater), claim should be intimated with 24 hours in most cases, how can I know how much amount will be spent on expenses. 3) If I intimate a claim for top-up and family floater at the same time, but if claim doesn’t exceed Rs. 10 lakh, will the insurance company consider my top-up policy as no claim or, since as I intimated the claim will it be considered as claimed and hence affect my no-claim incentive under which for every claim free year my sum insured increases by 10%? I also want to know whether just intimation of claim without any expenditure or payment by the insurance company and also due to the deductible on my policy, will lead to losing out on my no claim incentive 4) Can I show the family floater in tax savings? SRINATH INUGANTI A.On hospitalisation you can intimate your insurer of an imminent claim under the basic policy, ie the Rs. 10 lakh family floater. During the course of the treatment, when you see your expenses are getting close to your sum insured, say at Rs. 8 lakh, you can intimate the insurer about a possible claim under the top-up policy. Your no-claim incentive, which will reflect as an enhanced sum insured on renewal, will be affected only if a claim is paid. Mere intimation of a claim will not trigger this. In fact, should you prefer a claim and it is repudiated in toto, even then your no-claim incentive will be intact. Tax benefit under Section 80 D of the Income-tax Act, 1961 is available only on premium for self, spouse, dependent children, parents and parents-in-law. Q.I am 27 years old. I joined government service a year ago. I am trying to buy health insurance for my parents but am confused which type of insurance I should opt for. My parents are in the 50 plus age bracket. Should I buy separate insurance for them or joint? Will I get tax benefits or not? Please guide me PRAMOD K. R. A.To begin with, please enrol your parents under your employer’s health insurance scheme. Based on the coverage it offers, you can take further insurance covers with commercial insurance companies. As for the insurance company plans, taking a joint policy for your parents and a separate one for yourself (in which you can add your spouse and children) is advisable. This is because in a family policy the premium is determined on the basis of the eldest family member. So, it is better to isolate older members into a separate policy and preserve better rates for the younger members of the family. You will get Section 80 D benefits for premium you pay for your parents also.

20 December 2021||JAIPUR,||Akshdeep and Rinku power UP past MP||A rearguard effort with the bat from Akshdeep Nath and Rinku Singh and a disciplined bowling performance from Yash Dayal helped Uttar Pradesh register a five-wicket win over Madhya Pradesh and enter the quarterfinals of the Vijay Hazare Trophy at the Jaipuria Vidhyalaya Ground here on Sunday. Chasing a target of 235, UP was struggling at 43 for three in the 14th over. Akshdeep laid anchor, stitching useful partnerships with Sameer Rizvi (38, 71b, 3x4) and Rinku Singh (58 n.o., 64b, 5x4). When the required run-rate kept climbing, Akshdeep and Rinku accelerated before the latter swept left-arm spinner Kumar Kartikeya Singh for a four to seal the contest. Akshdeep’s fighting knock was the highlight of UP’s pursuit. Initially, he pushed the ball around for singles and twos before reaching his half-century with a pull for four off seamer Kuldeep Sen. Akshdeep switched gears in the 43rd over, lofting a full delivery from Avesh Khan straight behind the bowler’s head for six. Though Akshdeep fell with the target in sight, Rinku and Bhuvneshwar Kumar guided the team home. The penultimate over, bowled by Avesh, virtually sealed the contest. Bhuvneshwar hit a four through fine-leg before a full toss went through the wicketkeeper’s legs to the boundary. Consistent line Earlier, left-arm seamer Dayal (three for 35) was the pick of the Uttar Pradesh bowlers. He bowled a consistent line, tossing in the odd short ball and slower ball. Madhya Pradesh’s main man Venkatesh Iyer, who played an uncharacteristically subdued innings, was among Dayal’s victims. Bhuvneshwar, playing his first game of the tournament, bowled Abhishek Bhandari in the first over. Rameez Khan (35, 68b, 4x4), Rajat Patidar (46, 49b, 3x4, 1x6) and the in-form Shubham Sharma (83, 99, 10x4) batted sensibly to take their past past 200. Wickets fell in a heap towards the end before Puneet Date smashed two sixes off Shivam Mavi in the 48th over. However, Madhya Pradesh’s total proved inadequate once Akshdeep and Rinku staged a fightback.  The scores: Rajasthan 199 in 41.4 overs (Deepak Hooda 109, V. Vyshak 4/22) lost to Karnataka 204/2 in 43.4 overs (R. Samarth 54, K.V. Siddharth 85 n.o., Manish Pandey 52 n.o.).

20 December 2021||Jaipur,||Vyshak, Siddharth do it for Karnataka||Pacer V. Vyshak’s four-wicket haul (four for 22) and K.V. Siddharth’s unbeaten 85 (120b, 6x4) ensured an easy eight-wicket win for Karnataka over Rajasthan in the pre-quarterfinals of the Vijay Hazare Trophy at the K.L. Saini Stadium here on Sunday. Karnataka’s chase was set up by opener R. Samarth’s 54 who added 75 runs for the second wicket with Siddharth. Even as fellow opener Devdutt Padikkal struggled, Samarth looked fluent, finding quick boundaries. Finishing it in style Later, Siddharth and skipper Manish Pandey added 104 runs for the second wicket to see Karnataka home. Pandey finished things in style with a six over mid-wicket off leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi, also getting to his half-century. Earlier, put in, Rajasthan made 199, riding on skipper Deepak Hooda’s brilliant 109 (109b, 9x4, 5x6). His knock helped his side recover after being reduced to 19 for five by the eighth over. Nippy conditions In nippy conditions, pacer Prasidh Krishna gave the first breakthrough for Karnataka when he had opener Abhijeet Tomar caught at slips. Soon Vyshak ran through the Rajasthan middle-order picking up four wickets. He had Manender Singh trapped leg-before and Mahipal Lomoror bowled. He could have also had Hooda for nought had Siddharth held on to a simple catch at covers. In the eighth over, Salman Khan tried to pull Vyshak only to top-edge to fine-leg and two balls later, Kamlesh Nagarkotti cut one straight to point. Hooda, once he got his eye in, let loose finding boundaries easily, especially against spinners K. Gowtham and Pravid Dubey. He was supported by Samarpit Joshi, who played sensibly by rotating the strike well. The two added 118 runs off 133 balls for the sixth wicket. But once Joshi was dismissed, the rest of the batters did not show the same support for Hooda. Rajasthan committed the cardinal sin of not playing 50 overs and paid for it by crashing out of the tournament.  The scores: Rajasthan 199 in 41.4 overs (Deepak Hooda 109, V. Vyshak 4/22) lost to Karnataka 204/2 in 43.4 overs (R. Samarth 54, K.V. Siddharth 85 n.o., Manish Pandey 52 n.o.).

20 December 2021||Huelva (Spain),||Loh on a high as Srikanth finishes with silver||K. Srikanth’s fine run at the BWF World badminton championship ended with a silver-medal finish after he lost the men’s singles summit clash to Singapore’s Loh Kean Yew 15-21, 20-22 here on Sunday. Former World No. 1 Srikanth lost the first game, after leading 9-3, in just 16 minutes. He fought better in the second game but Loh was too good on the day. The 24-year-old Loh had stunned World No. 1 and reigning Olympic champion Viktor Axelsen in the first round. Nevertheless, Srikanth still etched his name in the history books by becoming the first Indian man to reach the final of the championships after his come-from-behind win over compatriot Lakshya Sen on Saturday. On Saturday, Srikanth had staged a remarkable comeback to down young compatriot Lakshya Sen in the semifinals. Lakshya finished with a bronze.   Second-seeded Akane Yamaguchi of Japan clinched the women’s title beating World No. 1 and top seed Tai Tzu Ying of Chinese Taipei 21-14, 21-11 in 39 minutes.

20 December 2021||Johannesburg,||Pujara backs India pacers’ strike power||Senior India batter Cheteshwar Pujara is confident his team’s fast bowling unit will keep up the good work and get 20 wickets in every Test in the upcoming series against South Africa, starting December 26. The Indian team has already started its skills training with all the premier batters having a quality net session on Saturday. “Our fast bowlers are our strength and I hope that they will be able to utilise these conditions and give us 20 wickets in every Test match. They have been the difference between the two sides whenever we have played abroad,” Pujara told local media. “If you look at the Australia series, even if you look at the England series, we have done exceptionally well as a bowling unit and I am sure that will be the case even in South Africa,” said the veteran of 92 Tests and 6,589 runs. The pacers have played a key role in India’s success in series abroad in the recent past. There aren’t any practice games due to the cramped schedule and the COVID-19 variant Omicron has already led to the tour being shortened. CSA postpones domestic matches Meanwhile, Cricket South Africa announced that the remaining round of CSA four-day franchise series has been postponed as a precautionary measure over COVID-19 fears. The announcement came just a week before the three-match Test series. The country has seen a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past few weeks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/pujara-backs-india-pacers-strike-power/article37993591.ece
20 December 2021||December 20 2021 00:00 IST,||BFC faces stiff test against JFC||Bengaluru FC (BFC) faces a tough challenge against a strong Jamshedpur FC in an Indian Super League (ISL) outing at Bambolim on Monday. BFC, winless in six games, takes on Jamshedpur FC, which is fresh from a 4-0 victory over Odisha FC in its previous outing. BFC, however, can take some positives from a 3-3 draw earned against ATK Mohun Bagan a few days ago. Suresh Wangjam returns to the BFC squad after the midfielder served his one-match ban for picking up a red card against FC Goa. Naorem Singh will miss out due to suspension (four yellows). Serious threat The Jamshedpur FC frontline poses a serious threat. Scotland’s Greg Stewart is in form, having scored the club’s first-ever hat-trick in the victory over Odisha FC. “They have four very good attacking players, and Greg Stewart is one of them. We’ve played two pre-season friendlies against them, and have an idea of the kind of threat they possess,” BFC head coach Marco Pezzaiuoli said. Jamshedpur FC has won three of its last five games, and will look to build on its good form. “Greg Stewart is a wonderful player. That’s why I got him to the football club. I told everybody in the pre-season about his qualities and it’s nice when I am vindicated,” Jamshedpur head coach Owen Coyle said.

20 December 2021||December 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Srikanth is back!||K. Srikanth, who had a dream run in 2017 when he won four Super Series titles and climbed to World No. 1 in the men’s singles rankings, created history in Huelva on Sunday when he became the first Indian man to reach the final of the World Championship. Though he lost to Singapore’s Loh Kean Yew in straight games, the 28-year-old had a memorable campaign as he capitalised on the withdrawals of a few big names. Unleashing his characteristic jump smashes under pressure, Srikanth dropped enough hints that he was back at full throttle. Against a determined Lakshya Sen in the semifinal, he clawed back from a game down to win in three in a contest that witnessed superb rallies and breathtaking shots. The first-ever semifinal featuring two Indians at the Worlds also showed that men’s badminton, as much as the women’s game, is growing in the country. Born in Ravulapalem, Andhra Pradesh, Srikanth started playing the sport in Guntur. His career took off once he shifted base to the Gopi Academy. In the international arena, he made his first big impact in 2014 when he defeated badminton legend and Chinese superstar Lin Dan in the China Open final and became the first Indian to win a Super Series Premier men’s title. Three years later, he was at his best as he accumulated trophies in style. A spate of injuries saw Srikanth falter after that remarkable phase. Things didn’t go the way he would have wanted them to though he won the mixed team gold and a silver in the 2018 Commonwealth Games. After missing out on qualification for the Tokyo Olympics, Srikanth trained hard for the rest of the season. And his performance in Huelva underlined that.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/srikanth-is-back/article37993594.ece

20 December 2021||HUELVA,||It has been a great week, says Srikanth||The World Championship silver medal is a culmination of years of hard work, said K. Srikanth after losing in the final on Sunday. “In a few tournaments, I played really well and in a few tournaments, I couldn’t. To reach the final of a World Championship is something that I really worked hard for and I am really happy to be here today,” Srikanth said. “I will try to continue to work hard... it is a process. There are many big tournaments next year like the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and World Championship. So it is a very big year next year. I will try to stay positive,” said Srikanth. “It has been a great week. Even today I had my chances in both games. I had a healthy lead in the first and even in the second, I had an 18-16 cushion. I was not able to finish well. Loh played really well,” he said. “There a lot of things to learn from this... definitely I will work on this and try and get better for future tournaments.” Srikanth had a tough time trying to get his visa for the Huelva tournament and said he wasn’t sure if he would be able to take part in the tournament. “I didn’t know if I would be able to come here and I got to know only on Thursday evening before the tournament. I think I got my visa around 6, so I wasn’t sure if I would be able to come here,” said Srikanth. ‘Cannot believe it’ For Loh, becoming the World champion was an incredible feeling. “I cannot believe it. I mean, at the start of the year I didn’t think this will happen. Now I can tell you I am finally happy,” said the World No. 22.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/it-has-been-a-great-week-says-srikanth/article37993748.ece
20 December 2021||Dhaka,||India thrashes Japan||Defending champion India crushed Japan 6-0 to remain unbeaten in the round-robin stage of the Asian Champions Trophy men’s hockey tournament on Sunday. Harmanpreet Singh (10th and 53rd minutes) scored a brace, while Dilpreet Singh (23rd), Jaramnpreet Singh (34th), Sumit (46th) and Shamsher Singh (54th) also registered their names on the scoresheet for India. India, which has already sealed a semifinals berth, ended the round-robin stage of the five-nation tournament at the top of the standings with 10 points, ahead of Korea (6), Japan (5), Pakistan (2) and host Bangladesh (0). This was India’s third win on the trot and the semifinals opponent is yet to be decided.  India completely outperformed Japan, the Asian Games gold medallist, in all departments. India dominated the first half. It earned two back-to-back penalty corners within the first six minutes of the the first quarter but was unable to convert either. India kept on attacking and received another penalty corner, this time Hardik Singh injecting the ball to perfection for Harmanpreet to flick it home and give the holder a 1-0 lead. In the 23rd minute, the trio of Mandeep Singh, Shilanand Lakra and Dilpreet combined well as Dilpreet doubled India’s lead. India scored its third goal courtesy Jaramanpreet’s strike. Sumit got a goal in the first minute of the final quarter and then Harmanpreet made it 5-0 by smashing the ball in the top right corner of the goalpost for his second of the match. Two minutes later, Shamsher and Shilanand combined beautifully as the former scored the team’s sixth goal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/india-thrashes-japan/article37993581.ece
20 December 2021||Adelaide,||England teeters on the edge||Joe Root fell in the final over of the fourth day to leave England in deep trouble at 82 for four here on Sunday. Chasing a massive 468 to win the second Ashes Test, England now needs a miracle to avoid slumping to 2-0 down in the series. Tall order No team has ever posted such a big score in a fourth innings to win in the history of Test cricket — with the West Indies’ 418 for seven in beating Steve Waugh’s Australia at St. John’s in 2003 the highest. It is an even harder task at the Adelaide Oval, where Australia’s 315 for six to defeat England in 1902 remains the best fourth-innings run chase. England’s problems stem from being bowled out, after a batting collapse, for 236 on Saturday in reply to Australia’s 473 for nine declared. England is 386 runs adrift, facing the near impossible task of batting out three sessions on the final day to salvage a draw with only six wickets remaining and the World No. 1 Test batsman back in the pavilion. Australia resumed its second innings at 45 for one and declared on 230 for nine midway through the second session, giving the bowlers a crack at England with the pink ball as twilight loomed. They immediately made inroads with Jhye Richardson steaming in to Haseeb Hameed and the ball flying off his glove to wicketkeeper Alex Carey without scoring. Dawid Malan, who hit 80 in the first innings, was dropped by Steve Smith, but only lasted three more balls before debutant Michael Neser trapped him lbw for 20. Opener Rory Burns was desperate for a big score after a lean spell and managed 34, but was then beaten by Richardson’s sheer pace, edging to Smith in the slips. Root hurt his abdomen during a warm-up that saw him miss the opening 85 minutes while he went for a scan. He appeared mostly untroubled while batting but late in the day took a nasty blow in the same area from Mitchell Starc that left him writhing on the ground in agony. Root gingerly got up, but in a huge blow was out for 24 in the final over, caught by Carey off Starc. Earlier, Marnus Labuschagne and Travis Head both made 51 for Australia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/england-teeters-on-the-edge/article37993583.ece
20 December 2021||December 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Blasters prove too hot for Mumbai City||Kerala Blasters pulled off a coup on Sunday night. The men from Kochi scored a stunning 3-0 win over table-topper Mumbai City at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Fatorda. They did that with a fair amount of flair too; one of their goals should count among the best of the season, while another was lovely to watch. The eye-catching goals from Sahal Samad and Alvaro Vazquez had already made life difficult for Mumbai when Pereyra Diaz struck from the penalty spot. The Blasters had started very much the underdogs as they had managed only one win in their five previous games. Mumbai, on the other hand, had won five of its six and was on a four-match winning streak which came to an end on this night. The Kerala men didn't give space to Mumbai’s dangerous frontline to create enough chances even as they created their own at the other end. One of those opportunities came in the 27th minute when Pereyra Diaz provided a pass to Sahal, who waited for the ball to bounce in front of him and volleyed it home. Early into the second half came that magical moment from Vazquez. His volley from the edge of the box had power and precision, and had class written all over it. Four minutes later, Mumbai was reduced to 10 when Mourtada Fall earned a second yellow for a tackle on Diaz. The resultant penalty was easily converted by Diaz. From 0-3 down, it proved an uphill task even for Mumbai; it, however, remained on top with 15 points. Blasters moved to fifth with nine points from six matches.  The results: Sunday: Kerala Blasters 3 (Sahal 27, Vazquez 47, Diaz 51-pen) bt Mumbai City FC 0.   Saturday: FC Goa 1 (Cabrera 64) drew with Hyderabad FC 1 (Chianese 54).   Monday’s match: Bengaluru FC vs Jamshedpur FC, 7.30 p.m .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/blasters-prove-too-hot-for-mumbai-city/article37993589.ece

Jurgen Klopp’s side recovered from Harry Kane’s early strike to move in front thanks to goals from Diogo Jota and Andrew Robertson.

City will now spend Christmas top of the table on 44 points, three in front of Liverpool and six ahead of Chelsea.

20 December 2021||Miami,||Woods admits to physical demands being challenging||A smiling Tiger Woods made a successful return to competitive golf on Saturday, teaming up with son Charlie to card a 10-under 62 at the PNC Championship family tournament in Florida. The Woodses were three shots behind leaders Stewart Cink, the 2009 British Open champion, and son Reagan at the end of the first round. Flashes of brilliance Woods, playing for the first time since suffering career-threatening injuries in a February car crash in California, showed flashes of his old brilliance even though he lacked his usual power and length. The 45-year-old golfing icon used a cart to move around the Ritz Carlton Golf Course’s 7,106-yard layout. He later admitted the physical demands of the round had been challenging; at one point Woods was seen wincing visibly. “It’s frustrating when I don’t hit the ball as far as I know that I can and the shots that I see don’t come off the way I want,” Woods told reporters, saying he hit only “three good shots” all round.  “It’s tiring out there, so it was a slow day. If I want to compete out here at the Tour level I’m going to have to get the endurance back and hit thousands upon thousands of golf balls. Just takes time. “I can still hit short irons and I can still putt. That has not left me. The speed and some of the shots, the longer stuff has,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/woods-admits-to-physical-demands-being-challenging/article37994103.ece
20 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||IOA forms six-member committee||The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) on Sunday formed a six-member committee to look into the amendments to be made to its constitution before holding elections so as to align it with the National Sports Code. The committee will comprise IOA president Narinder Batra, secretary-general Rajeev Mehta, treasurer Anandeshwar Pandey, senior vice-presidents Anil Khana and R.K. Anand, and Lalit Bhanot, who is a member of the committee that finalises India’s contingent to multi-sports events. The committee will take a decision on the amendments to be made by January 20. The IOA AGM was conducted by Justice (retd.) Rajiv Sahai Endlaw, who was appointed by the Delhi High Court as administrator for the purpose, and assisted by former Sports Secretary Injeti Srinivas. The IOA was to hold its elective AGM in Guwahati on Sunday but the Delhi HC had passed an interim order on November 30 to maintain status quo on an application by senior advocate Rahul Mehra. On Friday, the high court asked the IOA to shift the venue of the AGM to Delhi. “The General House decided to form a six-member committee to look at what amendments need to be made in the IOA constitution before the elections are held,” IOA Mehta said. “The committee will deliberate and propose which amendments are to be made. They will be vetted through Mr. Injeti Srinivas and submitted to the Delhi High Court,” Mehta added. Mehta added the IOA will have to inform Delhi HC about Sunday’s decision of the AGM on the next hearing on Dec. 23.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ioa-forms-six-member-committee/article37994104.ece

The request made through the mantras is that Aditi must be affectionate to those who honour Punarvasu. Punarvasu is a combination of two stars — Punah and Vasu. The Vedas pray that Aditi should come repeatedly to bless those who worship Punarvasu. Aditi does not get tired of coming to bless people, because she has the kindness of a mother. Who is Aditi? The Vedas give us an idea of the role Aditi played in making the earth habitable and beautiful. Originally, the earth had no vegetation. Bhooma Devi wanted the earth to look appealing. So, she prayed to Lakshmi, also called Aditi, on a day when the star was Punarvasu. As a result, the Earth became covered with greenery. If one worships Aditi on Punarvasu, then one will be blessed with children and grandchildren. The Vedas have even offered us an easy way to get Aditi’s blessings. They say that if we listen to a narration of the merits of Punarvasu, then we will get the same benefits, which would have come to us, if we had performed a special worship of Aditi. So it is clear that Aditi is none other than Lakshmi, the Goddess of prosperity. There is further proof of this. Lord Siva tells Parvathi that Aditi is one of the names of Lakshmi. The Sanskrit word ‘diti’ means cutting off. Aditi means that which cannot be cut off. What this means is that when something is given by Lakshmi to someone as a boon, none can take it away. No one can question Her as to why She has blessed someone, or given someone a boon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/aditi-deity-of-punarvasu/article37993559.ece

And in their midst was Arun Vasu, scouring the State in search of untouched places where he could camp and windsurf. “I used to park here, pitch a tent or sleep in my Gypsy. It was a pleasure to come here. So I thought, we must do something here,” says Arun, adding that he then bought a piece of land in the area in 2008. (Arun also runs Surf Turf in Kovalam, popular for both its classes and laid back restaurant and is the chief managing director of the TT Group.) Cut to 2021: the 50-acre stretch is now a plush boutique resort called The Alampara, offering surfing, kayaking, wakeboarding and standup paddling facilities. The once barren land — formerly used as a prawn hatchery, in ruins with gaping pits — is now luxuriously green, with 500-odd trees lending shade, their leaves swaying gleefully in a wind that rarely ceases. The property boasts four luxury tents — the larger ones measuring 700 square feet can accommodate four people and the smaller ones at 600 square feet can hold three — a tented restaurant, a private lake and even a backwater lagoon with a kilometre-long sand bar across it. “The sand bar is like a private island with a simple deck and a thatched structure where people can spend a day. The only way to get there is on a boat,” explains Arun, CEO of The Alampara. Turtles come here to nest in the nights from January to April. The property also hosts 60 varieties of bird in season, he adds. Given its proximity to the majestic Alamparai fort, people can kayak to the monument or paddle up to the scenic salt pans nearby. Surf Turf is in charge of the water sports. “We are engaging three villages around, so guests can go fish with the locals, be it laying nets or throwing a line,” says Arun. And after all that activity, guests can take their fresh catch — prawns, fish, crab — to the chef who will cook it for them. “One of the highlights is that the women from villages, sit in the water, pick the clams, and break them,” says Arun. The team is connecting with surrounding villages to source local produce from the area. “We have a chef’s garden where he grows spices and greens,” says Arun, who along with his team is educating the surrounding villages on waste segregation and setting up a recycling plant for plastic waste. Local talent is being roped in to create employment opportunities. “There is a focus on sustainability with plans in place to switch entirely to solar and wind power,” says Arun, adding that the idea here is coming back to Nature, where one can unwind from their hectic life and gadgets. Where the beep of the phone and maddening echo of video calls are replaced with the chirping of crickets and twittering of birds.  The Alampara will open on December 27. It lies just before Marakkanam, 35 kilometres from Puducherry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-luxe-tent-where-guests-catch-lunch/article37994083.ece
20 December 2021||December 20 2021 00:00 IST,||Thirukkural on your tab||When was the last time you recited the Thirukkural ? If you grew up in Tamil Nadu, you probably last learnt it in school. Carnatic musician Saketharaman and popular TV personality ‘Pattimandram’ Raja are trying to re-ignite people’s fascination for this popular Tamil classic written by Thiruvalluvar. Combining their expertise in music and public speaking, their latest collaboration — titled Irukuralil Thirukkural — aims to package the text in a novel way to reach the younger generation. While Saketharaman will sing 15 selected verses, Raja will explain the kural’s meaning with a dose of humour so that it leaves a lasting impression. Visuals for Irukuralil Thirukkural, shot and worked on at Jamdub Soundlabs (a new Thoraipakkam-based studio), feature multiple cameras and drones, a rarity for Carnatic music videos. The 15-episode series, launched on December 16, will be rolled out till Thiruvallur Day (January 15) and hopes to ignite conversation around topics that Thiruvallur wrote about, which are relevant even today. The effort is an extension of the Carnatic vocalist’s previous venture Kala Siksha, which sought to sow the seeds of music in a contemporary manner. “The students learnt the Thirukkural by rote, but did not know its meaning. I wanted them to realise how many life lessons it had to offer,” recalls Saketh. It was around that time, earlier this year that he performed a Thirukkural couplet during one of his Carnatic concerts; the positive response egged him to take it on in a bigger way. “Musically, the Thirukkural gives a lot of scope, despite its brevity,” he explains. For this current project, he has chosen a couplet on neer (water), and tuned in raga Amritavarshini. Other couplets he has chosen cover socially-conscious themes, and those on friendship and love. “Apart from the musical possibilities, both from a ragam and a taalam standpoint, its duration can be custom-made; in fact, we plan to release a one-minute version on Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, and a detailed, longer version on YouTube.” His musical exploration will be followed by Raja’s short story explaining the kural. “It will not be like a discourse elaborating on the meaning, but connected to a short story derived from life experiences,” explains Raja, popular among TV audiences. Madurai-based Raja was introduced to the Tamil classic during his childhood, but discovered its various facets later in life. “Back in school, some of our Tamil teachers would sing and even act it out for us. This, despite it being featured only in two-mark questions,” he recalls. As Raja flourished in public speaking and associated himself with Tamil scholars such as Solomon Pappiah, he dug deeper into the Tamil classic. “The more I studied, the more I discovered. It presented new insights to me. The Thirukkural can be considered a teacher, guru or even a parent who teaches modern science.” Raja says there should be more attempts towards popularising such works. He says, “Tamil ilakkiyam (literature) is not something that belongs to only a few sections of people; it should be simplified for the younger generation, who need to proudly flaunt it.”  Irukuralil Thirukkural will be featured on Saketharam’s YouTube, Facebook and Instagram pages||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/thirukkural-on-your-tab/article37994082.ece

Described simply, activity-based teaching means learning by doing and application. Whether in schools or colleges, it’s a rare teacher who uses activities to teach. Most prefer the lecture method because they address large numbers and tend to explain in words rather than “demonstrate”. In a hurry to complete the syllabus, they rarely stop to investigate how much their students have learnt. This often leads to students requiring coaching. One college student told me how she attended coaching before and after college. During the lockdown, many teachers complained that students absented themselves from the classes after switching on their devices. The common refrain was that online teaching did not allow for interaction. Some instructors built in quizzes into their lectures to ensure attention, but that was more a strategy to keep them awake. Did teachers try to explain concepts through activities, or did they lecture as in offline classes? Make connections Eric Mazur, Professor of Physics at Harvard, explains the difference between lecturing and learning. To learn, he says, students must understand and assimilate concepts, be able to relate them to previous knowledge, and connect them with their experience. Above all, students must be “able to transfer one’s learning to a new context.” He was a star performer with high student ratings until he discovered his students were merely memorising and regurgitating what he was telling them. When he realised that they had not learnt to THINK (because a lecture does not allow time for students to think), he changed his pedagogy. Mazur gave the students word problems to solve by applying concepts to real-life situations. One problem was: Which would get more battered if a heavy truck collided with a stationary car, and why? The students gave varying answers, which showed much guess work at play. He then asked them to discuss the problem with their neighbour. Only after going back and forth with their arguments, did they finally arrive at the answer. Mazur had made them think, which he maintains, is the real purpose of education, Mazur proved, through his own experiments in class, that learning happens through student interaction and application of the basics. He called this “Peer or Interactive Learning” and popularised the concept. With that, he also felled the myth that a quiet class is good (https://bit.ly/3IWH28b). Experiments In India, college teachers often think games are better suited to kids in primary school, but those teaching business administration know that, unless they set activities and practical analyses to understand concepts, the programme will have no value. A marketing professor asked his students to take an object of their choice and sell it to unknown people on the roads nearby. That day, the students got their best lessons in marketing, and understood how hard it is to persuade people to buy. During the lockdown, a computer engineering teacher assigned a project to student groups to design a cycle virtually. One student spoke of how hard her peers and she worked and how much they learnt and enjoyed. “It was the best course we studied!” Active learning is useful both in offline and online teaching. Once you have chosen specific activities and problems to present the concepts, it is fascinating to observe how fast and tirelessly the time passes and how much students learn. Active Learning requires just a little creativity to prepare for the class, which can initially challenge one used to lecturing. But, with practice, it grows on you. The reward lies in seeing one’s students exceed their performance beyond expectations.
