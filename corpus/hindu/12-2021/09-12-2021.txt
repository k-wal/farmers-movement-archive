09 December 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,||Rawat, 12 others killed in T.N. chopper crash||Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, his wife Madhulika Rawat, an Army Brigadier, and 10 others were killed when an Indian Air Force helicopter carrying them crashed into a heavily wooded area of the Coonoor ghat in the Nilgiris in western Tamil Nadu on Wednesday afternoon. Investigation has begun into the cause of the crash of the Mi-17V5 helicopter, a “trusted” aircraft. The lone survivor of the accident is under treatment in a hospital. The General was on a visit to the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC) in Wellington in the Nilgiris to address the faculty and student officers of the ‘Staff Course’ when the chopper crashed barely 10 km from the landing site around 12.25 p.m. Visibility was said to be limited on Wednesday in the ghat, which rises steeply from Mettupalayam. The Coonoor river flows through a deep gorge with sheer cliff faces on both sides. Shortly past 6 p.m., the Indian Air Force (IAF) confirmed that General Rawat, his wife and 11 others on board had died. Group Captain Varun Singh, Directing Staff at the DSSC, who survived with injuries, is under treatment at the Military Hospital, Wellington. He had come to Sulur to receive General Rawat and others. Late in the evening, the Indian Army confirmed that Brigadier L.S. Lidder, Lieutenant Colonel H. Singh, Wing Commander P.S. Chauhan, Squadron Leader K. Singh, Junior Warrant Officers Das and Pradeep A., Havildar Satpal, Naik Gursewak Singh, Naik Jitender, Lance Naik Vivek and Lance Naik S. Teja were the other defence personnel killed in the crash. Sources said that Wing Commander P.S. Chauhan, Commanding Officer of the 109 Helicopter Unit (the Knights) at Air Force Station, Sulur, and Squadron Leader Kuldeep, piloted the helicopter. The CDS earlier arrived at the Sulur Air Base around 11.34 a.m. from the Palam Air Base in Delhi on an IAF Embraer aircraft with his wife and personal security officers. At 11.48 a.m., the Mi-17V5 took off with the nine passengers and five crew members, including the Wing Commander and the Squadron Leader. As rescue efforts were under way at the crash site, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh briefed the Prime Minister on the situation, and directed the IAF chief to visit the crash site. The Cabinet Committee on Security met at 6.30 p.m. Mr. Singh will make a statement on the incident in both Houses of Parliament on Thursday, a defence official said. General Rawat took over as the first CDS, the senior-most military officer of the country, on January 1, 2020 after serving as the Army chief for three years. Local people were among the first to learn of the crash, and saw the chopper engulfed in flames. Soon, defence personnel, police, and fire and rescue services personnel, aided by civilians, began rescue operations. The lack of piped water connection in the area hampered efforts to battle the blaze as the residents tried to help with buckets of water.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rawat-12-others-killed-in-tn-chopper-crash/article37906453.ece
09 December 2021||Thrissur,||Thrissur native warrant officer among killed||A. Pradeep, 38, a junior warrant officer from Ponnukkara, Puthur, in Thrissur district, was among those who were killed in the copter crash at Coonoor on Wednesday. Pradeep was the eldest son of Radhakrishnan Arakkal, who resides near the Maimbulli temple at Ponnukkara. His brother Prasad had gone to Coimbatore when they received information about the accident. However, the official confirmation of the death will come only after getting the DNA test result. Pradeep got selected to the Air Force in 2004 and later became an air crew and served the force at various places across the country. He had participated in many operations, including the one against Maoists in Uttarakhand. He was part of a rescue mission in Kerala during the floods in 2018. Pradeep’s family is living in the Air Force quarters in Coimbatore. He is survived by wife Sreelakshmi and sons Dakshan Dev, 5, and Deva Prayag, 2. His mother is Kumari. He visited Ponnukkara sometime back in connection with the treatment of his father. Neighbours recalled that they celebrated his son’s birthday that time. It is reported that he had called his mother on Tuesday and said that he had an important duty on Wednesday. Revenue Minister K. Rajan, who condoled the death of Pradeep, recalled his service as part of a rescue mission during devastating floods of 2018.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/copter-crash-victims-family-lives-in-coimbatore/article37906589.ece
09 December 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Government doctors resume agitation||Doctors in Health Service, under the banner of the Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association (KGMOA), resumed their indefinite nilpu samaram or standing protest in front of the Secretariat from Wednesday against the government not heeding their request to resolve the anomalies in their pay revision. The KGMOA said in a statement here on Wednesday that the pay revision, instead of a proportional increase in salaries, had resulted in the denial of many allowances and benefits that the doctors were currently receiving. The Health department’s human resources are woefully inadequate to meet a health system crisis of the scale precipitated by COVID-19. Yet the doctors were willing to put in extra hours and give full backing to the government in its efforts to check disease transmission and provide medical care for all. Apart from COVID care, they also managed non-COVID care and other routines public health activities. Yet, the government’s denial of risk allowance to doctors, while snatching away their existing benefits too, was deplorable. Though this had been brought to the government’s attention several times over the past 10 months, it had not paid heed to the grievances of doctors, the KGMOA said. Under the terms of the new pay revision, an MBBS doctor joining Health Service as assistant surgeon after April 1, 2021 would have a basic pay that was Rs. 8,500 less than the current scale. The pay revision order made no mention of the time-bound higher grade that the doctors were receiving since ages. Remaining silent Though the government had said a special order on career advancement scheme for doctors would be brought out within a month, the government had chosen to remain silent even a year after pay revision. The government stopped personal pay, ratio promotion, and charge allowance while restricting compensatory allowance. Rural and difficult rural allowance were also not revised. Though these anomalies in pay revision, amongst many others, had been brought to the attention of the government several times over these past 10 months, the government chose to ignore these, the KGMOA said. The KGMOA had launched their nilpu samaram on November 1 but it was postponed following the government’s assurances that their demands would be considered soon. The strike, which was resumed on Wednesday, would be continued for an indefinite period, with members from districts taking the lead on each day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/government-doctors-resume-agitation/article37906775.ece
09 December 2021||Mumbai,||RBI retains accommodative stance, keeps rates unchanged||The Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee on Wednesday opted to keep benchmark interest rates unchanged and retained its “accommodative” stance. It cited “considerable uncertainty” on how the growth-inflation dynamics would pan out in the near term, and concern that the ongoing economic recovery was “not yet strong enough to be self-sustaining and durable”. “The recovery of aggregate demand hinges on private investment, which is still lagging,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said. “The MPC regarded the accentuation of headwinds emanating from global developments as the main risk to the domestic outlook, which is now somewhat clouded by the Omicron variant,” he added. The fact that activity, including private consumption, still below pre-pandemic levels, was still catching up, also made it necessary to maintain policy support to ensure that the recovery becomes durable and broad-based. “Consequently, the policy repo rate remains unchanged at 4%, and the stance remains accommodative as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward,” Mr. Das said. Equity investors cheered the central bank’s decision to stay growth-supportive with the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex and the NSE Nifty 50 index both climbing more than 1.7%. “It seems the RBI does not want to tinker much with the policy rates now given the nascent economic recovery and still looming uncertainty of the pandemic,” said Amar Ambani, head of institutional equities, Yes Securities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rbi-retains-accommodative-stance-keeps-rates-unchanged/article37906624.ece

09 December 2021||New Delhi,||Vacuum at top level of the military hierarchy||The tragic and untimely death of the country’s first Chief of the Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, in a helicopter crash has created a vacuum at the highest levels of India’s military hierarchy. The ambitious reform of the armed forces into integrated theatre commands, for which Gen. Rawat had set ambitious targets, also remains incomplete. Gen. Rawat took over as the 27th Army chief on December 31, 2016 and as the first CDS on January 1, 2020. As he stepped down as the Army chief after three years and before he turned 62, his tenure as the CDS was till March 2023. The age limit for the CDS’s post is 65 years with no fixed tenure defined. After Gen. Rawat, the senior-most officer in the military is Army chief General M.M. Naravane, who has tenure till April 2022. He took over as the 28th Army chief from Gen. Rawat on December 31, 2019 and is distinctly senior to the other two Service chiefs. The CDS wears several hats, which include Secretary of the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) in the Defence Ministry, permanent Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee, and the Principal Adviser to the Defence Minister. After the appointment of the CDS, the armed forces were brought within the ambit of the DMA, which also deals with works relating to the three Services, and with procurement exclusive to the Services, except capital acquisitions which remains with the Department of Defence. The broad mandate of the CDS includes bringing about “jointness” in “operations, logistics, transport, training, support services, communications, repairs and maintenance of the three Services, within three years of the first CDS assuming office”. Gen. Rawat was working towards bringing evolving consensus between the three Services on integrated theatre commands, which would be the biggest reorganisation of the armed forces since Independence. The task falls on the next CDS to build consensus and take the reorganisation forward.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vacuum-at-top-level-of-the-military-hierarchy/article37906187.ece
09 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Omicron patients should be treated in designated facilities’||The Health Ministry on Wednesday directed the States to ensure that all cases that have tested positive for Omicron should be treated at designated COVID-19 facilities with a separate isolation area marked only for patients with the new variant. Directing State Health Departments to ensure that no cross-infection takes place, the Ministry said in its letter signed by Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan that adequate precautions had to be taken by healthcare workers to prevent transmission between them and other patients. The States have been told to quickly track the primary and secondary contacts of positive cases on “mission mode”, and test them. “It is critical to track all contacts of such cases, quarantine them without delay, and test them as per the guidelines,” Rajesh Bhushan, Health Secretary, said in a letter. He has suggested that the States utilise the e-Sanjeevani telemedicine platform and call centres, and plan home visits by teams to the contacts under home isolation and quarantine. Close watch Omicron-positive patients have been reported in Maharashtra, Delhi, Karnataka and Rajasthan. The Government has asked States to keep a close watch on new clusters of COVID-19 positive cases, vaccination breakthrough cases, and reinfection cases, and ensure prompt investigation of such events by their rapid response teams. “They should send all positive samples from these events to designated genome sequencing labs of INSACOG,” Mr. Bhushan added. The Health Ministry has also said that it would be difficult to determine the true level of infection spread in the absence of sufficient testing. States have to be on guard due to the onset of winter, increased pollution in some parts of the country, and the prevalence of influenza and severe and acute respiratory illnesses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/omicron-patients-should-be-treated-in-designated-facilities/article37906200.ece
09 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farmers likely to call off their year-long agitation today||Thousands of farmers who have been protesting on the outskirts of Delhi for over a year are likely to end their agitation at noon on Thursday, as their leaders have decided to accept the Centre’s revised proposal to resolve their pending demands if it is sent in an official format. In a major overnight concession, the Central and State Governments have agreed to withdraw almost half a lakh cases filed against protesting farmers with immediate effect. “Samyukt Kisan Morcha confirms [that it has] received a revised draft proposal from the Government of India and that a consensus has been arrived at within SKM, accepting the proposal,” said a statement by union leaders, issued after a day of hectic negotiations both with the Centre and among the different farmer factions. “Now, a formal communication signed on the Government’s letterhead is awaited. The SKM will meet again tomorrow [Thursday] at 12 noon, at Singhu border, to take a formal decision thereafter to lift the morchas.” Awaiting official letter Speaking to journalists after the SKM’s meeting, leaders emphasised that they were still awaiting an official letter. “This is just a draft proposal on a piece of white paper. We will wait until we get an official signed communication, on the Government letterhead. Until then, there can be no decision to disband the agitation,” said Yudhvir Singh, general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union faction under the leadership of Uttar Pradesh leader Rakesh Tikait. However, a number of leaders privately said the majority of their demands had been accepted, and they expected to head home after the meeting. The revised proposal, sent on Wednesday morning, includes two major changes to cater to the farmers’ objections to the initial draft proposal received on Tuesday. Conditions dropped The Centre has dropped all conditions regarding the withdrawal of cases filed against protesters and promised that cases filed in the Union Territories including Delhi will be withdrawn “with immediate effect”. The Governments of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana have also agreed to do so, and the Centre will appeal to other States to follow suit. In the initial proposal, cases were to be withdrawn only once the agitation ended. Farmers estimate that 48,000 cases have been filed against them over the last year. With regard to the committee announced by the PM, the revised proposal, seen by The Hindu , says it will have a specific “mandate on how to ensure that all farmers get minimum support prices”. It also assured that there will not be any reduction in the amount of crops that the Government is procuring at MSP rates. The Centre clarified that the SKM leaders would be included among farmer representatives on the committee, but did not accede to the demand that other farm organisations should be excluded. No changes were made to the proposal’s clauses regarding compensation for those who died during the protest, the draft Electricity Bill or the criminalisation of stubble burning. There was no mention at all of the farmers’ sixth demand for the dismissal of Minister of State for Home Ashish Mishra Teni for his alleged role in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. “It is very clear that we will have to launch a nationwide struggle for MSP, and also for loan waivers,” said All India Kisan Sabha president Ashok Dhawale, who was part of the SKM’s five-member negotiating team.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-likely-to-call-off-their-year-long-agitation-today/article37906441.ece
09 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Omicron blunts immune response more, say reports||A slew of laboratory studies suggest that Omicron dramatically blunts the immune system’s response to the coronavirus in those inoculated with the Pfizer vaccine, more than any other variant so far. Though the studies don’t dent existing vaccines’ claims at protecting against severe COVID-19 and death, they suggest that booster shots may be required to protect to keep antibody levels up, or vaccines may have to be updated to account for newer variants. The three studies are out of South Africa, Germany and Sweden and they all independently tested how antibody numbers in those vaccinated with the Pfizer mRNA vaccine were influenced when exposed to the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. These are laboratory studies and are done by extracting plasma from the blood of vaccinated people and tested in petri dishes. Some of them had previously been infected with the coronavirus. The researchers also studied if the antibody levels in those previously infected and vaccinated differed from those who had antibodies solely as a result of vaccination. The first study out of Durban showed a nearly 40-fold decline in neutralising antibodies when blood plasma of those vaccinated and with a previous infection (with the original Wuhan strain) were tested against the Omicron variant. Another study out of Germany’s Institute of Virology found a 37-fold decrease in neutralising antibodies. This time, the comparison was in those previously infected with the Delta variant and vaccinated and when compared to the Omicron variant. The final study out of the Karolinska Insitute in Sweden showed the reduction in neutralisation with Omicron was seven-fold, which is significantly lower than observed in previous studies. A key difference in the Swedish study was that they used a pseudo virus, as opposed to the other two studies that employed a live virus and therefore a more realistic picture of how the virus might behave in the body. By comparison, earlier studies on the neutralisation reduction by Beta and Delta variant have shown they reduced antibodies no more than three-fold.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/omicron-blunts-immune-response-more-say-reports/article37906204.ece
09 December 2021||New Delhi,||Opposition blames Goyal for impasse||Opposition leaders from the Rajya Sabha boycotted the proceedings for the day to sit in solidarity with their 12 colleagues who have been staging a protest at the Gandhi statue in Parliament against their suspension for the last eight days now. The leaders, speaking to The Hindu , blamed Leader of the House Piyush Goyal accusing him of “inflexibility” leaving little room for compromise. At the protest site, Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said tendering an apology remains out of question. He said though Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu asked him and Mr. Goyal to sit together and solve the issue on Wednesday, there has been no outreach from the Government. “It is only in the House that they speak about reaching out. Outside the House they blame, criticise and humiliate us. They have no moral right to hold the Opposition responsible for this impasse,” Mr. Kharge said. Congress Rajya Sabha chief whip Jairam Ramesh said he visited the homes of the Opposition leaders, met Mr. Goyal, Mr. Naidu and Deputy Chairman Harivansh to explore options to resolve the deadlock. “Chairman Naidu’s position in all fairness is not unreasonable. He has appealed to both sides to come together and talk. But I must say Mr. Goyal has taken fundamentalist position leaving little room for a compromise,” Mr. Ramesh said. NCP patriarch Sharad Pawar and Samajwadi leader Akhilesh Yadav also participated in the protest. Along with the slogans, the lawmakers sang songs as they sat through the day on the grass in the shadow of the Gandhi statue.Various leaders have been taking turns to bring in food for their protesting colleagues. Many key leaders including Kapil Sibal, Derek O’Brien and others skipped the protest for various reasons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/opposition-blames-goyal-for-impasse/article37906193.ece
09 December 2021||New Delhi,||Sena turns UPA votary, wants Cong. to take lead||Former BJP ally, the Shiv Sena has called for rebuilding the United Progressive Alliance to end the debate started by Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee’s “no-UPA” comment and urged the Congress to firmly take the leadership of the alliance. A day after he had a one-hour meeting with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Sena leader Sanjay Raut told The Hindu , “If the UPA is strengthened, then people will not ask these questions.” Mr. Raut met Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday. Sources said Mr. Gandhi was expected to travel to Mumbai to meet Maharashtra Chief Minister Udhav Thackeray. With the Trinamool questioning the Congress’s credentials to lead an anti-BJP front, Mr. Raut, when asked about whose responsibility it would be to rebuild the UPA, said, “The responsibility falls on all of us but more than any one it is on the Congress because they are currently holding the reins of the alliance.” The Maha Vikas Agadi has completed two years in power, belying the expectations of sceptics both within and outside the coalition, predicting its early demise. Mr. Gandhi himself was opposed to the Congress allying with the Sena. Two years on, the Sena has emerged as one of the key defendants of the Congress and Mr. Gandhi. Sena mouthpiece Saamana , edited by Mr. Raut, on Sunday issued a strong rebuttal to Ms. Banerjee’s remarks questioning the existence of the UPA. The editorial argued that constructing a parallel opposition group to the UPA will only strengthen the BJP and the “fascist” forces. “It is understandable that [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi and his BJP feel that the Congress should be wiped out. This is part of their agenda. But it is more dangerous when those fighting against Mr. Modi and his ideology think that the Congress should be wiped out,” the editorial said. According to informed sources, the Sena is amenable to formally joining the UPA. But the former BJP ally is not simply going to walk over to the UPA. The Congress, many in the party feel, will have to manage the semantics and optics. It needs to be seen as making an effort to reconstruct and call new allies into the UPA. “We cannot comment right now on whether our party will join the UPA. The fact is that there is no invitation from the Congress right now. The onus is on Mr. Gandhi, who has to go to each and every ally to bring them on board,” another Sena leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sena-turns-upa-votary-wants-cong-to-take-lead/article37906210.ece
09 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cabinet nod for Ken-Betwa project||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the funding and implementation of the Ken-Betwa river interlinking project at a cost of Rs. 44,605 crore at the 2020-21 price level. The Centre would fund Rs. 39,317 crore for the project, with Rs. 36,290 crore as a grant and Rs. 3,027 crore as a loan. The project involves transferring of water from the Ken river to the Betwa river through the construction of Daudhan dam and a canal linking the two rivers, the Lower Orr Project, Kotha Barrage and the Bina Complex Multipurpose Project. The project is slated to irrigate 10.62 lakh hectares annually, provide drinking water supply to 62 lakh people and generate 103 MW of hydropower and 27 MW of solar power. The project is proposed to be ready in eight years. “The project will be of immense benefit to the water-starved Bundelkhand region, spread across Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. This project will provide enormous benefits to the districts of Panna, Tikamgarh, Chhatarpur, Sagar, Damoh, Datia, Vidisha, Shivpuri and Raisen of Madhya Pradesh and Banda, Mahoba, Jhansi and Lalitpur of Uttar Pradesh,” a statement noted. “The project is expected to boost socio-economic prosperity in the backward Bundelkhand region on account of increased agricultural activities and employment generation. It would also help in arresting distress migration from this region,” it said. Many hurdles Several obstacles have dogged the project. For one, the project will partly submerge the Panna Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh and affect the habitat of vultures and jackals. After years of protests, it was finally cleared by the apex wildlife regulator, the National Board for Wildlife, in 2016. Then Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh could not agree on how water would be shared, particularly in the non-monsoonal months. They reached an agreement in March. The original project was conceived in two distinct phases but now they are learnt to be combined.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cabinet-nod-for-ken-betwa-project/article37906445.ece

Special judge D.E. Kothalikar permitted Ms. Bharadwaj, who was present in the court, to submit temporary cash security valid for three months. On December 1, the Bombay High Court granted her bail and directed the special NIA court to decide her bail conditions on Wednesday. The central agency moved in appeal against the bail before the Supreme Court which dismissed the appeal on Tuesday. Citing bail conditions, the NIA court on Wednesday directed Ms. Bharadwaj to not leave Mumbai without the court’s permission and inform the agency and the court about her place of residence, her contact number and those of her relatives. The conditions included giving the addresses of at least three blood relatives. She was also directed to attend proceedings of the trial, and not make any statement regarding the proceedings to anyone from the media. Advocate Yug Chaudhry, appearing for Ms. Bharadwaj, told the court that she was a practising lawyer in Chhattisgarh and needed to get back to work for a living and hence should be allowed to travel between Mumbai, Chhattisgarh and Delhi. The court said she could practise in Nagpur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sudha-to-be-freed-on-cash-bond-in-bhima-koregaon-case/article37906443.ece
09 December 2021||New Delhi,||RS passes Bills on ART and surrogacy||The Rajya Sabha passed two Bills to regulate and supervise assisted reproductive technology clinics and surrogacy on Wednesday. The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill (ART), 2021 was passed by the Lok Sabha on December 1. It was passed by a voice vote in the Upper House. Amid sloganeering by the Opposition members who are protesting against the suspension of 12 members, the House also passed the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2020 with amendments. The proposed Bill was earlier passed by the Lok Sabha but the Rajya Sabha had referred it to a Select Committee. It will now go back to the Lok Sabha for approval. Replying to a discussion on both the Bills taken up together, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said most of the recommendations of the Select Committee have been included in the surrogacy Bill. Both the Bills seek to curb unethical practices related to issues like sex selection and exploitation of surrogate mothers. The provisions include both monetary penalty and jail terms for violations. The Bill related to surrogacy aims to constitute a National Surrogacy Board, State Surrogacy Boards and appointment of appropriate authorities for regulation of the practice and process of surrogacy. The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill, 2021 is for the regulation and supervision of the assisted reproductive technology clinics and the assisted reproductive technology banks, and prevention of misuse.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bills-on-art-and-surrogacy-passed/article37906212.ece
09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Farmers likely to call off agitation today||As in the initial proposal, the Centre clarified that the SKM leaders would be included among farmer representatives on the committee, but did not accede to the demand that other farm organisations should be excluded. No changes were made to the proposal’s clauses regarding compensation for those who died during the protest, the draft Electricity Bill or the criminalisation of stubble burning. There was no mention at all of the farmers’ sixth demand for the dismissal of Minister of State for Home Ashish Mishra Teni for his alleged role in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. Among leaders from U.P. and Maharashtra, areas where existing MSP procurement is not as strong as in Punjab and Haryana, there is a sense of resignation that their concrete demand for an MSP law has been diluted into a mere committee to discuss the issue. “The Punjab farmers may have achieved their major goals, but for the rest of the country, their problems are not yet over. It is very clear that we will have to launch a nationwide struggle for MSP, and also for loan waivers,” said All India Kisan Sabha president Ashok Dhawale, who was part of the SKM’s five-member negotiating team. “The Punjab farmers will also have a stake in the MSP struggle, as we are fighting for the Swaminathan Commission formula to be adopted,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-likely-to-call-off-agitation-today/article37906599.ece
09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Farmers likely to call off agitation today||Speaking to journalists after the SKM’s meeting, leaders emphasised that they were still awaiting an official letter. “This is just a draft proposal on a piece of white paper. We will wait until we get an official signed communication, on the Government letterhead. Until then, there can be no decision to disband the agitation,” said Yudhvir Singh, general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union faction under the leadership of Uttar Pradesh leader Rakesh Tikait. However, a number of leaders privately said the majority of their demands had been accepted, and they expected to head home after Thursday’s noon meeting. The revised proposal, sent on Wednesday morning, includes two major changes to cater to the farmers’ objections to the initial draft proposal received on Tuesday. The Centre has dropped all conditions regarding the withdrawal of cases filed against protesters and promised that cases filed in the Union Territories including Delhi will be withdrawn “with immediate effect”. The Governments of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana have also agreed to do so, and the Centre will appeal to other States to follow suit. In the initial proposal, cases were to be withdrawn only once the agitation ended. Farmers estimate that 48,000 cases have been filed against them over the last year. With regard to the committee announced by the Prime Minister, the revised proposal, seen by The Hindu , says it will have a specific “mandate on how to ensure that all farmers get minimum support prices”. It also assured that there will not be any reduction in the amount of crops that the Government is procuring at MSP rates. As in the initial proposal, the Centre clarified that the SKM leaders would be included among farmer representatives on the committee, but did not accede to the demand that other farm organisations should be excluded. No changes were made to the proposal’s clauses regarding compensation for those who died during the protest, the draft Electricity Bill or the criminalisation of stubble burning. There was no mention at all of the farmers’ sixth demand for the dismissal of Minister of State for Home Ashish Mishra Teni for his alleged role in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. MSP demand remains Among leaders from U.P. and Maharashtra, areas where existing MSP procurement is not as strong as in Punjab and Haryana, there is a sense of resignation that their concrete demand for an MSP law has been diluted into a mere committee to discuss the issue. “The Punjab farmers may have achieved their major goals, but for the rest of the country, their problems are not yet over. It is very clear that we will have to launch a nationwide struggle for MSP, and also for loan waivers,” said All India Kisan Sabha president Ashok Dhawale, who was part of the SKM’s five-member negotiating team. “The Punjab farmers will also have a stake in the MSP struggle, as we are fighting for the Swaminathan Commission formula [which involves an increase in MSP] to be adopted,” he added. Even as this agitation winds to a largely successful end, leaders emphasised that the SKM itself must not be disbanded. “The farmers of the nation have united under this banner, and that unity is our strength. The SKM is a powerful force right now, and must be expanded and strengthened,” said Abhimanyu Kohar, a leader of the Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh. He said any decision on the SKM’s continuing role in campaigning for farmers’ interests in the upcoming U.P. and Uttarakhand elections would be taken at the leadership meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-likely-to-call-off-agitation-today/article37906196.ece

As the Indian Air Force confirmed that Gen. Rawat had passed away in the crash, condolences poured in from all corners. “A very sad day for the nation as we have lost our CDS, General Bipin Rawat Ji in a very tragic accident. He was one of the bravest soldiers, who has served the motherland with utmost devotion. His exemplary contributions & commitment cannot be put into words. I am deeply pained,” Union Home Minister Amit Shah said in a tweet. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar recalled working with Gen. Rawat. “Deeply shocked at tragic demise of CDS General Bipin Rawat and his wife. We worked closely together in the last few years. It is a huge loss to the nation,” he said in a tweet. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi extended his condolences to Gen. Rawat’s family. “I extend my condolences to the family of Gen. Bipin Rawat and his wife.

The 22nd Law Commission was constituted by the Government on February 21, 2020. However, no progress has been made in the appointments till date and the short affidavit filed by the Law Ministry in the court does not explain the reasons for the day. The Government invoked the ‘doctrine of separation of power’, which says that one arm of governance should not encroach into that of another. The Government also responded to a plea that the Law Commission should be brought under a statute with definite terms on appointments, its functions and powers spelt out. The Centre made it clear that there was no such proposal to make the Law Commission a statutory body.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/law-panel-appointments-under-consideration/article37906181.ece
09 December 2021||New Delhi,||Nod for Bill on ex-judges’ pension calculation||The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed a Bill which seeks to clarify the process of counting the age of retired judges to determine when they will get enhanced pension. Replying to the debate on The High Court and Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Amendment Bill, 2021, Law Minister Kiren Rijiju told the House that the measure did not in any way affect the salary and pension of judges but only inserts an explanatory note to make the legislative intent clear about the additional quantum of pension. Additional quantum of pension to retired judges of High Courts and the Supreme Court is being sanctioned on completing the age of 80, 85, 90, 95 and 100 years as the case may be, but there was a confusion about the process of calculating the age. Talking about the high pendency of cases, he said the Centre was focussing on improving the physical infrastructure of the lower judiciary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nod-for-bill-on-ex-judges-pension-calculation/article37906188.ece
09 December 2021||New Delhi,||Sonia targets Govt. over price rise, farm issue||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday targeted the Narendra Modi Government over ‘spiralling’ prices of essential commodities, farmers’ demands and tension at the borders, and asserted that her party will insist on a discussion in Parliament on the challenges confronting Indian agriculture, loss of livelihoods by millions of people and the situation at the border. Addressing a general body meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP), Ms. Gandhi also expressed deep anguish over the killing of 14 civilians in Nagaland and said the Centre’s regret is not enough and suggested that the Centre should ensure such ‘ghastly’ incidents don’t recur and families of the victims get justice at the earliest. Calling the suspension of the 12 Opposition members from the Rajya Sabha as ‘outrageous,’ Ms. Gandhi said, “It violates both the Constitution and the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Council of States”. Congress MPs of both Houses of Parliament including former party chief Rahul Gandhi, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, Deputy Leader Anand Sharma, and Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, were present for the meeting that took place at the Central Hall of Parliament. Ms. Gandhi started her address by referring to the rollback of the three farm laws and said that they were been repealed “just as undemocratically as they were pushed through without a discussion”. She said the tenacity of the farmers forced the Government to climbdown from its arrogant position. Ms. Gandhi then focused on the price rise of edible oil, pulses, vegetable, basic industrial goods, cement and steel and questioned the Government’s claims of economic revival. “I cannot understand how and why the Modi Government is so insensitive and continues to deny the seriousness of the problem,” she said. Without directly referring to China, the Congress president said that it is “extraordinary” that the Government does not allocate any time for discussing the issue in Parliament. “The Government may not want to answer difficult questions but it is the right and duty of the Opposition to seek clarifications and explanations,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sonia-targets-govt-over-prices-farm-issue/article37906191.ece

Soon, defence personnel, police, and fire and rescue services personnel, aided by civilians, began rescue operations. Nilgiris Collector S.P. Amrith, Superintendent of Police Ashish Rawat and Inspector General of Police (West Zone) R. Sudhakar rushed to the spot to take stock of rescue efforts. The lack of a piped water connection to the area hampered efforts to battle the blaze as local residents tried to help with water filled in buckets. The rescue operation stretched on for three hours. Four persons were pulled out with critical burn injuries and rushed to the hospital. The bodies of the deceased were retrieved with difficulty. The final body was retrieved from the wreckage at 3.30 p.m. Top military officials visited the spot to ascertain the cause of the incident. Sources said the Lieutenant Colonel, two Naiks, two Lance Naiks and one Havildar were part of General Rawat’s security protocol. The two JWOs were from Sulur. PM expresses anguish Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his anguish over the helicopter crash and the deaths of Gen. Rawat, his wife and other military personnel. “They served India with utmost diligence. My thoughts are with the bereaved families,” he said on Twitter. Mr. Modi tweeted: “Gen Bipin Rawat was an outstanding soldier. A true patriot, he greatly contributed to modernising our armed forces and security apparatus. His insights and perspectives on strategic matters were exceptional. His passing away has saddened me deeply. Om Shanti.” In a statement, Army Chief General M.M. Naravane and all ranks of the Army expressed their deepest grief and sorrow over the untimely demise of Gen. Rawat, Mrs. Rawat (president of the Defence Wives Welfare Association), and other military personnel. Gen. Rawat was a visionary who initiated far-reaching reforms in the Indian military’s higher defence organisation and was “instrumental in creating the foundation of India’s joint theatre commands and giving impetus to the increased indigenisation of military equipment, a legacy which will be carried on and strengthened by successive generations,” the Army statement said.

09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Association with Prakriti||It is repeatedly taught in the Gita that spiritual awareness is rooted in the knowledge that the individual identity of every being is always associated with the cosmic. In other words, atma tatva jnana alone can free us from the sorrows and mental tensions of this world, pointed out Swamini Satyavratananda Saraswati in a discourse. In the thirteenth chapter, this is discussed as Purusha Prakriti Viveka. The Purusha, which is the ‘I’ who is changeless, and Prakriti, which is the changing aspect in our lives, can be seen as the two sides of the same coin. Without Prakriti, Purusha cannot manifest, and without Purusha, Prakriti can’t exist. This peculiar combination is the basis of the experience of joy and sorrow. Atma is the changeless seer (drashta), the sakshi chaitanya and is the essence of consciousness. Its mere presence illumines the mind, body and intellect, and enables the beings to experience the world. But it can also be seen as the enjoyer (bhokta), when it thus experiences the world through the mind. So, there are two seers or knowers, where one is the atma, the real seer, and the other is the ahamkara, comprising the mind, body and intellect, which represents only a duplicate self and is not the real seer. The latter borrows from the former, the atma or sakshi chaitanya. Since the mind belongs to Prakriti, the changing factor, it undergoes modifications. The human mind is known as antakarana as it performs an internal function to enable interaction of the sense organs with the sense objects of the external world. In its involvement with the novelty, beauty, colour, in prakriti with which it is closely associated, it misses the real seer, the atma. This is similar to the way we get carried away by bulbs that eclipse the presence of electricity, the source of light.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/association-with-prakriti/article37906202.ece

He said that Aruppukottai Municipality, with 87,722 population on 14.96 sq. km, does not have underground drainage facility in all 36 wards. So, a septic tank sludge removed from houses, commercial and industrial units are illegally dumped in vacant places by septic tank lorries at night. The faecal sludge treatment plant will be a solution to this practice that ruins the environment. While State Government has given Rs. 2.68 crore as its share, the Centre has given Rs. 1.32 crore for the scheme implemented under Integrated Urban Development Mission. The sludge removed by the septic tanks would be dumped at the new facility which will treat it through a series of process within 15 days, said the Municipal Commissioner G. Ashok Kumar.

09 December 2021||Bengaluru,TAMIL NADU||HC directs Lokayukta to complete inquiry in four months against 61 assistant public prosecutors||The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday directed the Lokayukta to complete within four months the disciplinary proceedings initiated against 61 assistant public prosecutors (APPs)/assistant government pleaders (AGPs), against whom charge sheets were filed for the alleged fraud and forgery in the 2012 selection process. Also, the High Court directed the trial court proceed as per the law based on the charge sheet filed by the police and complete the criminal proceedings expeditiously. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi issued the directions while disposing the PIL petitions seeking independent inquiry into the 2012 selection and questioning the correctness of selection of 197 candidates while alleging fraud, forgery of signatures of some of the judges of the trial courts and the High Court during the process of selection. The fraud was committed allegedly in connivance with then member secretary of the selection committee and the administrative officer of Directorate of Prosecution. While leaving open the issue of challenge to the correctness of selection 197 candidates in the tainted process, the Bench said that there was no need to continue the petitions as the investigation agency, based on a private complaint lodged before a trial court, had registered the First Information Report and submitted the charge sheet on June 12, 2017, against the accused persons, including 61 of the 197 selected candidates. The Bench also noticed that a supplementary charge sheet was filed in March, 2018, and the government had entrusted the process of disciplinary inquiries against the accused APPs/AGPs to the Lokayukta. The Bench also recorded the submissions of the government that 61 accused APPs/AGPs were suspended from service and not allowed to discharge their duties.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-directs-lokayukta-to-complete-inquiry-in-four-months-against-61-assistant-public-prosecutors/article37906219.ece
09 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||WRD to continue water release from reservoirs till end of monsoon||The Water Resources Department plans to continue water release from the major city reservoirs till the end of the Northeast monsoon. Though the reservoirs have not received rainfall for the past few days, they continue to get inflow from catchment areas upstream. WRD officials said the storage of the five reservoirs that contribute a large share of drinking water supply is being maintained at a considerable level this month. The combined storage of the reservoirs, including Poondi, stood at 10,582 million cubic feet (mcft) against their capacity of 11,757 mcft. “We have to build up the storage of the reservoirs to nearly 90% of their capacity. It was decided to have the floodgates open till the end of monsoon as more rain spells may occur. A minimum amount of water of 100 cusecs is being discharged from Red Hills and Chembarambakkam lake. This would have residents downstream on alert as water release may go up during rain,” said an official. This monsoon, the department was able to manage resources and build storage due to measured operation of the reservoirs during heavy inflow. Decisions on water discharge were taken based on the forecast of the Meteorological department and Central Water Commission. “We released a maximum of 3,000 cusecs into Adyar river from Chembarambakkam reservoir. Flash floods could be avoided. Kosasthalaiyar river carried more floodwater as it received heavy inflow consistently for many days,” the official said. On Wednesday, about 1,940 cusecs was released from Poondi reservoir as it continued to get over 2,600 cusecs of water as inflow from waterways upstream. The department is maintaining water level at 34.53 feet against its full level of 35 feet. Once the rain recedes, storage in other reservoirs like Chembarambakkam would further be stepped up. Water is also being diverted from Poondi reservoir to other waterbodies through the Link canal. For the second time in a month, the department is diverting floodwater from the Kosasthalaiyar to flush the polluted stretch of the Cooum river. Water flowing in the Link canal is routed to the Cooum river near Aranvoyal in Tiruvallur district. The river is already getting 700 cusecs from tanks upstream and another 300 cusecs of flow is added from the Link canal. The continuous flow would help clean up the river and also recharge groundwater level in the surrounding areas. Moreover, checkdams downstream of Korattur anicut in the Cooum have also filled up during this monsoon. The department plans to divert flow into the Cooum river till Pongal to sustain its flow till the mouth, officials said.  We have to build up the storage of the reservoirs to nearly 90% of their capacity. It has been decided to have the floodgates open till the end of monsoon as more rain spells may occur||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wrd-to-continue-water-release-from-reservoirs-till-end-of-monsoon/article37906548.ece
09 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stalin demands withdrawal of Electricity Amendment Bill, 2021||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, seeking his urgent intervention to defer the proposed amendments to the Electricity Act, 2003 as they had “far-reaching detrimental implications for the State Discoms”. Mr. Stalin said the amendments to the Bill propose to de-license the distribution sector of electricity by introducing the concept of ‘Distribution Company’ and the deemed registration of any such company after 60 days of application. “This step will give unbridled access to private players to supply power to select consumers and enable them to use the already laid out distribution network of the public sector power companies. While the State PSUs carry the burden of investment in such networks, these private companies are being allowed to use the same without any investment or any responsibility to maintain them,” Mr. Stalin said. Cherry-picking He said such new private distribution companies would be able to selectively access all the high-value customers in commercially viable areas, which would amount to granting them “a right to cherry-pick profitable ventures without any social obligations” while the State public sector power utilities will be left with the obligation to supply power to subsidised categories of consumers and to service the economically backward and rural areas. Further, the proposed amendments to Sections 26, 28 and 32 by giving the National Load Despatch Centre (NLDC) powers such as the integrated operation of the power system, optimum scheduling of electricity across different States and regions, monitoring of grid operations and giving directions to the Regional Load Despatch Centre (RLDC) or the State Load Despatch Centre (SLDC), would amount to indirectly controlling many significant functionalities of the SLDCs or Discoms of State governments, the Chief Minister said. He said the penalty to be levied under Section 142 for contravening the provisions of the Act or the directions or orders of the [Electricity] Commission was also high. “In any case, it may not be appropriate to cover the non-fulfilment of Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) under Section 142, considering that renewable power availability is infirm by nature, and hence, a power utility may not be in a position to achieve its RPO due to various genuine reasons like disruptions due to natural calamities,” he said. Mr. Stalin asked the Prime Minister to personally intervene to withdraw the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and allow the State-owned distribution licensees to continue to supply quality power at affordable rates to the people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-demands-withdrawal-of-electricity-amendment-bill-2021/article37906532.ece
09 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Students’ unruly behaviour sparks concern||Despite the best efforts of the police to wean students away from violence, there have been frequent quarrels among groups, that too in public places. Unmindful of the police advice, students continue to travel dangerously on footboards of buses or trains. One such case happened at Avadi bus stand to the shock of the onlookers. Two groups of girls from a government school recently clashed and this went viral on social media. While over 30 girls were standing at the busy bus stand, two groups of girls in school uniform slapped each other. Though the onlookers tried to intervene, the girls continued with their scuffle. “There is no formal complaint yet. However, we are inquiring into the reason behind their clash and whether they had any personal problems. We may hold counselling with the children and their parents if required,” said a senior police officer. Similarly, on December 2, a few school boys travelled in a dangerous manner on an MTC bus (route number T-110) from Tiruvallur to Meyyur. A few boys were standing on the roof of the moving bus while some were seen hanging from the footboard. Periyapalayam police booked a case in this regard. The students were released only after assurance from parents that they would not indulge in such acts. Other students who were left out of the inquiry would be summoned soon, according to the police. Arms Act invoked Last Monday, eight college students were caught carrying a long knife near Tiruvallur railway station. The students were returning home after attending a marriage reception. They were booked under the Arms Act but were handed over to their parents after a warning, considering the students’ future. However, the case against them is still pending. In another video that surfaced on social media, a school girl and a boy were seen running close to the railway platform to catch a moving train and then scratching their legs on the platform after boarding in Kavarapettai police limits. The police let them off with a warning. At railway stations, the police have displayed pictures of people who lost their arms and limbs in accidents to create awareness. Tiruvallur Superintendent of Police R.V. Varun Kumar said: “We called the students and held a meeting with their parents. The students were released in the interest of their future after issuing them a strong warning. Now, nine students are booked in two days and investigation is on. We warn the erring students to desist from such acts or otherwise, we will arrest them.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/students-unruly-behaviour-sparks-concern/article37906558.ece
09 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Parts of Thiruninravur waterlogged for 20 days||Rains may have abated for a week now in the city. But, residents of a few areas in Thiruninravur continue to suffer as water has not receded in their locality for over 20 days now. Muthamizh Nagar, Periyar Nagar and Sudesi Nagar are under sheets of water after recent heavy rain. Residents have to walk in knee-deep water or use makeshift boats to reach schools or workplace from streets like Ambedkar Street and Kamarajar Street. Mohammed Jaffer visits the area daily to transport residents and schoolchildren in makeshift boats till the main road or subway. “Some streets are heavily waterlogged and I have to walk in waist-deep water. Some people pay for the trips during morning and evening hours,” he said. Several residents have vacated from the area as water had entered their houses. G. Saravana Kumar said he had to extend leave for a fortnight now to take care of his parents. “I have rented out another house as water has entered our house. We may have to stay in rented house for a few months till the water recedes. I have packed most of the belongings and left them on the loft,” he said. Residents complained that the area gets waterlogged every time there is heavy rain as there was no stormwater drain or water channel. Ramachandra Rao, a resident of Periyar Nagar, said: “I have been living here for two decades now. We are affected every year during rainy season. Thiruninravur Esha lake must be desilted and a channel created to divert floodwater in the low-lying areas.” A bund has been created around the lake. But, there is no channel to link rainwater to the waterbody. Although officials and elected representatives had visited the area, a permanent solution is yet to be provided, the residents said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/parts-of-thiruninravur-waterlogged-for-20-days/article37906556.ece

Stalin on Wednesday evening rushed to the Nilgiris following the IAF chopper crash in which Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and others were killed. Mr. Stalin visited the Madras Regimental Centre in Wellington late on Wednesday and met top Army officials. Senior Cabinet Minister K.N. Nehru, DGP Sylendra Babu and senior civil servants accompanied him. He is expected to visit the site of the crash on Thursday. Earlier in the day, following the news of the crash, the Chief Minister instructed the local administration to provide all necessary support to the rescue operation. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said eight ‘108’ ambulances had reached the accident spot, and Army personnel were at the forefront of the rescue operation. He said the Revenue, Disaster Management and Forest Departments and the people on the spot had been providing help initially, and the State Government’s role was ‘supportive’. “It is a sad event. We are working with the Collector. We have also spoken to the 108 ambulance drivers. The Udhagamandalam [hospital] dean is there; the Collector went to the spot immediately; the joint director - health was also at the spot,” he said in the evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/iaf-chopper-crash-cm-rushes-to-the-nilgiris/article37906543.ece
09 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Adventure tourism operators to come under regulation soon||Adventure tourism operators in the State, who are into providing services for mountain climbing, trekking, rock climbing and water sports, including kayaking and stand-up paddle, will soon be regulated. The Tourism Department has already made ready a set of draft guidelines for the same and is circulating it among stakeholders. “We will soon submit it to the government. We will provide a single window portal where they can upload documents pertaining to land ownership, infrastructure, equipment and the people on board. Then we will inspect the location and if they conform to guidelines, they will get recognition, something that will help them since it will instil confidence in tourists,” said Sandeep Nanduri, Managing Director, Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation. 40 operators On the need for guidelines, he said there were around 40 adventure tourism operators in the State but not a single body to regulate or qualify, or provide them recognition and see if they follow rules. “This will also help curb illegal operators,” he added. Along with adventure tourism, the draft guidelines for homestays, bed and breakfast places and caravan operators too are ready and would soon be sent to the government after obtaining the opinion of stakeholders. Squadron Leader Unni Nair (retired) said adventure tourism was still in a nascent state in India. “People’s mindset is not into adventure. They want to do mild stuff, which is not scary. There are a few operators, who are passionate, but we are nowhere near places like New Zealand. We need to build a mechanism with experts in the field, which would be the nodal controlling authority,” he said. Guidelines welcomed Group Captain Jayashankar (retired) of the National Adventure Foundation, which runs Camp Splendour, a multi-adventure camp site near the remote Thirumoorthy Dam in Tiruppur district, welcomed the framing of guidelines by the Tourism Department. “The guidelines should be framed based on the State’s unique terrain. Adventure operators should be encouraged to have their own standard operating procedures. The department should also help operators to get clearances from the Public Works Department, Forest Department and local bodies,” he said, adding that every water sports or adventure outlet must have continuous hands-on training for their staff in life-saving skills.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/adventure-tourism-operators-to-be-regulated/article37906678.ece
09 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A literary magazine that gave equal importance to cinema||The name Manikodi conjures up an era when the Tamil literary world witnessed outstanding short stories and writers. The literary magazine that survived for just six years from its launch on September 17, 1933, had also accorded equal importance to cinema, and a new monograph sheds light on the subject. “It was a time when people were attracted to cinema in a big way. The magazine, then a weekly, had decided to publish film advertisements to ensure its existence. Compared to Ananda Vikatan , Manikodi had published more film advertisements,” said writer Kadarkarai Matthavilasa Angatham, the author of the book Manikodi Cinema.  Though it was inevitable for a literary magazine to allot adequate space for cinema reviews to make itself relevant, in the case of Manikodi , some of its writers nurtured the dream for a role in the film world. Languishing in poverty, Pudumaipithan, a trailblazer in Tamil short story writing, went to Pune with the hope of becoming a rich man. “But he only got tuberculosis and was left without money to even buy medicine. His letters to his wife Kamala reveal his life,” Kadarkarai said. However, P.S. Ramaiah, who became the editor of the magazine, made a successful entry into the film world and directed films. He also wrote a book, Cinema, based on his experiences in the film world. “His success in the film world is explained by the presence of bigwigs in the committee constituted to celebrate his 60th birthday. A.V. Meyyappa Chettiar was the president of the committee and the members included S.S. Vasan, Kothamangalam Subbu, Gemini Ganesan, K.S. Gopalakrishnan, J.P. Chandrababu and Pandaribhai,” said Kadarkarai. When Mehaboob Khan, the well-known Hindi film producer, wanted to make Aan in Tamil, he had commissioned Ramaiah for the project and gave him a whopping Rs. 60,000. S.S. Vasan had given Ramaiah an advance of Rs. 10,000 and Kadarkarai has collected the details from the souvenir published on the occasion of the birth centenary of Vasan. All aspects Kadarkarai has written in detail about the reviews published in Manikodi and in the process offers information on every aspect of films including actors, directors and production companies. For instance, he has quoted from the review of the movie Saint Thiyagarja by critic Sanjayan: “Barring the appearance of a bicycle in the movie, the period of saint Thiyagaraja should belong to the age as claimed by the film makers.” In 1939, a conference in Chennai witnessed a heated argument. While Murugadasa, who directed films like Nandanar , made a strong case for making films that would inculcate “healthy taste” in audiences, another director, Y.V. Rao, lamented that “ideal film” would not result in box office collections. An age-old argument indeed.  P.S. Ramaiah, who became the editor of the magazine, made a successful entry into the film world and directed films. He also wrote a book, Cinema, based on his experiences in the film world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-literary-magazine-that-gave-equal-importance-to-cinema/article37906656.ece

09 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||City police revive bicycle patrolling in several areas||The city police on Wednesday revived bicycle patrolling in several areas to ensure visible policing. On the orders of City Police Commissioner Shankar Jiwal, personnel in 12 police districts patrolled the city. Mr. Jiwal has instructed Deputy Commissioners of Police to carry out regular bicycle patrolling in their respective jurisdictions to maintain a good interface between people and the police. This will also make the police approachable and help prevent crime. Deputy Commissioner of Police, Triplicane, P. Pakalavan, said, “To ensure visible policing, we will patrol on bicycles, criss-crossing narrow lanes and crowded places. We have chalked out a plan to execute the traditional method of cycle patrolling. As per our plan, at least four personnel will move around on bicycles in each beat of the police station, for two to three hours, every day.” Another officer said, “When personnel move around in jeeps or two-wheelers, people may not have easy access to them. Using bicycles, the police can now become more accessible and move around narrow lanes and crowded places.” Besides, the move is expected to help build a rapport between residents and the police, and keep personnel fit. Officers said they can clearly hear sounds from inside a house or observe a house break while patrolling in cycles. This way, criminals can easily be nabbed, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/city-police-revive-bicycle-patrolling-in-several-areas/article37906566.ece
09 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||CSK moves HC challenging two provisions of CGST Act||Chennai Super Kings (CSK) Cricket Limited has moved Madras High Court to declare two provisions of Central Goods and Services Tax Act of 2017 as manifestly arbitrary and unconstitutional. It also insisted on quashing a show cause notice issued by Ludhiana zonal unit of Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence on November 2. The petitioner had challenged Sections 17(2) and 17(3) of the CGST Act on the ground that denial of input tax credit under reverse charge mechanism (tax paid by recepient of certain goods and services) would lead to the government collecting 25% more tax than what it would collect under forward charge mechanism (tax paid by supplier of goods and services) . Justices R. Mahadevan and Mohammed Shaffiq on Tuesday directed V. Sundareswaran, senior standing counsel for GST Council, to ensure that counter affidavits were filed by December 20. Coercive action The judges also asked him to instruct the officials concerned to not take any coercive action until the court hears the matter at length and passes appropriate orders. Representing the writ petitioner, senior counsel Arvind P. Datar said it owns a cricket team in the Indian Premier League in the name and style of CSK. Under a contract entered into by the petitioner with Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the team participates in IPL cricket tournaments played within the country and sometimes outside India too. In Chennai, the matches are played at M.A. Chidambaram Stadium which the petitioner hires for the duration of the tournament every year. As the owner of CSK, the petitioner was entitled to require its players and allow its assets and properties to carry advertisements and branding of products, brands, names and logos of interested advertisers. Accordingly, the petitioner permits such advertisements on CSK players’ apparel, media campaigns and at match venue.  ‘Sponsorship services’ Pointing out that neither ‘sponsorship services’ nor ‘brand promotion services’ had been defined under the CGST Act, the petitioner said, in such circumstances, the ordinary commercial meaning should be given to those terms while dealing with them under the law. However, the Ludhiana zonal unit of DGGSTI had attempted to re-classify all brand promotion services from July 1, 2017 to March 31, 2021 as sponsorship services, the petitioner complained. “This is patently illegal and Respondent 3 (DGGSTI) has no power under the CGST Act to reclassify commercial contracts,” the affidavit filed on behalf of CSK Cricket Limited read. It further stated that generally, suppliers of goods or services were liable to pay GST. However, in specified cases such as imports and other notified supplies, the liability could be cast on the recepient of the goods or services under reverse charge mechanism. Reverse charge means the liability to pay tax was on the recepient in respect of notified categories of supply. Since sponsorship services fell under the reverse charge mechanism, the officials were denying the benefit of input tax credit to the petitioner, it said and referred to the FAQs on GST which categorically state that input tax credit would be made available for discharging the CGST liability on the output at every stage. The petitioner also questioned the territorial jurisdiction of Ludhiana zonal unit having issued the show cause notice to the petitioner located in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/csk-moves-hc-challenging-two-provisions-of-cgst-act/article37906575.ece
09 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘China need not be a sticking point in relationship between India and Russia’||India’s problems with China and Russia’s strong ties with China need not be a sticking point in the bilateral relationship between India and Russia, former Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs, M. Ganapathi said on Wednesday. Addressing a panel discussion on “India-Russia special and privileged strategic partnership”, organised by the Consulate General of Russia in Tamil Nadu, in the backdrop of the recent visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin to New Delhi, he said the visit had allayed many fears raised by a section of critics and analysts over the bilateral relations. Highlighting that every country acted to protect their supreme national interest, he said Russia maintained an excellent relationship with China for the same reason. Russia’s relationship with China should not affect the strong Indo-Russian relationship, just as the development of a relationship between India and the U.S. should not be a sticking point between India and Russia, he said. He said Mr. Putin’s visit took place in the background of uninformed speculation and negative reports, some of which were over the top, on the difficulties in bilateral relations. However, the outcome of the visit has allayed many such fears, he said. On the media coverage N. Ram, director, The Hindu Publishing Group, said media coverage preceding Mr. Putin’s visit was largely superficial, with a tendency to see things in black and white, without going into the nuances. They lacked substantive content, he said. Speculations that India is moving towards the U.S., and therefore its relationship with Russia will turn cold, have proven to be unfounded, he said. The relationship between India and Russia is clearly strong and robust, with very few conflicts of interest, Mr. Ram said. Despite all the issues between India and China, bilateral trade between the two countries is expected to cross USD 100 billion in 2021, he said. Oleg Avdeev, Consul General of the Russian Federation in South India, said the symbolism of Mr. Putin’s visit could not be downplayed, as it was only his second trip abroad since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. He said 2021 marked the 50th anniversary of the Bilateral Treaty on Peace, Friendship and Cooperation between the two countries. While the world has undergone fundamental changes in the last five decades, the friendship between Russia and India has remained a constant. The proposed Chennai-Vladivostok Maritime Corridor will help expand the economy of Tamil Nadu and south India at large, he said. Commodore (retired) Vijesh Kumar Garg, executive director, Chennai Centre for China Studies, recalled the support provided by Russia during the Indo-Pak war of 1971. Pointing to the strong defence cooperation between the two countries, he said Russia was also always willing to transfer technology to India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/china-need-not-be-a-sticking-point-in-relationship-between-india-and-russia/article37906530.ece
09 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘General Rawat died while heading to his alma mater’||Former University of Madras Defence Studies professor Gopalji Malviya, who interacted with Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat at the National Defence College in New Delhi, during 2009-10, said on Wednesday that it was poignant to note that he died in the unfortunate helicopter crash when he was heading to deliver a lecture to young officers in Wellington, where he studied years ago. “He was going to speak to the young officers at the same place where he studied, his alma mater. He was not there for a holiday,” Prof. Malviya said. Prof. Malviya said General Rawat, India’s first Chief of Defence Staff, hailed from an illustrious family. “Hailing from Uttarakhand, which is known for sending notable officers to the Armed Forces, General Rawat’s father Lakshman Rawat was also a Lieutenant General in the Army,” said Prof. Malviya. Recalling him as a “brave officer”, Prof. Malviya said he had done a commendable job as the Chief of Defence Staff. “He performed the job of integration (of the Air Force, Navy and Army), and introduced the concept of ‘theatre command’ in India. This is something that has already been implemented by forces in the developed countries,” he said. Prof. Malviya remembers interacting with General Rawat as part of a group in 1991-92, at the Defence Staff Service College in Wellington, and later, in 2009-2010, at the National Defence College in New Delhi, when he had moved up the ranks in the Armed Forces. “General Rawat was a Major in the Armed Forces when he did his M.Sc. in Defence and Strategic Studies from the University of Madras, at the Defence Staff Service College in Wellington, around 1991-1992. Later, in 2009-2010, he completed his M.Phil from the National Defence College in New Delhi [an affiliated programme with the University of Madras] as a Brigadier of the Indian Armed Forces,” said Prof. Malviya.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/general-rawat-died-while-heading-to-his-alma-mater/article37906563.ece
09 December 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||HC summons Chief Secy. to explain delay in evicting encroachers||The Madras High Court has summoned Chief Secretary V. Irai Anbu to explain why there has been a delay in identifying all waterbodies in the State, fixing their boundaries through a full-fledged survey and evicting the encroachers so that the State does not suffer from either water scarcity or flooding in the future. Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P.D. Audikesavalu directed Mr. Anbu to be present in the court on December 16. They were unhappy over the non-compliance with three significant directions issued by the court on January 28, 2019 with the aim of protecting the waterbodies and preserving them for posterity. The first direction was to file an action taken report on the basis of the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report, for the year ending March 2017, which stated that the Tamil Nadu Protection of Tanks and Eviction of Encroachment Act of 2007 was of no use since the government had not earmarked the boundaries of each and every waterbody. Secondly, the court had directed the Collectors of all districts to prepare a list of the waterbodies found in their revenue records and send copies of the same to the officers of the Registration Department, Tangedco, jurisdictional local bodies and the District Election Officers before February 8, 2019. The idea behind the order was to ensure that no document related to a land classified as a waterbody got registered and no construction on a waterbody was provided with an electricity connection. The third direction was to the Chief Secretary to compile the data submitted by the Collectors and file a report in the court, listing the number of waterbodies in the State, the extent of encroachments and the steps taken to remove them. Though the Chief Secretary filed an affidavit on Wednesday, the judges were not satisfied. Expressing dismay over very little having been done in the last three years to evict the encroachers and remove the encroachments from waterbodies, the ACJ said: “We are not going to pardon anyone.” “If they are not going to protect the waterbodies, what are they paid for?” he asked. He warned that the court would not hesitate to pass orders withholding the salaries of the officials concerned if they do not pull up their socks and swing into action even after the Chief Secretary had been summoned.

The Southern Railway is set to open the service road once the culvert is completed near the Velachery railway station. Running parallel to the railway track, the road would provide easier access for several residential areas to the three railway stations, including Velachery, Perungudi and Taramani. However, the absence of a wide road to link the service road with VGP Selva Nagar, Balakrishna Nagar, Annai Indira Nagar, Anna Nagar Venus Colony and Park Avenue, will pose hardship to the residents as they would have to reach the Station Service Road via narrow streets. Social activist S. Kumararaja said the vacant land in the area belonging to the Revenue Department could be handed over to the Corporation to build a link road.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/velachery-residents-want-link-road-to-railway-station/article37906554.ece

The boy from Bengaluru was suffering from primary hyperoxaluria type-II, where the liver cannot regulate the excessive build up of oxalate in kidneys and other vital organs of the body. Due to renal failure caused by the disease, the boy was already undergoing dialysis thrice a week. According to a press release from Gleneagles Global Health City (GGHC), when the patient was brought by his parents, his condition demanded a combined liver and kidney transplant as the problem was primarily in the liver. While the boy’s mother donated a kidney, his aunt donated a part of her liver. Somashekhara, consultant paediatric hepatologist and liver transplant physician, said it was a challenge to treat the boy as there were not many proven studies reported elsewhere. According to Mettu Srinivas Reddy, director, liver transplantation and hepatobiliary surgery, a team of over 20 surgeons were involved in the combined transplant. “It is like a large symphony orchestra where the timing of the two donor operations and the child’s double transplant surgery had to be carefully coordinated, so that the out-of-body time of both the donated organs was kept to a minimum while ensuring safe transplantation,” he said. K. Muruganandham, head and senior consultant, urology and renal transplantation, said the kidney transplant was particularly complicated as a full-sized adult kidney had to be placed in the pelvis of a child.  While the boy’s mother donated a kidney, his aunt donated a part of her liver||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/combined-kidney-liver-transplant-successfully-done-on-bengaluru-boy/article37906657.ece

Panneerselvam on Wednesday questioned the need for changing the consumer complaint redressal system in Tangedco. In a statement, he said the telephone number of the complaint redressal mechanism — 1912 — had functioned since 2003 and, in the name of merging the call centre with a new arrangement called ‘Minnagam Call Centre’, the number had been changed to 94987 94987. Under the previous arrangement, the power utility had resolved 12,000 complaints a day through 44 complaint call centres whereas, under the new system, the figure had come down to 8,000. Mr. Panneerselvam asked Chief Minister M.K. Stalin to ascertain whether the tender process for the new arrangement was followed in a transparent manner, and urged him to publish all the details on the website of the power utility; reinstate the services of those who had lost their jobs owing to the new system; address the issue of dissatisfaction among the workforce; and protect the data of three crore consumers of electricity. Protest postponed In a release, the AIADMK announced that its State-wide demonstrations against the DMK Government, slated for Thursday, had been postponed to Saturday.

The debt financing would be subject to negotiations of definitive agreements between the DFC, America’s development bank and First Solar, the largest American solar manufacturing company. “The DFC is thrilled to be in a position to support First Solar’s new venture in India, which will boost solar panel manufacturing capacity for a key ally and help mobilise the industry to take up better standards that align with the U.S. values,” said Dev Jagadesan, DFC’s Acting Chief Executive Officer in a press release. “This transaction represents another milestone in the U.S.’ effort to drive alternative supply chains and to articulate a vision for climate finance that drives our development mission.” Mark Widmar, First Solar’s Chief Executive Officer said like the U.S., India has recognised that it must shape its own sustainable energy future and has sought to supercharge the expansion of its domestic solar manufacturing capacity. A press release said this investment will promote the DFC’s commitment to diversify ing supply chains. First Solar produces “thin film” solar panel modules, which do not use polysilicon. First Solar, which was the first of the world’s ten largest solar manufacturers to join the Responsible Business Alliance, will replicate its industry-leading transparency and traceability protocol in India, amplifying efforts to boost supply chain transparency throughout the renewable energy sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/500-mn-funding-for-solar-module-project-in-tn-gets-dfc-green-light/article37906665.ece

Parthiban passed the order after wondering how the association could object to the change in timings. In an affidavit filed on behalf of the association, its secretary, J. Mohanraj, said the 10 a.m.-8 p.m. working hours was convenient for the salesmen, who had to work for two hours after closure to settle the accounts. If the shops close only at 10 p.m., the salesmen will be forced to work till midnight. He said though outlets stayed open from 12 p.m. to 10 p.m. before COVID-19, the change in timings during the lockdown was better for the salesmen. The body said the Tasmac management did not issue any prior notice to the salesmen before reverting to the old timings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/case-against-change-in-tasmac-timings/article37906536.ece

A team led by Assistant Town Planning Officer, Central Zone, A. Babu took possession of the reserved site measuring 17 cent at Balaji Nagar (Ward 53) in Avarampalayam. Mr. Babu said a resident who had built compound wall and erected temporary structures to house an animal farm was rearing cattle, poultry and dogs. He was in illegal possession of the land for the last 10 years. There was a legal dispute regarding the illegal possession. The case had reached the Supreme Court in 2010 and in 2019 the apex court had ruled in the civic body’s favour. Even thereafter, there was no action from the Corporation other than issuing two notices. After learning about the encroachment, recalling the files to study the Court verdict and taking a legal opinion, the Town Planning wing went ahead with the eviction drive, Mr. Babu said.

The University conducted the election on Wednesday to elect four persons – two from teachers’ constituency and a like number from the principals’ constituency . Four contestants were in the fray from the teachers’ constituency and the same number from the principals’ constituency. Sources said that in the last minute, on Wednesday morning, the officials conducting the election in the University had permitted principals in-charge of colleges to cast votes. This included principals in-charge from government-run and self-financed colleges. This was vote by proxy, alleged P. Thirunavukkarasu, state president, Association of University Teachers. The last minute inclusion of names had tilted the scales in favour of a group that attempted to rig the election right from day one, he alleged. Sources said neither the government colleges nor the self-financed colleges had given the names of persons who would be voting when the University had sent out circular asking for names to be included in voters’ list. That the proxy voting happened after the deadline to include names was a pointer to the fairness in conducting the election, the sources added. Vice Chancellor P. Kaliraj said the persons, who the University had allowed to vote, had letters of authorisation from their authorities concerned – regional joint director in case of government or government-aided colleges and secretaries of management of self-financed colleges. The University statute allowed principals in-charge to vote and by permitting them there was nothing illegal. The University had followed the rules and the allegations or objections had no way impacted the election, he maintained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/allegations-of-irregularities-mar-election-to-bu-syndicate/article37906578.ece

09 December 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Slushy earth hampers operations in Vellalore yard||The recent rains have hampered operations at the Coimbatore Corporation’s dump yard in Vellalore. Sources said that after almost every rain, the ground turned slushy at the yard. This was more so at the 200 acre where the Corporation dumped waste in the open. The slushy earth makes it difficult for the lorries to move in and out, as the vehicles get stuck particularly when they are fully packed with waste. Therefore, on rainy days and for a few days thereafter the Corporation lets in only one lorry at a time into the site to dump waste and exit the place. This took time and led to piling up of lorries one behind another. As a result of the time taken for lorries to dump waste and return to the wards for collecting waste in the second trip, the operation was hampered, the sources said. The Corporation’s Vellalore yard saw 200 lorry trips of waste dumped in the open – or about 300 tonnes a day. The impact of the time the lorries took to dump waste in Vellalore on the streets was that the waste collected and dumped in bins was not getting cleared the very day, the sources said and pointed out that the Vellalore bus terminus construction only compounded the problem, the sources added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/slushy-earth-hampers-operations-in-vellalore-yard/article37906570.ece

09 December 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||High Court cancels premature release of two life convicts||The State government on Wednesday told the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court that pursuant to the court’s direction, government orders were passed with regard to cancellation of the premature release of two life convicts, who had breached the conditions and committed crimes, including murder. A Division Bench of Justices S. Vaidyanathan and G. Jayachandran was told that the orders cancelling the premature release of the two life convicts – Uma Shankar and Saiprasath – were passed by the Home Secretary. The court was hearing the petition filed by N. Ilavarasi of Theni district who sought a direction to the Home Secretary to consider her representation and cancel the premature release of the two life convicts. She said the two were involved in the murder of her husband Nagendran. The convicts, who were undergoing life imprisonment for the murder of one Kumaraguru, were prematurely released in 2018. After their release, they breached the conditions and were involved in the murder of her husband and two other criminal cases, the petitioner said. She said the premature release of the life convicts and their subsequent conduct had caused fear and apprehension in her and her family members’ minds that the released life convicts would come after their lives. She made a representation to the government to cancel their premature release in 2020. The court was told that the Director General of Prisons had taken note of the conduct of the two life convicts and recommended to the government to pass orders to rescind their premature release. But, the Home Secretary had not taken any action in this regard. Hence, the court had said the Home Secretary should take necessary action, failing which he would be summoned to explain the delay in taking the decision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-cancels-premature-release-of-two-life-convicts/article37906643.ece
09 December 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||High Court sets aside acquittal of five persons in murder case||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has set aside a trial court order acquitting five key accused in a 2007 murder case registered in Thoothukudi, and awarded life sentence to them. The court was hearing a criminal appeal filed by P. Thilagavathi of Thoothukudi district against the judgment of the Additional Sessions Judge, Thoothukudi, who in 2009 acquitted 12 persons accused of murdering her husband Pachaiperumal. The case of the prosecution was that in 2007 the 12 accused persons conspired to eliminate Pachaiperumal due to previous enmity. They intercepted him near a plantation and inflicted injuries on him indiscriminately, causing his death. The Additional Sessions Judge had outrightly rejected the conspiracy theory and expressed doubts over the witnesses. All the 12 accused were acquitted by the trial court. The acquittal was challenged before the High Court. A Division Bench of Justices S. Vaidyanathan and G. Jayachandran observed that though evidence was adequate to convict the accused, the trial court had disbelieved the prosecution case in its entirety for slender reasons due to fanciful reasoning and doubts. The court could not lose sight of the fact that it was a case involving multiple accused and multiple injuries. Naturally, the witnesses were subjected to cross-examination by multiple advocates. Failure to attribute definite roles to the accused or minor variations in ascribing the roles to them alone could not be a reasonable ground for acquittal, the Bench said. In this case, sufficient evidence was available to prove that with deadly weapons, the five main accused caused bodily injuries with common intention to cause death and with knowledge that the injuries were sufficient and likely to cause death. The main accused – Murugesan alias Shanmugasundram, Pachaiperumal alias Patchikutti, Palavesaraj alias Palavesamuthu, Kulasekarapandian and Blade Ganesan alias Ganesan – were found guilty of murder. The court awarded life sentences to them, and confirmed the acquittal of the other accused.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-sets-aside-acquittal-of-five-persons-in-murder-case/article37906647.ece

09 December 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Cut in prices of SIDCO plots welcomed||Agrofood Chamber of Commerce and Industry has welcomed the announcement of Chief Minister M.K. Stalin to slash the prices of plots in SIDCO industrial estates, for which there were no takers on account of their high prices, by 5% to 75%. This was the first time in the more than 50 years of service history of SIDCO that such a step had been taken. The move would help trade and industry recover from the paralysis caused by COVID-19 epidemic, said Chamber president S. Rethinavelu. Tamil Nadu stood third next to Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal in distribution of small and micro enterprises. Eight per cent of the MSMEs were located in Tamil Nadu, and next to agriculture the MSMEs provided high employment opportunities. The reduction in the prices of plots in SIDCO industrial estates would enhance the industrial growth of Tamil Nadu. Stating that most of the food industry units were small and micro enterprises, he said they preferred industrial estates, since there would not be any delay in obtaining various licences and getting power connection. The Chamber requested the Chief Minister to fix sale price or rent of industrial plots in food parks, being established or planned in the State, at the most competitive rates in order to be attractive for the MSME sector to go in for industrial investments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cut-in-prices-of-sidco-plots-welcomed/article37906866.ece

Karmegam said heavy vehicles should not overtake on the ghat roads and drivers should not operate their vehicles at the edge (valley side) of the roads. He said vehicles should operate only with the allowed goods weight and drivers should follow all the road rules without fail. “Heavy vehicles are allowed to use the stretches only if they follow the norms,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/heavy-vehicles-allowed-on-yercaud-ghat-roads/article37906670.ece
09 December 2021||SALEM,TAMIL NADU||‘Do not prefer self-medication’||District Collector S. Karmegam has asked people with fever and body pain not to prefer self-medication and immediately approach the nearest government hospital or primary health centre. He held a consultative meeting on dengue preventive measures in which Corporation Commissioner T. Christuraj and other officials took part at the Collectorate. Mr. Karmegam said the administration continued to take all precautionary measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Though the spread of virus was reducing, people should continue to follow the norms while in public places. The Collector said due to incessant rain, there were chances of outbreak of dengue and viral infections and asked people to follow all the norms. “If they suffer from fever or body pain, they should immediately visit the government hospital or primary health centre,” he said. He asked people not to buy medicines from medical shops and go for self-medication. Workers involved in anti-dengue operations should visit all the households allotted for them and effectively carry out the work, he added. He said all the local bodies should involve in anti-dengue operations and asked officials to monitor the works.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/do-not-prefer-self-medication/article37906674.ece

09 December 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Commuters hopeful of restoration of Tiruvarur-Karaikudi train service from Jan.||Repeated representations by rail users’ associations in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts to the railways seeking normal services on the Tiruvarur-Karaikudi section have raised hopes of commuters that the services will be restored from January 2022. The Tiruvarur-Karaikudi section was closed for traffic 11 years back to facilitate the gauge conversion work and the project was completed a few years ago. The track was subsequently cleared for operation of trains. Rail users were disappointed when a lone on-board gatekeeper diesel-electric multiple unit (DEMU) service between Tiruvarur and Karaikudi was introduced a few months before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Later on, the running time of the DEMU service got reduced by a few hours after the appointment of ex-servicemen as guards on a contract basis at some of the level crossing gates in this section, according to Venkatesan of Aalathampadi. But, the decision to terminate the ex-servicemen from the service taken recently by the Railway Board shocked the train commuters as they were hoping that the Southern Railway was in the process of fulfilling the vacant gatekeeper posts to revive the normal train services on this newly laid BG track. Pointing out that a total of 72 level-crossings exist on this section, N.Jayaraman, president, Pattukottai Taluk Rail Passengers Welfare Association, said that initially around 100 ex-servicemen were selected and trained in the level crossing operation works. Out of them, 42 persons were deployed subsequently. Suddenly, a few months ago the Southern Railway relieved all these ex-servicemen from the LC manning duty, he added. Stumped by the unexpected development, various rail commuters associations in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts rose up to the occasion and persuaded the Members of Parliament elected from these two districts to take up the issue with the Railway Board and ensure that the service of ex-servicemen was utilised by the railways to man the level crossing gates. Further, the associations have also suggested that the retired para-military personnel could also be considered for the gatekeeper posts. Their efforts to convince the Railway Board to continue with deployment of ex-servicemen at the LCs on a contract basis through the MPs had elicited a positive response. The railways had called for applications for the post of gatekeepers at the LCs falling under the Tiruchi Division of the Southern Railway till November-end this year. About 300 ex-servicemen/retired para-military personnel are reported to have expressed their interest to take up the gatekeeper responsibilities at the level crossings falling under the Tiruchi Division of the Southern Railway.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/commuters-hopeful-of-restoration-of-tiruvarur-karaikudi-train-service-from-jan/article37906626.ece

09 December 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,TAMIL NADU||Amid Omicron scare, Kerala gears up to tackle exigencies||As the uncertainty surrounding the new SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron grows and experts debate whether the variant’s immune evasion potential can lead to a massive surge in reinfections, Kerala is leaving nothing to chance by making preparations ahead. Ensuring oxygen availability and ICU/ventilator facilities has been a main task that the Health department has been undertaking in preparing to meet any exigency involving Omicron. Oxygen utilisation The State is producing 354.43 tonnes of oxygen daily now, while the current utilisation of oxygen is around 65 tonnes only. Kerala is self-sufficient in oxygen production and it also has adequate buffer stock, Health Minister Veena George said here on Wednesday. Review meeting The oxygen and ICU/ventilator situation was reviewed by the Health department in anticipation of a possible third wave of COVID-19. During the second wave, when Delta was sweeping across all States and leading to a situation of huge oxygen shortage in hospitals, Kerala had managed to avert a crisis. If earlier there were only four oxygen generators in the State, 38 more such generators, which can additionally manufacture 89.93 tonnes of oxygen daily, were established in anticipation of a third wave. Work on setting up another 18 oxygen generators, which can manufacture 29.63 tonnes of oxygen, was also on. Ms. George said that this apart, there are 14 air separation units in different parts of the State, which can manufacture 65 tonnes of oxygen daily. Also, the State has the capability to produce 207.5 tonnes of liquid oxygen daily. The storage capacity of liquid oxygen has also been enhanced. In both public and private sector facilities, 1,802.72 tonnes of liquid oxygen has been stored, and the work on enhancing it by another 174.72 tonnes is progressing. ICU beds and ventilators are being readied. The public sector hospitals in the State have 3,107 ICU beds and 2,293 ventilators. Of these, the current occupancy is only in 267 ICU beds and 77 ventilators. Non-COVID patients are occupying 983 ICU beds and 219 ventilators. A total of 40.2% ICU beds and 12.9% of ventilator beds in the State are occupied now. Private hospitals have 7,468 ICU beds and 2,432 ventilators at their disposal. If at all there is a shortfall in ICU beds/ventilators, the government will seek the help of private sector, she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/amid-omicron-scare-kerala-gears-up-to-tackle-exigencies/article37906422.ece
09 December 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Minister inspects waterlogged areas||Encroachments along the waterways will be identified and removed to ensure immediate draining of rainwater stagnating at several places, Minister for Social Welfare P. Geetha Jeevan has said. Rainwater stagnation makes residents to spend sleepless nights as the sewage has mixed with the stagnant water and seeped into to the drinking water pipes. Though the corporation has deployed around 400 pumps to pump out stagnant water, the result is not impressive. The reason behind this issue is the non-cooperation of the lower-level staff, who do not operate the pumps to pump out the sewage-mixed rainwater. While the pumps deployed on the arterial and other important roads are properly operated to escape from the wrath of the higher-ups and the public, the motors kept at interior areas housing middle-class families are kept idle after operating them for a couple of hours. Consequently, the town witnessed road roko agitations at five places on Monday and Tuesday which compelled the Minister to visit these areas on Wednesday. However, she did not visit Annai Velankanni Nagar near Krishnarajapuram North where the residents are battling rainwater mixed with sewage for the past 14 days. When the agitated residents threatened to hoist black flags on the day when Chief Minister M.K. Stalin visited Thoothukudi, the authorities silenced them. After visiting a few rain-hit and waterlogged places along with Collector K. Senthil Raj and Corporation Commissioner T. Charusree, Ms Geetha said the unprecedented heavy downpour and the improperly implemented Smart City project works were the reasons behind the water stagnation in Thoothukudi. Eight teams had been formed to identify the encroachments made across the waterways and drainage channels by using the old maps available with the Corporation to find permanent solution to this problem. After completing this task within a week, the encroachment eviction drive would start. As a temporary relief measure, steps were being taken to lay pipes for about 3.50 km along the Ettaiyapuram highway to pump out the stagnant water in this area. “Moreover, Rs. 187 crore will be spent with the funding of Asian Development Bank for creating drainage channels at Dhanasekaran Nagar and Muththammal Colony,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/minister-inspects-waterlogged-areas/article37906990.ece
09 December 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||‘Switch over to mechanised transplanting’||Collector K. Senthil Raj has appealed to farmers to switch over to the mechanised transplanting of paddy as it will save them Rs. 3,600 per acre. After taking a look at mechanised transplanting of paddy near Srivaikundam on Tuesday, Dr. Senthil Raj said that shortage of farmhands and coverage of more area in short duration had encouraged the farmers to rely upon mechanised transplanting of paddy. Since this method would come in handy for the farmers following system of rice intensification, it would save the farmers Rs. 3,600 per acre. “While the mechanised planting of paddy costs Rs. 4,500 per acre, it would be Rs. 5,500 if farmhands are used. Besides saving seeds, the use of ‘cono weeder,’ being operated by a farmhand, ensures sizable savings of Rs. 2,000 for the farmers as the mechanization averts the use of 12 farmhands for weeding.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/switch-over-to-mechanised-transplanting/article37906658.ece

09 December 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||PWD plans survey of encroachment along Ariyar watercourse||The Public Works Department has planned to undertake a detailed survey of encroachment along the watercourse of the Ariyar, which was in spate for a few days in October and November. The naturally-formed river gets water from the South Malaiyar, the Kannuthur river and the Ponnaniyar in Dindigul, Karur and Tiruchi districts. In addition, it gets flow from the tanks in and around Manapparai. The 85-km-long Ariyar traverses along Sithanatham, Inamkulathur, Piratiyur, Ammapettai and Ariyavur. The Ariyar subsequently joins the Kudamuriti river and empties into the Cauvery. The Ariyar witnessed heavy flow in October due to very rain on the catchment areas of the river in Manapparai and Vaiyampatti in Tiruchi district and parts of Dindigul district. It breached at places near Punganur on the outskirts of Tiruchi. It ultimately caused flooding in Piratiyur and the low-lying areas along the Kudamuriti. The Ariyar once again breached a few days ago due to the sudden rise in the water level in the aftermath of cloudburst over Manapparai. Though the heavy rain and subsequent heavy flow was said to be the main cause for the breach and flooding at Piratiyur and Punganur, the officials said that indiscriminate encroachment was also a reason. While the river has a width of about 100 meters along the upper stream up to Inamkulathur, the encroachment has narrowed down its width to 40 meter to 50 meter in the downstream. A section of farmers, who have lands in Punganur, had apparently encroached the watercourse towards the tail end of the river, according to officials. “The riverside has been encroached at various places. While there was no breach of bund on the upper stream of the Ariyar as it was wider enough to carry huge amount of water, breach had occurred at the tail end. Action will be taken to retrieve the encroached tracts of water course,” says Collector S. Sivarasu. A PWD Ariyar Division official said that a detailed survey would be carried to figure out the encroachment. There was no physical structure of encroachment. The farmers had raised paddy crop on the watercourse. If the encroached area was retrieved, the river could carry more amount of water thereby avoiding breach along the bunds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pwd-plans-survey-of-encroachment-along-ariyar-watercourse/article37906633.ece
09 December 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Governor holds discussions with stakeholders of university system||Setting a precedent, Governor and Chancellor K.N. Ravi, who is camping here to take part in the Convocation of Bharathidasan University on Thursday, held candid discussions with members of Syndicate, principals of affiliated colleges, and students, after a tete-a-tete with Vice-Chancellor M. Selvam. In these meetings, all of informal nature lasting 20 to 45 minutes, the Governor had emphasised on the inevitability of the higher education system switching over to the New Education Policy 2020. Every discussion was followed by a question-answer session wherein the Governor exhorted the stake-holders of the higher education system to devise means to shore up the standing of the university in the NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) ranking. Participants of the meeting said the discussions were candid in nature and that the air of informality was palpable. When Syndicate members had raised the issue of the poor monetary condition of the university, the Governor had, while taking cognisance of the grievance, counselled financial self-reliance through consultations, foreign collaborations and start of new courses. The New Education Policy 2020 was replete with several positives, and was inevitable for the higher education system in a dynamic scenario, the Governor shared with about 20 principals of affiliated colleges at a subsequent meeting. In the context of a suggestion made by a principal of a city college for incorporation of moral education at the higher education level, the Governor said the NEP 2020 had such a provision and also scope for horizontal and vertical mobility in choice of courses based on aptitude. Mr. Ravi also interacted with students in the last leg of informal discussions to determine the extent of prevalence of academic freedom from their perspective.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/governor-holds-discussions-with-stakeholders-of-varsity-system/article37906639.ece
09 December 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Srirangam temple library gets a makeover||The ‘Samaya Noolagam’ (library with Hindu religious books) functioning in the Srirangam Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple has been given a makeover with more books being added to its existing collections, thanks to contribution from some donors. The library with a collection of books in Tamil, Sanskrit and English will be open to the public from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on all days barring Tuesdays with a one hour break between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. The temple authorities who run the library have provided chairs and tables inside for the convenience of the devotees to read the books of their choice besides new almirahs to keep the books in safe custody. A temple staff has been posted to man the library during the specified timings and provide the books as required by the devotees and keep them inside the almirahs. The makeover to the temple library has been given following an announcement made by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Minister in the Legislative Assembly a few months ago that the 'Samaya Noolagams' in temples across the State would be improved. In the first phase, improvements are being made in 10 temples – Srirangam Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Arulmigu Dhandayuthapani Temple, Palani, Arulmigu Meenakshi Amman Temple, Madurai, Arulmigu Subramaniya Swamy Temple, Tiruchendur, Arulmigu Ramanathaswamy Temple, Rameswaram and Arulmigu Swaminatha Swamy Temple, Swamimalai. Devotees would be given books of their choice to read them in the library itself. The books were not meant for circulation. Temple authorities said the space inside the library has been expanded as part of the makeover to accommodate 40 readers at a time. The library is functioning in a mandapam at ‘ul manal veli’ inside the temple premises. The library was closed for public due to COVID-19 pandemic and has been reopened now after giving it a makeover, say the temple authorities. The library has a collection of around 3,000 Hindu religious books on various topics. ‘Naalayira Divya Prabhandham, ‘Srimad Bhagavatham’, ‘Brahma Suthram’, ‘Yajur Veda’, ‘Vaishnava Aagamam’, Saint Ramanuja, ‘Sriman Narayaneeyam’, ‘Atharvana Veda’, ‘Panchadasi’, ‘Uthava Geethai’ and ‘Divyadesa Manimaalai’ are available. A religious organisation and some devotees had donated books to the temple library adding to its existing collection, said the temple authorities. The temple authorities say donors could donate more books to the library to augment its collection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/srirangam-temple-library-gets-a-makeover/article37906637.ece

09 December 2021||TIRUNELVELI,TAMIL NADU||Bus stands, STEM park inaugurated||Chief Minister M.K. Stalin inaugurated the Vaeinthaankulam new bus stand, renovated here on an outlay of Rs. 50.72 crore under the Smart City prgoramme, through videoconference from Chennai. Collector V. Vishnu, Corporation Commissioner B. Vishnu Chandran and Palayamkottai MLA M. Abdul Wahab lighted the traditional lamp to mark the formal commissioning of the bus-stand. Subsequently, buses, which were being operated from the temporary bus-stand near Perumalpuram police station for the past 15 months, started rolling out from the new bus-stand where the number of platforms has been increased from 4 to 6 to handle 78 buses at a time. The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) operates 1,380 trips of mofussil buses, 186 trips of State Express Transport Corporation buses and 210 city buses a day from the new bus-stand. The new bus-stand, which had 130 shops before the renovation, now has 190 shops in the ground floor and in the newly created first floor. The Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Park created in front of the new bus-stand on an outlay of Rs. 10.54 crore was also inaugurated. The STEM Park, housing a good number of working models to explain lucidly the scientific concepts in play-way methods, will be a great attraction to the children. Moreover, the ‘Innovation Hub’ established there encourages the children to create their scientific models and produce 3D print of their designs. The STEM Park will be maintained by a private firm for 2 years and entry fee will be collected from the visitors. The Palayamkottai bus stand, which could accommodate at least 10 buses at any given point of time prior to its reconstruction at a cost of Rs. 13.08 crore, was also inaugurated. Now, the bus terminus can handle only 6 to 7 buses at a time as the parking area inside the bus-stand has shrunken a lot with the creation of more shops. Since the rental charges for these shops have been increased – Rs. 250 per square feet in the ground floor and Rs. 150 per square feet in the first floor – traders who had shops in the bus stand prior to reconstruction demand the reduction of the rent and the deposit for the shops. The Chief Minister inaugurated four-wheeler parking lot on the new bus stand premises (Rs. 11.75 crore), vehicles for cleaning streets and sucking sewage water (Rs. 3.95 crore), high-mast lights and LED lights (Rs. 10 crore), two-wheeler parking lot on the T.M. Road (Rs. 6.75 crore) and bicycle path in NGO Colony (Rs. 2.84 crore).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bus-stands-stem-park-inaugurated/article37906994.ece

When the district administration organised the job fair in Palayamkottai last Sunday, 20 Kani tribal candidates, all getting trained in the Mundanthurai coaching centre, also participated. “As 22-year-old S. Sandhiya got selected by Germany’s Bosch for its Gangaikondan manufacturing unit, where the multinational giant is manufacturing sensors, I was so thrilled. Ms. Sandhiya has been selected for the post of machine operator to manufacture sensors being used in a range of appliances, said Assistant Director of Employment Antony.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/from-deep-forest-to-hi-tech-bosch-unit/article37906659.ece

09 December 2021||Tiruppur,TAMIL NADU||Decline in number of migratory birds at Nanjarayan tank||Birdwatchers expressed concern over the sharp decline in the number of migratory birds that visit the Nanjarayan tank, in the outskirts of Tiruppur, between December and March every year. According to K. Ravindran, president of the Nature Society of Tiruppur (NST), who has been documenting the arrival of birds at the tank, waders (birds that are found along shorelines and mudflats) and ducks from various parts of India and the world have particularly declined this year. “In November 2020, we recorded around 85 garganeys that come from Europe. However, no garganey was spotted this time,” he said on Wednesday. Similarly, around 45 northern shovelers, another migratory bird that breeds in Europe, was recorded in November last year, but only five was observed during a recent enumeration of birds done by the NST team at Nanjarayan tank. The number of common sandpipers also dipped sharply from 51 last year to three this year, according to Mr. Ravindran. One possible reason for this sharp decline could be the rise in water levels in the tank following the recent heavy rain, he said. With the mudflats being submerged, ducks like northern shovelers might not find the location conducive for roosting and waders like wood sandpipers, which prefer to walk in shallow waters, might be averse to high water level in the tank, according to Mr. Ravindran. “The migratory birds might have landed elsewhere in the State. When the water levels reduce, it is likely that these birds will return [to Nanjarayan tank],” he said. Expressing similar sentiments, birdwatcher S. Murugavel said that the Forest Department must also take steps to reduce human interference at Nanjarayan tank and urged the State government to declare the tank, which attracts a large number of migratory birds every year, as a bird sanctuary. Sources in the Forest Department said that the officials have been conducting awareness programmes to the residents living near the Nanjarayan tank not to disturb the migratory birds. Regarding the demand for a bird sanctuary, the sources added that the details pertaining to the arrival of birds at Nanjarayan and Manickapuram tanks in Tiruppur district were recently sent to the top officials of the Forest Department for further action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/decline-in-number-of-migratory-birds-at-nanjarayan-tank/article37906573.ece

He expressed displeasure over the tendency to break Lingayat community into various sub-castes for seeking reservation and other government benefits. He was speaking after unveiling a statue of Sri Shivabasava Swami of Naganur Rudrakshi Mutt in Belagavi on Wednesday. The seven-feet tall statue inside the mutt premises is installed on a pedestal and covered by a protective wall. Sri Tontada Siddarama Swami said that Sri Shivabasava Swami of Naganur Rudrakshi Mutt was a pioneer of education in North Karnataka. He set up a free hostel for students of KLE College in Belagavi nearly a century ago. The seer also promoted the cause of Kannada in the border areas, he said. His move proved to be an inspiration to many others who set up similar hostels and educational institutions. Sri Gurusidda Mahaswami, Sri Prabhu Channabasava Swami, Sri Siddalinga Swami and other religious leaders were present. The guests gave away Seva Rathna awards to writer Guruling Kapse, N.K. Kumbar, Ashok Chandaragi, C.R. Yaravintalimath, and Channayya Hiremath.

09 December 2021||Belagavi,KARNATAKA||‘Give uniform multi-vitamin pure vegetarian food to all students’||The State Government should open exclusive schools and anganwadis for vegetarian children, if it cannot stop providing eggs in schools and anganwadis, head of All India Vegetarians Federation Sri Dayanand Swami said in Hubballi on Wednesday. “The government should provide uniform multi-vitamin pure vegetarian food to all students or open exclusive schools for vegetarians. The government should stop imposing food habits on vegetarians,’’ the seer, who is the convenor of the federation and convenor of Vishwa Prani Kalyan Mandali, told journalists. “Members of the federation and some religious leaders will participate in the Sant Samavesh and Suvarna Soudha Chalo in Belagavi on December 20 in protest against the State Government’s decision to provide eggs to poor children in schools and anganwadis,’’ he said. He said that giving eggs and bananas to different sections of students would create a wedge between students and lead to discrimination and inequality. “The problem is not limited to government schools. The government is forcing several religious leaders to cook eggs in their aided schools run by mutts. That will be an insult to such seers. We suspect that the government is introducing this scheme under pressure from poultries,’’ he said. “It is unfortunate that a government that seeks directions from Hindu organisations, RSS and Vishwa Hindu Parishat, with a Lingayat Chief Minister and a Brahmin Education Minister, is taking such steps. It is condemnable,’’ he said. Earlier also, governments led by S. Bangarappa, H.D. Kumaraswamy and B.S. Yeddiyurappa had planned to distribute eggs in schools. But they had withdrawn the proposal after protests from various organisations. “We warn of a State-wide agitation if the government does not withdraw the scheme immediately,” he said.  The government should stop imposing food habits on vegetarians, says head of All India Vegetarians Federation Sri Dayanand Swami||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/give-uniform-multi-vitamin-pure-vegetarian-food-to-all-students/article37906684.ece

09 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Rs. 16 cr. dues prevent BMTC from getting a new bus stand||Pending bills of Rs. 16 crore is holding back the transfer of the newly-constructed bus stand at Kalasipalyam to the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC). The cash-strapped corporation had approached the State Government to clear the dues to the contractor. The terminal, taken up for construction in 2016, is almost complete, barring some final work. Sources said that the contractor has been waiting for the corporation to clear the bills and take possession of the property for over a year. Until that happens, passengers remain inconvenienced. Hundreds of city buses by BMTC, Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and private players operate from that point. At present, in the absence of a functioning terminal, city buses are operated from three points in the area and buses are seen parked on the busy road blocking traffic. With buses parked alongside black spots where garbage is dumped indiscriminately, passengers have no choice but to board in unhygienic conditions. The lack of toilets is another problem. It’s not only passengers who are upset. A BMTC employee manning movement of the buses in the area said, “Buses are haphazardly parked. It is very difficult to control their movement. If we get a designated space inside the bus stand, it will help. Moreover, people are urinating everywhere due to the lack of toilets.” Other than city buses, private bus operators also operate from the point to various destinations such as KGF, Hosur and M.M. Hills. A large number of inter-State services also originate from Kalasipalyam. The bus terminal is spread across 4.3 acres of land with provisions to operate 18 BMTC buses at a time and six each for KSRTC and private operators. The cost of the project is around Rs. 63 crore. The fact that the handover hasn’t happened yet is a sore point with regular commuters. “Thousands board at this point. Now we risk our lives to cross the road to catch a bus,” said Suma H., a student. Asked when the BMTC would start commercial operations, V. Anbukumar, MD, BMTC, said, “We are expecting a required grant from the Government to clear the pending bills within a week or ten days. The BMTC has to pay Rs. 16 crore to the contractor. More than 90% of the project is complete. All measures will be taken to complete the pending works and operationalise the bus stand.” The BMTC is yet to take measures to provide connectivity between the terminal and K.R. Market metro station, which is around 500 m away. Officials said it will build a link to the metro station from the bus stand.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rs-16-cr-dues-prevent-bmtc-from-getting-a-new-bus-stand/article37906492.ece
09 December 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Ten high-end cars registered in the city impounded||An alleged nexus between Regional Transport Office (RTO) officials, middlemen and car owners to evade taxes while registering high-end cars has again come to the fore. Transport officials on Tuesday impounded 10 luxury vehicles of various makes, including Mercedes Benz and BMW among others after it was found that their owners were allegedly involved in evading tax. By reportedly misusing ‘loopholes’ in the system, impounded vehicles were registered by either partially paying tax or in some cases evading it completely. All the impounded vehicles were registered in Bengaluru. Transport Commissioner N. Shivakumar said that these vehicles were registered prior to the introduction of Vahan 4 portal. “Of the 10 vehicles, owners of six high-end cars have due of Rs. 1.47 crore as tax. Owners of vehicles that include BMW and Mercedes Benz either paid tax partially or not paid tax at all. There is a possibility of the RTO officials colluding with owners of the vehicles or the agents,” said Mr. Shivakumar, adding that an investigation into this is under way. The official said the vehicles could have been registered by submitting fake challan numbers of taxes. L. Narendra Holkar, additional commissioner of transport (Enforcement South), said that they have sought information and registration details of the vehicles from the National Informatic Centre which had designed the registration portal. Seven of the cars impounded bear the registration number, 5556, and are allegedly owned by a single person. An official said the owner of the car is a property owner with political links. He had registered the cars in various RTOs such as Koramangala, Bengaluru East, Electronics City among others. They are currently impounded at the Nelamangala RTO. "The extent of the tax evasion by the owner will be know after the investigation," said the official. In the recent past, there were many instances of owners registering high-end cars outside the State, but plying them on roads in Karnataka without paying taxes. But owners of luxury cars registered in the city with permanent registration numbers evading taxes has raised serious questions about the functioning of the RTOs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ten-high-end-cars-registered-in-the-city-impounded/article37906499.ece

The committee comprising doctors from both Government and private hospitals met here on Wednesday to discuss treatment and discharge protocols apart from screening and testing strategies in the wake of emerging new variants. K. Ravi, Professor and Head of the Department of Medicine at Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI), who heads the committee, said, “With regard to discharge, the existing norms of testing RTPCR negative twice in a span of 48 hours after 14 days of onset of symptoms will hold good. However, we are yet to take a call on whether we have to wait for genome sequencing reports of the patients before discharging them.” Same family C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, who is also part of the clinical experts committee, said it is ideal to follow the existing protocols as irrespective of the variant the infection belongs to the same family of SARS-CoV-2. “We cannot hold back pateints if they are symptom free and test negative twice after 14 days of onset of symtpoms,” he said. Another committee member, K S Satish, who is also the President of the Karnataka Pulmonologists Association, said they will finalise the guidelines based on WHO and ICMR recommendations in a day or two. “A report on the guidelines will be submitted to the government shortly,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/continue-existing-treatment-protocols/article37906502.ece

While recommending that there should be 24x7 emergency services in all the PHCs, the KSLSA has suggested that the Government should survey all the PHCs, provide necessary infrastructure, human resources including sufficient number of doctors, para-medical staff and health workers after KSLSA’s random survey found several lacunae in PHCs. Providing proper residential accommodations for medical staff at PHCs, digitisation of storage, collection of stocks, maintenance of health records of patients and financial data to track flow of funds, installation of CCTV surveillance systems, immediate repairing dilapidated buildings of some PHCs, and ensuring cleanliness and hygiene were among the other recommendations made by the KSLSA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-implement-suggestions-to-improve-phcs/article37906500.ece

Bipin Rawat, who was killed in a helicopter crash in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday, was a regular visitor to Bengaluru to take part in defence-related events, including the biennial Bengaluru air show Aero India. He also visited Kodagu many times and highlighted the service of Kodavas in Forces. He visited two editions of the premier air event as the Chief of Army Staff, in 2017 and 2019. He was back in Bengaluru when the truncated premier event was held early this year as the Chief of Defence Staff. “He was deeply seeped into the military affairs and showed his keenness to participate in such events,” a defence source said. Among his last events in Bengaluru was the Indian Air Force conclave “Synergised Objectives”, organised to mark 50 years of India’s victory in the 1971 Indo-Pak war on October 22 during which he had indicated that the contours of the theatre command was ready. In his speech, he had warned of the Chinese threat due to the advancement in cyber and space domain, and had pitched to incorporate AI, robotics, cyber, and electronic warfare. Remembering Cariappa When Gen. Bipin Rawat was the Chief of Army Staff, he visited Gonikoppa in Kodagu in November 2017 to unveil the bronze statues of Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa and General K.S. Thimayya. At the function, he recalled that Kodagu has served the country with distinction by sending a large number of youth to join the army. He remarked that the sacrifices of people of Kodagu will always be remembered by the Indian Army. He had also pitched for Bharat Ratna for Field Marshal Cariappa and announced support to convert Sunny Side, the residence of Gen. Thimayya, into a museum. Locals aver that the support of Gen. Bipin Rawat to the establishment of the museum was immense and credit him for some of the vintage weapons that are on display at the museum. He visited Madikeri as the Chief of Defence Staff in February this year along with President Ram Nath Kovind in connection with the inauguration of the museum.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/gen-rawat-was-a-regular-at-aero-india/article37906520.ece

09 December 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||State Govt. urged to withdraw National Education Policy||The Ballari district units of the All-India Democratic Students’ Organisation (AIDSO) and the All-India Save Education Committee (AISEC) staged a demonstration on Wednesday outside the office of Deputy Commissioner in Ballari opposing the imposition of National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020). In a memorandum addressed to the Higher Education Minister, the organisations demanded that the Government withdraw the policy. “Before going to implement an education policy, the Government should consult and have brainstorming discussions with the stakeholders, especially the representatives of the students, parents, educationists and teaching community. But the BJP-led Union Government has introduced the NEP 2020 without taking the opinions of the stakeholders. There are many issues in the policy that go straight against the interests of the students. The Government should withdraw the policy and restart the process by consulting the stakeholders,” R. Somashekhargouda, district president of AISEC, said during the protest. Criticising the State Government for its hurry to become the first State in the country to implement the new policy, Mr. Somashekhargouda alleged that the Education Department in the State had started the implementation of the policy without even preparing curriculum as per the new policy. “It takes two years, at least, to prepare the curriculum and textbooks as per the new policy as such an exercise requires extensive consultation and discussions. But, the Government has prepared them within a month and went for implementation. Many teachers, educationists and even parents have expressed their concerns that such an irresponsible act would harm the future of the students,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-govt-urged-to-withdraw-national-education-policy/article37906692.ece

09 December 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Four of family found dead; woman taken into custody for abetment||Four members of a family hailing from Bagalkot district were found dead in a house near Jeppu Market here on Wednesday. The police gave their names as Nagesh Shiraguppi (30), his wife, Vijayalakshmi (26), and their two children, Sapna (8) and Samarth (4). They hailed from Sunaga village of Bilagi taluk of Bagalkot district. The police said that at around 10.30 a.m. an Assistant Sub-Inspector of Mangaluru South Police Station received a voice message from a man (later, identified as Shiraguppi) accusing a woman from Bejai here of attempting to religiously convert his wife and holding that woman responsible for the death of his family members. The man also sent an image of a note where he has reiterated his charge. The police traced the message to Shiraguppi who worked as a truck driver and did other sundry jobs for his owner, a stone quarry operator. Shiraguppi and his wife, Vijayalakshmi, who worked as a maid in houses around, stayed in the old house of the stone quarry operator in Jeppu. As police rushed to the spot, the quarry owner too went there after hearing that Shiraguppi and his family members have not come out of the house since morning. Shiraguppi was found hanging from the ceiling, while Vijayalakshmi was found dead on a cot. The police said that there were blood stains on the mattress and pillow indicating that Vijayalakshmi could have been smothered to death by her husband. The death of the two children is attributed to them consuming food laced with poison on Tuesday night. The family had moved to the house a month ago, the police said. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar said that Shiraguppi and his wife had had fought earlier and in October, the latter had left her husband and children to live in the house of the accused woman in Bejai. Shiraguppi had then filed a missing complaint. A few days later, Vijayalakshmi appeared before the Woman Police Station and told the personnel there that as Shiraguppi had assured her of treating her well, she was going back to live with him. After the recovery of the note written by Shiraguppi, Mr. Kumar said, the Mangaluru South Police sou motu registered a case under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of Indian Penal Code against the Bejai woman and took her into custody. Meanwhile, Vishwa Hindu Parishad has announced that it will be holding a protest on Friday to demand action against those involved in attempting to convert Vijayalakshmi. In a statement, VHP district secretary Shivanand Mendon urged the State Government to bring in the anti-religious conversion law.

Speaking to media persons in Udupi after attending a programme organised by Sri Krishna Temple/Mutt, Mr. Swamy said that the inquiry should not be just for the sake of it but [it should] go deep into the issue.

09 December 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Manjunath Bhandary exudes confidence of winning polls||Exuding the confidence of winning the election to the Legislative Council from the local authorities constituency of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, Congress candidate and Vice-President of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee Manjunath Bhandary said on Wednesday that he will get the required over 2,000 first preference votes. Talking to reporters at the District Congress Committee office here, Mr. Bhandary said that apart from getting 1,900 votes of Congress-backed members of gram panchayats and other local bodies, he is likely to get first preference votes of other members, including the over 200 Independents. “I am confident of winning the seat. I have assured voters of becoming their voice in the Legislative Council,” he said. Mr. Bhandary and Minister for Social Welfare Kota Srinivas Poojary are among the three candidates contesting in the elections to the dual-member seat for the local authorities constituency of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, which is slated to be held on Friday. Mr. Bhandary said that he has worked in his personal capacity for the last six months to chart out details of all the 6,040 voters. He started calling on voters even before his name was announced by the party. “If I had failed to get party ticket, I would have shared this information with the candidate who would have been nominated,” he said and thanked the party high command for providing an opportunity for a party activist like him to serve members of the local bodies. On his close association with many BJP leaders and Sangh Parivar members, Mr. Bhandary said that as an entrepreneur, he has friendship with politicians across party lines. This does not in any way come in his way of professing the ideals of the Congress in the Legislative Council. District Congress Committee president and MLC K. Harish Kumar was present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/manjunath-bhandary-exudes-confidence-of-winning-polls/article37906883.ece
09 December 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Airport shifts screening of international passengers to pre-immigration area||Mangaluru International Airport has streamlined the process of screening international passengers, including those arriving from at-risk countries, pursuant to a directive from the Ministry of Civil Aviation on Tuesday. The entire process is now being completed in the pre-immigration area at the international arrival hall. Hitherto, international passengers, including those arriving from or having transited through at-risk countries, were undergoing rapid RT-PCR tests at the arrival hall of the airport after clearing immigration and customs. The airport has now organised to collect swabs of passengers from at-risk countries and 2% of the passengers arriving from other non-at-risk countries selected by the airline concerned, the authorities concerned said in a release. A dedicated registration desk, help desk and foreign exchange services along with a refreshment counter have been set up for passengers in the international arrival area. A holding area has also been created for passengers arriving from at-risk countries. Rollable standees have been set up at vantage points explaining the latest guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for international passengers. A special isolation room too has been set up in the arrival area to hold passengers testing positive for coronavirus. Airport Health Organisation (APHO) staff have been issued with PPE kits to transport passenger testing positive through a safe route to ambulances from where they will be taken to institutional quarantine. Other passengers have been requested to follow the directive given by the local health authorities, the release added. Since the new testing process was initiated on December 2, 2021 for COVID-19, with Omicron emerging as a variant of concern, 74 passengers, including 10 from at-risk countries, have been screened on arrival at the airport and all have tested negative for coronavirus, the release added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/airport-shifts-screening-of-international-passengers-to-pre-immigration-area/article37906888.ece

09 December 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Work resumes on Azeez Sait Main Road||The work on repairing Azeez Sait Main Road, which has been in a deplorable condition for a long time, resumed earlier this week. The repair works, which had actually begun in March-April this year, had been discontinued twice earlier, much to the disappointment of the residents of the adjoining localities like Shantinagar and Ghousianagar, who were forced to put up with an apparently unmotorable thoroughfare. However, road repair machinery was back on the road from Monday, signalling the resumption of the pending repair works on the road. After Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) tweeted photographs of the progress of the repair works, an official said the works had resumed pending an approval for the variation estimate from the Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA) in Bengaluru. According to MCC’s tweet, the work had been taken up under the Chief Minister’s grants at an estimated cost of Rs. 250 lakh. “We have convinced the contractor to resume work after the officials of DMA assured the senior officials of MCC that the variation estimated will be approved soon. There was a lot of pressure on not only the elected representatives of the area, but also officials of MCC,” the official said. Commuters had begun falling on the road, which had been dug up, and were suffering injuries. Protests were held in front of the head office of MCC on Sayyaji Rao Road and the Zone 8 office in Udayagiri against the delay in the road work. Hence, a decision was taken to resume the work by convincing the contractor that the approval will come soon, the official added. About 910 metres of Azeez Sait Main Road from Shantinagar 1st Cross to Ek Minar Mosque, which has already been widened after removing encroachments, will be asphalted as part of the ongoing works, the official added. Azeez Sait Main Road connects Sathgalli bus depot on the Outer Ring Road with Forum Mall in Gandhinagar, but the stretch of road cutting through the densely populated localities of Shantinagar and Ghousianagar in Narasimharaja Assembly constituency was in such a pathetic state that commuters were upset with the authorities and elected representatives for neglecting the road. Expressing confidence that the roadworks will be completed in about three weeks, MCC officials hoped that the residents will be able to use the newly-laid road from the start of 2022. It may be mentioned here that works on the road, which had not been repaired for several years now, began in March-April this year only to be suspended due to non-availability of construction material during the lockdown. The work resumed in September only to be suspended a couple of weeks later after elected representatives took objection to the specifications of the material, which was being used to lay the road. The elected representatives felt that the layer of asphalt should be thicker to bear the load of heavy vehicles and the volume of traffic that plied on the road. Hence, the officials had to obtain a clearance from the Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA) by submitting a variation estimate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/work-resumes-on-azeez-sait-main-road/article37906911.ece
09 December 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Postponement plagues industrial adalat||Industrialists in the city are peeved over the repeated postponement of Kaigarike Adalat that was scheduled to be held here. Though the original date was changed multiple times, it was finally scheduled for November 12 only to be postponed again. The election code of conduct came into effect from November 9 when the schedule for the polls to the Legislative Council from the local bodies was announced forcing the postponement. The Government has bandied about a number of dates after the poll date – slated for December 10 – but there is skepticism about the adalat being held anytime soon. Suresh Kumar Jain, General Secretar, Mysuru Industries’ Association, said that a new date has been flagged during the second week of January but the association was going slow on publicising it given its experience of announcing the dates only to rescind it later. It has been over 10 years since the Industrial or Kaigarika Adalat was held in the city and local stakeholders have grievances that remained unresolved for years. “We were hoping that some of the pending grievances would be resolved in the adalat but unfortunately it is yet to take place,” said Mr. Jain. The last Kaigarike Adalat held in Mysuru was in 2011 and since then new issues having a bearing on industrial activity or grievances that was impacting industries, have cropped up or have not been resolved by the authorities. The Kaigarike Adalat for Mysuru region will involve stakeholders from Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan, Kodagu and Chikkamagaluru districts and Mr. Jain said that the bulk of the grievances pertain to land allocation. “There have been cases in which a letter officially acknowledging the allotment, have been issued but the beneficiaries have been unable to take possession of the land for various reasons,” according to Mr. Jain. In such cases where land was taken possession of by the allottees it was subsequently found to be problematic or unsuitable for the proposed industries. “Though in such cases a swap is possible it is subject to availability of land which is now the key issue which is hampering industrial growth of Mysuru,” Mr. Jain added. The export centre for which the local stakeholders were fighting for decades is also yet to become functional. It was meant to give a fillip to the manufacturing and export units. It was originally conceived in 2010 and the civil works began in July 2019. But two years on, the works have come to a standstill and the pandemic too has contributed to this. For local entrepreneurs keen to tap the international market, the export centre was set to emerge as a single-window facility to complete all export-related formalities. But civil works are yet to be completed for the centre to begin functional. The pandemic has also acted as a dampener to the industrial activity in general but association members aver the momentum was gaining traction and was nearing the re-COVID-19 level of activity. Hence they want the work on the export centre to be expedited.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/postponement-plagues-industrial-adalat/article37906906.ece

09 December 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||VVCE students replace steel with bamboo in construction||Three students of Vidyavardhaka College of Engineering (VVCE), who graduated in civil engineering this year, have demonstrated how bamboo can replace steel to reduce construction costs, under certain conditions, besides making it eco-friendly. Nishanth, M.P. Karthik, and Mahendra Halamandage developed the concept and worked on it and it was listed as the best project for 2021 by the Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology. The students created a spherical shell which was reinforced by using locally available bamboom which was transformed into a mesh akin to a bamboo cage. This was used as reinforcement and to create the contours and shape of the spherical shell. The shape helps reduce the cost of construction as it reduces the need to use steel to support the structures. Through this project, the students have demonstrated how locally grown bamboo could be used to cut down construction costs, according to P.K. Umesha, Professor, VVCE. Dr. Umesha, who was the guide, said that bamboo can replace steel and used in earthquake-prone area for low-cost housing. Besides, it is eco-friendly, corrosion resistive, cost-effective, and lightweight, he added. With pollution only getting worse, building eco-friendly houses is now a necessity. Replacement of bamboo mesh as reinforcement will promote cultivation of bamboo which will help absorb carbon dioxide in atmosphere and contribute to sustainable development, according to the college authorities. Mr. Nishanth said that in order to produce 1 tonne of steel, 2.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide is emitted into atmosphere. Underlining the importance of the project, B. Sadashive Gowda, Principal, VVCE, said the use of bamboo stemmed from a quest for alternatives for conventional technology and practices which is required in a lot of areas. The students have demonstrated the possibilities of bamboo and it is for the industry to adapt and scale it up, he said. “From resorts to low-cost construction in hilly terrain and environmentally sensitive zones, it has myriad applications and will also have a positive benefit on the environment apart from reducing the cost,” said Dr. Gowda. The college has also filed for a patent for this project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vvce-students-replace-steel-with-bamboo-in-construction/article37906913.ece

09 December 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Issue of demolition of church compound will be raised in legislature: Siddaramaiah||The demolition of the compound of a church in Mysuru on Tuesday by the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) will be raised in the coming session of the Legislative Assembly, said former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. Mr. Siddaramaiah, who visited the church in Gandhinagar in Mysuru on Wednesday along with party MLA representing Narasimharaja Assembly constituency Tanveer Sait, said he will write to MCC Commissioner Lakshmikant Reddy and seek an explanation on the matter. The next course of action will be decided based on the reply received from the MCC. He said he and Mr .Sait will raise the issue in the next session of the Legislative Assembly and speak on the matter. Referring to the MCC’s contention that the compound was removed following orders from a city court, Mr. Siddaramaiah said he would seek an explanation from the MCC Commissioner on whether the court’s orders were to survey the land or remove the compound. He alleged that certain ‘communal’ officials were targeting the minorities not just in Mysuru, but in the entire State. He said the minority communities need not fear as the Congress will work to uphold Constitutional values. Mr. Sait, who also spoke on the occasion, said the documents pertaining to the church had been submitted to the then Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru four years ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/issue-of-demolition-of-church-compound-will-be-raised-in-legislature-siddaramaiah/article37906909.ece

09 December 2021||IDUKKI,KERALA||Only one Mullaperiyar shutter open||Tamil Nadu closed eight spillway shutters of the Mullaperiyar dam of the nine that weres opened in the morning on Wednesday. The shutters were closed in the evening after the water level dipped to 141.75 ft. at 4 p.m. on Wednesday. The average inflow of water stood at 4,257 cusecs, while the tunnel discharge was 1,867 cusecs. Earlier, the nine shutters were raised at 9 a.m., discharging 7,105.59 cusecs of water to the Periyar. Possibility of opening Residents along the downstream of the dam say that though Tuesday night did not witness a heavy release of water to the Periyar, the possibility of shutters being opened again remained. According to a Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) official, Tamil Nadu had kept open only one shutter by 10 cm during daytime and maintained the water level close to the maximum level of 142 ft. This was done to “overrule” the formalities of opening the shutters. As per the norms, Tamil Nadu is required to give advance warning and notice to Kerala before opening the shutters. “When one shutter is kept open for just 10 cm, they can claim that the shutters were not closed so as to avoid giving an advance warning,” said the KSEB official, adding that the sudden opening of dam shutters and release of a high volume of water could have been avoided if the water level was kept at a safe level of at least one foot below the maximum level. Idukki reservoir Meanwhile, the Shutter 3 of the Idukki dam remained open by 40 cm at 4 p.m. on Wednesday. A dam safety official said a decision on closing the shutter would be taken after analysing the possibility of heavy rainfall. He said the shutter could be closed at night though there was a norm to avoid opening of shutters at night. The water level in the Idukki dam fell to 2,401.38 ft. by 4 p.m. Power generation at the Moolamattom powerhouse continued to be above normal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/only-one-mullaperiyar-shutter-open/article37906803.ece
09 December 2021||KALPETTA,KERALA||Hundreds of tribespeople in Wayanad waiting for promised land||Hundreds of landless tribal families who have erected huts on forest land in various parts of Wayanad district as part of the land agitation in 2012 continue to be in misery, with the authorities paying scant attention to their plight. When the land stir intensified in the district, with support from major political parties, in May and June 2012, hundreds of landless tribal families participated. They erected huts on forest land under the South and North Wayanad forest divisions, hoping that they would get to own it at the end of the agitation. More than 800 acres of forest land were encroached upon by nearly 1,000 tribal families at 53 agitation points in the two forest divisions. The largest number of tribal families took part in the agitation at Moonnanakuzhi and Cheeyambam agitation centres under the South Wayanad Forest Division. Balakrishnan of Anappara tribal settlement has planted nearly 400 pepper vines and 250 coffee plants on an acre of forest land ‘assigned’ to him by leaders of the Adivasi Congress, an outfit of the Congress party, at Cheeyambam. He was promised that he would never be evicted. Nani, a resident of Irulam Paniya settlement near Pulpally, is an activist with the Adivasi Kshema Samiti, the tribal wing of the CPI(M). She says her party members told her that tribals should continue agitating and not leave the agitation centre till they got land. Though Forest Department officials arrested 826 tribal agitators, including 296 women, after demolishing nearly 1,287 huts erected by the latter in July 2012 alone, they were let off. They were back when local courts granted them bail. The families were those arrested under the Kerala Forest Act but later, the government cancelled all forest cases against them. Once the intensity of the agitation abated, a few returned to the huts. Those who did not possess land stayed back. “Though nine years have passed after we launched the agitation, nobody tells us how long we have to continue our wretched life inside the forest,” Ms. Nani said. The members still live in unhygienic makeshift huts, with no potable water, vulnerable to diseases and attacks by wild animals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hundreds-of-tribespeople-in-wayanad-waiting-for-promised-land/article37906750.ece

Bindu Sivan posted an emphatic win in the Gandhi Nagar Division and improved the tally of the LDF in the 74-member council. She won the election with an improved majority than that of her husband K.K. Sivan, whose death warranted the bypoll in the division. Ms. Sivan defeated United Democratic Front (UDF) candidate P.D. Martin by a margin of 687 votes, which is almost six times the margin with which Sivan had defeated Mr. Martin during the last civic election. During the last election, Mr. Sivan had won the election by a margin of 115 votes. With the win from the Gandhi Nagar division, the LDF has a strength of 37 members including the four independent councillors. While the UDF has the support of 32 members, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had got four of its representatives elected to the council. The Ernakulam South seat, which was represented by a woman councillor of the BJP, fell vacant following her death. Responding to the media after the announcement of the poll results, Ms. Sivan said the victory should be viewed as approval of the good governance in the Kochi Corporation led by Mayor M. Anilkumar. The people in the division wanted to take forward the development works that were initiated by Sivan. She dedicated the improved majority of the LDF in the division to her husband. In Piravom, LDF candidate Ajesh Manohar won the Edapallychira division by defeating UDF candidate Arun Kallarakkal by a margin of 26 votes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-wins-bypolls-in-ernakulam/article37906786.ece

A comprehensive plan is being prepared to meet the goal, he said at the inaugural address at the formation of the reception committee for the State meet of the party on Wednesday. The conference will be held here from March 1 to 4, 2022. Fascist forces will make inroads, if we lose the fight in protecting our secular values, Mr. Balakrishnan said. He alleged that a campaign was on to scuttle the development of the State. The CPI(M) had supported the high-speed rail project proposed by the previous UDF government. But the UDF is now opposing the semi high-speed rail corridor project proposed by the LDF government, he said. Mr. Balakrishnan claimed that the project was necessary for the progress of the State. The land required for the project is being acquired at prices above the market rate, he said. Besides party leaders, the 2,001-member reception committee for the State meet consists of academicians, writers, artistes, and film-makers, including critics M.K. Sanoo and M. Leelavathy among patrons and poet Balachandran Chullikkad and filmmakers Rajeev Ravi and Ranji Panicker among vice presidents. Industries Minister and CPI(M) State secretariat member P. Rajeeve is the chairman of the committee, while district secretary C.N.

09 December 2021||Kochi,KERALA||City police HQ to be energy efficient||The Kochi City Police Complex, now under construction and scheduled to be commissioned by the middle of 2023, is expected to highlight Kerala’s concern over climate change and carbon emissions by considerably increasing energy efficiency through measures that include attention to natural lighting and airflow. “Public buildings in the State are more and more concerned about reducing their carbon footprints by adopting measures to reduce energy consumption,” said B.R. Ajith, architect, who is involved in designing the building of the police headquarters that will come up close to the busy Banerjee-Shanmugham Road junction in the city. K.A. Shanavas, joint director of the Kerala State Productivity Council and accredited energy auditor, said there has been a considerable push towards more energy-efficient buildings, especially after the Energy Conservation Building Code came into force. The police headquarters complex in Kochi will be spread over 1,25,000 sq.ft. A building of such extent, under normal circumstances, will require energy supply of around 400 kW of power. However, adoption of energy-efficient measures like using LED lights, maximum natural light usage and natural airflow will help bring down the potential power consumption, excluding the requirement for air conditioning, to about 300 kW. The concept of more energy-efficient buildings stands out as the country observes a fortnight of Energy Efficiency between December 1 and 14. December 14 is celebrated as Energy Conservation Day. C. Jayaraman, an expert in energy conservation in Kochi, said it was time people became more responsible for the use of energy just as they are being educated about the use of water. There should be more accountability on the use of energy because energy is a great resource like water, he said. Accountability about energy utilisation should be considered a part of social responsibility for the greater good of society, he added. Mr. Ajith said the upcoming police headquarters would be an example of green building consciousness being promoted by the Indian Green Building Council, which has helped reduce carbon footprint by the building industry by providing support to a range of measures in energy conservation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/city-police-hq-to-be-energy-efficient/article37906791.ece
09 December 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||HC pulls up child rights panel||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court has pulled up the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights for exceeding its jurisdiction by ordering psychiatric treatment for a woman. The Bench comprising Justice K. Vinod Chandran and Justice C. Jayachandran recently impleaded the commission as it was of the prima facie opinion that it had exceeded its jurisdiction. The Bench directed the commission to file an affidavit explaining the reasons why it had issued such an order. The court issued the directive when a writ petition filed by K. Balakrishnan from Kodungalloor, father of the woman, seeking a directive to produce his daughter and two grandchildren came up for hearing. The Bench observed that “we are more distressed by the manner in which the commission proceeded in the matter.” It was appalling that the commission thought it fit to direct the District Child Protection Officer (DCPO) to submit a mental status report of the woman, the court added. The Bench observed that the writ petition narrated a sad tale of marital discord, from the very inception of the marriage and the wife being evicted from the marital home after giving birth to two children and the harassment she had to undergo at the hands of her husband. The court interacted with the woman and her two children who were produced before the court, along with a psychiatrist. The doctor told the court that as of now, the woman did not seem to be suffering from any psychotic illness and that her disturbed mental status as of now was only due to the stress she had undergone in her life and because of the forceful admission in a mental institution and separation from her children. The court allowed the woman and her children to go with her father.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-pulls-up-child-rights-panel/article37906805.ece

Sivan who had earned a place in the minds of people, said Mayor M. Anilkumar. LDF workers, led by CPI(M) leaders C.N. Mohanan and C.M. Dinesh Mani, worked overtime to ensure the victory of the front’s candidate Bindu Sivan. The LDF-led Kochi Corporation council had kick-started a series of development activities in the division including the rehabilitation of the residents of P&T Colony. The council will take forward the projects and make Gandhi Nagar a model division in the Kochi Corporation, said Mr. Anilkumar in a statement. Meanwhile, Ernakulam District Congress Committee president Muhammad Shiyas termed the LDF win in the division as a technical one, which according to him, was won by engaging in vote trading and malpractices. The CPI(M) had enrolled a large number of bogus votes in the two divisions of the two civic bodies in the district which went to polls. In Gandhi Nagar, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate polled only 191 votes against the 481 it had bagged last time. The CPI(M) had entered into a secret understanding with the BJP to shift its votes to the latter when bypoll will be conducted in the Ernakulam South seat, a seat held by the saffron party last time, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/victory-a-tribute-to-sivan-says-mayor/article37906787.ece

The event, featuring six teams and 30 matches in the double-leg format, will get under way at the floodlit stadium in Thrissur on December 11. It will be preceded by a celebrity women’s football match. Actors Reema Kallingal and Malavika Jayaram, among others, are expected to participate in the match to be held at the Kadavanthra Regional Sports Centre on Friday. Among the teams to feature in the KWL include the women’s team of Gokulam FC, which had won the last league. KFA president Tom Jose said the superior quality of Gokulam FC need not lead to a one-sided league as teams could spring surprise performances. “The winners can participate in next year’s India Women’s League and bag a cash prize of Rs. 1 lakh, while the runners-up will get Rs. 50,000. We want to gradually increase the number of teams while ensuring quality. We will have to give the women’s game the importance it deserves for improvement. The league will also give a fresh lease of life to officials and others associated with the game,” he said. While the KFA will deal with the official conduct and scheduling of matches, Scoreline Sports will handle the promotional and commercial aspects of the league, including match telecast. It will be the sole women’s league to be telecast live. “We are delighted to be associated with the rejuvenation of the KWL and are looking at a long-term collaboration with the KFA. We aim at creating a congenial atmosphere for encouraging more women to take up sports by organising more matches and creating awareness,” said Minna Jayesh, director of Scoreline Sports Private Limited. KWL matches will be held on alternative days.

Incidentally, this was also the first international batch to be trained virtually under the Bereavement Companionship Programme being run jointly by Mission Better Tomorrow, an NGO, Kozhikode-based Institute of Palliative Medicine, and the Sydney-based Death Literacy Institute. The batch was an eclectic mix of doctors, nurses, professors, mental health workers, and activists chosen jointly by the Palliative Care Society of Bangladesh and Phoenix Wellness Centre, Bangladesh. One of the major highlights of the programme was the active participation of Nezamuddin Ahmad, who is considered the father of palliative care in Bangladesh and the founder-director of the Palliative Care Society of Bangladesh. “Whatever development witnessed in palliative care in Bangladesh is thanks to the collaboration with the Institute of Palliative Medicine dating back to 2005. The bereavement training programme has been highly successful, and we look at taking it forward with the training of more batches from our country,” said Mr. Ahmad over the phone from Bangladesh. The training programme usually lasts 15 hours spread over three days but was extended to 18 hours over four days to adapt the programme to the requirements of the local culture of the participants. “We have generated the bereavement manual in Bangla along with English and Malayalam to facilitate identification of future trainers in Bangladesh. Since bereavement is closely associated with the local culture, the manual will be constantly modified to adapt to different regions and countries as we plan to expand the training programme globally,” said Suresh Kumar, founder-director, Institute of Palliative Medicines, a collaborating centre of the World Health Organisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-rare-show-of-unity-in-palliative-care/article37906778.ece

Shiji Sivaji, member of the commission, met the woman here on Wednesday as part of the inquiry into the alleged lapses on the part of the police and to extend all support to her. “The woman will be accommodated at the government shelter home till legal and other related steps in the case are complete,” she said. The commission has asked the police to furnish a reply on the action taken on her complaint lodged at the Ernakulam North police station. A native of Kayamkulam, the woman had complained that she was denied entry into her husband’s house at Kaloor despite an order issued by the First Class Judicial Magistrate, Aluva, permitting her entry. The woman had alleged that her husband and his relatives locked the house and left the place after hearing about the order issued by the court. She was forced to sit in front of the gate and her health had deteriorated following the tough situation. The woman had complained that her husband took all her money and abandoned her after her health condition worsened. Ms. Shiji said that the District Legal Services Authority has agreed to provide legal help to the woman. People associated with the authority will inform the First Class Judicial Magistrate, Aluva, about her plight. They will also submit that the woman was denied entry by her husband in violation of the court order. Personnel at the Ernakulam North Police station said that they were yet to get the order from the court to break open the lock and to ensure the entry of woman into her husband’s house. The District Legal Services Authority has agreed to present this before the court and seek necessary orders, they said. The husband of the woman was not available for comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/commission-comes-to-the-rescue-of-woman-abandoned-by-husband/article37906797.ece

The project areas should be expanded to include the coastal region between Cheriyakadavu and Fort Kochi, the Vedhi said in a statement here. The organisation also demanded that the material dredged from the shipping channel, also used by the Cochin Port Trust, be deposited close to the Chellanam coast to help reduce the depth of sea. The Vedhi is of the view that the 121 geotextile tubes now lying idle should be utilised to build breakwaters at designated distances to help prevent sea erosion.

Daniel at a press meet here on Wednesday. Depending on the requirement, selected candidates will be sent to the engineering departments of various local bodies, Kerala Water Authority (KWA), Kerala Electrical and Allied Engineering Co.

Each month, the panchayat will have to set aside Rs. 30 lakh for paying the honorarium and around Rs. 7.5 crore in total will be spent in two years. Perhaps, the Kollam district panchayat will be the first local body in the country to implement such a project,” said Mr. Daniel. In order to address the pandemic-triggered job crisis, the panchayat had earlier launched Malakhakoottam, another project offering on-job training with stipend for 100 Scheduled Caste women for two years. Steady income “Considering the current situation, the annual plan of the panchayat focusses on different projects that generate employment.

Much to the relief of the CPI(M), its nominees retained the prestigious Nanmanda division of the Kozhikode district panchayat as well as the Koompara ward of Koodaranji grama panchayat which were vacated by party legislators Kanathil Jameela and Linto Joseph, who had won from Koyilandy and Thiruvambady Assembly segments respectively. Ms. Jameela had stepped down as the Kozhikode district panchayat president, while Linto Joseph had resigned as president of Koodaranji grama panchayat. In the Nanmanda division, CPI(M) candidate Rasiya Thottai defeated her nearest rival K. Jameela by a margin of 6,766 votes. She secured 19,381 votes and her rival 12,615 votes. BJP nominee Girija Valiyaparambil could muster only 4,518 votes, and there were seven invalid votes. Earlier, Ms. Jameela of the CPI(M) had won the polls after defeating the Congress nominee by a margin of over 8,000 votes. The LDF has already a brute majority with 18 seats in the 27-member council. However, the bypoll to Nanmanda saw the voter turnout drastically come down to 62.54% this time. About 80% of voters had exercised their franchise in the December 2020 local body polls. In the keenly contested ward of Koompara in Koodaranji grama panchayat, CPI(M) candidate Adarsh Joseph won by a whisker of seven votes. He defeated his nearest rival Sunesh Joseph of the Congress. Mr. Adarsh received 447 votes, while Mr. Sunash, 440. BJP candidate E.R. Lajeesh got 13 votes. Two Independents — Sunesh and T.K. Sunesh — got four and nil votes respectively. In the Valliyoth ward of Unnikulam grama panchayat, Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) candidate O.M. Saseendran won by defeating his nearest rival K.V. Pushaparajan, an Independent backed by the LDF by 530 votes. Mr. Saseendran received 1,018 votes while Mr. Pushparajan got 488 votes. BJP candidate M.C. Karunakaran secured only 14 votes. Earlier, IUML nominee E. Gangadharan had won the ward by a margin of 453 votes. The bypoll was necessitated following his death.

09 December 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||‘Exams for private registration students put off on flimsy grounds’||The Parallel College Association has alleged that the University of Calicut has suspended first semester exams for the 2020 batch of private registration undergraduate students on flimsy grounds. Jiji Varghese, president, told the media on Wednesday that the university was all set to hold exams for regular students in aided, unaided and government colleges on December 14. Private registration students, however, had been told that the dates for their exams would be announced later because they were yet to be distributed study materials. A.G. Rajeevan, secretary , claimed that the notifications for declaring the exam dates and seeking remission of fees were similar in nature for regular and private registration students. Of the around 30,000 students under the private registration stream, 3,000 had remitted fees. But when it came to holding exams, private registration students were left in the lurch, Mr. Rajeevan said. ‘No practice’ He pointed out that there had been no practice of distribution of study materials for private registration students. “The School of Distance Education [SDE] of the university had lost the University Grants Commission recognition in 2019. The State government’s plan to bring all distance education courses under the Sree Narayana Guru Open University too did not work out. That was why the students were asked to register privately with the university in 2020,” Mr. Rajeevan said. The Syndicate had then said that once the UGC restores its recognition, they would be migrated to the SDE. However, the migration was yet to be done, he added. The association claimed that delaying exams would affect the academic prospects of students, most of whom are from weaker sections.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/examinations-for-pvt-registration-students-put-off-on-flimsy-grounds/article37906763.ece

Later in the day, the State executive members of the KMPGA too came up with a release saying that the strike would continue in all government medical colleges across the State. The declaration calling off the strike was taken after a section of KMPGA leaders held talks with Health Minister Veena George in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday night. The Calicut unit of the KMPGA claimed then itself that the decision to withdraw the strike was taken without informing any of the college association members across all the government medical colleges in the State. In addition, the government did not provide any written orders on their demands related to the delay in medical counselling and posting of Non-Academic Junior Residents (NJAR). KMPGA leaders in Kozhikode also pointed out that despite holding funds which were enough to provide stipends for an entire batch of junior residents, it was unfortunate that the government had turned a deaf ear towards their demand to provide a 4% hike which was promised several months ago. Thus, the junior resident doctors at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, continued to boycott outpatient services, scheduled surgeries, and ward duty. Quoting from a release of the executive committee on Wednesday, one of the KMPGA functionaries in Kozhikode said that the Government should issue an order on the recruitment of NJARs, specifically mentioning their number allotted to each college, date of recruitment, duration of posting, remuneration, working hours and responsibilities. The State should send an official request to the Centre for fast-tracking NEET-PG counselling. Also, resident doctors should get a 4% salary hike. The KMPGA leader said the association would intensify the strike and boycott emergency services, including intensive care units, labour wards, and casualty except COVID duty, from December 10 if the demands are not met.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/resident-doctors-continue-strike-at-mch/article37906764.ece

Mr. Vijayan, during a meeting with Samastha leaders on Tuesday, had assured that the decision to leave Waqf Board appointments to the PSC would be implemented only after discussions with Muslim organisations. The State’s decision had evoked strong protests from the Muslim community, with the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) spearheading a political campaign against the government. A meeting of the Samastha coordination committee held on Wednesday expressed confidence in the Chief Minister’s assurance. “If the State dilly-dallies on the matter, we will be forced to protest,” said SKJU president Syed Mohammed Jiffri Muthukoya Thangal. Samastha demand The Samastha demanded that the government should form a special recruitment board for Waqf Board postings. It also sought that the State restore the 1965 Waqf Board regulation by which only Muslims who are believers would be appointed in the board.

09 December 2021||New Delhi,KERALA||HC seeks ED reply on PFI plea||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) response to a plea by the Kerala-based Popular Front of India (PFI) challenging a money laundering case registered by the agency in 2018. Justice Anu Malhotra granted four weeks to the ED to submit its reply. PFI lawyer Adit Pujari claimed that over 150 summonses had been received by several of its members from across the country for a “roving and fishing inquiry” in the case. Counsel said the present money laundering case by the ED arose from a National Investigation Agency (NIA) case concerning the alleged training of youth in Kerala for carrying out anti-national activities in 2013. The NIA had alleged that the training was being given with an intention to prepare them for terrorist activities and to “commit acts endangering the unity and integrity of the nation”. Mr. Pujari said while the trial court convicted certain persons for offences under the Indian Penal Code, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and the Explosives Act, the High Court concerned had later dropped the UAPA charges against the accused. He said that when the High Court acquitted the accused of offences under the UAPA and gave a finding that there were no anti-national activities, there was no reason for the ED to proceed against the petitioner. Mr. Pujari also claimed that the ED was not following the Supreme Court’s directions with respect to the installation of CCTV cameras at places of interrogation. ED’s counsel Amit Mahajan said the agency was complying with the court’s directive. The High Court said it “expected that the CCTV cameras of the respondent will remain functional at the time of recording of statements”.

Ameer, an expelled branch committee member of the CPI(M), was elected by a margin of 377 votes, giving a shock to the party district leadership. He defeated Congress’s Kuttan and Left Democratic Front’s (LDF) official candidate Mohanakrishnan of the Communist Party of India(CPI). The byelection was necessitated when the Congress’s elected member resigned after getting a job. When the LDF leadership offered the seat to the CPI, a section within the CPI(M) protested. Mr. Ameer was expelled from the party as he refused to obey the party. However, a section in the CPI(M) campaigned for Mr. Ameer. His victory is viewed as a challenge to the party district leadership. The other bypoll winners in the district are: Palakkad district panchayat: CPI(M)’s K.

09 December 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Police meet amidst misconduct plaints||The State law enforcement would hold a conference of law and order officers on Friday to address complaints about police behaviour. A top official told The Hindu that it is a special meeting to revitalise the department. State Police Chief Anil Kanth will chair the conference. The police came under fire from the High Court recently for impeding the process of penalising officers responsible for violating the Constitutional rights of citizens. The High Court found that a woman officer had wrongly accused a Dalit child and her father of mobile phone theft. It felt the police hierarchy had created barriers to holding the officer responsible for misconduct. The incident caught on camera had caused public outrage. The police had protected the officer and merely assigned her to other duties. The court refused to accept the apology of the officer. The conference could perhaps create a baseline for police conduct, accountability and citizen interaction. Law enforcement might consider harnessing technology to audit police conduct,including body cameras. Oppn. charge The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) attacked the police for “protecting the officer” responsible for pushing law student and dowry harassment victim Mofiya Parveen into desperation and later suicide. It organised protests in front of the Aluva police station demanding disciplinary action against the officer. The UDF also blamed the “overreaching power of pro-CPI(M) police unions” that rendered disciplinary action against errant officers almost impossible. Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan pointed out that the accused officer in the Mofiya case had a chequered track record. However, police union “satraps” had ensured that he got key law and order postings despite having drawn adverse remarks from supervisory officers. The Congress also highlighted the “police tendency” to side with accused persons against victims, chiefly women complainants. Mr. Satheesan said the old-fashioned patriarchal values appeared to guide the police and not the law. Women had to clear an exceptionally high hurdle to make themselves heard at police stations.  The police have come under court fire for impeding the process of penalising officers responsible for violating citizen rights.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-meet-amidst-misconduct-plaints/article37906808.ece

The function was at the Government Higher Secondary School, Punkunnam, under the Thrissur Corporation to honour meritorious students. The Mayor, who reached the school, got angry when he saw the banner in which the photo of P. Balachandran, MLA, was given prominently. His photo was given in a small size below. The angry Mayor boycotted the function. “As the school is under the Thrissur Corporation, the Mayor should preside over the function. But I was made chief guest. How can the Mayor be a chief guest in a school under the Corporation,” he asked. Alleges insult “This is an insult to the post of Mayor, not M.K. Varghese as an individual. If people are not ready to respect the protocol, we have to fight for it,” he said. “As it is a school under the Corporation, such a function has to be organised after discussing with the Mayor,” he added.

09 December 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Confusion over discharge of Omicron patients||Although three contacts of the 46-year-old Omicron-infected government anaesthetist tested negative for COVID-19, twice in a span of 48 hours, their discharge from the State-run Bowring and Lady Curzon Medical College and Research Institute, the designated Omicron treatment facility, has become a bone of contention between the treating doctors and Health officials. While the three doctors, an anaesthetist, a cardiothoracic surgeon and a vascular surgeon, had been initially discharged on Tuesday and had left the premises of the hospital, they were asked to come back by the hospital authorities late in the night as their genome sequencing reports have still not arrived. And, accordingly the doctors returned to the hospital. Sources said on Wednesday evening, the three, who could not wait any longer to get back home as some of their family members too have tested positive and needed care, left the hospital without informing the doctors or staff. “We learnt from the nurses in the ward that the three doctors left the hospital as they did not want to continue in the COVID-19 ward after testing negative twice. Moreover, some of their immediate family members have been infected and they needed care and attention,” sources said. However, Manoj Kumar H.V., dean and director of the institute, said the three contacts had been discharged but had not left the hospital. Sources said the confusion over discharge of the contacts is prolonging in the absence of clear guidelines. “When the patients are symptom-free, have completed 14 days after the onset of symptoms, and have tested RT-PCR negative twice after undergoing the required treatment for COVID-19, they are fit for discharge. This is what has been followed ever since the pandemic began and holds good even now, irrespective of the variant,” said C.N. Manjunath, member of the State’s clinical experts committee set up to advise the Government on treatment of Omicron patients. However, State Health Commissioner D. Randeep said the patients cannot be discharged till their genome sequencing reports arrive. “If any of them is detected positive for Omicron, we will have to observe them for a few more days and take a call. This is irrespective of their testing RT-PCR negative. The reports are expected soon,” he said. Sources said the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), where the samples of the contacts had been sent for genome sequencing, is yet to send the reports officially. “We have been orally informed that the Omicron-infected doctor’s wife has been infected with the Delta variant. How can this happen? If the variant is highly transmissible, his wife should also have had the same infection. We now have a doubt about the positive Omicron report of the doctor,” sources pointed out.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/confusion-over-discharge-of-omicron-patients/article37906448.ece
09 December 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||Need to tweak visa norms: Karnataka HC||The High Court of Karnataka has suggested to the central government to make appropriate changes in the law governing grant of visa to foreign nationals to check growing instances of foreigners staying in India despite expiry of visa. The court said that the centre could also engage with foreign countries to get an assurance for cancellation of travel documents of their citizens, co-terminus with the expiry of their visa, so that their expulsion becomes easy consistent with the principles of sovereignty and reciprocity. “The penalties/fines for overstaying aliens should be reasonably enhanced commensurate with the seriousness of the issue. It is also desirable to request the foreign States concerned to recall their nationals immediately on the expiry of their travel documents. Precautionary measures may be many but policymakers need to advert to them, keeping in view all relevant factors,” the court said. The court suggested that the competent authorities can include conditions in visa document that foreign nationals should leave India soon after expiry of visa, and they would be discouraged to re-enter India on subsequent occasion in case of overstay. Justice Krishna S. Dixit passed the order while rejecting the plea of Li Dong, a 42-year-old Chinese national staying at Srirangapatna in Mandya district, for extension of visa though she has been overstaying in India for over a year. The authorities had initially extended her visa in view of COVID-19 in China and non-availability of flights. Though the central government refused to extend her visa, she failed to leave India even after issuance of multiple leave-India notices. Many cases The court observed: “Nowadays, courts have been noticing a large chunk of cases involving overstaying of visa and visa violation by foreigners. In quite a few cases, an impression is gathered that the aliens concerned want to somehow perpetuate their continuance in the Indian territory and for this, several devious strategies are adopted (however, arguably petitioner’s may not be one such case).” “One such means is to commit some bailable offence and to trigger the prosecution which would more often than not be dragged for long; added to this, the bail orders obtained by them are wrongly treated by the quarters that be as the visa extensions unmindful of the difference that galores between them,” the court observed. There is absolutely no justification for the petitioner to stay on Indian soil any longer, disobeying a series of leave-India notices, and such foreign nationals cannot be granted indulgence by the Constitutional courts, the court said. The competent authorities in their discretion may conditionally permit the petitioner to stay in India till the first flight to China is scheduled and not beyond that, the court said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/need-to-tweak-visa-norms-karnataka-hc/article37906221.ece
09 December 2021||Bengaluru,ANDHRA PRADESH||CM hints at new guidelines after Cabinet meet today||Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai has hinted that the Government will announce a new set of COVID-19 guidelines after a discussion at the State Cabinet meeting on Thursday. In view of the emergence of clusters, Mr. Bommai said: “All details pertaining to COVID-19 will be presented before the Cabinet.” After the discussions, the Chief Minister said, a decision would be taken on issuing a fresh set of guidelines.

Sai Teja (29), the personal security officer of Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, who was among the 14 killed in an IAF copter crash in the Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday. According to information, Sai Teja, a 2012 batch jawan who rose to the rank of Lance Naik recently, was attached to the Chief of Defence Staff as his PSO.

09 December 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Omicron threat keeps officials on toes||At a time whe the medical and health officials of Chittoor district were heaving a sigh of relief with a “negligible number of daily count” of COVID cases, the threat of Omicron variant has once again kept them on their toes. Unlike other districts, the floating population of pilgrims visiting Tirumala and Srikalahasti has made the task of authorities tough. Senior officials on COVID task force duties observed that except for screening the cases arriving at Tirupati airport, tracing the arrival of home-bound passengers through trains and road transport after alighting in Mumbai or New Delhi was proving a Herulean task. Deputy District Medical and Health Officer P. Ravi Raju said all government and private hospitals were alert to a rise in COVID cases and the Omicron threat. The official said that a round-the-clock oxygen facility was in place at all notified hospitals for COVID treatment. “Once again, we have increased the daily tests. Though the number has remained below 20 daily for a few days, all the field staff are instructed to be alert to any rise in their numbers. They have been told to immediately notify the arrival of any foreign returnees into the district, particularly in the rural areas,” he said. The Deputy DMHO said that steps would be initiated on a war-footing to once again clamp the face-mask rule in the public. He urged people not to believe rumors about the Omicron variant’s prevalence in the State. “The district has completed 92% of vaccinated target for those above 18 years. We have been continuously monitoring the exercise to cover the remaining target,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/omicron-threat-keeps-officials-on-toes-in-chittoor/article37906463.ece
09 December 2021||HYDERABAD,ANDHRA PRADESH||ECI raps Telangana for model code violation||The Panchayat Raj and Rural Development department drew flak from the Election Commission of India for releasing orders sanctioning a grant of Rs. 250 crore to local bodies in violation of the provisions of model code of conduct (MCC) that is in force in the State for elections to the Legislative Council from local bodies constituency (LAC) on Friday. The Election Commission took a serious view of the GO issued by Panchayat Raj commissioner regarding release of grant to zilla and mandal parishads in violation of the code. Chief Electoral Officer Shashank Goel asked the Panchayat Raj secretary to furnish a report within a day over orders issued during the ongoing MCC in respect of polls to five seats of the constituency without the consent of the office of the Chief Electoral Officer or the ECI. The Election Commission of India , in its orders issued on December 6, asked the official to treat the matter as “most urgent”. Panchayat Raj secretary Sandeep Kumar Sultania was, however, not available for his comment on whether the department had submitted its report and explanation on the order. This is the second instance of the Election Commission of India snubbing the State Government since the model code of conduct became operational from November 9 when the schedule for elections to the Legislative Council from the constituency was released. All the elected representative of urban and rural local bodies are voters of the constituency. Earlier, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar released orders on November 17 enhancing the honorarium being paid to elected local representatives by 30 per cent. Following complaints lodged against the development, the EC was said to have asked the Chief Secretary to furnish an explanation. The order was however withdrawn the next day without giving any reasons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/eci-raps-telangana-for-model-code-violation/article37906224.ece

09 December 2021||KARIMNAGAR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Coal unions to go on strike from today||Raising their voice in unison against the Centre’s decision to auction four coal blocks in the State for commercial mining, all the trade unions of Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) have resolved to go on a three-day strike from December 9 with the slogan ‘Save Singareni’. Setting aside the ideological affiliations, the Singareni area trade unions affiliated to the five central trade unions – INTUC, AITUC, CITU, HMS and BMS, besides the TRS-affiliated Telangana Boggu Gani Karmika Sangham (TBGKS) have come together to spearhead a 72-hour strike from Thursday. In an extraordinary show of unity, the unions have joined hands to make the strike a success for mounting pressure on the Centre to de-list the four coal blocks from the auction list and allow the government-owned SCCL to take up coal mining in the four blocks — Kalyan Khani Block-6, Koyagudem Block-III, Sattupalli Block-III and Shravanapalli in the State. Sources said that the last-ditch efforts by the SCCL management to avert strike and the meeting convened by the labour authorities to dissuade the trade unions from going on strike ended inconclusively in Hyderabad on Wednesday evening. The three-day strike is slated to begin from the first shift on Thursday and is likely to result in a production loss of nearly 1.50 lakh tonnes of coal a day. The major trade unions conducted meetings at the coal mines in Ramagundam, Kothagudem and other coal mining areas of the company on Wednesday calling upon the SCCL’s nearly 43,000 workforce to strike work for 72 hours across all the 45 coal mines in the State’s coal belt region spanning six districts. The unions representing the contract workers of the SCCL have given a call to the entire workforce to make the three-day strike a success to achieve the other major demands including hike in salaries of the contract workers employed in the SCCL as recommended by the high-power committee on a par with Coal India Limited (CIL).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/coal-unions-to-go-on-strike-from-today/article37906420.ece
09 December 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Two plant species now extinct in the wild’||Two species of plants first collected by botanists more than 125 years ago from Meghalaya and the Andaman Islands are now extinct in the wild, according to a new paper published in the Journal of Threatened Taxa. Classified under the genus Boesenbergia, the species belong to the family of Zingiberaceae, the ginger family of flowering plants. Boesenbergia rubrolutea was first collected from the Khasi Hills, Thera, in Meghalaya on October 10, 1886. Specimens of Boesenbergia albolutea were collected from the Andamans and sent to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England, in 1889. Multiple reasons Possible reasons for their disappearance include climate change, human interference and overexploitation or natural calamities, said authors of the paper — M. Sabu, CSIR-Emeritus Scientist, Malabar Botanical Garden and Institute for Plant Sciences, and K. Aishwarya of the Department of Botany, University of Calicut. Field visits Endemic to the locations of their discovery, Boesenbergia albolutea and Boesenbergia rubrolutea are also among the least explored species of the genus Boesenbergia, the paper said. Ten species of this genus, including the two cited above, have been reported in India. The authors have recommended listing them as ‘Extinct in the Wild (EW) (IUCN 2019)’ under the IUCN Red List category on the basis of field visits, examination of databases of various herbaria, and available literature, it said. Neither of the species were reported again after their first collection. Three decades of field explorations by Dr. Sabu throughout India, including the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, as part of the taxonomic revision of the family Zingiberaceae, also failed to spot even a single specimen of these species, the study adds. 1995 paper The paper further notes that in 1995, botanists S.K. Jain and Ved Prakash, on the basis of available literature, reported the species Boesenbergia rubrolutea as endemic to Meghalaya and endangered as it was restricted to ‘very small areas of one State and facing immediate danger of extinction, these species need urgent conservation.’ Attempts by Dr. Sabu and Dr. Aishwarya to locate new specimens of the two species also proved futile. The lone herbarium specimens are preserved at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/two-plant-species-now-extinct-in-the-wild/article37906417.ece

The United Democratic Front (UDF) won 11, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) one, and Independents four, the State Election Commission (SEC) said on Wednesday. The votes were counted on Wednesday across different centres. The LDF constituents CPI(M) and CPI won 15 seats and one seat respectively.

The BJP won its lone seat in the Vadakke Idaliparakkudi ward in Edamalakkudi grama panchayat, Idukki district, wresting it from the CPI(M) by a margin of one vote, according to the SEC. A CPI(M) ‘rebel’ won in the Ariyacode ward of Erumayoor grama panchayat, Palakkad, defeating the Congress candidate. In the bypolls in the two Corporation wards, the CPI(M) retained Vettucaud in Thiruvananthapuram and Gandhi Nagar in Kochi.

09 December 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,ANDHRA PRADESH||CM silent on Mullaperiyar: UDF||Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan on Wednesday said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was strangely silent about Mullaperiyar. But he could not resist harping about the “environmentally and economically” unviable SilverLine (K-Rail) project. He said the precarious situation of the 126-year-old barrier had endangered the peace of mind and security of 40 lakh Keralites living downstream. However, Mr. Vijayan seemed least bothered. Tamil Nadu continued to release water at will from Mullaperiyar with impunity. It rarely bothered to warn Kerala or the populace. He said Tamil Nadu dam authorities routinely let out water at night flooding houses and inundating farmlands. The Sate government’s response seemed muted. Water Resources Minister Roshy Augustine merely “felt pained” by Tamil Nadu’s actions and has done little to mitigate the situation. Meeting of panel Kerala has not called for an urgent meeting of the Mullaperiyar Supervisory Committee appointed by the Supreme Court. The State’s legal response to the situation appeared weak. Mr. Vijayan has limited his response to penning entreaties to his Tamil Nadu counterpart M.K. Stalin, he said. He said the Centre had not cleared the SilverLine project. However, Mr. Vijayan was pushing ahead with the quixotic project as if in a hurry to leave behind a legacy of his rule. The government had single-mindedly forged ahead with land acquisition for SilverLine. Railways had not given clearance for the project. Kerala has done no comprehensive environmental and social impact study, Mr. Satheesan said. Notwithstanding the United Democratic Front (UDF), the CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said SilverLine would catalyse Kerala’s development. It would also reduce the State’s carbon footprint, decongest its clogged roads, and open up the hinterlands for development, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cm-silent-on-mullaperiyar-udf/article37906227.ece

In a review meeting on YSR Jagananna Colonies and YSR Jagananna Sampoorna Gruha Hakku scheme on Wednesday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the OTS scheme was optional and houses would be registered with clear titles. He said the government would be waiving off housing loans amounting to Rs. 10,000 crore availed by the poor, and get the registrations done free of cost. He said the beneficiaries would get legal rights on the properties, and alleged that some vested interests were obstructing the implementation of the scheme. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the previous government did not consider proposals to waive interest on housing loans. Approximately, 43,000 people had paid the principal and interest amounts during the previous government’s tenure. However, only B-form pattas were given to them. The beneficiaries of OTS scheme would be able to mortgage or sell their properties. The officials informed the Chief Minister that they had issued orders to remove Section 22-A and cancel stamp duty, transfer duty and user fees for the OTS scheme beneficiaries, and that the registrations were being done in the village / ward secretariats.

09 December 2021||Vijayawada,ANDHRA PRADESH||Wakf tribunal to be set up in Kurnool||The State government issued a gazette notification on Monday for setting up the Wakf Tribunal at Kurnool having jurisdiction over the State of Andhra Pradesh. Advocate-General S. Sriram told The Hindu that the State was not having a Wakf tribunal for the last seven years and the common tribunal at Hyderabad refused to take up matters related to Andhra Pradesh. He pointed out that these were quasi-judicial bodies under various enactments on a par with the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC), and no law required them to be on the same premises as the High Court. The location of the tribunal in Kurnool had nothing to do with the Decentralisation Act, he asserted. It may be noted that the government had issued notifications for setting up the SHRC and the Institution of Lokayukta and Upa-Lokayukta in Kurnool and the latter had even started functioning from a temporary office there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/wakf-tribunal-to-be-set-up-in-kurnool/article37906936.ece

09 December 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Police bust child-kidnapping gang in Agency; 10 arrested||The district police busted an organised network of kidnapping and human trafficking of babies and arrested a 10-member gang in Visakhapatnam Agency on Wednesday. The gang targets children of beggars and destitutes and sell them to childless people for high prices, police said. The accused were identified as P. Maheswari (20), K. Kranthi (25), N. Mani, who works as a watchman at a private hospital in Vizag, P. Ramesh (36), K. Sampath (18), S. Suresh (20), A. Krishna (21), N. Srinivasa Rao (34), S. Nagamani (32) and P. Mohan Rao (34), all belonging to various parts of Vizag and rural areas of the district. Addressing a press conference at Paderu on Wednesday, Superintendent of Police (Visakhapatnam Rural) B. Krishna Rao said that on November 3, the Dumbriguda police received a complaint from a couple who stated that their three-month-old son Arjun was kidnapped by unidentified miscreants while they were asleep. After registering a case, police formed teams and started an investigation. The SP said that during the course of the investigation, police stumbled upon the gang responsible for kidnapping and trafficking babies from destitute families. The SP explained the modus operandi of the gang. “A woman named Neelapu Mani, who works as a security guard at Government Victoria Hospital in Visakhapatnam city, was in a live-in relationship with a man named P. Ramesh in Pendurthi. Mani would gather information on poor or destitute mothers coming to hospital and allegedly lure them to sell the babies to people who are childless,” he said. According to the SP, nine months ago, one K. Kranthi, who is a boxing coach, and a woman named Maheswari came to their hospital for an abortion. “Mani saw them and advised them to give birth and hand over the baby to childless parents in exchange for money. As such, Kranthi and Maheswari, after the birth of a baby girl on March 3, sold her to K. Kumari for about Rs. 2.50 lakh. Later, Kranthi and Maheswari joined hands with Mani, P. Ramesh and another accused identified as P. Mohana Rao. They planned to kidnap babies, especially from platforms, footpaths, wandering people or beggars, with an intention to sell them for huge amounts to childless parents. The gang recruited Prasad, Krishna, Suresh, Abhi and Ramakrishna, who offered lucrative sums of money,” the SP said. Police said that the gang believed kidnapping children of destitute people would not result in any consequences as such cases do not get much attention. As part of their plan, the accused kidnapped a nine-month-old girl from Goplapatnam railway station, an eight-month-old boy at Araku Valley, and a three-month-old boy from Dumbriguda. After a thorough investigation, the police arrested the gang membes near Gali Bheemavaram. Police found that the gang had sold the babies illegally to childless parents. All the children were rescued and handed over to their parents on Wednesday. The SP said that some other accused are yet to be arrested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/police-bust-child-kidnapping-gang-in-agency-10-arrested/article37907013.ece

Giving away the cup to the Cavaliers CC team, Visakhapatnam Port Trust chairman K. Rama Mohana Rao urged the budding cricketers to stay focused on their goal. “You have to put your heart and soul into whatever you are doing and only then can you walk towards success,” he said. He thanked AMNS and The Hindu for encouraging sporting activities and said that at a time when children are immersed in gadgets and are turning into ‘couch potatoes’, sports have taken a backseat. But tournaments such as this one will encourage youngsters to come on to the field and sweat it out, which is good for both the physical and mental health, he said. AMNS head HR and Administration D.S. Varma said that next year, the trophy will enter the 25th year and as part of its silver jubilee, it will be held in a bigger way. This year, we had 16 teams participating in the tournament, which included the top clubs in the city and institutions such as Railways, HPCL, VSP and Police and three district teams from Vizianagaram, Srikakulam and East Godavari.

09 December 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘AU misses a true friend in Gen. Rawat’||In 2018, when General Bipin Rawat was then the Chief of the Indian Army, had met a delegation from Andhra University led by its then Vice-Chancellor Prof. G. Nageswara Rao. Recollecting the meeting with the General, Prof. Nageswara Rao said, “He was a true General – who was an officer and a gentleman. He not only praised AU for its efforts in launching the Defence Studies Department but also said that he would extend all help as it benefits his officers during service and post-retirement.” “Initially, he had agreed only for an appointment of 20 minutes, but the interaction went on for over an hour,” Prof. Nageswara Rao recollects. It was General Rawat who suggested a system to enrol officers who have post-graduate degrees for Ph.Ds in universities. “During that period, there was a proposal to start a defence university and the General was worried that his officers may not be able to teach, as they do not have Ph.D degrees. Based on his suggestion, we decided to offer five seats each for Ph. D for all the three tri-services and we subsequently implemented it in AU. Today, we offer five Ph.D seats to the Army, Navy and Air Force,” said Prof. Nageswara Rao. General Rawat had also expressed concern over the post-retirement phase of his jawans. “In the Army, after completion of 15 years of service, a gazette is issued to the personnel stating that upon discharge, ‘his 15-year service is equivalent to a degree’. But this gazette is not accepted as an eligible criteria for any Group-I or Group-II service or any government examination. General Rawat was apparently worried about his men and we suggested that AU issue a Bachelor of Arts degree to such persons so that they become eligible for any examination, and we implemented it,” he said. “General Rawat was highly pleased and promised to visit the campus at a later date. AU would miss a true friend,” Prof. Nageswara Rao said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/au-misses-a-true-friend-in-gen-rawat/article37907012.ece
09 December 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Time Jagan took up Vizag steel plant privatisation issue with Prime Minister’||It is time Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy joined the VSP agitation and took up the issue of privatisation of the plant with the Prime Minister directly. This was the opinion of all the leaders of Visakha Ukku Parirakshana Porata Committee, who staged a maha dharna on completion of the 300 days of agitation, at Gajuwaka here, on Wednesday. The Chief Minister should invite all parties and form a common delegation and lead from the front to New Delhi, said Ch. Adinarayana, one of the chairmpersons of the porata committee. A maha dharna was organised by the committee at Old Gajuwaka junction to mark 300th day of its agitation against privatisation of the steel plant. Over 1,500 people comprising employees and members of various trade unions and political leaders participated in the dharna. Addressing the dharna, porata committee leaders said they woud intensify the agitation and lead it as the farmers had done in New Delhi against the farm laws. The leaders urged all parties, trade unions and members from the civil society to come forward and scale it up, till the Union Government is forced to repeal the decision. “VSP is not just any other steel plant, but it comes wrapped with the sentiments of the people of Andhra, as over 30 people had sacrificed their lives for the setting up of the plant and we willot allow it to be sold to a private party,” said Mr. Adinarayana. TDP urban president Palla Srinivasa Rao said the response from the Chief Minister had been lukewarm and guarded. It was time that he took a stand, he said. Gajuwaka MLA Tippala Nagi Reddy said he would bring the ongoing agitation to the notice of the Chief Minister. He said the committee was successful in mobilising support from people of various districts and trade unions. He said the YSRCPhad always supported the agitation and would continue to do so. Former MLA Chintalapudi Venkatramaiah, Jana Sena PAC member Kona Tata Rao, corporators A J Stalin, B Ganga Rao and Dalli Govind and others addressed the dharna. They said the central government was imposing a burden on a common man at the same time it was offering incentives to corporate houses.

09 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Silently crossing hurdles to deliver on healthcare promise||Trudging through treacherous terrains, walking in dense forests and keeping an eye out for wild boars or snakes, wading across a stream or rivulet... This may sound like an adventurous weekend plan to thrill-seeking urbanites, but it is, in fact, the daily experience of hundreds of Auxiliary Nursing Midwives (ANMs) in Telangana. These grassroot-level healthcare workers deliver crucial medical services to people in remote corners of the State. Officials of the Health department say they depend on ANMs, apart from Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), for the implementation of any major or even minor public health project of the State government. There are around 6,000 ANMs belonging to different categories in the State. That includes 4,200 women employed as ‘Second ANMs’. Daily travails Irrespective of their age, these women travel long distances, visiting far-flung villages, remote habitations in forests or up hilly terrains to deliver medical services, the list of which runs quite long. Of late, one of the services at the top of their agenda has been vaccinating the population against COVID-19. President of Second ANMs Association, Ch. Anuradha says they conduct Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) survey, deliver mother and child healthcare services, are part of the programmes to control tuberculosis, leprosy and AIDS, apart from generating awareness on temporary and permanent contraceptive methods. “We have conducted COVID tests and thermal screening of people during the two COVID waves. We have performed duties of lab technicians and pharmacists too,” Ms Anuradha explains. Now, with the State government setting a deadline of December-end to vaccinate the 2.77 crore population, pressure on the ANMs is consistently mounting. They are going the extra mile to give the jab to the eligible beneficiaries. Social media has been flooded with the photographs of ANMs giving the vaccine to people working in the fields, travelling on bullock carts and even those washing clothes by a water body. Dawn to dusk “We visit a target village and stay put early in the morning till evening hours. That makes it possible for us to get hold of people as they step out for work or while they are on their way home during dusk. All ANMs are women. We face several problems when we have to be at one place for several hours. It is especially difficult to deal with drunk men,” adds Ms. Anuradha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/silently-crossing-hurdles-to-deliver-on-healthcare-promise/article37906704.ece
09 December 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Average speed of vehicles in Hyd. is 25 kmph, say police||The average speed of vehicles on city roads has gone up by three kilometres per hour in the last two years. According to Hyderabad Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar, the average journey speed on the city roads had gone up to 25 kilometres per hour (kmph). The average vehicle speed in 2019 was 22 kmph and 19 kmph in 2016. Comparing this with other metro cities like Mumbai, New Delhi, Bengaluru, the officer said, Hyderabad emerged as the number one city where vehicle traffic speed per hour is constantly increasing year after year. This gives certain benefits like savings in fuel, engine efficiency, less fatigue and dropping pollution. “When compared to other cities, average speed of the vehicle is improving only in Hyderabad,” Mr. Kumar pointed out. The roads have become comparatively easy as most of the working staff are confined to homes, use of public transport -- like Metro rail and TSRTC, and the high-end zigWheels may vroom even in the peak hours. Further, the Commissioner said that road safety in the capital is improving, albeit slightly, going by the number of accidents (both simple and fatal). He said that the total number of road accidents as of December 7 has dipped to 1,657 vis-a-vis 1,843 accidents recorded in 2020. While COVID-19 lockdown slowed down traffic movement for a few months in the first half of the calendar year, the overall number of fatal road accidents have also come down when compared to previous years. Mr. Kumar said that so far this year, as many as 237 fatal accidents took place on the city roads, while the number was 248 in 2020, and 259 in 2019. "In 2017, the number of fatal accidents was 303, and the following year it was 294. The number is decreasing each year due to massive awareness campaigns by the traffic wing," he said. Further explaining the reasons for 237 fatal deaths, the officer said 178 accidents took place due to over-speeding, while 13 deaths were caused due to drunk drive, 10 due to wrong side driving, and six died due to minor driving. Careless and negligent driving cases had 24 deaths this year. The officer said that this year alone over 39 lakh bike riders were issued challans for 'No helmet or improper helmet'. "The number was 41,000 in 2014 and 1.33 lakh in 2015," he said. While 1.25 lakh tickets were issued to the bikers for triple rider, 75,000 tickets were issued for violation of stop line. Hyderabad traffic police issued 76,000 challans for overspeeding/dangerous driving. The traffic mainly runs on 3Es – Education, Engineering and Enforcement, the officer added. Sensational cases Meanwhile, Cyberabad Police Commissioner M. Stephen Raveendra on Wednesday reviewed the progress of investigation and trial in sensational cases booked in limits of the commisionerate with Deputy Commissioners of Police N Prakash Reddy, Rohini Priyadarshini, PV Padmaja, in-charge DCP (Madhapur) M.

09 December 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘TRS govt. delayed procurement’||Union Minister for Food and Public Distribution Piyush Goyal has blamed the TRS government totally for the delay in paddy procurement and said despite several extensions the Centre was yet to procure paddy produced in the kharif of last year and pass it on to the Food Corporation of India (FCI). In reply to a question from Nalgonda MP and former TPCC president, N. Uttam Kumar Reddy in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, the Minister said the Central government did not procure paddy but only rice, and it was the state government’s responsibility of procuring paddy and then give rice to the FCI. Mr. Uttam Reddy, who raised the question, blamed both BJP and the Telangana Rashtra SAmithi (TRS )governments saying their total confusion, incompetence and lack of foresight had dealt a deadly a blow to paddy farmers of Telangana. In response to the Minister’s statement, he asked if the Central government did not procure paddy, for whom it was it announcing the Minimum Support Price (MSP). “Is it for the rice millers or farmers,” he asked. He said the Minister had earlier given a written reply to him that the Central government was procuring paddy and also listed out the quantity of paddy procured in the last five years. As per the Minister’s written reply the government procured 53.67 lakh metric tonnes in 2016-17 followed by 54 lakh MT in 2017-18; 77.46 MT in 2018-19; 111.26 MT in 2010-20 and 141.11 MT in 2020-21 years, he said. Blaming the TRS he said on August 17, 2021 the TRS government had accepted the procurement period from October 2021 to January 2022 for 40 lakh MT of rice (equivalent to 60 lakh MT of paddy) out of paddy produced in kharif of 2020 while smaller states like Punjab and Haryana had said they would procure 113 lakh tonnes of rice and 40 lakh tonnes by November 15 respectively. The delay by the TRS government and the unseasonal rains drenching the paddy have caused severe farmer distress in Telangana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-govt-delayed-procurement/article37906741.ece

09 December 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Police unable to ascertain exact speed of Porsche||Hyderabad city police were unable to ascertain the exact speed of the Porsche Cayenne driven by Bazar Rohit Goud, allegedly under the influence of alcohol, which claimed the lives of two youngsters late on Sunday, as neither there were CCTV cameras nor speed guns monitoring the accident spot. This puts the police in quandary in fixing the rashness and negligence of the delinquent driver. As there were no CCTV cameras at the accident spot near Rainbow Children Hospital on Road No. 2 of Banjara Hills, the police could only draw an inference that the speed of the vehicle was anywhere between 100 kmph to 120 kmph on that fateful night. “With no CCTV cameras on the spot, we are unable to ascertain the exact speed,” an officer said. The accused, Goud from Uppal, and Vedulla Sai Soman Reddy from Karmanghat, consumed alcohol at three different places in Jubilee Hills and Banjara Hills, and were going to a star hotel for late-night dinner when their car hit two persons – Ayodhya Rai, 24, and Debendra Kumar Das, 29. They accused fled from the spot soon after the accident. After hitting the duo, the accused drove directly to their friend’s house – Padmavathi Nilayam on Road No. 5 of Jubilee Hills – and parked their damaged vehicle in the cellar without realising that a police patrol team was already following them. “They were caught when they went back to Padmavathi Nilayam in another vehicle to take the parked luxury car,” Joint Commissioner of Police (west zone) AR Srinivas said. Two MLAs of TRS rushed to Banjara Hills police station in the early hours in a bid to shield Sai Soman Reddy in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/police-unable-to-ascertain-porsche-speed/article37906721.ece
09 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Don’t auction coal blocks’||Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Wednesday addressed a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to take steps to stop the Coal Ministry from auctioning four coal blocks in Singareni Collieries. Ahead of the three-day strike by trade unions in the coal belt of the State, Mr. Rao recalled that the the Singareni Collieries Companh Limited produced 65 million tonnes of coal annually and played a key role in meeting the coal requirement of power stations in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra , Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The demand for power in Telangana had also gone up since the formation of the State in 2014. It was 5,661 MW then and 13,688 MW till March this year. Therefore, an uninterrupted supply of coal to the thermal power stations of the State had become a necessity. The State government had sanctioned several mining leases in view of demand for coal from the mines of Singareni. They were also approved by the Coal Ministry. The decision of the Centre to auction JBR open-cast mine - 3, open-cast mine at Sravanpalli, open-cast mine three at Koyagudem and KK-6 underground block will adversely affect coal excavation in Singareni Collieries. Hence, the Ministry should be directed to stop the auction, Mr. Rao appealed to Mr. Modi. These blocks should be allotted to SCCL itself.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/dont-auction-coal-blocks/article37906739.ece
09 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Man on the streets is our boss, says KTR||Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) working president K. T. Rama Rao said that the common man on streets was the boss of the TRS unlike the BJP and Congress which had their power centres in Gujarat and New Delhi respectively. Addressing a meeting on the occasion of a Congress leader from Karimnagar Chalamada Lakshmi Narasimha Rao joining the TRS on Wednesday, Mr. Rao criticised State Congress president A. Revanth Reddy and his BJP counterpart Bandi Sanjay Kumar for targeting the TRS government without realising that they had no public sympathy. “These people are blind towards development that has been taking place in the State. The recent handbook of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has declared that Telangana is contributing five per cent of India’s GDP despite having 2.5 per cent population. Though geographically it was in 11th place and population wise 12th place, it is in fourth place in extending financial support to the nation. We are feeding the states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar ruled by BJP. While percapita income in the State rose to Rs. 1.12 lakh in 2014 to Rs. 2.37 lakh in the current year, the national per capita income stood at Rs. 1.2 lakh. For paddy procurement an amount of Rs. 26,611 crore was paid in the current year against Rs. 3,392 crore in 2014. This was made possible under the able leadership of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and it was proved what a capable leader can do,” said Mr. Rama Rao and questioned why national status was not accorded to either Kaleshwaram or Palamur while it was accorded to Upper Bhadra of Karantaka last week. The Telangana Rashtra Samthi (TRS) working president said that there should be national policy for a national party in paddy procurement and wondered why there was a different attitude towards Telangana. Mr Keshava Rao said that the TRS was committed to people of Telangana and problems like fluoride and viral fevers were wiped out from Telangana by supplying potable water to every house. Civil Supplies Minister G. Kamalakar, terming Mr Rama Rao future of Telangana, described themselves as ‘suicide squad’ of the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/man-on-the-streets-is-our-boss-says-ktr/article37906732.ece

She visited Nalgonda on Wednesday and attended a slew of programmes, including on-field interaction with farmers and the organisers, and later addressed media persons. Ms. Soundararajan said Nalgonda district had completed 72% of the procurement and the process, except for disturbances caused by weather, was progressing smoothly. The district was operating 249 procurement centres, more than the 182 centres that were operated in the previous season, she said. On a second visit to Nalgonda, Ms. Soundararajan started her tour around 11.30 a.m., meeting district officials including Additional Collector V. Chandra Sekhar and SP A.V. Ranganath.

Bhupal Reddy and municipal chairman M. Saidi Reddy, she participated in special prayers and in the installation of dhwaja sthambham and the sikharam at the temple. As part of her field tour, Governor Soundararajan visited the PACS procurement centre at Arjalabavi on the town outskirts and spoke to the farmers.

09 December 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Treacherous trail to reach the underserved||A. Mangamma hurries out of her home in Tadwai of Mulugu district around 5 a.m., slinging a heavy bag on her shoulders. For this Second ANM, the task at hand is to reach a habitation deep in the forest around sunrise and catch hold of the potential beneficiaries before they leave for work. She tags along with an Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) and starts her journey. Taking a two-wheeler into the forest is not possible, thanks to the treacherous terrain. The distance to be covered is 6km or more, but they have no option other than to walk. “At times, we have come across wild boars. We hide behind a tree and stand still to avoid catching their attention. Over the years, we have learnt to navigate through the forests,” says Ms. Mangamma. According to P. Rajeshwari, another ANM who works in Penugolu in the district, the most difficult time to travel through the forest or trek up a hillock is during the monsoons when the streams are in spate and paths slippery. She does not know how to swim, so a stick is her only friend while crossing swollen streams. “Now, a path is laid to some of the places. But it is uphill. Even if we take a bike, we have to get down at one point and drag the bike up,” she adds. Sometimes, the ANMs have to walk along the lake bed or river banks to reach a habitation. In the course of their journey, they come across wild animals which come to the water body to quench thirst. In her 12-year working experience, she says she has often encountered bears and wild boars.  At times, we have come across wild boars. We hide behind a tree and stand still to avoid catching their attention. A.

The petition was filed by the Community Organisation for People’s Emancipation, where the petitioner stated that GO Ms. No. 10 was issued on October 15, 2015, restricting allotment of double bedroom houses only to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and minorities. The said order was arbitrary and against the principles of natural justice. A Division Bench headed by Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma dismissed the petition. Meanwhile, the Bench suo motu took up as PIL petition a news report over the death of two persons who were hired to clean a septic tank of an apartment building in Kondapur. Describing it as an unfortunate incident, the HC said that it was sad that people were being engaged for scavenging work even after enactment of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act 2013. Referring to an apex court verdict, the High Court said that Rs. 10 lakh should be paid to the kith and kin of the deceased manual scavengers. The Supreme Court also wanted identification of all persons who died while doing scavenging work since 1993. The issue was not only about payment of compensation to the families of dead scavengers. It must be ascertained whether the State government had carried out any survey of manual scavenging and any rehabilitation measures were initiated, the HC said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/pil-plea-for-quota-for-2-bhk-house-dismissed/article37906730.ece

At Ahmedabad civil hospital, we have withdrawn from emergency services as well after 5 p.m., as there is no assurance from the authorities yet. The strike will continue,” said Dr. Oman Prajapati, vice-president of the Junior Doctors’ Association of Ahmedabad’s BJ Medical College. The Union government recently put on hold the counselling for the NEET-PG 2021 until January 2022 over some issues. The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for Postgraduate (NEET-PG) courses are conducted for fields such as Master of Surgery and Doctor of Medicine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/gujarat-resident-doctors-to-continue-their-strike/article37906825.ece
09 December 2021||Bhopal,||Bangle-seller gets bail after 107 days in jail||A man, assaulted in August for selling bangles in a locality in Indore, was granted bail by the Madhya Pradesh High Court’s Indore Bench in an alleged sexual harassment case. “Taslim Ali was granted bail on Tuesday by Justice Sujoy Paul,” Ehtesham Hashmi, who is Mr. Ali’s lawyer, told The Hindu . Mr. Ali, a bangle-seller from Uttar Pradesh’s Hardoi district was booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) and other IPC sections, on charges of outraging modesty. The POCSO case was registered after Mr. Ali lodged a complaint at Banganga police station in Indore in which he said he was abused, threatened and assaulted on August 23 while he was doing the rounds, selling bangles. A video of the assault had also gone viral on social media. Name not revealed However, the police is not revealing the identity of the person on whose complaint the POCSO case was registered. Mr. Ali’s lawyer also said this was surprising as, “there was no mention of the molestation charge in the widely-circulated video.” He added that four men arrested by the police for thrashing Mr. Ali got bail in a few days, while he has spent 107 days in jail. The court granted bail to Mr. Ali on a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and a like surety of the same amount, both of which were arranged by the lawyers pursuing his case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/bangle-seller-gets-bail-after-107-days/article37906617.ece

We will bring adjournment motion on different issues,” said Mr. Hooda. The winter session of the Haryana Assembly will begin on December 17. Mr. Hooda said the Congress wants an investigation into the recruitment scam under the supervision of the sitting judge of the High Court. “An official of the rank of Deputy Secretary of HPSC cannot carry out such a huge scam.

09 December 2021||GURUGRAM,||Trinamool enters Haryana||In keeping with its plan to expand its footprints across the country, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) set up its first office in Haryana at Gurugram on Wednesday, aiming to increase its presence in the State over the next couple of months. Party leaders said that TMC would contest all forthcoming elections, including Panchayat and municipal polls, in the State. Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha member and Haryana in-charge Sukhendu Sekhar Ray, present on the occasion, said the party has the support of the common man in Haryana and that offices would set up in all districts over the next three to four months. “We have supporters in every district. We will reach out to people in every village and locality,” announced Mr. Ray. He added that Haryana, though geographically not a big State, has an important place in the history of the country starting from Harappan civilisation and was politically significant being close to Delhi. He said that farmers not getting remunerative prices for their crops was one of the major issues in the State. Former Haryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar, who had formally joined the TMC last month, said ad hoc committees at the district and block levels would be constituted over the next few days to take forward the party’s expansion plans. Mr. Tanwar, the former Sirsa Lok Sabha MP, said he along with other prominent leaders would tour all the 90 Assembly constituencies in the State to expand the support base for the party in January next year with a simultaneous membership drive, followed by a rally by TMC founder chairperson Mamata Banerjee. In reply to a question, Mr. Tanwar said all political and also non-political people willing to see a change in the system were welcome to the party’s fold. He added that leaders across parties and States had accepted the leadership of Ms. Banerjee and she was the only alternative to the BJP’s misrule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/tmc-enters-haryana-opens-its-first-office/article37906614.ece

09 December 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra parties seek stay on local polls||A day after the Maharashtra State Election Commission stayed polls on seats reserved for the OBCs in the local body election, parties have demanded to stay the entire poll process to avoid any injustice to the OBCs. The State Government will also be filing a review petition in the apex court terming the order as contradictory, it was announced. “State Government’s Ordinance was based on the law currently being implemented across nine States in the country where 27% reservation for OBCs is being extended under the limit of 50%. The court order does not mention anything about it. We have decided that we will approach the apex court with a review petition as the order is contradictory,” said State Minister Nawab Malik, after a Cabinet meeting. “Our law is valid. We will ask the court to proceed with the election on OBC reserved seats where poll process has already begun and if not, then the entire poll process should be stayed,” he said. Earlier, a Bharatiya Janata Party delegation held a meeting with State Election Commissioner U.P.S. Madan demanding that the entire poll process should be stayed.  Polling on Dec.21 A total of 106 municipal panchayats, Bhandara and Gondiya zilla parishad and 15 panchayat samitis under these ZP are going for polls on December 21. In addition, bypolls for four municipal corporation seats and 7,130 vacants posts in gram panchayats are also going for polls. “Stay on 27% seats would mean citizens on those wards are kept away from their right to franchiseenshrined in the Constitution. There is no clarity on when the OBC reservation will be restored and therefore it is not advisable to keep these seats vacant for unspecified time period. The State election commission’s decision to stay polls on only OBC seats is creating an imbalance,” said the delegation’s letter to Mr Madan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/maharashtra-parties-seek-stay-on-local-polls/article37906829.ece

09 December 2021||New Delhi,||Free pilgrimage: second train to Ayodhya leaves tomorrow||The second train to Ayodhya under the Delhi Government’s free pilgrimage scheme will depart with a fresh contingent of nearly 1,000 pilgrims on a four-day trip on Friday. The first train on the Delhi-Ayodhya-Delhi route of the Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojana was flagged off from the Safdarjung railway station by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal a week ago. According to Government sources, the pilgrimage to Ayodhya, which was added to the list of destinations under the scheme in late November, is already gaining popularity. “After the launch of the Ayodhya route, 40 to 50 enquiries about the scheme are being received at the local offices of MLAs across the city on a daily basis. Most of these are regarding Ayodhya,” said a Government source. “We are in the process of arranging trains to ply under the scheme for the coming months because of its fresh popularity after being briefly stalled due to COVID-19. We are expecting the applications to increase manifold after the end of the ongoing marriage season,” the source added. Since the launch of the pilgrimage scheme in July 2019, almost 5,000 applicants have visited Rameshwaram and over 3,000 have made a trip to Dwarkadhish. In comparison, Ayodhya, for which the application process started last week, has already been visited by a 1,000 pilgrims and a similar number of people are looking forward to the second trip. Almost 45,000 citizens — including pilgrims and their attendants — are scheduled to be sent over the coming days, according to sources. Addition to routes “There used to be 12 listed routes to which the people could avail of the free pilgrimage scheme. Till now, over 36,000 people have been on pilgrimage thanks to this scheme,” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal told a digital briefing on November 24. Ayodhya, Velankanni Church and Kartarpur Sahib have been added to the list of destinations recently. The pilgrimage scheme was approved by the Delhi Cabinet on January 9, 2018. It provides Government assistance to senior Delhi residents, specifically those belonging to the economically weaker sections, to go on pilgrimages with an attendant. The Delhi Government facilitates these tours through the IRCTC, offering AC trains and AC hotel rooms to devotees; the entire expense to and fro is borne by the Delhi Government along with an insurance cover of Rs. 1 lakh. According to Kamal Bansal, chairman of the Delhi Government’s Tirth Yatra Vikas Samiti which oversees the scheme, its genesis lies in a devotional programme organised by the administration on the occasion of Mahashivratri in 2018. “While observing devotees naming the various Jyotirlingas (shrines), the Chief Minister wondered aloud whether a scheme could be initiated around facilitating their visits to these places; that is how we decided to examine the possibility and here we are,” Mr. Bansal said. “Demand for longer routes appears to be high because they have been available for longer, but Ayodhya is emerging as a very sought-after destination now. We expect the demand on all routes to spiral soon after the wedding season ends and are making requisite arrangements,” said Mr. Bansal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/second-train-to-ayodhya-leaves-tomorrow/article37906616.ece
09 December 2021||New Delhi,||Smog tower’s current efficiency ‘half’ of Delhi Government claim||On October 1 this year, the Delhi Government said that a smog tower can clean up to 80% of polluted air, citing a preliminary report on the project. However, two months later, the percentage of pollution being reduced is only 34%-43%, according to six readings between November 30 and December 1 accessed by The Hindu . The smog tower at Connaught Place, a pilot project installed at a cost of Rs. 20 crore, was inaugurated on August 23 by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who had said similar towers will be built in other parts of the city if the results are satisfactory. A few weeks later, Environment Minister Gopal Rai’s office released a statement that read: “The preliminary report of the smog tower installed by the Kejriwal Government was released today (October 1). The report has revealed that the smog tower is cleaning up to 80% of the air.” This statement has been challenged by the readings at the same tower on December 1, where at 10 a.m, the level of PM2.5 — a chief pollutant — at the inlet of the tower was 460.06 ug/m3 and the value at outlet after purification was 299.22 ug/m3 — a reduction of only 34.9%. The reduction in the level of pollutants at a distance from the tower will be even lesser. At 9 a.m. on November 30, the level of PM2.5 at the inlet of the tower was 314.62 ug/m3 and at the outlet of the tower was 179.1 ug/m3, a reduction of 43.07%. This is the highest reduction in pollution levels among the six readings between November 30 and December 1. IIT studying project When contacted, a Delhi Government spokesperson said, “Studies are being done by IIT-Bombay at all levels. This is a pilot project and final conclusion of efficiency is yet to be arrived at. If needed we will enhance the entire system to achieve our goals.” The smog tower is a 24 metre-high structure fitted with fans and air filters which draw in polluted air from the top and release purified air near the ground through fans fitted on the sides. The tower has 40 big fans and 5,000 filters to clean the air. When asked about the efficiency of the tower being “only half” of what the Government had announced in October, Karthik Ganesan, a fellowat Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a think-tank, said, “It may be because filters of the tower have been clogged with pollutants and need to be changed. Also, now the tower is operating at a higher pollution load compared to October.” “Smog tower is a terrible idea. You cannot vacuum clean air. You just cannot do it. It has to be addressed at the source of pollution appropriate technologies,” he added. The Government has not made these reading public till now.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/smog-towers-current-efficiency-half-of-delhi-government-claim/article37906609.ece

Anil Kumar said that the Central Government and the BJP-ruled municipal corporations were being inconsiderate to doctors despite them being on strike for the past few days.

The court also noted that it was not an ordinary case of individuals or groups committing an unlawful act, and the north-east Delhi riots was of such a nature that had not been witnessed since the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. The order was passed by Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat, who framed charges against Pathan, Shamim, Abdul Shehzad, Ishtiyaq Malik and Kaleem Ahmed. Pathan has also been charged under Sections 25 and 27 of the Arms Act and Sections pertaining to promoting enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion, criminal conspiracy, among others. Mr. Rawat, in his order, noted that it was apparent from the statement of head constable Deepak Dahiya that Pathan led a group of rioters and formed an unlawful assembly at 66 Futta Road on February 25 around 2 p.m., armed with deadly weapons, and used criminal force on a public servant to deter him from discharging his duty. “...even the video shows firing by accused Shahrukh Pathan from a pistol in daylight with an aim to kill Deepak Dahiya. This is enough for framing the charge against the accused under Section 307 IPC,” the ASJ stated in the order.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/court-charges-shahrukh-pathan-with-attempt-to-murder-in-riots-case/article37906605.ece

09 December 2021||Berlin,||Scholz vows new beginning for Germany||Olaf Scholz became Germany’s new Chancellor on Wednesday after 16 years with Angela Merkel at the helm, pledging his centre-left-led coalition would offer a “new beginning” for Europe’s top economy. Mr. Scholz was officially named the country’s ninth post-war leader by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who urged him to “ensure that the pandemic does not keep us firmly in its grip for another year” as a fourth wave of the coronavirus outbreak rages. The former Finance Minister, who won 395 of the 707 votes cast in the Bundestag Lower House, has vowed broad “continuity” with the popular Ms. Merkel while making Germany greener and fairer. “It will be a new beginning for our country,” Mr. Scholz pledged as he officially assumed the office from Merkel and thanked her for her lengthy tenure. “I will do everything to work towards that.” Ms. Merkel wished Mr. Scholz luck as Chancellor, urging him to “take this office and work in the best interest of our country”. The 63-year-old, who turned emulating Ms. Merkel in style and substance into a winning strategy, forged Germany’s first national “traffic light” coalition with the ecologist Greens and the liberal Free Democrats, nicknamed after the parties’ colours. The alliance aims to slash carbon emissions, overhaul decrepit digital infrastructure, modernise citizenship laws, lift the minimum wage and have Germany join a handful of countries worldwide in legalising marijuana. French President Emmanuel Macron congratulated Mr. Scholz, pledging that “we will write the next chapter together” while EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said she looked forward to cooperation for a “strong Europe”. Vladimir Putin said Russia was offering “constructive ties” with the new Government, while China’s Xi Jinping said Beijing was willing to work with Scholz to “promote bilateral ties to a new level”. In his first TV interview as Chancellor, Mr. Scholz warned of possible “consequences” for the contested Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, stressing “the inviolability of the borders” must be respected. The new Foreign Minister, Annalena Baerbock, has pledged a tougher line with authoritarian states such as Russia and China after the business-driven pragmatism of the Merkel years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/scholz-vows-new-beginning-for-germany/article37906168.ece
09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S. House passes $768 bn defence spending Bill||The U.S. House of Representatives passed the $768 billion National Defense Authorization Act (FY2022), authorising defence spending and addressing defence reforms. The House version of the Bill, a compromise that emerged after negotiations between the House and Senate leadership, will now have to be approved by the Senate before it can be signed into law by President Joe Biden. This year’s Bill, which passed the House 363-70, asks the President to provide a ‘Grand Strategy With Respect to China’, advises the Secretary of Defence to deepen alliances in the Indo-Pacific and contains measures to reform how harassment and sexual assault in the U.S. armed forces are prosecuted, among other provisions. The Bill enables the setting up of a 16-member ‘Afghanistan War Commission’ to study the 20-year U.S. occupation of Afghanistan and “lessons learned” from the past 20 years. In addition to the ‘Grand Strategy’ on China (a classified document with an unclassified summary), the draft NDAA also asks for a number of other reports related to the country, including Beijing’s missile development, a comparative study of U.S. and China’s development and deployment of hypersonics and China’s influence in Latin America and the Caribbean. On the Indo-Pacific, the Bill says, “It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Defence should recommit to and strengthen United States defence alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region so as to further the comparative advantage of the United States in strategic competition with the People’s Republic of China,” and goes on to name countries and alliances with which the administration is advised to deepen ties. When an Act becomes law, a ‘Sense of Congress’ clause in it is not legally binding on the administration, but a signal from Congress on the direction of policy. The countries and alliances named include Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, ASEAN, India (mentioned in this order) and others. The Bill calls for “investing in an enhanced military posture and capabilities” in the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command area. With regard to India, the legislation calls for the “broadening” of U.S. engagement with India, “including through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue — to advance the shared objective of a free and open Indo-Pacific region through bilateral and multilateral engagements and participation in military exercises, expanded defence trade, and collaboration on humanitarian aid and disaster response; and to enable greater cooperation on maritime security and the threat of global pandemics, including COVID–19”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-house-passes-768-bn-defence-spending-bill/article37906176.ece
09 December 2021||Dhaka,||20 Bangladesh students get death sentence for murder||Bangladesh sentenced 20 university students to death on Wednesday for the 2019 murder of a young man who criticised the government on social media. The battered body of Abrar Fahad, 21, was found in his dormitory hours after he wrote a Facebook post slamming Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for signing a water-sharing deal with India. He was beaten with a cricket bat and other blunt objects for six hours by 25 fellow students who were members of the ruling Awami League’s student wing, the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL). “I am happy with the verdict,” Fahad’s father Barkat Ullah told reporters outside court after the sentencing. “I hope the punishments will be served soon.” The remaining five perpetrators were handed life terms. All those given death sentences were between 20 and 22 years old at the time of the murder and attended the elite Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology alongside Fahad. Three of the defendants are still at large, while the rest were in the courtroom. Faruque Ahmed, a lawyer for some of the defendants, said the sentence would be appealed.  Protests in the days after Fahad’s murder called for the attackers to be harshly punished and for the BCL to be banned. Ms. Hasina vowed soon afterwards that the killers would get the “highest punishment”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/20-bangladesh-students-get-death-sentence-for-murder/article37906166.ece
09 December 2021||London,||Johnson orders Christmas party probe as aide quits||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologised and his adviser resigned on Wednesday after a video emerged of senior aides joking about a Christmas party at Downing Street last year when social events were banned under COVID-19 rules. The leaked footage appears to contradict more than a week of denials by Mr. Johnson and his Ministers that a party took place, following newspaper reports that dozens of staff had attended an evening-long gathering on December 18, 2020. The embattled leader, facing calls for his resignation from some Opposition politicians during a raucous parliamentary questions session, vowed “disciplinary action” would be taken if the investigation found rules had been broken. “I understand and share the anger up and down the country at seeing No 10 staff seeming to make light of lockdown measures,” he said. “I apologise unreservedly for the offence that it has caused... and I apologise for the impression that it gives.” Mr. Johnson added he had been “repeatedly assured” that there was no party inside his Number 10 Downing Street office and that no rules were broken. Mr. Johnson’s adviser Allegra Stratton, a former political journalist who was serving as his press secretary at the time the footage was recorded, swiftly tendered her resignation. The footage shows Ms. Stratton fielding questions from other staff during a rehearsal press conference on December 22 with no media present. The group laughs and trade jokes as they discuss a “fictional party” four days earlier, which reportedly involved food, drink, games and “secret Santa” gift-giving. “This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced,” she laughs over joking exchanges about “cheese and wine” and whether the Prime Minister would “condone” such an event.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/british-pm-orders-probe-into-aides-lockdown-party/article37906174.ece
09 December 2021||OTTAWA/BEIJING,||Beijing Games: Canada, U.K. follow U.S. approach||Canada joined Australia and Britain in a U.S.-led diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing on Wednesday, saying it was important to send a clear message over China’s human rights record. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Beijing would be aware of long-standing Western concerns about human rights in China. “(So) it shouldn’t be a surprise that we decided not to send diplomatic representation.” Mr. Trudeau’s decision seems sure to add tension to an already strained bilateral relationship, which sank to new lows over the detention of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant.  Asked earlier in Parliament if his country would follow Washington’s lead, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “There will be effectively a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, no Ministers are expected to attend and no officials.” “I do not think that sporting boycotts are sensible and that remains the policy of the government,” he added, indicating that British athletes will still compete. Earlier, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his decision came because of Australia’s struggles to re-open diplomatic channels with China to discuss alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and Beijing’s moves against Australian imports.  China has denied any wrongdoing in Xinjiang and said the allegations are fabricated. Its Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a daily briefing in Beijing that Australian politicians were engaged in “political posturing”. “Whether they come or not, nobody cares,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/beijing-games-australia-uk-follow-us-approach/article37906170.ece
09 December 2021||Washington,||Putin defends troop build-up near Ukraine||A day after his high-profile talks with U.S. leader Joe Biden, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday defended the movement of up to 1,00,000 troops to the border of Ukraine, describing this as a defensive measure amid fears in the Kremlin that the one-time Soviet republic is being pulled into NATO’s sphere. He, however, refused to say if he planned to invade Ukraine. “Russia has a peaceful foreign policy, but has the right to defend its security,” Mr. Putin said at a news conference with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. “We cannot but be concerned about the prospect of Ukraine’s possible admission to NATO, because this will undoubtedly be followed by the deployment of appropriate military contingents, bases and weapons that threaten us,” he said. Mr. Putin stressed that NATO expanding eastwards is a “very sensitive” issue for Russia. Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Biden said he had warned his Russian counterpart of unprecedented U.S. sanctions should Russian troops attack Ukraine. Mr. Biden said Mr. Putin got “the message” during their virtual meeting on Tuesday. “I made it very clear if in fact he invades Ukraine there will be severe consequences, severe consequences — economic consequences like none he’s ever seen or ever have been seen,” Mr. Biden told reporters. He, however, added that sending U.S. troops to confront Russia was “not on the table”. Mr. Biden said that in addition to economic measures, a new Russian attack on Ukraine would trigger a bolstered U.S. military presence on the territory of existing NATO allies in eastern Europe. “We would probably be required to reinforce our presence in NATO countries to reassure particularly those in the eastern front. In addition to that, I made it clear that we would provide a defensive capability to the Ukrainians as well,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/russia-has-right-to-defend-its-security-says-putin/article37906173.ece

09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Russia, a legacy relationship with limitations||The Russian President Vladimir Putin’s short visit to New Delhi and the inaugural 2+2 meeting between India and Russia — which is India’s fourth such engagement with another country — will help improve Moscow-New Delhi ties, currently fraying under the pressure of larger global power shifts. Of all the diplomatic balancing acts India has to play in this milieu of geopolitical uncertainty, the one with Russia is the most significant. And yet, let the ongoing flurry of activity between Moscow and New Delhi not blind us to the global forces that will pose formidable challenges for the partnership. There are constraints Russia, no doubt, is a friend in need to India; but Moscow’s friendship comes with limitations. Not only would the realities of the global balance of power shrink the robustness of the relationship over time, but, more crucially perhaps, a legacy relationship based on limited interaction might eventually lose the warmth given that there is little organic, people-to-people content to the relationship. To put it bluntly, unless the bilateral ties can move beyond arms sale/purchase, the phase of stasis will kick in sooner rather than later in India-Russia relations. Consider for instance, the India-Russia bilateral trade is around U.S.$10 billion, far lower than India’s trade with China and the United States, China’s trade with the U.S. and Russia, and even the U.S.’s trade with Russia. The Soviet-era cultural and people-to-people contacts have almost entirely evaporated. Arms sales alone won’t a relationship make. Today, the India-Russia relationship stands deeply strained by the larger geopolitical realities which neither of them is completely in control of. The quadrilateral dynamics among India, China, the U.S. and Russia have different implications of varying degrees for all four states in this relationship, in particular for India. The dynamics Let us use the concept of primary and secondary antagonisms to understand the dynamics of this quad better. To a great extent, if not entirely, the dynamics of this six-way relationship, at the apex, is a function of the U.S.-China rivalry. In this six-way matrix, China-U.S. antagonism is the first order relationship and the U.S.-Russia, China-Russia and Russia-India are the second order relationships. While the second order relationships in this quad are, to a great extent, a product of the primary antagonism, the second tier relationships also have their own unique dynamics and implications. For instance, India-China, a second order relationship in this quad, is both a product of the primary antagonism between the U.S. and China as well as a result of the regional geopolitical rivalry between India and China. Even though China remains its primary antagonism, Washington has not yet succeeded in divorcing its less challenging second order antagonism (rivalry with Moscow) from it. Washington’s parallel rivalries with China and Russia (albeit to a lesser extent) have complicated matters for New Delhi. What appears to be a near certainty in the medium to longer term is that the dynamics of the quadrilateral relationship, in particular India’s tense relations with China, will go on to complicate India’s time-tested partnership with Russia, a process that has already started. Even though Beijing has not aggressively attempted to damage India-Russia relations, there is little doubt that China will attempt to drive a wedge between New Delhi and Moscow since isolating India in the larger Asian region suits Beijing’s larger game plan. A few scenarios It gets more complicated if we were to examine the various potential scenarios in this quadrilateral relationship. For instance, the extent of Chinese aggression towards India will play a role in determining India’s relationship with Russia. Consider this. An aggressive China will push India towards the U.S., and even though Russia would be understanding towards India’s rationale behind such a pro-U.S. tilt in the medium term, India’s relationship with the U.S. will invariably create hurdles in India-Russia relations in the longer term. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s warning to India should be read in that context: “We expressed our serious concern to our Indian friends over the U.S. activity there (Asia-Pacific region) under the slogan of so-called Indo-Pacific strategies and the creation of closed bloc-type structures”. Put differently, the more aggressive Beijing gets towards New Delhi, the more India would grow closer to Washington and Moscow. However, while Moscow would appreciate a close partnership with New Delhi, it may not be when it comes to a growing India-U.S. partnership. More so, if Moscow has to choose between Beijing and New Delhi, it would choose Beijing just as New Delhi would choose Washington over Moscow if it comes to that. This also implies that an aggressive China may also help increase India-Russia relations in the short to medium term, something we may already be witnessing. Recall Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s visit to Moscow in June 2020 soon after the stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops on the Line of Actual Control to procure more weapons systems, among other things. In the meantime, the seemingly unresolvable first order antagonism (the U.S. versus China) also provides space for geopolitical hedges in the second order partnerships/antagonisms, i.e., India-Russia and even Russia-U.S. For instance, Russia’s dormant concerns about China’s rising influence in its traditional periphery, and Moscow’s relations with India in the broader context of Central and West Asia and the western Indian Ocean could prompt Moscow to maintain a certain degree of, albeit limited, geopolitical hedge vis-à-vis Beijing. India’s desire for a robust relationship with Russia will be more appreciated by the U.S. due to the Chinese aggression against India and the U.S.’s systemic and first order rivalry with Beijing. More so, once the reality of the rise of China becomes a concern for Moscow, it could potentially open conversations with Washington to create a balance vis-à-vis Beijing which suits Indian interests. At the same time, however, if there is a rapprochement between the U.S. and Russia or a reduction in the war of words between the U.S. and China, this may or may not have a direct and substantive impact on Sino-Indian relations since the strains in Sino-Indian relations are not just a product of global balance of power but, more fundamentally, a result of India-China dynamics in the Southern Asian region. Put differently, no matter what the state of global geopolitics is, the essential (adversarial) nature of India-China relations is unlikely to undergo a fundamental transformation. For New Delhi, the principal antagonism is China. Therefore, New Delhi must exploit strategies and partnerships that can help address the China challenge more effectively. This means that India has to carefully balance its growing partnership with the U.S. with its somewhat delicate relationship with Russia. Potential for cooperation Let us return to the India-Russia ties and examine the potential for cooperation between the two sides. In a sense, the U.S. withdrawal from Kabul and India’s relationship with Moscow have helped New Delhi to adopt more flexible strategies vis-à-vis Afghanistan as well as the broader region. Given the close relationship that New Delhi enjoyed with Washington, American presence in Kabul had, in a way, limited India’s options as New Delhi was broadly encouraged to follow U.S. policy in the region. With the Americans gone, India can openly cooperate with Moscow and even Tehran, especially if the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) renegotiations succeed, and engage Afghanistan and the Central Asian region with their help. If New Delhi plays its cards well, it can use Moscow to gain more geopolitical heft in the region — while the U.S. provided New Delhi status quo in the region, Moscow could provide India with more direct opportunities. Of course, New Delhi would need to be prepared for adverse reactions from Beijing and Islamabad. Yet another area of cooperation between Moscow and New Delhi is the Indian Ocean Region, especially the western Indian Ocean where Russia has been expanding its influence and India has significant interests. For New Delhi, located in an unstable and virtually friendless neighbourhood, friendship with Russia is important notwithstanding the structural limits to such a friendship. It will, therefore, take a great deal of diplomatic agility from New Delhi to stay the course and improve the relationship with Moscow amidst high-stakes geopolitical contestations.

09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||High LPG prices are scorching the air pollution fight||The sustained rise in the price of LPG cylinders has been burning a hole in many a household budget for more than a year now. The price of LPG refills has risen by more than 50% to over Rs. 900 per cylinder in November this year compared to around Rs. 600 over the past year. With no refill subsidies in place since May 2020, there is genuine concern about many households now slipping back to using polluting solid fuels for cooking, such as firewood and dung cakes. A start Solid fuel use for cooking is the leading contributor to air pollution and related premature deaths in India, estimated to be around over 600,000 every year, as per the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. To tackle this issue head-on, the Government of India has taken several measures to improve access to clean cooking energy. For instance, under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana scheme, the Government distributed more than 80 million subsidised LPG connections. But how far have we managed to dissuade households from biomass? What more do we need to do as a country to move the needle further? Sizing up India’s LPG revolution. Good news first. As per the India Residential Energy Survey (IRES) 2020, conducted by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and the Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy, LPG has now replaced biomass as the most common cooking fuel in India. Nearly 85% of Indian homes have an LPG connection and 71% use it as their primary cooking fuel, compared to only 30% a decade back. This reversal of trends could be attributed to the success of the Ujjwala, consumption-linked subsidies and gradual strengthening of the LPG distributorship. Needless to say, this would have significantly influenced the sector’s contribution to air pollution.  However, the battle is only half won. Around 30% of Indian households continue to rely on biomass as their primary cooking fuel, mainly due to high LPG prices. Another 24% stack LPG with biomass. The practice of biomass usage is predominantly concentrated in rural areas, particularly among States such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal. Urban slums are also critical hotspots where the use of biomass for cooking is widely prevalent. Easy availability of free biomass and lack of home delivery of LPG refills further reduce the efficacy of LPG as a reliable and affordable proposition.  Reinstate subsidies To sustain the country’s momentum on clean cooking energy access and thereby, cleaner air for all, we propose three key steps. First, reinstate the subsidies on LPG refill for low-income households. At the current refill prices, an average Indian household would have to spend around 10% of its monthly expense on LPG to meet all its cooking energy needs. According to a CEEW study, this is just double the actual share of reported expenses on cooking energy (as of March 2020). In fact, nearly half of all Indian households will have to at least double their cooking energy expense to completely switch to LPG at current prices. Given the loss of incomes and livelihoods during the novel coronavirus pandemic, the ability of households to afford LPG on a regular basis has taken a further hit. Thus, resuming subsidies would be critical to support LPG use in many households. Our estimates suggest that an effective price of Rs. 450 per LPG refill could ensure that the average share of actual household expenditure on cooking energy matches the pre-pandemic levels. The Government could take this into account as it reconsiders resuming LPG subsidy. The Government can also explore diverse approaches to identify beneficiaries. This may include limiting the subsidy provision to seven to eight LPG refills annually and excluding well-to-do households using robust indicators. For instance, lowering the income-based exclusion limit for LPG subsidy to Rs. 2,50,000 a year from Rs. 10 lakh a year or excluding families owning a non-commercial four-wheeler vehicle can significantly reduce the number of eligible beneficiaries. At the bare minimum, subsidy must be resumed for the households granted LPG connections under the Ujjwala scheme. Availability and biomass Second, boost timely availability of LPG for all consumers. Only half the rural LPG users receive home delivery of LPG refills, while the rest have to travel about five kilometres one way to procure a cylinder. Gaps in the doorstep delivery of LPG cylinders are also present in urban pockets, particularly in slum areas. This is a major factor behind the use of biomass among urban slum households. There is a need to strengthen the LPG supply chain and enforce timely service delivery, particularly in States with a large number of Ujjwala connections and slum population. This must be complemented by higher incentives for rural distributors, who have to otherwise service a low but distributed demand at similar commissions. Looping in self-help groups could also help aggregate demand and create jobs in distant areas. Third, create a new market for locally available biomass. The Government needs to pilot initiatives focused on promoting the use of locally available biomass in decentralised processing units that manufacture briquettes and pellets for industrial and commercial establishments. For instance, the National Thermal Power Corporation recently invited applications to supply biomass pellets to fire their power stations. The Government can incentivise entrepreneurs to participate in such activities. Similarly, households can be incentivised to supply locally available biomass (including crop stubble or dung cakes) to Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG) production plants being set up under the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) scheme. Such measures would help enhance local income and livelihood opportunities, in turn encouraging rural families to use LPG on a regular basis. In August, the Prime Minister launched the Ujjwala 2.0 scheme to distribute 10 million additional free LPG connections to poorer households. It shows the Government’s commitment towards promoting clean cooking energy access. But ensuring affordability and timely availability of LPG cylinders for refills would be a must to wean households away from polluting biomass and reap the benefits of the investments made in the Ujjwala scheme over the past five years. Such efforts would go a long way in improving the health and well-being of our citizens.

09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||The need for a robust civil registration system||As the COVID-19 pandemic advances into its third year with varied intensity, the world waits with bated breath to learn about the impact of the Omicron variant. Fortunately, South Africa has established an efficient rapid mortality surveillance system which would alert us with the earliest evidence of such impact, if any. It is also reassuring that lessons from previous pandemic waves in India have resulted in an early scrambling of critical response preparedness activities. Nevertheless, despite pronouncements of ICU bed availability and oxygen supply by several States combined with personal protection through vaccination, the threat of individual susceptibility to the new variant from immune escape and underlying morbidity remains. Hence, any proof of lethality (or lack thereof) of this variant from South Africa could only serve as background information, underscoring the need for similar early warning mortality surveillance activities in India. No reliable estimate Mortality data are essential for pandemic management from both clinical and public health perspectives to guide patient care, protection of vulnerable population groups, and resource mobilisation and allocation. In all countries, data from COVID-19 mortality surveillance systems are limited on account of inadequate access to ante-mortem testing and inconsistent cause attribution. Hence, pandemic impact is now evaluated through estimation of excess mortality (additional deaths observed during the pandemic period in comparison with those recorded in previous calendar years). For adequate response, such evaluation needs reliable baseline pre-pandemic mortality measures, near-complete death reporting during the pandemic, and real-time data compilation and release at weekly or monthly intervals. For South Africa, the National Population Register serves as a useful data source, with weekly updates of deaths by sex, age, date of death, and place of registration. Shortcomings in completeness and timeliness of reporting exist, but the mortality surveillance team has established procedures to correct for such biases to report excess mortality estimates at the national and provincial level in near to real-time. For India, excess mortality estimates are based on epidemiological models, some of which include analyses of month-wise death registration data released by several States. However, these estimation exercises were hampered by uncertainty in baseline pre-pandemic mortality levels, potential under-registration in 2021, and the likelihood for the data to include some delayed registrations. All these likely data biases were statistically accounted for by different analysts through varying methods and assumptions, resulting in national excess mortality estimates ranging from 2.8 million to 5.2 million deaths between April 2020 and June 2021. On the other hand, the national COVID-19 surveillance programme death toll for this period was about 4,30,000, considered to be a gross under-count. This 10-fold variation in estimates of COVID-19 mortality in India is clearly not helpful, and the absence of a reliable estimate constitutes a major impediment to our understanding of the magnitude of pandemic mortality, both at the national and global level. Encouraging trends Nevertheless, several recent developments have created prospects for improved estimation of excess mortality in 2020/2021, as well as for ongoing mortality surveillance and measurement programmes in India. First, the Civil Registration System (CRS) Report for 2019 indicates high levels of registration completeness across India. These data have now been corrected for under-reporting to compute reliable pre-pandemic mortality estimates by sex, age and location, as a baseline for evaluating pandemic impact. Next, the prompt release of information on registered deaths by some States in 2021 (summarised in COVID-19 mortality data reports by The Hindu ) indicates that efficient mechanisms for data compilation are functional in these States. Indeed, the Registrar General of India (RGI) had issued a circular in November 2017 which requires District and State Registrars to submit summary monthly returns of births and deaths registered within their jurisdiction. The circular also declares that “the vital rates generated through the CRS are exact and real data certified by registering authority, and therefore legally admissible, and prevail over any other estimates that may be done for proxy purposes due to the lack of data”. It is likely that the prompt release of registration data following the second wave would have been facilitated by these instructions. Third, the pandemic has evoked considerable media and public attention to epidemiological data including mortality, which led to the flurry of data reports to meet this demand. There is now a general expectation of continued public attention to such health data in times to come. The road ahead While the quick data release in 2021 augurs well for future availability, CRS data for 2020 and provisional data reports for 2021 should be released at the earliest, at least to an internal team of analysts. Local statistical capacity must also be established at State registration offices for data quality evaluation, adjustments for data bias, and basic trend and forecast analysis. Data dissemination protocols need to be standardised using a template for compilations of deaths tabulated by sex, broad age groups, month of death occurrence, and district of usual residence. The CRS death reporting forms include these variables, hence enabling such detailed tabulations each month. A lag period in death reporting across registration units and districts is anticipated, but updated counts in subsequent months are widely accepted in regard to pandemic surveillance. Information on deaths recorded in the national Sample Registration System and other household surveys could be used to estimate completeness of CRS data using record linkage methods. It should be feasible for State Registrars to direct such operations, with resources and technical support from local public health/academic institutions. Of course, subsequent detailed analysis of annual data complying with the standard data validation protocols implemented by the RGI would still be necessary for the annual CRS report. But the availability of provisional near real-time surveillance reports would enhance monitoring of the mortality impact of this and future epidemics. In principle, mortality estimates developed from adjustments to empirical data are by design locally relevant and therefore more acceptable than modelled estimates. Even in routine times, there has been an undue dependence on epidemiological models to estimate mortality for India, as observed from various recent disease burden estimations. Analysis of recent CRS data has exposed the brittle nature of the outputs from these models. Moreover, the identified gaps in CRS data by location, sex and age from detailed analyses can help guide interventions to improve data quality for the future. In the current environment, establishing reliable, real-time mortality surveillance is an essential element of pandemic preparedness, and urgent steps to build on recent developments in this aspect would advance the cause of evidence-based health policy to deal with the pandemic in India.

09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Low tobacco tax, poor health||In India, 28.6% of adults above 15 years and 8.5% of students aged 13-15 years use tobacco in some form or the other. This makes the country the second largest consumer of tobacco in the world. Tobacco use is known to be a major risk factor for several non-communicable diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic lung diseases. India also bears an annual economic burden of over Rs. 1,77,340 crore on account of tobacco use. Yet, there has been no major increase in taxation of tobacco products to discourage the consumption of tobacco in the past four years since the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017 except for a small increase in the national calamity contingent duty (NCCD) in the 2020-21 Union Budget which only had the effect of increasing the average price of cigarettes by about 5%. A worrying trend The absence of an increase in tax means more profits for the tobacco industry and more tax revenue foregone for the government — revenue that could have easily been utilised during the COVID-19 pandemic. There has been a 3% real decline in GST revenues from tobacco products in each of the past two financial years. The average annual tax revenue collection from all tobacco products (based on the past three years), including excise duty, NCCD, GST, and compensation cess, is about Rs. 53,750 crore. Excise taxes on many tobacco products used to be regularly raised in the annual Union Budgets before the GST. Similarly, several State governments used to regularly raise value-added tax (VAT) on tobacco products. During the five years before the introduction of the GST, most State governments had moved from having a low VAT regime on tobacco products to having a high VAT regime. The 17.3% relative reduction in the prevalence of tobacco use among adults that India experienced between 2009-10 and 2016-17, as shown by the Global Adult Tobacco Survey, could be partly attributed to this as well. International literature recognises tax increase as one of the most cost-effective ways of regulating the consumption of tobacco. The lack of tax increases in post-GST years might mean that some current smokers smoke more now and some non-smokers have started smoking. This could potentially lead to a reversal of the declining trend in prevalence. This might jeopardise India’s commitment to achieving 30% tobacco use prevalence reduction by 2025 as envisaged in the National Health Policy of 2017 by the Government of India. The lack of tax increase means that the tax burden on tobacco products (tax as a percentage of the retail price) decreases. The tax burden on bidis, cigarettes, and smokeless tobacco, on average, stands at 22%, 53%, and 64% in 2021, while the World Health Organization has been recommending a uniform tax burden of at least 75% for each tobacco product. Given that the vast majority of tobacco taxation today is in the form of GST and compensation cess and their revision requires consensus within the GST Council, tobacco taxation has not seen any increase whatsoever under the GST since 2017. In other words, the tobacco industry has been virtually enjoying four years without extended tax on tobacco products, since the introduction of the GST. This has made tobacco products more affordable post-GST as shown in recent literature from India. This is highly detrimental to public health. Meanwhile, the share of central excise duties including NCCD in the total tobacco taxes decreased from 54% to 8% for cigarettes, 17% to 1% for bidis, and 59% to 11% for smokeless tobacco products, on average, from 2017 (pre-GST) to 2021 (post-GST). Several countries in the world have high excise taxes along with GST or sales tax and they are continuously being revised. Yet, the excise duty on tobacco in India continues to remain extremely low. A considerate view of public health The Union government should take a considerate view of public health and significantly increase excise taxes — either basic excise duty or NCCD — on all tobacco products. The upcoming Union Budget gives a perfect opportunity for this. The Budget should fix an excise tax of at least Rs. 1 per stick of bidis while aiming for a significant increase in the excise tax of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. Taxation should achieve a significant reduction in the affordability of tobacco products to reduce tobacco use prevalence and facilitate India’s march towards sustainable development goals. Rijo M.

09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||A measured response||The threat posed by Omicron is tenuous and it will still be a few weeks before a comprehensive understanding of it emerges, but what is known unambiguously is that this latest variant of the coronavirus is extremely infectious. Nearly 50 countries now have reported its presence within their borders but insight into its effects is available only from South Africa. A preliminary analysis of patients in Tshwane district, in Gauteng Province of South Africa, which has been the global epicentre of the Omicron-led fourth wave, suggests that despite its infectiousness, Omicron is less deadly than other variants that have led the country’s previous three waves. When 166 new admissions were analysed, there were 10 deaths in the past two weeks, making up 6.6% of the 166 admissions. By comparison, the death rates in previous waves ranged from 17%-23%. The major caveat, as scientists who are part of the South African Medical Research Council point out, is that patterns could rapidly change in the next two weeks as it takes nearly a month for infection to reveal its worst-case outcome of death, and so the current data of two weeks are insufficient. Trends in hospitalisation too are encouraging, the scientists say. Finally, the third piece is that an overwhelmingly large number of those needing intensive care were unvaccinated. Of 38 adults in the COVID wards, six were vaccinated, 24 were unvaccinated and eight had unknown vaccination status. Of nine patients with COVID pneumonia, eight are unvaccinated. Therefore, the prevalent wisdom that despite being highly infectious, vaccination — it is not clear if those in the wards were fully or partially vaccinated — significantly protected against disease and death. But vaccination trends in South Africa are not encouraging. Only about 30% of the country has had one dose and only 25% fully vaccinated. Reports have suggested that the South African government has actually had to delay vaccination because it claimed it had “too much stock”, underlining that problems of vaccine hesitancy or easy access for the greater part of the population was a challenge. As observed in previous waves, the first line of defence — or neutralising antibodies produced as a result of a prior infection or vaccination — was significantly reduced when confronted with the Beta or Delta variants. The same appears to be the case with Omicron, but the second line of defence, or cellular immunity, continues to be effective from the extant evidence. Hence, the lesson for the world continues to be that rather than focus on the novelty of Omicron, it is wiser to double up on efforts to completely vaccinate people and then, based on the evidence, consider booster or subsequent doses.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-measured-response/article37906146.ece
09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Diplomatic games||The U.S. government said on December 6 it will stage what it called a “diplomatic boycott” of the Winter Olympics, set to begin in Beijing on February 4. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the decision was taken because “U.S. diplomatic or official representation would treat these games as business as usual”. These games, she argued, could not be treated as such because of China’s “human rights abuses and atrocities in Xinjiang”. The announcement came days ahead of U.S. President Joe Biden’s “Summit of Democracy”, with leaders and representatives from more than 100 countries; China and Russia were not invited. China’s Foreign Ministry has described the boycott as an “outright political provocation”, warning that China would take “firm countermeasures”. Sharp statements aside, the U.S. move is largely symbolic and is unlikely to have a major impact. A diplomatic boycott, which means no official representation, holds far less weight than a complete boycott which would have meant the absence of American athletes. While Australia and New Zealand have also announced that their officials will not be present in China, it remains to be seen how much traction the U.S. campaign will receive beyond its allies. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was in India earlier this week, has announced he will be present at the games, underlining the continuing closeness between China and Russia amid their divergences with the West. China has seized upon both the U.S. boycott and the democracy summit to launch a counter campaign. This week, China’s government released a white paper on democracy, saying there was “no fixed model” and criticising the U.S. system for its “money politics”, a message that Beijing’s officials hope will find sympathetic audiences in Asia, Africa and Latin America, particularly among those countries left out of the summit (including Sri Lanka and Bangladesh). India, meanwhile, has found itself treading the middle ground in this clash of values despite the downturn in ties with China. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi is among the leaders attending the democracy summit, New Delhi last month signed off on a statement issued by the Foreign Ministers of Russia, India and China expressing support for the games. The G20 summit in October had stopped short of doing so, merely saying it looked ahead to the games after the U.S. reportedly opposed a stronger declaration of support. The exchanges this week are a reminder of the current state of ties between the world’s two biggest powers, which have clashed over trade, Taiwan and the South China Sea among other issues, even though their two leaders, in a virtual summit last month, agreed to “responsibly” manage an increasingly competitive relationship. What has complicated that task is a growing clash of values, with ideological differences adding another element to a relationship already in trouble over trade and geopolitical leverage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/diplomatic-games/article37906147.ece
09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Proposing a law in bad faith||The BJP Government in Karnataka is keen to follow in the footsteps of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh by passing a law banning religious conversions through “force” or “allurement”. The demand for such a law is not new in Karnataka, but the pitch has steadily increased over the last few months. Interestingly, while the argument in support of the law in other BJP-ruled States was woven around the narrative of ‘love jihad’, in Karnataka it has been around conversions by Christians. The first indication of this came in July when the Directorate of Minorities Welfare instructed the deputy commissioners of all districts to conduct a survey of churches, purportedly for data collection purposes. It got louder after former Minister and BJP MLA Goolihatti Shekar sought action against missionaries in Hosadurga, his Assembly constituency, for carrying out “rampant religious conversions”. His mother, he said, was among the 15,000 to 20,000 people in his constituency who were “victims” of missionaries. The MLA since then has arranged for a ‘ghar wapsi’ of his mother and a few others. However, officials who carried out a survey in two villages in the MLA’s constituency found no cases of “forced” conversions. The following month saw a House committee of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly on Backward Classes and Minorities meeting to decide on a survey to check “forced conversions”, chaired by Mr. Shekar himself. A day later, an internal order was issued by the ADGP, Intelligence, to all Deputy Superintendents of Police to collate information about “authorised and unauthorised” churches. In November and December, Karnataka has witnessed many attacks and threats against Christian prayer congregations, particularly in the border district of Belagavi. Several prayer groups that used to hold meetings in halls and open grounds have stopped doing so following alleged threats by Hindutva outfits. The police have “advised” them to discontinue their activity “to maintain peace.” In some instances, cases have been booked against those attacked. The last time Karnataka saw a spate of attacks on Christian institutions was in 2008 in Mangaluru and other coastal towns, when the BJP formed an independent government for the first time with B.S. Yediyurappa at its helm. Since November, organisations such as the Shri Ram Sena, Hindu Janajagruti Samiti and a section of seers of various religious sects have kept up pressure on the Government to pass an anti-conversion law. On the other hand, Christian groups have petitioned the Government to underline the dangers of such a law. One petition pointed out that Christians account for only 1.8% of the State’s population and there has hardly been any increase, which flies in the face of claims of “rampant conversions.” Archbishop of Bengaluru Peter Machado said recently that the law would become a tool for fringe groups to target Christians. He claimed that even in the absence of a law, since January, there have been 32 incidents of attacks on the community. He cited a fact-finding report by the United Christian Forum and others, based on calls received on the Forum’s helpline, to say that Karnataka ranks third after U.P. and Chhattisgarh in such attacks. The report notes a rise in attacks in October and November, as the discussion on anti-conversion law grew stronger. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, however, has continued to reiterate his government’s resolve to implement an anti-conversion law, after studying similar laws in other States. But it remains to be seen if he will push ahead with the bill in the upcoming session or defer it until the party’s strength in the Upper House, following the Legislative Council elections scheduled this Friday, gets consolidated enough to pass it without impediments. bageshree.s@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/proposing-a-law-in-bad-faith/article37906165.ece
09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Yahya Khan’s only option (From an Editorial)||The 104 members of the U.N. General Assembly who toed the American line by voting for the resolution calling on India and Pakistan to cease fire forthwith and pull back their troops may lay the flattering unction to their souls that they did something dramatic about the Bangla Desh conflict, but their actual contribution to ending that conflict can only be zero. On the other hand, their blatant anti-India bias and their refusal to go to the root cause of the conflict, namely the Islamabad junta’s savage repression of the people of Bangla Desh, may well contribute to the prolongation of the crisis by the indirect encouragement they have given to the junta. That they went ahead and adopted the resolution even after the strong objection voiced by the Indian representative, Mr. Sen, gives room for the thought that they were more interested in embarassing India than in bringing about an easing of the crisis in the sub-continent. A General Assembly resolution is only recommendatory in scope and not binding on the members and India will be well within its legal rights if it ignores the Assembly’s call for a cease-fire and troops withdrawal, which is what it is bound to do. The U.S., in its chagrin over the failure of its move to get the U.N. to pull Islamabad’s chestnuts out of the fire, may then take the issue back to the Assembly and try to get a stronger anti-Indian resolution passed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/yahya-khans-only-option-from-an-editorial/article37906157.ece
09 December 2021||MUMBAI,||Outlook clouded by Omicron, says RBI||Spillovers from imminent shifts in monetary policy by major global central banks and a possible jump in infections from the Omicron variant of the coronavirus could dent the Indian economy’s ongoing recovery, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das cautioned on Wednesday. “The Indian economy is relatively well-positioned on the path of recovery, but it cannot be immune to global spillovers or to possible surges of infections from new mutations including the Omicron variant,” Mr. Das said, in a monetary policy speech. “Hence, fortifying our macroeconomic fundamentals, making our financial markets and institutions resilient and sound, and putting in place credible and consistent policies will assume the highest priority in these uncertain times,” he said. Mr. Das said that though globally economies were reaching pre-pandemic levels, the recurrence of COVID-19 waves in many parts of the world including the appearance of the Omicron variant, stubborn inflation and headwinds from elevated energy and commodity prices and continuing supply bottlenecks cast a shadow on the outlook. “Given the evolving growth-inflation dynamics across countries, monetary policy is also reaching an inflection point, keeping financial markets edgy,” he said.  Dissent on stance Earlier, the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted unanimously to hold interest rates and by a 5-1 majority opted to retain the “accommodative” policy stance ‘for as long as necessary’. Accordingly, the benchmark repo rate remains unchanged at 4%, the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the bank rate stay at 4.25% and the reverse repo rate continues at 3.35%. Stating that the economic recovery that had been interrupted by the second wave of the pandemic was regaining traction, but was not yet strong enough to be self-sustaining and durable, he said the downside risks to the outlook had risen with the emergence of Omicron. The RBI retained its projection for GDP growth in the current fiscal year at 9.5%. Acknowledging that cost-push pressures continued to impinge on core inflation, Mr. Das posited that “pass-through may remain muted due to the slack in the economy”. The MPC retained its full-year CPI inflation projection at 5.3%. Noting that it was ‘important to keep inflation aligned with the target while focusing on a robust growth recovery’, Mr. Das asserted, “price stability remains the cardinal principle for monetary policy as it fosters growth and stability”. “Our motto is to ensure a soft landing that is well timed,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/outlook-clouded-by-omicron-says-rbi/article37906143.ece
09 December 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Retail auto sales stayed stuck in the slow lane in November’||Automobile retail sales in the country declined by about 3% in November as chip shortages and heavy rains in South India impacted sales across various segments including passenger vehicles and two-wheelers, automobile dealers’ body FADA said on Wednesday. Total registrations slid 2.7% last month to 18,17,600 units, from 18,68,068 units in November 2020. Passenger vehicle sales, however, slumped a much sharper 19.4% to 2,40,234 units, from 2,98,213 units in the same period last year. Similarly, two-wheeler sales last month dropped to 14,33,855 units, from 14,44,762 units in the year-earlier period. Tractor sales slid to 45,629 units last month from 50,180 units in November 2020. Commercial vehicle and three-wheeler registrations, however, increased last month as compared with the year-earlier period. “Auto retail for the month of November continued to remain in the negative zone despite Diwali as well as marriage season in the same month,” FADA president Vinkesh Gulati said in a statement. The passenger vehicle segment continues to face the brunt of a shortage of semiconductors, he said. “While the new launches are keeping customer’s interest high, it is only the lack of supply which is not allowing sales to conclude,” Mr. Gulati said. “The extended waiting period is now starting to make customers jittery, and this may lead to loss of interest in vehicle buying,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/retail-auto-sales-stayed-stuck-in-the-slow-lane-in-november/article37906133.ece
09 December 2021||HYDERABAD,||Tata AIA Life mulls debt after COVID claims rise||Tata AIA Life Insurance is evaluating sources for raising subordinate debt up to Rs. 488 crore to shore up capital in the face of more-than-anticipated COVID-19 claims as well as challenges on the reinsurance front. “We have an approval from IRDAI to raise subordinate debt of Rs. 488 crore, which we are in the process of organising right now,” MD and CEO Naveen Tahilyani said in an interaction here on Wednesday. Different options are available and being studied by the insurer, whose decision to raise capital, for the first time since inception, comes amid COVID claims in 2020-21 pushing up total claims by about 35%. “This [financial] year has been much worse... our claim experience has been twice the normal because the peak in second wave [of pandemic] was sharper,” he said. He said the IRDAI approval had come in October and the company has six months to raise the debt. Raising capital has become imperative in the context of reinsurance supply drying up, Mr. Tahilyani said, pointing out that it translated into higher retention limits for the insurer and could result in increase in premium for the insured. Negotiations with reinsurers, who are seeking higher rates, are underway. Life insurers are urging the reinsurers to separate the COVID experience from normal experience and instead, take a long-term view.

09 December 2021||MUMBAI,||RBI to mop up surplus liquidity as it ‘rebalances’||The Reserve Bank of India said it would continue to rebalance liquidity conditions in a non-disruptive manner while maintaining ‘adequate’ liquidity in the system. The RBI has proposed to enhance the 14-day variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auction amounts on a fortnightly basis in the following manner: Rs. 6.5 lakh crore on December 17; and Rs. 7.5 lakh crore on December 31. “Consequently, from January 2022, liquidity absorption will be undertaken mainly through the auction route,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said. He pointed out that the RBI had been conducting fine-tuning operations from time to time to ‘manage unanticipated and one-off liquidity flows so that systemic liquidity conditions evolve in a balanced and evenly distributed manner’.  ‘Longer-term VRRRs’ The central bank has also been conducting 28-day VRRR auctions. Going forward, the main operation of 14-day VRRRs would continue to be complemented by longer-term VRRRs, the size and maturities of which would be decided based on evolving liquidity conditions, he said. The RBI’s endeavour was “to put in place an effective liquidity management framework that is consistent with an economy emerging out of the pandemic and having a nascent but strengthening recovery,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rbi-to-mop-up-surplus-liquidity-as-it-rebalances/article37906134.ece

09 December 2021||Chennai,||Rahane, Pujara get the selectors’ backing for South Africa tour||The Final Frontier, that’s what South Africa is to the Indian cricket team. It’s the only country where India has not won a Test series. In many respects, the tour, for which the squad was announced on Wednesday, gives India a gilt-edged opportunity to make history. Coach Rahul Dravid and his men could tick a big box for Indian cricket in what might be a momentous tour. Crucially, Rohit Sharma, known for his cricketing nous, has been elevated as the vice-captain, replacing Ajinkya Rahane. Surprises The Test squad, led by Virat Kohli, does not carry surprises. The big question ahead of the selection was would Rahane, lacking runs, retain his place? The selectors have chosen to be conservative banking on Rahane’s experience in the middle-order to deliver the goods. Rahane can execute horizontal bat shots on the bouncy South African pitches and did conjure a match-winning knock at the Wanderers in India’s last tour of the country, factors that could have weighed in the Mumbaikar’s favour. Another warhorse, Cheteshwar Pujara, an influential top-order batsman in crucial away campaigns, finds a place. Rohit Sharma, K.L. Rahul and Mayank Agarwal are the openers (the injured Shubhman Gill misses out), and Shreyas Iyer and Hanuma Vihari, picked for his temperament in tough situations, are the additional middle-order batters. Given that Ravindra Jadeja could not make the squad owing to fitness concerns, off-spinning ace R. Ashwin is slated to play all three Tests. Left-arm spinner Axar Patel is injured but Jayant Yadav’s inclusion as the second spinner - he too sends down off-spin - is surprising considering the selectors could have picked a wrist spinner for variety, providing a lifeline to someone like Kuldeep Yadav. The three Tests will be played at the Centurion, Wanderers and Newlands and all three venues have pitches that offer bounce and seam movement. Potent pace attack India has picked a potent pace attack spearheaded by Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami that will probe the South African batsmen. Rishabh Pant, with his X-factor, will be the first choice ’keeper on foreign tours.  The squad:   Virat Kohli (Capt.), Rohit Sharma (Vice-capt.), K.L. Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Shreyas Iyer, Hanuma Vihari, Rishabh Pant, Wriddhiman Saha, R. Ashwin, Jayant Yadav, Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Umesh Yadav, Shardul Thakur, and Mohammed Siraj.   Standbyes: Navdeep Saini, Saurabh Kumar, Deepak Chahar, Arzan Nagwaswalla .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rahane-pujara-get-the-selectors-backing-for-south-africa-tour/article37906436.ece
09 December 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||TN rides on Shahrukh’s late assault||Finisher Shahrukh Khan’s latest cameo — 66 off 35 balls — floored defending champion Mumbai, which lost to Tamil Nadu by 54 runs, in a Elite Group B match of the Vijay Hazare Trophy cricket tournament at the St. Xavier’s College here on Wednesday. Shahrukh’s late assault powered Tamil Nadu to an imposing 290 for eight and on a slowing pitch, the spinners choked the Mumbai batters after medium-pacers Sandeep Warrier and Silambarasan scuppered the chase by pricing out openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (five) and Armaan Jaffer (nine) cheaply. Lone battle Captain Shams Mulani (75) waged a lone battle but the chase never gathered momentum as Tamil Nadu spinners struck regularly to dismiss Mumbai for 236 in the 47th over. Earlier, twin strikes by Dhawal Kulkarni in the PowerPlay forced B. Indrajith (45) and Washington Sundar (34) to repair the damage cautiously. After they were dismissed while trying to lift the run-rate, Dinesh Karthik attacked the spinners in the middle overs to give the innings the impetus. Useful partnership The stage was then left for Shahrukh to revel and he did it in style. However, he lived a charmed life at the start as the Mumbai fielders failed to latch on to two mishits. He punished Mumbai for the lapses and added 88 for the sixth wicket with J. Kousik (32) which proved to be the game-changer. Meanwhile, Karnataka warmed up for the Thursday southern derby against Tamil Nadu by crushing Pondicherry by 236 runs at the KCA Cricket Stadium. Asked to bat, Karnataka rode on half-centuries from R. Samarth (95), Manish Pandey (64) and K.V. Sidharth (61) to reach 289 for six. It proved to be a tall order for Pondicherry, which folded up for 53. J. Sucith finished with dream figures of four for three. At the Sports Hub, Bengal defeated Baroda by 27 runs after defending a target of 231. Baroda lost its way after a promising start as the Bengal bowlers, led by Akashdeep (three for 39), took wickets regularly to enable their side score an important win.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tn-rides-on-shahrukhs-late-assault/article37906477.ece
09 December 2021||MUMBAI,||Senapati helps Odisha stun Andhra||A captain’s knock by Subhranshu Senapati and a four-wicket haul by left-arm spinner Jayanta Behera set up Odisha’s comfortable 63-run victory against Andhra in its Vijay Hazare Trophy Group A opener on Wednesday. Riding on Senapati’s third List A hundred (116, 120b, 8x4, 2x6) and his stands of 92 and 124 for the second and third wickets with opener Sandeep Pattanaik (57, 86b, 6x4) and Govinda Poddar (46, 55b, 4x4), Odisha scored 278 for five after being asked to bat at the Mumbai Cricket Association’s Bandra-Kurla Complex facility. A star-studded Andhra batting line-up then crumbled against spinner Behara (4/24). While skipper K.S. Bharat, who moved from India’s bubble to Andhra’s in the same city, was bowled by new-ball bowler Debabrata Pradhan for 14, Behara got rid of dangerman Ambati Rayudu. The veteran batter made only 12 as Andhra slumped to 56 for four in the 16th over. Seasoned Ricky Bhui (74, 102b, 9x4) waged a lone battle as Andhra was nowhere in the chase before being bowled out for 215 in the 47th over. At the Brabourne Stadium, pacers Chintan Gaja (4/30) and Hemang Patel (3/29) set up Gujarat’s five-wicket win against J & K. Thane back on the map Big-stage cricket returned to Thane, Mumbai’s twin city, after a quarter of a century as Vidarbha made short work of Himachal Pradesh. Pacer Yash Thakur’s five for 53 helped Vidarbha dismiss Himachal for 213. The left-handed duo of Atharva Taide (64, 59b, 5x4, 3x6) and Yash Rathod (76 n.o., 78b, 7x4, 1x6) sizzled with the willow as Vidarbha overhauled the target with more than 10 overs to spare.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/senapati-helps-odisha-stun-andhra/article37906927.ece
09 December 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Himmat masterminds Delhi’s chase||Himmat Singh waved his bat, looked at the sky, and hugged teammate Kshitiz Sharma after reaching his century as Delhi began its Hazare Trophy campaign with a six-wicket win over Jharkhand at the I.S. Bindra Stadium on Wednesday. Himmat’s unbeaten 113 (124b, 11x4, 1x6) helped his team overcome early jitters and bag four points. Chasing 264, Shikhar Dhawan lasted just three balls and departed for a duck, Anukul Roy taking a sharp catch at point off Varun Aaron. Himmat, walking in with the score at one for one, added 127 for the second wicket with Dhruv Shorey (64, 82b). On a good batting surface, Shorey held fort while Himmat smashed a few boundaries to put pressure on the Jharkhand bowlers. Jharkhand captain Virat Singh tried out several bowling options before getting the breakthrough in the 25th over when Shahbaz Nadeem pouched a return catch to dismiss Shorey. A few overs later, Jonty Sidhu was run out as Delhi was reduced to 154 for three. However, Himmat forged two alliances — with Lalit Yadav and Kshitiz (43 not out) — to guide Delhi home. Earlier, Delhi skipper Pradeep Sangwan, after inviting Jharkhand to bat, reduced it to 55 for four before captain Virat (79, 104b) and Kaushal Singh (69, 86b) revived the innings with a 129-run stand. After Virat and Kaushal fell, Anukul’s 47 off 30 deliveries guided Jharkhand to 263 for eight.  In another match, Tanmay Agarwal’s unbeaten 77 guided Hyderabad to a five-wicket win over Haryana. After Tilak Varma’s four for 23 had restricted Haryana to 162, Tanmay took the team home with nine overs to spare.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/himmat-masterminds-delhis-chase/article37906591.ece
09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Kerala crushes Chandigarh in its opener||Kerala’s campaign in the Vijay Hazare Trophy got off to a smooth start at Rajkot on Wednesday as Sanju Samson’s men romped home with six wickets and 16 overs to spare against Chandigarh at the Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Ground. Put in to bat, Chandigarh could manage only 184 for eight. It was hardly sufficient on what the Kerala coach Tinu Yohannan termed an “excellent track” for batting. Chandigarh could not quite recover from the early loss of two wickets. Opener Sarul Kanwar was removed by Basil Thampi for a duck, while one-drop Shivam Bhambri (14) was sent back by Manu Krishnan, who has impressed this season on his comeback after a long gap. The other opener and captain Manan Vohra, though, ensured his bowlers would have at least something to bowl with. He made 56 (69b, 4x4, 2x6). The second highest score was 26 not out by No. 10 Sandeep Sharma. Left-arm spinner Sijomon Joseph was the pick of the Kerala bowlers, finishing with three for 44.  Kerala’s chase suffered a jolt when Mohammed Azharuddeen was trapped lbw by Jagjit Singh Sandhu. But his opening partner Rohan Kunnummal (46, 59b, 6x4) dropped anchor to take the team closer to the modest target. Rohan added 37 for the second wicket with Samson (24) and 47 for the third with Sachin Baby (59 n.o., 78b, 3x4, 2x6). “This was the kind of start we needed,” Yohannan told The Hindu . “I am really pleased with the way Sijomon and our seamers Basil, Manu and M.D. Nidheesh bowled. Rohan’s innings at the top of the order was crucial in our chase.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/kerala-crushes-chandigarh-in-its-opener/article37906839.ece
09 December 2021||CHANDIGARH,||‘An open stance was the only option’||For Wriddhiman Saha, the just-concluded Test series against New Zealand was very satisfying. He batted despite a stiff neck and went on to score a fifty in the second innings of the first Test in Kanpur. On a short break before the tour of South Africa, Saha shared his thoughts with Sportstar on the recent Tests, competition with Rishabh Pant, and more. Excerpts How would you rate your performance against New Zealand? I have not been playing regularly for a while now, so when an opportunity came my way, I wanted to make the most of it. When I started my career, Dhoni bhai (M.S. Dhoni) was the main wicketkeeper. After his retirement, I played regularly until I suffered an injury a few years ago. Then Rishabh (Pant) took over. Whenever there is a chance, I want to take every game seriously. During the Kanpur Test, your wife was admitted to hospital with dengue. Did it affect your focus? It was challenging for sure. When Romi (wife) was battling dengue, I would regularly keep in touch with the doctors after returning from the stadium in the evening. My family members supported me a lot and ensured that I could focus on the Test. As a team, we were not in a good position in that Test and I was also struggling due to a stiff neck. It was painful and I was even wondering how I would bat in such a situation. In the morning, I had a few knocking sessions and realised that I would have to take an open stance so that I could see the bowler better. I could not bend my neck much and this was the only option. It was difficult, but I did it for the team. Not long ago, you were considered the first choice in Tests. But over the last couple of years, Pant has taken that slot. How do you see this competition? Such things happen in international cricket. There are phases when you are out of the team due to injury. I missed out on a couple of Test series (2018-19 season) due to shoulder surgery and that’s when Rishabh came in and proved his class. He has done a good job as a batter-stumper. After I recovered, there were no Test series immediately, so I had to wait for my turn. It was quite a long gap, but I did not lose confidence and ensured that I gave my best.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/an-open-stance-was-the-only-option/article37906893.ece
09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||HFC adds to BFC’s misery||Bengaluru FC’s season went from bad to worse as Hyderabad FC won 1-0 and handed it a third loss in five matches at the Bambolim stadium on Wednesday. Bartholomew Ogbeche’s deflected goal in the seventh minute was enough to give Manolo Marquez’s men their second win from four matches and send the side third (seven points). BFC slipped to ninth, with just four points from five matches. Hyderabad was quickly off the blocks, with wing-back Aakash Mishra running rings around right-back Roshan Naorem. Pratik Chowdhary, the right centre-back, was almost always out of position and defensive midfielder Bruno Ramires was invisible. In the seventh minute, Mishra went past Roshan with ease and found Ogbeche. The Nigerian was unchallenged and his shot deflected off Pratik and curled into the bottom right corner. Near the half-hour mark, Ogbeche, again unmarked, split the defence with a perfect through ball only for Javier Siverio to blast his shot over and spurn the chance to double the lead. With almost all action limited to the BFC half, Marco Pezzaiuoli pulled out forward Edmund Lalrindika and introduced Danish Farooq to provide some midfield solidity. Though it didn’t change things immediately, BFC showed greater urgency in the second period. Hyderabad nearly paid the price for not having led by more than a goal as Cleiton Silva came close on multiple occasions. An attempted chip by the Brazilian was tipped over by Laxmikant Kattimani before a turn-and-shoot attempt went straight at the goalie. The best opportunity came when he had an unhindered view of the goal from a great position on the right but fluffed it by shooting waywardly. The spell of sustained pressure, though, ended soon as Hyderabad shored up its defence. BFC displayed some renewed vigour in the closing stages, with Kattimani even forced into a save with just seconds left. But it was not to be.  The result: Hyderabad FC 1 (Ogbeche 7) bt Bengaluru FC 0.   Today’s match: Mumbai City FC vs Jamshedpur FC, 7.30 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hfc-adds-to-bfcs-misery/article37906434.ece
09 December 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM:,||Cavaliers CC emerges champion||Cavaliers Cricket Club recorded an eight-wicket win over Gajuwaka Greens Cricket Club in the final of the 24th The Hindu Trophy one-day cricket championship at the Port Stadium on Wednesday. Put in to bat, Gajuwaka made a challenging 292 in 49.5 overs with G. Appanna (55, 67b, 5x4), N. Jyothi Sai Krishna (50, 51b, 6x4) and L. Sravan Kumar (48, 25b, 5x4, 4x6) being the main scorers. For Cavaliers, A.V. Murali returned a three-wicket haul. In reply, Cavaliers was rarely in trouble thanks primarily to fine batting by G. Rohit (84, 75b, 10x4, 4x6), Anshul Gupta (80 n.o., 66b, 5x4, 2x6) and Nakul Sharma (80 n.o., 50b, 4x4, 7x6).  The scores (final):   Gajuwaka Greens 292 in 49.5 overs (G. Appanna 55, N. Jyothi Sai Krishna 50, L. Sravan Kumar 48, A.V. Murali 3/52) lost to Cavaliers 294/2 in 41.4 overs (G. Rohit 84, Anshul Gupta 80 n.o., Nakul Sharma 80 n.o.).   Special awards: Nakul Sharma (Cavaliers, player-of-the-final).   Anshul Gupta (Cavaliers, best batter), K. Ajay Kumar (Gajuwaka Greens, best bowler), B.

09 December 2021||Chennai,||INCRC 2021 set to resume||After a break of close to three months, the MRF MMSC FMSCI Indian National Car Racing Championship 2021 will resume with COVID-19 safety protocols in place at the MMRT here on Friday. The MRF F1600 will headline the weekend card with a triple-header, while the Formula LGB 1300, the Saloon Cars (Indian Touring Cars, Super Stock, Indian Junior Touring Cars) and Volkswagen Polo will have two races apiece in the three-day event. Of equal significance is the entry-level MRF Saloon Cars category, featuring Toyota Etios. Last season, it made a debut in the National Championship, promoted by the Madras Motor Sports Club, with just six entries, but now boasts of a grid of 25 cars, representing two teams – the Red Line Racing India and Quest Motorsports. Two young guns who stood out in the first round were teenagers Shahan Ali Mohsin from Agra and Bengaluru’s Ruhaan Alva, both products of the National karting championships. Shahan won two of the three races in the MRF F1600 category while Ruhaan (MSport) was adjudged “best rookie” in the Formula LGB 1300.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/incrc-2021-set-to-resume/article37906483.ece
09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Calm after the storm as Nepo plays it safe||In what turned out to be the quickest game of the ongoing World chess championship title match, Magnus Carlsen and Ian Nepomniachtchi needed only 125 minutes to draw Game 10 in 41 moves in Dubai on Wednesday. With four games to go, Carlsen leads 6.5-3.5 and needs only one more point to keep the title. Nepo will play with white pieces when the action resumes on Friday after a day’s rest. Having lost three out of the last four games, Nepo was expected to adopt a more pragmatic approach, and he did. Playing black, he chose to repeat Petroff Defence and made no secret of being satisfied with a draw. Asked if he was surprised by Nepo’s decision to stick to Petroff, Carlsen said, “I didn’t particularly think he would do that. But I guess he was in damage-limitation mode at this point.” The players gave very little away and after a series of exchanges in quick time, a draw was agreed. Though a draw appeared the most obvious result for a long time, the players played out a minimum of 40 moves to meet the stipulation set for a draw offer. The game ended once the second rook came off the board and the players were left with a knight and four pawns each. “At this point, there’s so few games to go that any draw is an excellent result,” said Carlsen. Asked if his strategy was going to draw the remaining games, Carlsen said, “I very much assume he’s going to try and win, especially with the white pieces. But sure, any half-point that I can get is great and I think that’s pretty obvious." Strangely, the moderator at the media conference — Grandmaster Maurice Ashley — asked Nepo, “You’ve only got four games left and a three-point deficit. Your strategy is still heavily trying to win this match?” To which a visibly irked Nepo responded, “Well, that’s an absurd question.”  The moves: Game 10: White: Carlsen; Black: Nepomniachtchi   1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nd3 Nxe4 5. Qe2 Qe7 6. Nf4 Nf6 7. d4 Nc6 8. c3 d5 9. Nd2 Nd8 10. Nf3 Qxe2+ 11. Bxe2 Bd6 12. O-O O-O 13. Bd3 Re8 14. Re1 Rxe1+ 15. Nxe1 Ne6 16. Nxe6 Bxe6 17. g3 g6 18.

09 December 2021||Chennai,||Rohit’s elevation a significant step||It was a big day for Rohit Sharma. Wednesday saw the Mumbaikar named the captain of the ODI side and elevated as vice-captain of the Test team. Considering Rohit already captains the country in Twenty20 cricket, he effectively becomes India’s captain in white ball cricket. It’s a significant development that signals a shifting of the balance of power in Indian cricket. Virat Kohli opted out of Twenty20 captaincy after the World Cup in UAE, but he was still the skipper of the ODI side. The selectors, now, have effectively removed Kohli as the ODI skipper.  Perhaps, the selectors felt the burden of captaincy in the different formats was taking its toll on Kohli’s batting. The feisty right-hander is no longer as prolific as he once was and this is worrying for the Indian camp. Kohli has a direct in-your-face attitude and does play his cricket with a lot of passion. But then his approach could make some of his team-mates uncomfortable. Rohit, in contrast, has a relaxed approach to captaincy. The manner he led India in the recent Twenty20 series against New Zealand was laudable. He does not get ruffled, has his finger on the pulse of the game, and has this ability to get the best out of the younger bunch.  Rohit is also a bowler-friendly captain who comprehends the needs of this tribe. He gets the job done without putting the bowlers under undue pressure, shows confidence in them, the hallmark of a good captain. Rohit’s field placements are imaginative too. There is this quiet efficiency driving his cricket. His partnership with coach Rahul Dravid will be watched with interest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rohits-elevation-a-significant-step/article37906428.ece
09 December 2021||SOLAPUR,||Akanksha packs off Mihika||Akanksha Nitture defeated fifth seed Mihika Yadav 6-0, 6-4 in the first round of the Jamshri $15,000 ITF women’s tennis tournament here on Wednesday. The 18-year-old Akanksha had a brisk start and raced away with the first set, dropping a mere eight points. She led 3-1 in the second before Mihika fought back and saved a match point in the ninth game. Akanksha was in fine form and converted seven of nine break points. Akanksha will play Saumya Vig in the pre-quarterfinals.

09 December 2021||Jeddah,||It has never been the main thing for me, says Raikkonen||While all eyes in Abu Dhabi will be on the headline drama of the title fight between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen this weekend, another world champion will be making his final appearance in a Formula One car. Twenty years after making his F1 debut for Sauber at the 2001 Australian Grand Prix, Finnish driver Kimi Raikkonen will start his 349th and final race on Sunday but he says he “wouldn’t change a thing” and has no regrets about stepping away. “F1 takes up a lot of time but it has never been the main thing for me,” the 2007 world champion told AFP. “My life has always been outside. There are other more important things for me than F1. Today my schedule affects my whole family so I am looking forward to the day I have nothing planned and can do what they want.” Retirement is nothing new for the 42-year-old whose drive at Alfa Romeo next year will be taken by Valtteri Bottas. He tried it once before, missing the 2010 and 2011 seasons, although that just made time for him to race in NASCAR and the world rally championship. That switch within motor sports appears unlikely this time around although Raikkonen’s fans have been encouraging him to bid for the presidency of both Formula One and Finland.  Raikkonen has always been his own man, picking up the nickname ‘The Iceman’ partly because of the brevity of his glacial answers to journalists over the years. “That is how it works in my head. I tell it like it is,” he says. Forging his own path Raikkonen also admits that he has not always been the best listener over the course of his career as he forged his own path. “I think I was given a lot of advice but didn’t listen. I always felt you had to live your life in the best way for yourself and not for others.”  Raikkonen came to prominence as a driver when he left Sauber for McLaren for the 2002 season, finishing runner-up twice in the world championship in 2003, behind Michael Schumacher, and 2005 behind Fernando Alonso.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/it-has-never-been-the-main-thing-for-me-says-raikkonen/article37906916.ece
09 December 2021||Paris,||Hamilton not ‘playing fair’ with Verstappen: Ecclestone||Title challenger Max Verstappen has been bullied by seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton and his Mercedes team this season, former Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone said. Verstappen and Hamilton are tied on points heading into the final Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi on Sunday and Ecclestone believes the pressure of Mercedes’ “psychological game playing” has had a significant bearing on the title race. Ecclestone —- who over several decades transformed the sport into a global multi-billion-dollar commercial giant — said Mercedes CEO Toto Wolff and Hamilton were “not playing fair.” “Max is a kid compared to Lewis and the worst thing is Lewis has a massive publicity campaign working for him,” Ecclestone said. “They have been pushing down all the time on Max and then the race directors have been looking in because Toto goes to the race director. “Max has more than a race to confront as he has them too on his back because they are bullying him and not playing fair. “It is psychological game playing.” Ecclestone, 91, says if it comes down to mind games Hamilton is in the stronger position. “Max has had a few years of racing but has not had years in the streets like Lewis,” said Ecclestone. “It has built character and knowing he would win the race with Mercedes being the dominant force over the past few years has made him a much stronger character than Max. “For Max, this season is the first one he has had a car capable of winning regularly whereas before it was nothing like competitive.” Ecclestone hopes Sunday will produce a better race than the ‘club race’ he watched last weekend — and he believes the winner will be whoever is “luckiest”. “It is good for the sport,” he said. “I think people have known full well in previous years who was going to win. “But this has been an incredible year. This year it has been good to have something a little bit different. “There is nothing wrong with Lewis, he has done the best he can but he has had a lot of help.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/hamilton-not-playing-fair-with-verstappen-ecclestone/article37906869.ece
09 December 2021||Porto,||All’s well that ends well for Atletico||Three red cards, on-field brawls, countless chances and a flurry of late goals. A wild, win-or-bust match in the Champions League between Porto and Atletico Madrid had it all. In the end, it was Atletico celebrating a place in the last 16 of Europe’s top club competition with a 3-1 win on Tuesday, emerging from a three-way fight for qualification in the final round. On a night when Ajax striker Sebastien Haller became an unlikely history-maker, Real Madrid finished on top of its group, and Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi ran amok for Paris Saint-Germain, much of the focus on the next-to-last night of group play was on the Group B finale as three teams vied to be runner-up to Liverpool before Atletico sealed it. Haller, by converting an eighth-minute penalty for Ajax in its 4-2 win over Sporting, the Ivory Coast striker became only the second player — after Cristiano Ronaldo in 2017-18 — to score in all six matches of a single group stage.  The results: Group A: Paris Saint-Germain 4 (Mbappe 2, 7, Messi 38, 76-pen) bt Club Brugge 1 (Rits 68); RB Leipzig 2 (Szoboszlai 24, Andre Silva 71) bt Manchester City 1 (Mahrez 76). PSG, Man City qualified.   Group B: AC Milan 1 (Tomori 29) lost to Liverpool 2 (Salah 36, Origi 55); Porto 1 (Oliveira 90+6-pen) lost to Atletico Madrid 3 (Griezmann 56, Correa 90, De Paul 90+2). Liverpool and Atletico advanced.   Group C: Borussia Dortmund 5 (Malen 29, Reus 45+2 & 53, Haaland 68, 81) bt Besiktas 0; Ajax 4 (Haller 8-pen, Antony 42, Neres 58, Berghuis 62) bt Sporting Lisbon 2 (Nuno Santos 22, Bruno Tabata 78). Ajax and Sporting progressed.   Group D: Real Madrid 2 (Kroos 17, Asensio 79) bt Inter Milan 0; Shakhtar Donetsk 1 (Fernando 42) drew with Sheriff 1 (Nikolov 90+3).

09 December 2021||KOZHIKODE,||Railways aiming to derail Manipur||Manipur’s domination of Indian women’s football has been remarkable. It has won the title in 20 of the 25 editions of the National championship. On Thursday we will find out if the Manipur women could make it 21. If they do, it would be commendable — for, they would be doing it without many of the main players. Those players are doing national duty at the moment. They are in Kochi — about five hours’ drive from here — for the Indian team’s preparatory camp for the Asia Cup. Manipur’s opponent in the final, the experienced Railways team, will certainly be fancying its chances and looking for revenge. In the final of the last edition in 2019 held at Pasighat (Arunachal Pradesh), Manipur had beaten Railways 1-0. Both the teams were stretched in Tuesday’s semifinals. After playing in sweltering heat for 120 minutes — not to mention the injury time — the matches were decided in shoot-outs. The players would have appreciated the rest day they got ahead of the final, scheduled to kick off at the Corporation Stadium at 3 p.m. Among the players to watch out for are Railways’ Mamta and Manipur’s Irom Prameshwori Devi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/railways-aiming-to-derail-manipur/article37906473.ece

09 December 2021||CHANGANASSERY,||Thiruvananthapuram boys, Kottayam girls triumph||Captain C.K. Abhinav’s 41 points, which included nine three-pointers, went in vain as Thiruvananthapuram edged out Thrissur 74-73 and won the boys’ title in the 45th Kerala State junior basketball championship here on Wednesday. Thrissur had held a six-point lead in the last quarter but it allowed the boys from the capital, which included international Pranav Prince, to bounce back and a free throw miss by Karthik Jayasankar in the last few seconds allowed Thiruvananthapuram to pull off a one-point win. Earlier P.S. Jesly, international Jeena Skaria’s younger sister, was in sparkling form as Kottayam toyed with defending champion Thiruvananthapuram 65-31 and regained the girls’ title. Jesly, from Assumption College, was virtually everywhere. She was virtually flying, plucking rebounds and scoring baskets from tough angles with point guard Aksa Thangam, who was in fine form, providing many an assist. Coached by Thomas Chandy, Kottayam was a well-knit unit. The host girls were fast on court and neat with passes and they rattled Thiruvananthapuram with their zone defence and rebounds where Swapna Merin, K. Sreelakshmi and Irin Elsa impressed in turns. That virtually shut out their opponents in the second third quarters.  The result:   Boys final: Thiruvananthapuram 74 (Pranav Prince 22, Arjun Unnikrishnan 19, Alan Rozario 12) bt Thrissur 73 (C.K. Abhinav 41). Third place: Kottayam 77 (Adarsh S. Kappen 20, Alfin Charly16) bt Kozhikode 46.   Girls final: Kottayam 65 (P.S. Jesly 31, K. Sreelakshmi 13) bt Thiruvananthapuram 31.

The Chennai-based entrepreneur has just launched a range of curry pastes that enable you put a elaborate meal on the table in less than 30 minutes. All you need to do is to cook the protein — you can choose meat, fish, vegetables or eggs — with this fragrant paste, along with water or coconut milk. “When I got married and came from Cochin to Chennai in 1987, I was in awe of my mother-in-law who cooked elaborate meals. Our home in Anna Nagar, at Q49, was synonymous with hospitality. That’s why I decided to create a line of products, named Q49, to popularise heirloom recipes.” In 2009, Renu began to experiment with curry pastes, for her son, who was studying in Canada. “When he visited, I would make curry pastes, which I packed in a freezer box, so he could take them back and use them to cook for a few months,” she says. When her daughter moved to the US and had a baby, Renu visited and filled her freezer with an assortment of these pouches before she returned to India. “After numerous trials and tests for over three years, our product has finally launched in Chennai five months ago,” says Renu, adding that it has a shelf life of one year, and is free of chemical preservatives and additives. “We use only fresh ingredients, herbs and spices,” she says, explaining that they use retort processing technology, which ensures a long shelf life without the use of artificial preservatives, resulting in a curry that tastes and feels exactly like what her mother-in-law made at home.  Bestsellers: Kerala red fish curry, methi paneer masala and chicken curry paste. Visit www.q49.in. Shipping across India.   Tulua  “When I travel just from Nashik to Kolhapur, I taste such dramatic changes in flavours. Then imagine how diverse the rest of the country is,” says Richa Dave, the 27-year-old founder of Tulua Foods, a company that provides homestyle, ready-to-cook curry bases inspired by regional recipes from across the country. Tulua (meaning, ‘to rise’ in Sanskrit) was launched in August last year. “With changing lifestyles, not many have the time to prepare family recipes. My idea was to make cooking more approachable. I also wanted to archive, conserve and preserve regional recipes through our meal pastes,” says Richa. Tulua currently offers five varieties of curry pastes: a ghee roast from Mangaluru, Goan vindaloo, Delhi’s butter masala, Malabar curry from Kerala and malaikari from West Bengal. Noticing the rising demand for regional curry pastes in the Indian market, especially after the pandemic and associated lockdowns, during which people spent more time at home, and in their kitchens, Tulua works with chefs and focuses on creating products that are versatile and relatively healthy. “They do not contain preservatives and we use high quality organic ingredients,” says Richa, adding, “For example, our ghee roast paste is used as pizza toppings or as pasta sauce.”  Bestsellers: Malabar curry, malaikari and ghee roast . Visit www.eattulua.com. Shipping across India  Curry Tree “Though our range of ready-to-cook curry pastes was planned earlier, we finally launched in July, at the peak of the pandemic. Going by the surge in sales I believe we launched at the right time,” says Brijesh Jacob, who co-founded Curry Tree along with Prajanya Advait. “Our idea is to make expert cooks out of our customers and boost their confidence by ensuring the cooking process is error free,” says Brijesh. Involving a three-step process, Curry Tree has developed their these Do-It-Yourself range in consultation with a team of chefs and food technologists, highlighting the cuisines of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Goa and West Bengal. They plan to launch the cuisines of every State eventually. Their next launch, however, is an Asian Thai curry paste. Research is also on to offer the popular Bengalo kosha mangsho and railway curry. “Our biryani paste has made Sundays enjoyable for many families, as it involves no fuss or elaborate processes. Our fish fry paste can be used for vegetables such as cauliflower and brinjal as well,” says Brijesh. Stating that parties at home and potlucks have become more popular over the past couple of years, because of the pandemic, ready-to-use pastes are getting popular because of the convenience they offer for making large portions of food. Especially because, as Brijesh emphasises, “It tastes as good as home-made.”     Bestsellers: Chettinad masala, fish fry paste and Kerala Roast. Visit www.currytreepastes.com.

09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||It’s gig night once more||When the Covid-related lockdowns began in March 2020, Chennai’s musicians retreated into their homes and studios to bide their time. Many stayed in touch with fans online. Most of them stayed in touch with their creative inner selves, quietly releasing song after song, in a steady outpour of ‘lockdown releases’ that continues to this day. In recent weeks, it looks like the involuntary hiatus is finally at an end. Indie music performances are becoming a regular feature of the city’s night life again, and songs hitherto restricted to lives and streams are finally getting belted out to real-life audiences. But though revellers and performers are equally happy, some usual challenges remain. At Barracuda Brew in Nungambakkam this past Saturday, it fell to singer-songwriter Sarah Black to get the evening started. Her voice is powerful, but her songs were soft, and it took two solid numbers before the chatty patrons settled down enough to really give her a listen. Sarah’s opening act — a mix of covers, originals and unreleased singles — paved the way for the rest of the lineup of Michael Timothy and Friends, and the night ended on a more synergetic high. Sarah had anticipated as much: “It’s a pub after all; people are there to have fun. Keeping a crowd silent while playing acoustic is hard; but the audience got peppier towards the end.” Her set included numbers she has never performed before, such as the sweetly wistful ‘Someday’ written a month ago, and earlier lockdown releases like ‘Loud’ and ‘Summer Love’. She adds, “Michael Timothy asked me to open one of his gigs a long time ago, which did not happen then. I was excited to open for him finally, because he’s an amazing musician and the lineup was really good.” Part of the same lineup was Amogh Balaji, who for the past few weeks has been on stage both as a solo artiste and as part of ensembles, including one with fellow musician and collaborator Michael Timothy. Amogh’s first night back on stage, he recalls, was at Black Orchid, RA Puram in November. Says Amogh, “There was me, Nadisha Thomas, Paul Livi, Chris Jason and a number of other musicians. The crowd was a mix of people who had come just for us, and people who just wanted to have fun on the weekend.” Recent gigs are giving Amogh another reason to be happy: “Last weekend, two or three people came up to me at the show, saying they were here because they recognised me from Instagram. It’s good to see that social media is working for us, and showing results in real life.” A new audience is not the only yield musicians are reaping from their year online. In some cases, it has landed them a platform too. House of T, which has been organising Instagram and Zoom shows for most of the pandemic — sometimes ignoring dwindling viewership — has found promising new talent through it. Says Thomas Davis, founder of House of T, “A lot of interesting musicians were part of our Zoom shows, including Kavin who does reggae music in Tamil, Sadhanaa B who plays the violin as well as the guitar, and some younger talent who had to put their music on hold because of board exams, and are now raring to return.” When the time is right All these musicians have been hosted by House of T at its usual venue: Republik, Adyar. Their shows have tentatively been becoming more frequent since August: “In November, we moved to Sunday nights, since the bar crowd in Chennai prefers dance music over live music on Saturdays. The Sunday crowd is more mellow, and wants to listen to original music.” Thomas adds that, surprisingly, audience numbers now are higher than they were before the lockdowns. “What used to be a maximum of 30 people per show, is now a minimum of 30 and maximum of 60.” Even larger platforms — like Social — are optimistic about their indie music plans. Ranveer Sabhani, business head — South, Impresario Handmade Restaurants, says about Mount Road Social, “We would like to host them [independent musicians] as frequently as possible. We are waiting to find a pool of talent that we can start a mid-week property with. Currently, we have five to six gigs per month. ” “The culture still needs to be built more,” acknowledges Thomas, “but people are now more willing to come out for artistes they don’t personally know.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/its-gig-night-once-more/article37906402.ece
09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||In rewind mode||The ‘A side first song’ of Lagaan was ‘Ghanan Ghanan’. The ‘B side first song’ of Kandukondein Kandukondein was ‘Konjam Mainaakale’. Terms like ‘A side’ and ‘B side’ might be unfamiliar for Gen Z but for those from the Eighties and Nineties, they are an inseparable part of growing up. The makers of Hridayam hope to tap into that nostalgia. Directed by Vineeth Srinivasan and starring Pranav Mohanlal, Darshana Rajendran and Kalyani Priyadarshan, this upcoming Malayalam film will have all its 15 tracks on audio cassettes and CDs on sale for listeners. The idea was the result of a discussion between director Vineeth Srinivasan and composer Hesham Abdul Wahab when they were taking a stroll on the streets of Istanbul in Turkey, where they had gone to record a few instruments. “We spotted shops selling CDs and cassettes, and we became nostalgic about our own experiences with music,” recalls Hesham, who grew up in Riyadh, where access to entertainment channels was limited. “My only gateway to music was through cassettes and CDs, which I used to buy whenever I came to India for vacations. Those experiences will never go away from my heart.” The team wanted to see if it was possible to make audiences re-live that experience. Thanks to Chennai-based music label Think Music and an association with a Japanese manufacturer of audio cassettes, Hridayam will now its music in cassettes and CDs. “Any composer who has lived in the Eighties and Nineties would have this dream to bring their music in the form of cassettes, and I’m glad to be living that dream,” says Hesham. The announcement of pre-orders has already received an overwhelming response, according to Santhosh Kumar of Think Music. He says, “We have already received 1,000 pre-orders for cassettes and 500 for CDs, from listeners across Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka,” he says. Vinyl recordings of Hridayam also will be available after the movie’s release. So, how do audiences listen to the songs when they are unlikely to still own audio cassette and CD players? Says Santhosh, “As a music label, our scope ends with making the cassettes and CDs. The availability of electronic equipment is not in our purview, but we do know that there are many households that still have cassette players. They are also available in some electronic shops and can be ordered online.” Hesham has already got his old Walkman fixed and is waiting for the first batch of Hridayam cassettes to arrive, so that he can re-live what he felt as a listener two decades ago. He mentions that cassettes/CDs of Tamil film Boys and Hindi flick Jodhaa Akbar find pride of place in his studio. “Take  AR Rahman’s Jodhaa Akbar , for instance. When we listen to the first song (‘Azeem-O-Shaan Shahenshah’), we are being introduced to the world of Jodhaa Akbar and get a peek into what the film is about. We then move on to the love song ('Jashn-E-Bahaaraa') and then to ‘Khwaja Mere Khwaja’. This slowly prepares you for the film and leaves to your imagination on what kind of visuals will go with it. All this gives you a unique musical experience, something which modern musical streaming apps cannot provide.”  Cassettes and CDs are available for pre-order in www.thinkmusic.in at Rs. 199, excluding shipping   Any composer who has lived in the Eighties and Nineties would have this dream to bring their music in the form of cassettes, and I’m glad to be living that dream Hesham Abdul Wahab||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/in-rewind-mode/article37906355.ece

After decades of watching WWE icons like The Undertaker, Triple H and others on television, there I was, at the stunning Barclays Center in Brooklyn, NY, ready to witness the 2021 Survivor Series! WWE’s tie-in with Netflix’s recent Red Notice sparked excited rumours of The Rock, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds being in attendance. Though this sadly didn’t come to fruition, several other celebrities and movie stars were among the spectators, the most popular of them being HBO’s Succession ’s Kieran Culkin — he really is the most riveting thing on TV these days — who waved to fans from the Jumbotron’s big screen. A crowd of nearly 16,000 — most of them unmasked — engulfed the sprawling arena, under a psychedelic spectacle of lights, bangs and fireworks. This was exhilarating and terrifying all at once, as my double-masked self from India tried to come to terms with the new.. old normal (?) in another country. Those seated around me even found my levels of paranoia funny, especially when I politely — and wistfully — turned down beer and appetisers, unwilling to lower my N95 (I did manage to pick up a shawarma — how could I not? — from a downtown food truck later on in the freezing New York night). Onto proceedings then. The kick-off pre-show featured a mini-concert and match between Shinsuke Nakamura and Damian Priest; the former won thanks to a disqualification result. The actual pay-per-view opened with Raw Women’s Champion Becky Lynch taking on SmackDown Women’s Champion Charlotte Flair. Easily one of the best matches of the evening, with two of the most gifted performers in wrestling history pulling out all the stops, this featured some spectacular moves such as the Top Rope Moonsault and Figure Four Leglock, but ultimately Lynch reigned supreme. Another exciting match-up pitted tag team champs RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle) against the Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), which ended with a mid-air RKO from Orton, and the crowd going absolutely bonkers. Some of the loudest cheers were reserved for Orton, a true-blue legend of the sport, who at 41, still commands incredible technique. With the US having recently opened its doors to vaccinated travellers from other countries, the audience comprised people from various nationalities. Imagine my surprise when I suddenly heard Telugu slogans behind me. During the course of the event, several video montages paid tribute to The Rock, commemorating the 25th anniversary of Dwayne Johnson’s WWE debut at the 1996 Survivor Series. Cue “Rocky! Rocky!” chants throughout the arena every half hour. Finally, the start of the main event — between WWE Champion Big E and Universal Champion Roman Reigns — brought the house down. Reigns, one of the most marketable athletes in modern sport today, was in sensational form, as he showcased his array of skills, finally landing his epic finishing movie — the Spear — to emerge victorious. Given his global fandom nowadays, Hollywood surely awaits this star. The next day brought with it some hobnobbing with WWE’s finest (Drew McIntyre, Rhea Ripley and THE Stephanie McMahon herself) and a visit later to Monday Night Raw where two championships changed hands. An exhilarating ending to a surreal experience that lived up to its billing. And then some.

09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Ninety and living it||In September this year, Sowcar Janaki returned to Chennai from a solo trip to Coonoor and informed her family she had a surprise for them: that she was back from a shooting stint! Janaki, who turns 90 this December 12, is well known in her family for being independent. “Of course, she assured us that she was well taken care of on set,” laughs the actor’s elder daughter Yagna Prabha, amid preparations for a get-together to celebrate her mother’s birthday. The actor was shooting with director Nandini Reddy in Coonoor; she plays actor Rajendra Prasad’s aunt in his upcoming project titled Anni Manchi Sakunamule. “I was hesitant initially but the makers insisted I play the role and I was touched. I left my fate in God’s hands and took the chance,” says Janaki, adding, “It’s nice to be on the set. It feels gratifying.” Reveals Nandini Reddy, “The role required an independent, individualistic and strong matriarchal personality whose words have an impact on the family, and we could not think anyone beyond Janaki amma . Though she was reluctant initially, she agreed after becoming fully vaccinated.” In order to make the veteran actor comfortable, Nandini shot only two hours in a day, ensuring there were breaks in between takes. Janaki made her debut in the LV Prasad-directed Telugu film Shavukaru in 1950, which got her the moniker ‘Sowcar’. Apart from playing lead roles in her 70-year career, Janaki has portrayed multiple character roles and is well-known for her light-hearted role in Thillu Mullu co-starring Rajinikanth, with whom she shares her birthday. She was last seen in Tamil films like Thambi (2019) and Biskoth (2020).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/ninety-and-living-it/article37906362.ece
09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Dinner slows down||“Oh, come all ye faithful,” a trio tomato rasam made with lentils, will be one of the dishes at a 10-course sit down festival menu at Farmlore in Bengaluru this Christmas. Curated by Chef Johnson Ebenezer, the festive menu is part of an immersive dining experience launched in mid-2019 when he co-founded Lore, an outfit that tells stories with food. He was unaware then that he would be doing mainly sit-down dining and silver service for the next couple of years, after the pandemic altered dinner parties and gatherings through 2020 and 2021. Last year when travel came to a standstill, Lore offered a communal dining based on the theme - Around the world in 80 days. Menus were printed as boarding passes of each aerodrome. The format limits itself to a range of 16 to 24 diners, says Johnson, who organised the event along with his business partners Chef Mythrayie Iyer and Chef Avinash Vishaal. “The sit-down layout gives people ample time and closeness to have long and slow conversations,” adds Johnson. With small groups, it is possible to create multi-course degustation menus that immerse guests in a dining experience for two to three hours. In Hyderabad, Lore hosted Omnisense, offering a menu that was crafted around the five senses. In Bengaluru, their seven-course dinner based on ‘birth to rebirth’ was customised for individual groups and held at different locations. Earlier in September, Mumbai -based experimental chef Prateek Sadhu celebrated his fine dining, ingredient driven restaurant, Masque turning five with a five-city tour. This included pop-up dinners in Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Chennai and Ladakh. Set in the middle of an idyllic apricot orchard the Ladakh dinner was particularly unique because the menu was almost entirely planned around foraged and local ingredients. Noticing a definite uptick in private dining requests since pandemic restrictions eased, Sadhu says, “A meal like this means someone is setting aside the time to invest in an experience. They’re committing themselves to you for two to three hours, and leaving themselves at your mercy and that’s a responsibility we don’t take lightly. We discuss every aspect of the tableware and service style before launching a new menu, because everything surrounding the food is what also builds the experience.” Chef Vikramjit Roy, who set up Hello Panda, a gourmet pan-Asian delivery service in June 2020 has been organising sit down dinners during the pandemic for couples, and bigger groups of 50 to 60 people. He believes that the pandemic brought the sophisticated sit down dining experience from the outside to people’s homes. “These clients are well-travelled and know their food. During the pandemic they missed the fine dining experience and hence wished to bring it home,” he says. Vikram says the challenge of setting up the experience at home is “immense.” “We operate in professional kitchens, as chefs, with precise equipment. The menu at sit downs is not a bowl meal, but one where every element stands out. All this requires sophisticated equipment and most home kitchens have basic cooking appliances,” says Vikram, adding that his team carries a full range of cooking ware including dehydrators, sous-vide machines and blenders to the location. According to Vikram, food is only 30%of the experience. The rest lies in service, tableware and styling. “The server, who originated from the butler of yore, is very knowledgable about the food that’s served. He should have the ability to interact with guests in an easy way, explaining the nuances of the meal,” says Vikram, who has done elaborate multi-course events across India, from the metro cities to tier-II cities like Ludhiana and Lonavala. In Kochi, Sareeka John and Payal Bafna who founded Guestronomy, a bespoke dining venture, in 2019. In 2022, they are set to take it forward with The Grape Escapade: 30 dinners over a four-day event at six wineries in Nashik, from January 26. “The health crisis slowed us down and reconnected us to our old modes of functioning,” says Sareeka, adding, “Earlier meal times were elaborate. We are now looking for such intimate experiences that infuse closeness and a bonding that had gone missing. I believe there is a market opening for this slow and stylish meal time after the pandemic.” As Sareeka works with hotels to curate bespoke dinners, she says that guests are just discovering this aspect, “that something interesting, thoughtful and fun can be done away from the fixed dining formats that hotels offer.” Such experiences can costs between Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 10,000.  Call for innovation  Mayank Kulshreshtha, Executive Chef ITC Grand Chola, says chefs have introduced many innovations, like innovative plating, platter-to-plate silver service, and thali service. Seating arrangements like the round, V, block table and the E shape too are back in vogue. As examples of innovation, he talks about techniques like the slow infusion of ghee from a lit ghee candle placed on a dish or active charcoal smoking a dish as dramatic interventions. Though big hotel groups like ITC typically do not cater to home dinners, during the pandemic they did send teams of chef and steward to unravel and explain their menus to guests at home. Mayank He sees a clear shift towards sit-down dining and believes that the trend is here to stay. “ It’s going to catch on more. People have got used to the pampering that the format offers.” Sit down dining is also getting increasingly creative. Vikram recently catered a 10-course menu for a small group on a beach island off Mayabunder in the Andaman. “The island is very secluded and has no electricity. Dinner was in the glow of candlelight and we created a dreamy environment,” he says. He does not divulge the cost of the experience, except for saying, “it’s not cheap for sure”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/dinner-slows-down/article37906414.ece
09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Santa paws is coming to town||Rustom and Simba have an important look about them. The indie and the Labrador wag their tails in support as they trail their humans who are busy putting together stalls for the upcoming Santa Paws market. The fundraiser bazaar by Chennai-based NGO Tail Alert will send its proceeds towards rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming abandoned adult dogs that have no street survival skills. The sprawling tree-lined premises of Sir Mutha Campus Hall will play host to around 17 stalls. “Interestingly, almost all of them are owned by proud pet parents of dogs that have been adopted and not shopped,” says Renuka Jaypal, founding trustee, Tail Alert. “Half of them adopted from us,” she laughs. There is food, shopping, games, a garage sale and a raffle. “Our youngest stall owners are two 12-year-old who will put up their baked goodies; and the oldest is a 78-year-old quilter,” says Renuka. One of the participating brands does QR codes that can be used to locate anything from lost luggage to lost pets. Then there is also a young doodler who will create quick sketches of pets. At the Tail Alert stall, one can shop for merchandise or just talk to the members to learn of heart-warming tales of rescue and what it is like for a pet to find a new loving home and its owner to be showered with unconditional love. A case in point is Scooby’s Cafe. “From having a rough life, the doggo is now the sampler at the cafe,” says Renuka. The members at Tail Alert are touched by the large heartedness of people. “The Food and Beverage industry despite being badly hit has given us food vouchers for the raffle. This includes Park Hyatt, ITC Grand Chola, Trident, The Westin, Hyatt Regency, Soy Soi, Kappa Chakka Kandhari, East Coast at Madras Square, Ambassador Pallava, Green Park hotels, Radisson Blu, Le Meridien, Fairfield by Marriott and Gourmet Gig by Chef Payal...” informs Renuka. To drive home the point of ‘adopt, don’t shop’, Renuka says they have planned party games like Pin the Tail on the Donkey, except here one pins the muzzle on the breeder or the dunce hat on the buyer. In its fourth year now, Tail Alert has, in the last 24 months, found homes for 157 adult dogs and over 100 puppies.  Santa Paws market will take place on December 11 at Sir Mutha Campus Hall,Harrington Road, Chetpet, between 10 am and 5 pm.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/santa-paws-is-coming-to-town/article37906374.ece
09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||A dream as big as the ocean||Imagine mastering the toughest of skating moves and not being able to afford a good pair of shoes, or even a skateboard for that matter. This is a challenge for many of the young fishermen of Mamallapuram who take an interest in the sport. Teenagers B Sivaraj, M Harish, and A Manikandan, all of them Higher Secondary students, are no exception. Sivaraj, for instance, goes fishing on weekends and had to drop out of school two years ago to support his family. But a scholarship seat awaits him at a city college, all thanks to his skateboarding and surfing abilities. The three boys are set to travel to Dhelpur in Punjab tomorrow to represent Tamil Nadu at the National-level Skateboarding Championship. “This is important on many levels for the boys,” says Aine Edwards, an Irish national based in Mamallapuram, who put up a crowd-funding campaign to support their expenses for the trip. “If they win, they could get a Government job, go to university, show their parents who did not even want them to take up the sport, become heroes in the village...” That Mamallapuram is home to some of our country’s best surfing and skateboarding talent is no secret. “Boys here pick up the tricks of the sport from travellers who visit from across the world,” says Mukesh Panjanathan, a fisherman-turned surfing instructor, who runs Mumu Surf School at the fishing village. Mukesh has trained several fisher boys, providing them free boards to practice on. “Surfing and skateboarding have similar moves,” he points out. “Except that the latter is done on land instead of water.” He built a skateboarding ramp inside the fisherfolk settlement at Mamallapuram in 2015. “Surfers practise at the ramp when there are no waves to catch,” he says. The ramp has been a huge help for boys such as Sivaraj. Not that he needs it, though. Give him any surface, and he will glide across on his skateboard. “It is a little rough,” says Sivaraj about the road in his neighbourhood — the first surface he ever skated on. “The board tends to shake,” he admits. But that did not stop him from skating on it day and night. Mukesh says that this tournament is important to the boys who were “physically and mentally affected by Covid since they could not go fishing”. Says Aine, “Sport can change their destiny. These are the future leaders of Mahabs.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/a-dream-as-big-as-the-ocean/article37906393.ece
09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Wait for it...||One of the popular jokes delivered by Tamil stand-up comic Chockalingam SP (Chocku) involves a trip to Sri Lanka, and how the travelling time to get there is less than what you spend waiting at a busy Chennai traffic signal. There will be more such travel jokes in his comedy set titled Kutty Stories , happening this weekend in the city. Along with Ramkumar Natarajan, Chockalingam hopes to regale audiences with a set to jokes that will be an extension of their previous hit outing, titled Ram-Lingam. In this weekend’s show, the duo will not only crack IT-related jokes (both of them have an IT background). This time however, it is centred around travel and life experiences. “There is no theme to this show. It will be a collection of fun tales, as both of us are strong in storytelling,” says Chockalingam. Chockalingam got into the Tamil stand-up scene in 2016, after being inspired by popular stand-up comedian Praveen Kumar’s rise. “The years before the pandemic were a golden phase for Tamil stand-up comedy. With three popular clubs and an open-mic environment, the scene was thriving. Everyone was ready to do solo shows,” says Chockalingam, whose 2018 show Indha Ooru Enna Vilai ran to packed audiences in Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai and Pondicherry. But then, the pandemic threw life out of gear. Some comics adapted to the virtual format, but not all jokes make a lasting impression when delivered in front of a screen. “The essence of stand-up comedy lies in being live in front of an audience and eliciting their response.” Accompanying him will be Ramkumar Natarajan, whose recent videos on the Evam Standup Tamasha YouTube channel went viral among IT employees. In Kutty Stories , he will deliver a set on his experiences of living in a gated community comprising 350 families, apart from his experiences as a project manager in the IT sector... all of which were written during the pandemic. “I started trying my hand in stand-up more than two years ago,” recalls Ramkumar, “My first few outings bombed, but after a few attempts, I tried the same jokes with a few tweaks and presenting them in a different style. That connected with the audience. It was live performances and crowd applause that gave me the confidence to deliver more material.” With Kutty Stories , he — and fellow comedian Chocku — are hoping to experience that yet again.  Kutty Stories, presented by Chennai Art Theatre, will be staged at Medai, Alwarpet on December 12, 7pm. Tickets are on bookmyshow.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/wait-for-it/article37906408.ece
09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||On the road again||Out with the old and in with the new! Lucky Ali will be signing off 2021 with an all-India tour that will spill over into the new year. The Lucky Ali India Tour, which commences on December 12, will see the singer perform in Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Goa, after a hiatus. “Amongst my first releases for this tour will be my compilations with Michael McCleary who produced most of my early work. This album is a continuation of the work that we have done. The music has been in the making for a while now and we were just waiting for the right time to release it,” says Lucky Ali, talking about the upcoming event and the unnamed album. “Although it is fun to release a whole album, we now have the luxury of being able to release a single track, work on it, film it and later on compile it into an album. That makes more sense. If you’ve noticed, all our music follows a similar line of thought and these songs are no different.” Though only four cities are currently part of the tour, the organisers will be adding other cities to the event that will conclude by the end of February. According to the singer, fans can follow updates of his recent releases on his social media sites and he says his team is working on releasing their latest compilation as a vinyl. “My songs reflect a constant sense of self searching, and a love for travelling, they are about communication and relationships. Inspiration is something that happens when it does. When you are compiling an album, the songs stem from that perspective. You make it, break it, remake it. Basically, it is a work in progress. Even after a song is released, it is a work in progress because it has another life on stage.” Ali says the India Tour is so called not due to geographical confines alone — it caters specifically to an Indian audience. “The set up is unique to this particular tour and promises to be an audio-visual experience,” he says, adding that none of the current material will be heard at concerts abroad, at least for the time being. “The tour will be an audio-visual journey that will take the audience through time, as it will focus on the journey of music and the way each song is performed. Each section has a mood and accompanying visuals, promising to make it an immersive experience.” “Apart from being an extraordinary challenge, we also get to enjoy the audience being a very big part of the entire experience. They sing our songs with us, they interact and communicate with us. India may have seen plenty of audio-visual events, but for our set, it is going to be different affair,” admits the singer candidly, adding, “Normally, we would just get together and jam, but this time round there would be a little more discipline to the playing.”  Tickets to the Lucky Ali India Tour are available on insider.in.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/on-the-road-again/article37906357.ece

The film, directed by Rahul Sankrityan, features this melody to trace the romance between the characters essayed by actors Nani and Sai Pallavi. Recently, Rahul and Nani released a video detailing how the lyricist worked on the song despite his health constraints. Rahul stated in the video, “On November 3, “Sirivennela’ garu informed me that he could not complete the song because of his health condition. However, we requested him to write. I was woken up by his call the very next morning, on Deepavali, and he asked me to write down the ‘pallavi’. One line had his name Sirivennela. When asked, he laughed and said that this might be his last song. The irony is that his last rites were performed on the day the song was recorded.” ‘Sirivennela’ has been composed by Mickey J Meyer and sung by Anurag Kulkarni. The film will also feature another song penned by the late lyricist.  Shyam Singha Roy also stars Krithi Shetty, Madonna Sebastian, Rahul Ravindran, Murali Sharma and Leela Samson.

09 December 2021||December 09 2021 00:00 IST,||Get up, fight back||Lights, camera… and wrestle. After decades of watching WWE icons like The Undertaker, Triple H and others on television, there I was, at the stunning Barclays Center in Brooklyn, NY, ready to witness the 2021 Survivor Series! WWE’s tie-in with Netflix’s recent Red Notice sparked excited rumours of The Rock, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds being in attendance. Though this sadly didn’t come to fruition, several other celebrities and movie stars were among the spectators, the most popular of them being HBO’s Succession ’s Kieran Culkin — he really is the most riveting thing on TV these days — who waved to fans from the Jumbotron’s big screen. A crowd of nearly 16,000 — most of them unmasked — engulfed the sprawling arena, under a psychedelic spectacle of lights, bangs and fireworks. This was exhilarating and terrifying all at once, as my double-masked self from India tried to come to terms with the new.. old normal (?) in another country. Those seated around me even found my levels of paranoia funny, especially when I politely — and wistfully — turned down beer and appetisers, unwilling to lower my N95 (I did manage to pick up a shawarma — how could I not? — from a downtown food truck later on in the freezing New York night).

Curated by Chef Johnson Ebenezer, the festive menu is part of an immersive dining experience launched in mid-2019 when he co-founded Lore, an outfit that tells stories with food. He was unaware then that he would be doing mainly sit-down dining and silver service for the next couple of years, after the pandemic altered dinner parties and gatherings through 2020 and 2021. Last year, when travel came to a standstill, Lore offered a communal dining based on the theme — Around the world in 80 days. Menus were printed as boarding passes of each aerodrome. The format limits itself to a range of 16 to 24 diners, says Johnson, who organised the event along with his business partners — Chef Mythrayie Iyer and Chef Avinash Vishaal. “The sit-down layout gives people ample time and closeness to have long and slow conversations,” adds Johnson. With small groups, it is possible to create multi-course degustation menus that immerse guests in a dining experience for two to three hours. In Hyderabad, Lore hosted Omnisense, offering a menu that was crafted around the five senses. In Bengaluru, their seven-course dinner based on ‘birth to rebirth’ was customised for individual groups and held at different locations. Earlier in September, Mumbai -based experimental chef Prateek Sadhu celebrated his fine dining, ingredient-driven restaurant, Masque, turning five with a five-city tour. This included pop-up dinners in Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Chennai and Ladakh. Set in the middle of an idyllic apricot orchard, the Ladakh dinner was particularly unique because the menu was almost entirely planned around foraged and local ingredients. Noticing a definite uptick in private dining requests since pandemic restrictions eased, Sadhu says, “A meal like this means someone is setting aside the time to invest in an experience. They’re committing themselves to you for two to three hours, and leaving themselves at your mercy and that’s a responsibility we don’t take lightly. We discuss every aspect of the tableware and service style before launching a new menu, because everything surrounding the food is what also builds the experience.” Chef Vikramjit Roy, who set up Hello Panda, a gourmet pan-Asian delivery service in June 2020, has been organising sit-down dinners during the pandemic for couples, and bigger groups of 50 to 60 people. He believes that the pandemic brought the sophisticated sit-down dining experience from the outside to people’s homes. “These clients are well-travelled and know their food. During the pandemic, they missed the fine dining experience and hence wished to bring it home,” he says. Vikram says the challenge of setting up the experience at home is “immense”. “We operate in professional kitchens as chefs, with precise equipment. The menu at sit-downs is not a bowl meal, but one where every element stands out. All this requires sophisticated equipment and most home kitchens have basic cooking appliances,” says Vikram, adding that his team carries a full range of cooking ware, including dehydrators, sous-vide machines and blenders to the location. According to Vikram, food is only 30% of the experience. The rest lies in service, tableware and styling. “The server, who originated from the butler of yore, is very knowledgable about the food that is served. He should have the ability to interact with guests in an easy way, explaining the nuances of the meal,” says Vikram, who has done elaborate multi-course events across India, from the metro cities to Tier-II cities like Ludhiana and Lonavala. In Kochi, Sareeka John and Payal Bafna founded Guestronomy, a bespoke dining venture, in 2019. In 2022, they are set to take it forward with The Grape Escapade: 30 dinners over a four-day event at six wineries in Nashik from January 26. “The health crisis slowed us down and reconnected us to our old modes of functioning,” says Sareeka, adding, “Earlier meal times were elaborate. We are now looking for such intimate experiences that infuse closeness and a bonding that had gone missing. I believe there is a market opening for this slow and stylish meal time after the pandemic.” As Sareeka works with hotels to curate bespoke dinners, she says that guests are just discovering this aspect, “that something interesting, thoughtful and fun can be done away from the fixed dining formats that hotels offer.” Such experiences can cost between Rs. 2,500 and Rs. 10,000.  Call for innovation  Mayank Kulshreshtha, Executive Chef ITC Grand Chola, says chefs have introduced many innovations, like innovative plating, platter-to-plate silver service, and thali service. Seating arrangements like the round, V, block table and the E shape too are back in vogue. As examples of innovation, he talks about techniques like the slow infusion of ghee from a lit ghee candle placed on a dish or active charcoal smoking a dish as dramatic interventions. Though big hotel groups like ITC typically do not cater to home dinners, during the pandemic they did send teams of chef and steward to unravel and explain their menus to guests at home. Mayank sees a clear shift towards sit-down dining and believes that the trend is here to stay. “ It’s going to catch on more. People have got used to the pampering that the format offers.” Sit-down dining is also getting increasingly creative. Vikram recently catered a 10-course menu for a small group on a beach island off Mayabunder in the Andaman. “The island is very secluded and has no electricity. Dinner was in the glow of candlelight and we created a dreamy environment,” he says. He does not divulge the cost of the experience, except for saying, “it’s not cheap for sure”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/dinner-slows-down/article37906897.ece
