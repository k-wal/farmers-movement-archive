02 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Expert panel gives the go-ahead for Covishield||Covishield, the vaccine candidate from the Pune-based Serum Institute of India, was approved by a subject expert committee (SEC) of the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) late on Friday. Bharat Biotech has been asked to furnish more data demonstrating the efficacy of its candidate, Covaxin, an informed source confirmed to The Hindu.  The nod for Covishield came at the end of a marathon meeting of the SEC, which began in the morning and went on till late in the evening. The SEC gives its recommendation to the DCGI which is the approving authority for drugs and vaccines. “Covishield is likely to be practically available for use within the next week,” the source said. “Similar to that in the United Kingdom, we’ve approved the vaccine to be given in two doses 4-12 weeks apart.” Covishield, which is similar to the ‘Oxford vaccine’ developed by the Oxford University vaccine group and marketed by AstraZeneca, was approved by the health regulator in the U.K. under emergency use conditions on Wedneday. Under this, the company is allowed to deploy its vaccines to priority groups and then the larger public, even though a full safety assessment hasn’t been completed. For Covishield’s appraisal, the source said, the nod by the U.K. regulator and data from a Phase-2 trial on 100 volunteers in India, antibody levels generated in the volunteers in response to the vaccine, and safety data from the Phase-1 studies were relied on.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covishield-gets-nod-from-vaccine-panel/article33476758.ece
02 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farmers threaten to step up protest||Farmer groups on Friday said they would intensify their protest if the Centre did not take a firm decision on the repeal of the three farm laws during the next round of talks on Monday. Speaking to mediapersons after an internal meeting on Friday, Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leaders threatened to shut down malls and petrol pumps in Haryana, hold a tractor rally on the Kundli-Manesar Highway, and march further towards Delhi on the highway from Jaipur unless their demands were met. Tens of thousands of farmers have been protesting on the borders of Delhi for 37 days in a row. After six rounds of talks with the Centre, they have reached in-principle agreements on issues related to stubble burning and power subsidies, but are deadlocked on the major demands to repeal the three laws and provide a legal backing for the procurement of crops at minimum support prices. ‘Govt. taking us lightly’ “The government seems to be taking the farmers’ protest lightly. In Shaheen Bagh, they were able to disperse the protesters, so they think they can do the same thing with us. But that will not happen,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union-Tikait group general secretary Yudhvir Singh. “If the government does not take a decision on January 4, then the farmers will have to take a decision,” he added. Bhartiya Kisan Sangharsh Samiti leader Vikas Sisar said the protesters would announce the dates to shut down malls, petrol pumps and toll plazas in Haryana if the deadlock continued. He added that the leaders of the BJP and its ally, the Jannayak Janata Party, would face continuous protests in the State. This is part of the SKM’s strategy to target the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) members and pressure them to quit the alliance and sever ties with the BJP in support of the farmers, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/farmers-threaten-to-step-up-protest/article33476760.ece
02 January 2021||Bengaluru,||School, PU students get a memorable welcome as classes begin in Karnataka||There was a festive atmosphere on campuses across the State on Friday as schools and colleges reopened after nine and a half months to students of Class X and second pre-university on the first day of the new year. Teachers welcomed students with flowers, sweets and a traditional aarthi and expressed hope for a safer 2021. Many school managements organised for loudspeakers and drums to welcome students. Vidyagama classes, too, commenced for high school students from classes VI to IX on Friday. At a press conference later in the day, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar said that 41% of the 9.27 lakh Class X students from 16,850 high schools in Karnataka that follow the State syllabus attended classes on day one. However, attendance of II PU students was lower: 32% of the total 2.41 lakh such students across 5,492 colleges returned to the campuses. Private school managements, however, said the attendance was far higher on Friday but was not reflected in the data as they were unable to upload the information on the software. The first period across all schools and PU colleges was dedicated to educating students on the precautionary measures that need to be taken in light of COVID-19. More girls in class Mr. Suresh Kumar said that for the most part, more girls attended classes than boys. “Girl students said that they were happy to be back in school as they had spent a large chunk of their time over the past nine months doing household chores.” The Minister added that they expected the attendance to improve from Monday. “Many students probably celebrated the new year last night and may not have been able to come to school,” he added. Two schools in Udupi district did not open as some of the teachers tested positive for COVID-19. The department also received reports of two schools in Chickballapur and Hassan districts allegedly violating SOPs, and has sought a report. District-level teams will inspect schools to ensure they are following the SOPs, while mentors have been appointed in all schools to keep tabs on the mental and physical health of students.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/school-pu-students-get-a-memorable-welcome-as-classes-begin-in-karnataka/article33477058.ece

Now, writing will be restricted to classrooms,” he said with a smile.  Challenging task Science and English teacher at Government HPS, Nelyadi, Vimal Kumar, said that teachers would find it challenging to bring back students to the classroom environment. “It is a gradual process and we are ready to take up the challenge,” he added.

02 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||GST collections touch an all-time high in December||Gross revenues from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) hit a record high in December 2020, with collections of Rs. 1,15,174 crore, 12% higher than a year ago and 9.7% greater than the previous month’s inflows. December marks the fourth month in a row that GST collections have grown year-on-year, after revenues collapsed in the first quarter of 2020-21 amid the COVID-19 lockdown. The 12% year-on-year growth recorded in December was the highest in 21 months. The government said the highest monthly GST kitty since the introduction of the indirect tax in 2017, was a reflection of a rapid economic recovery under way. It also attributed part of the gains to better compliance following an official crackdown on malpractices to weed out taxpayers evading GST or using fake bills to defraud the exchequer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gst-mop-up-hits-record-high-in-dec/article33476762.ece

The party said it was just a game of political ‘arm-wrestling’ between the two coalition partners of the ruling MVA government. BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said the Sena typically kicked up the emotive ‘Sambhajinagar’ issue just before local elections, only to jettison its soon afterwards. “It hardly matters if the Congress opposes or supports it. The Sena conveniently raises it before any election, and then just as conveniently sets it aside,” Mr. Fadnavis said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/second-nearby/article33477555.ece

02 January 2021||CHANDIGARH,||In Punjab, stir reaches BJP leaders’ doorsteps||Protesting against the Centre’s farm laws, several farmers associated with different unions picketed residences and commercial premises of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in Punjab on Friday. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said attempts by some protesters to enter the homes of political leaders and workers in support of the farmers’ agitation went against the spirit of ‘Punjabiyat’ and could not be condoned. Condemning such behaviour, the Chief Minister appealed to the protesters not to cause any harassment or inconvenience to families of political functionaries of any party. “Invasion of privacy of people brings a bad name to the peaceful agitation of the farmers and defeat its very objective,” he said. After months of showing exemplary restraint and not indulging in any violence or lawlessness in Punjab, as well as at the borders of the national capital, some protesters were losing their restraint despite being asked by farmer leaders to keep the protests peaceful, Captain Singh said. The CM cautioned that attempts of forcible entry into the houses of political functionaries, or picketing of their homes, had the dangerous potential of vitiating the atmosphere of peace and destroying the harmony amongst people of diverse castes, religions, communities etc., a move that was contradictory to the Punjabi spirit of harmony and unity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-punjab-stir-reaches-bjp-leaders-doorsteps/article33476709.ece
02 January 2021||New Delhi,||PM unveils project for affordable housing||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday laid the foundation stone of six Light House Projects in six cities as part of the Global Housing Technology Challenge-India (GHTC-India) initiative. The aim of the programme is to build around 1,000 houses each in Indore (Madhya Pradesh), Rajkot (Gujarat), Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Ranchi (Jharkhand), Agartala (Tripura) and Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh) over a period of 12 months. Modern construction practices from countries such as France, Germany and Canada would be adopted. Addressing the Chief Ministers, Governors and other officials of the respective States via videoconference, Mr. Modi said the country was getting new technologies for providing resilient, affordable and comfortable housing for the poor and the middle class. The cooperation extended by the States in the projects was strengthening cooperative federalism, he said. The GHTC provided the scope for incubating new technologies for construction and innovation, he pointed out and called upon planners, architects and students to visit the project sites, learn from the technologies and mould them for use in accordance with the local requirements. Mr. Modi said in Indore, the light houses would be built using the prefabricated sandwich panel system technology, while in Rajkot, the monolithic concrete construction system from France using tunnels would be being employed. Precast concrete technology from the U.S. and Finland would be used for the construction of the houses in Chennai, while in Ranchi, a 3-D construction system from Germany would be used. Benefits for middle class Mr. Modi said the middle class was today getting benefited from the relaxation in the home loan interest rates. The new Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) also provided protection to them. A series of measures were also taken to promote the real estate sector. Taxes on affordable and regular houses had been reduced significantly to encourage buyers. He said another major initiative — the Central rental housing complex project — was conceived last year, with the objective of addressing the issues faced by migrant labourers. The project was being implemented in coordination with industrialists and other investors. The Prime Minister also gave away awards for excellence in the implementation of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-Urban). A total of 88 beneficiaries from across the country were felicitated. A compendium of 54 innovative housing construction technologies identified through GHTC-India was also released.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-unveils-project-for-affordable-housing/article33476756.ece
02 January 2021||New Delhi,||Virus variant cases in India rise to 29||Four more cases of the mutant strain of the COVID-19 virus were detected in the country on Friday, taking the total number of those affected by it to 29, the Union Health Ministry said on Friday. Of the four cases, three were found in Bengaluru, while one was detected in Hyderabad, said a senior Ministry official. So far, 10 cases have been detected by labs in Delhi, 10 by a Bengaluru lab, one in West Bengal, three in Hyderabad and five by the National Institute of Virology, Pune. “As per protocol, all the 29 patients have been kept in isolation at designated health facilities and are being monitored,” a Ministry official said. On Friday, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan reviewed the preparedness of the States and the Union Territories for a dry run on January 2 for the roll-out of a COVID-19 vaccine. Emphasising the importance of such an event that involves mass participation similar to elections, he said: “Let us attempt to implement it as a real exercise with attention to the minutest detail. Proper coordination will go a long way in building mutual understanding so that the upcoming vaccination drive may proceed without any glitch.” He requested every official to ensure that the vaccination sites and those in charge abided by the detailed checklist and standard operation procedures for vaccination that had been prepared by the Health Ministry and shared with the States and the Union Territories. Dr. Vardhan pressed the need for perfect calibration between the administrative and medical officers to make the event a primer that would later enable the mass implementation of a vaccination drive. Training on After training over 2,000 master trainers nationally, training was on at the State and district levels in over 700 districts. “The procedure is similar to conducting elections where the team at a booth is also trained,” he noted. Drawing from the Pulse Polio drive of 1994 in Delhi, he said as the exercise of vaccination was so integrally based on interaction and involvement of people, the relevant stakeholders, NGOs, civil society organisations and others need to be mobilised. He called for security arrangements at sites, cold chain points and during transportation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/virus-variant-cases-in-india-up-to-29/article33476716.ece
02 January 2021||New Delhi,||Cong. eyes action plan for Kerala Assembly polls||Jolted by the recent local body elections results in Kerala, Congress general secretary Tariq Anwar on Friday said the party would put in a 90-day action plan for the coming Assembly elections in the State. Polls in Kerala would be around April-May, along with Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam and Puducherry. And the Congress is hoping to wrest the State back from the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) as the State is known to alternate between the LDF and Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) every five years. However, the UDF came second to the LDF in the December local body polls, which is being seen as a precursor to the Assembly polls. “We have about 90 days for the Assembly elections and will put in place an action plan. I was in Kerala on December 27 and 28 to review the recent local body polls. From now on, I will be visiting the State every 10 days,” Mr. Anwar told The Hindu.  “In terms of vote share, we are behind the LDF by about 0.95 %. So, we will specifically target the mandals where we didn’t do well and see what changes we need to make,” he stated. Three regions The entire State had been divided into three regions and three secretaries from the All India Congress Committee (AICC) have been assigned one region each to take feedback from grass root workers, he said. Asked who would the Congress project as its leader to take on Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Mr. Anwar sidestepped by talking about “collective leadership”. While Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) is headed by Mullappally Ramachandran, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, former Chief Minister Ommen Chandy and former Lok Sabha member P.C. Chacko are also front runners for the top job. Political contradiction “We have many senior and experienced leaders,” he said, refusing to name anyone as a possible leader of the United Democratic Front. Mr. Anwar also answered about political contradiction of bitterly fighting the LDF in Kerala while aligning with the Left Front in West Bengal. “At the national level, the Congress and the Left have often fought together against communal forces. Political equations also differ from State to State. In Kerala, the BJP is not much of a force,” he explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-eyes-action-plan-for-kerala-assembly-polls/article33476695.ece
02 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Kerala international film fest in 4 phases at 4 venues||Forced by the COVID-19 pandemic situation, the Kerala State Chalachitra Academy has decided to organise the 25th edition of the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) in four phases in four regions of the State. The first phase will be held in Thiruvananthapuram from February 10 to 14, the second phase in Ernakulam from February 17 to 21, the third phase in Thalassery from February 23 to 27 and the fourth phase in Palakkad from March 1 to 5.

The organisers made it clear that Thiruvananthapuram will continue to be the permanent venue of the festival and this year’s would be a stop-gap arrangement. “Since the IFFK is a festival accredited by the International Federation of Film Producers Associations (FIAPF), it is stipulated that the festival should have a permanent venue. This arrangement is being allowed only considering the COVID-19 situation,” said an academy official. No public events The inauguration of the festival will be in Thiruvananthapuram, while the closing ceremony will be held in Palakkad. No public events or crowd-pulling cultural events will be organised. The maximum number of participants in the inaugural and closing events will be limited to 200.

02 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||India seeks action for attack on Pak. temple||India has expressed “serious concerns” over the demolition of the Karak Hindu Temple by a mob in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, and called upon the Imran Khan government to take “strict action” against those responsible, sources here said. In a written demarche to the Pakistan High Commission on Thursday, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said it expected the Pakistan government to share details of its investigation into the attack on the temple that was set on fire and demolished by a mob, allegedly instigated by a local cleric and activists of the Jamaat ulema e Islam (JuI-F), a radical party. “Our message reiterated that the Government of Pakistan is expected to look after the safety, security and well-being of its minority communities,” a source said, pointing to the fact that this is the second time since 1997 that the Karak temple had been demolished. Since the attack on the temple on Wednesday, Pakistan’s federal and provincial government, both led by Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party (PTI), have ordered the arrests of more than 30 people, alleged to be part of the mob of about 1,500 responsible for the attack. According to Pakistan’s Dawn News , those arrested, including the cleric and a JUI-F leader, have been booked under charges of “defiling a place of worship, hurting religious sentiments, robbery, hurt, arson, mischief and assault” as well as Pakistan’s Anti-Terrorism Act. The provincial Chief Minister said at a public event that he had issued orders for the reconstruction of the temple, news agencyPTIreported. Meanwhile, after an appeal by Pakistani lawmaker and chief of Pakistan’s Hindu Council Ramesh Vankwani, Pakistan’s Supreme Court said it was a matter of “grave concern”, and ordered authorities to submit a report by January 4 and for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa officials to appear before the court the next day. Mr. Vankwani said that while expressing concerns about human rights issues and minority rights in Pakistan, India, too, should be open to similar concerns raised by Pakistan. He specifically mentioned an attack on a mosque in Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday. Despite ongoing tensions over the temple attack and increasing ceasefire violations at the Line of Control, India and Pakistan continued traditional exchanges of information on New Year’s Day according to previously signed agreements. Both countries exchanged lists of nuclear installation and facilities and others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-seeks-action-for-attack-on-pak-temple/article33476704.ece
02 January 2021||New Delhi,||In 2020, RS saw lowest number of sittings ever||With the government refusing to call the winter session of Parliament, the Rajya Sabha sat for just 33 days in 2020, its lowest-ever tally of sittings in a year. There are only three other occasions when the sittings were below 50 days in a year. The Budget and the monsoon sessions had to be cut short due to COVID-19. The Budget session, which was scheduled to have 31 sittings, was brought to a close after 23 sessions. Similarly, the monsoon session, which was to have 18 sittings, amid strict restrictions, could manage to have only 10 as the number of COVID-19 positive cases among parliamentarians and the supporting staff started spiralling. There are only three other occasions when the Rajya Sabha met for fewer than 50 sittings in a year — 48 in 1999 and 46 each in 2004 and 2008. The BJP, the single largest party in the Upper House, now has 93 members. The House is no longer the stumbling block that it was during the first term of the Narendra Modi government. The last time the winter session was cancelled was 36 years ago in 1984. In overall parliamentary history, there have been only two other instances in 1979 and 1975 when the winter session was cancelled. ‘Productivity not hit’ As per an analysis by the Rajya Sabha secretariat, the limited number of sittings did not hurt the productivity. “During the year 2020, the annual productivity has been 82.7%, the highest annual productivity during the last 11 years,” a senior Rajya Sabha official said. A total of 39 Bills have been passed by the House during 2020, including 12 during the Budget session and 27 during the monsoon session. The list of legislation includes the three controversial farm laws, which the Opposition parties claimed were bulldozed through without any credible discussion. Year 2020 also saw an unprecedented suspension of eight Opposition MPs and the Opposition moving a notice for the removal of Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-2020-rs-saw-lowest-number-of-sittings-ever/article33476706.ece
02 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Protesting, making Lohri plans in biting cold||At the Singhu border, farmers remain undeterred even as the temperatures drop, with many who have been protesting at the site for over a month re-asserting that they are ready for the long haul and are even prepared to spend Lohri at the border itself with the “extended family”. Though Lohri is an important festival for many farmers, those camping at the capital’s borders said that “fighting for their rights” was the need of the hour. Sukhwinder Singh, a farmer from Jalandhar district, said, “In the past month, I have visited my wife and daughters just twice. Even the New Year has now started with us sitting in the same place where we were a month ago. If the Prime Minister does not accept our demands then we will celebrate here, at the border itself,” Mr. Singh said. “All these people over here are our brothers. So why not celebrate with this new family that we have made out here?” Another farmer, Manjeet Singh added, “We trust god, and definitely much more than we trust the PM. We have enough reinforcements to last us a year if need be. So we are in no rush. Whenever he [the PM] agrees to our demands, we’ll leave.” While there is “sadness” among the farmers, one will not find “despair”, said Kulwinder Singh, a farmer from Rupnagar district in Punjab. Kesar Singh from Fatehgarh Sahib added, “We are not moving from here unless the black laws are removed ... Now that a festival is also around the corner, we will see what to do. Either spend it apart from family members or maybe ask them to join us over here. But there’s no going back.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/protesting-making-lohri-plans-in-biting-cold/article33476711.ece
02 January 2021||Pune,||Teach Bhima-Koregaon battle: Athawale||The 1818 battle of Bhima-Koregaon, one of the last battles of the Third Anglo-Maratha War which culminated in the Peshwa’s defeat, should be included in the history textbooks, Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Ramdas Athawale said on Friday. “The history of the Bhima-Koregaon battle should be taught in schools. I will be writing a letter to the Education Ministry in this regard,” said Mr. Athawale, who is the president of the Republican Party of India (A). Mr. Athawale visited the battle’s victory obelisk, or ranstambh , at Perne near Koregaon-Bhima village and offered tributes. The victory memorial is dedicated to the battle of January 1, 1818, in which 500 soldiers of the Mahar community fought alongside the English to defeat the numerically superior army of Peshwa Bajirao II. However, it was Babasaheb Ambedkar’s visit to the site on January 1, 1927, that revitalised the memory of the battle for the Dalit community, leading to its commemoration in the form of a victory pillar, besides creating the discourse of Dalit valour against Peshwai “oppression”. COVID-19 restrictions by the Pune district administration including the imposition of Section 144 of the Cr.PC saw a relatively low turnout on the occasion as opposed to the lakhs of pilgrims who visit the memorial site every year. Only senior political leaders and prominent Ambedkarite community representatives across Maharashtra, including Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) chief Prakash Ambedkar and Ministers Anil Deshmukh and Nitin Raut, paid tributes at the obelisk. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Athawale said that for atrocities against the Dalit community in the country to stop, there must be unity among different castes at the village level and that the Dalit-upper caste divide must end for the country to make tangible social progress. Meanwhile, Prakash Ambedkar, grandson of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, said January 1 was a day to rid oneself of the burden of “social bondage”. “In this context, the Bhima-Koregaon battle was part of a fight against the anti-Dalit policies being followed during the Peshwa rule,” he said. Criticising the Centre and the State governments, Mr. Ambedkar said they had no plan to revitalise the economy ravaged by the pandemic. 2018 clashes The bicentenary celebrations of the battle in 2018 were marred by clashes which heightened social tensions across Maharashtra. Since then, there have been two investigations into the incident. The Pune rural police have lodged an FIR against right-wing Hindutva leaders Sambhaji Bhide ‘Guruji’ and Milind Ekbote, for orchestrating the violence. However, the Pune city police and central agencies such as the NIA have conducted crackdowns across the country and arrested a number of lawyers, writers, intellectuals and activists including advocate Surendra Gadling, professor Shoma Sen, Gautam Navlakha, poet P. Varavara Rao, Father Stan Swamy and Sudha Bharadwaj among others for their alleged links with proscribed Maoist outfits and for their roles in the 2017 “Elgaar Parishad” and the subsequent Bhima-Koregaon clashes. Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the ruling MVA government would probe the roles of Bhide and Ekbote. He further said the State government was looking into the matter of the withdrawal of security for retired Bombay High Court Judge B.G. Kolse-Patil, one of the organisers of the contentious ‘Elgaar Parishad’ on December 31, 2017.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/include-bhima-koregaon-in-textbooks/article33476729.ece
02 January 2021||CHENNAI,||MDMK will not contest on DMK’s symbol, says Vaiko||MDMK general secretary Vaiko on Friday said his party candidates would contest on their own symbol and not on the DMK’s ‘Rising Sun’ symbol in this year's Assembly elections. He also clarified that there was no pressure or demand from the DMK to contest on the party’s symbol. In the 2019 Parliamentary elections, the MDMK candidate was elected on the 'Rising Sun' symbol. Talking to reporters during his annual New Year interaction, Mr. Vaiko said spiritual politics could not emerge as an alternative to Dravidian politics since actor Rajinikanth, the proponent of the idea, had decided against launching a political party. “There is no person other than Mr. Rajinikanth to propagate the idea. Communal forces will try to occupy a space in Tamil Nadu politics. But they will not succeed in their attempt,” said the MDMK leader. He felt that the actor was under no compulsion to give up his plans to launch a political party. “He is capable of taking his own decision,” said Mr. Vaiko who had spoken to the actor when he was being treated in a Hyderabad hospital last month. Asked who would be benefited from Mr. Rajinikanth’s decision to opt out of a political entry, Mr. Vaiko said even if the actor had entered politics he would not have affected the prospects of the DMK. “The DMK front will secure an absolute majority by winning more than 200 seats in the Assembly elections,” he said. Recalling the impact made by Mr. Rajinikanth’s support to the DMK-TMC combine in 1996, Mr. Vaiko said the MDMK was severely affected by the actor’s message against the AIADMK government and its Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. The DMK had then put up posters saying that every candidate of the party had the support of Mr. Rajinikanth. “But in the coming elections he will not express his opinion in favour of anyone,” he said. Mr. Vaiko said he could not comment on expelled DMK leader M.K. Alagiri’s plans to meet his supporters in Madurai on January 3, contending that without knowing what he had planned to do it was impossible to comment. He recalled that he stopped criticising former Chief Minister M G Ramachandran after meeting LTTE leader Prabhakaran (whom the AIADMK founder had helped). Mr. Vaiko said Tamil Nadu Governor should take a decision on the resolution adopted in the State Assembly in favour of releasing all the seven persons convicted in the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assasinataion case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mdmk-will-not-contest-on-dmks-symbol-vaiko/article33476833.ece
02 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Ayurvedic institute, CCMB ink agreement||CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) has entered into an agreement with Arya Vaidya Sala (AVS), Kottakkal, to check for the efficacy of Ayurvedic formulations in the fight against COVID-19 on Friday. AVS is a 118-year-old charitable institution headquartered at Kottakkal in Kerala and has been engaged in practice and propagation of Ayurveda manufacturing more than 500 formulations. In this partnership, AVS will provide standardised Ayurveda formulations, the CCMB will test them on the lab-grown coronavirus strains in cell culture system, and check for their anti-viral efficacy. “If it yields tangible results, the project will lead to major progress in pharmaceutical industry in India. While the country possesses a lot of ancient wisdom, it has lacked defined regulatory protocols for testing the efficacy of formulations that are based on the ancient texts. In the ongoing fight against the coronavirus, it has become imperative to rigorously test the different treatment possibilities before they are used by the public,” informed CCMB director Rakesh Mishra. The CCMB has established an efficacy testing facility for drugs and devices by using the lab-grown coronavirus and this can be used for testing the anti-viral efficacy of Ayurvedic formulations too, he said. “AVS is joining hands with CCMB with the clear objective of attempting to validate classical knowledge of Ayurveda with the aid of modern science,” said senior scientist C.T. Sulaiman. Therapeutic support The AVS was hopeful that findings of this study will yield useful therapeutic support in the current situation.

02 January 2021||Kozhikode,||Wild elephant rescued from well||A Kerala Forest Department squad on Friday rescued a wild elephant that fell into a deep well at Muthappanpuzha, near Anakkampoyil, in the eastern hill areas of Kozhikode district. A patrol team had spotted the animal in the well two days ago. Forest officials from the Thamarassery range office said the elephant did not sustain any major injuries in the fall. The team could complete the rescue operation by 8 p.m. on Friday, they said. As the accident spot was in a hillock in a remote area, it took a long time for the rescue team to reach the spot with the required accessories and rescue vehicle. An earth-mover was taken to the site to speed up the rescue operation. Despite the challenges, the team could flatten the well in six hours, the officials said. A flying squad and a rapid response team were also present at the spot to coordinate the rescue operations under the Kozhikode Divisional Forest Officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/wild-elephant-rescued-from-well/article33476680.ece
02 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Schools open in Karnataka, Kerala for Classes 10, 12||It was in May 2020 that schools in Kerala witnessed a flurry of activity in connection with the conduct of the pending board examinations in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Seven months later, that experience came in handy as they welcomed students of Classes 10 and 12 for the first time ever this academic year, on New Year Day. Government and aided schools opened their portals to restricted number of students for limited hours on Friday while adhering to the COVID-19 protocol. Masks, sanitisers, thermal scanners were kept ready and classrooms where students would need to sit clearly listed and marked to avoid confusion. Disinfection of school premises and classrooms, including furniture, had been completed by Thursday. Classes were held in two shifts — morning and afternoon. Schools had prepared their own detailed plans for the partial reopening. The number of students who would attend school on a single day was decided on the basis of the General Education Department’s guidelines and the facilities in a school. Festive atmosphere In Karnataka, there was a festive atmosphere on campuses across the State on Friday as schools and pre-university colleges reopened after nine and a half months to students of Class 10 and second pre-university on the first day of the new year. Teachers welcomed students with flowers, sweets and a traditional aarthi.  Many school managements organised for loudspeakers and drums to welcome students. Vidyagama classes too commenced for high school students from Classes VI to IX on Friday. Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar said 41% of the 9.27 lakh Class X students from 16,850 high schools that follow the State syllabus attended classes on day one. However, attendance of II PU students was lower: 32% of the total 2.41 lakh students across 5,492 colleges returned to the campuses.

02 January 2021||Kolkata,||Amartya Sen again refutes Visva-Bharati V-C’s call claim||The controversy over whether or not Nobel laureate Amartya Sen made a phone call to Visva-Bharati Vice-Chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty, requesting him not to evict hawkers from outside his ancestral home in Santiniketan, refuses to die down. In a fresh e-mail, sent to Visva-Bharati University Faculty Association (VBUFA) president Sudipta Bhattacharyya and seen by The Hindu , Professor Sen once again strongly dismissed the repeated claim made by Mr. Chakrabarty, that he had indeed received such a call from the celebrated economist. The controversy began last month when Mr. Chakrabarty, during a virtual meeting with faculty members, claimed that he had received a call from Professor Sen, who had introduced himself as “Bharat Ratna Amartya Sen” and requested that hawkers outside his home not be removed because his daughter, who visited Santiniketan periodically, would be inconvenienced. Following this, the VBUFA president had written to Professor Sen, asking him whether he had indeed spoken to the V-C over the phone. The Nobel laureate, in his reply, denied making any call or request, leave alone introducing himself as “Bharat Ratna”. Subsequently, the university spokesman, in a statement to the media, insisted that Professor Sen had indeed called up the V-C from a local number and complained to him about the removal of hawkers. According to the spokesman, the conversation took place in June 2019, when the V-C was returning to Santiniketan from the Kolkata airport after attending a meeting in Delhi. The VBUFA president then e-mailed Professor Sen once again, asking him whether he was in India in June 2019. To this email, the Nobel laureate replied last Tuesday: “I was not in India at all in June 2019... On your other question, I have talked with the present V-C of Visva-Bharati only once, to the best of my knowledge. This was a few years ago when he was chairing a meeting for the release of a book by Pranab Bardhan. His claim that we have talked on the phone and I introduced myself as Bharat Ratna is tantalisingly untrue.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/amartya-sen-again-refutes-visva-bharati-v-cs-call-claim/article33476714.ece
02 January 2021||New Delhi,||Rana extradition hearing put off again||The extradition hearing of Tahawwur Rana, key accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack, has been postponed by a U.S. court. The hearing has now been pushed to April 22. The earlier dates fixed were January 8 and then February 21. An order by U.S. magistrate judge Jacqueline Chooljian said, “The extradition hearing in this case is continued to April 22, 2021, at 1:30 p.m.; Relator Tahawwur Hussain Rana shall file his opposition to the request for extradition by not later than February 1, 2021; and the United States shall file its reply memorandum in support of the extradition request by not later than March 22, 2021.” In accordance with the provisions of the extradition treaty between India and the U.S., India first submitted a diplomatic note formally requesting Rana’s extradition on December 4, 2019. Rana is wanted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the 2008 terror attack case that claimed 166 lives including six Americans. Sentence commuted He was released from prison in June last year after an Illinois court commuted his jail sentence (scheduled to get over in September 2021) after he tested positive for COVID-19. Following his release, he was provisionally arrested by the federal police in the wake of the pending extradition request from India and is currently lodged in a Los Angles prison. Rana has moved more than one application in the U.S. court seeking bail on grounds of health and challenged his extradition to India. The various applications filed by Rana have stalled the hearing of the extradition proceedings. Unlike his school friend and prime accused David Coleman Headley, Rana did not enter into a plea bargain with the U.S. authorities that would have barred his extradition to India. The Pakistani-Canadian citizen, who was arrested in 2009, was convicted by a U.S. court in 2013 for providing material support to the Pakistan based terror outfot- Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ranas-extradition-hearing-delayed/article33476723.ece
02 January 2021||Srinagar,||Soldier killed in Pakistan firing in Rajouri||A soldier was killed in ceasefire violation by Pakistan along the Line of Control (LoC) in Rajouri district of Jammu on Friday. In the Kashmir Valley, a worker of the The Resistance Front (TRF) was arrested and newly introduced Chinese grenades were recovered, the police said. An Army official said a soldier, identified as Naib Subedar Ravinder, was killed in firing by the Pakistan Army in the Nowshera area of Rajouri district. “Around 3.30 p.m., Pakistan initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing with small arms and shelling mortars along the LoC in Nowshera. Around 5.30 p.m., Pakistan again initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation. Our troops responded strongly to the enemy fire. However, one soldier was critically injured and later succumbed to his injuries,” the Army said. In the Valley, suspected militants tossed a grenade at a security force camp in the Chanapora area. “However, there were no reports of any casualty,” an official said. Meanwhile, a new variant of Chinese grenades were recovered from a worker of the TRF outfit in Baramulla district of north Kashmir. “The TRF worker was tasked with recruiting youth and killing a newly elected councillor. Three new types of Chinese grenades were also recovered,” the police said. Senior Superintendent of Police, Baramulla, Abdul Qayoom identified the arrested militant associate as Asif Gull. “Gull was on the police radar for the past six months after his involvement in a grenade attack in Baramulla in August,” Mr. Qayoom said. Gull was in touch with top militants in the valley and the handlers across the LoC, police said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/soldier-dies-in-pakistan-firing-in-rajouri/article33476719.ece
02 January 2021||Srinagar,||Shutdown in Valley over killing of 3 men||Parts of the Kashmir Valley observed a shutdown on Friday over the killing of three “militants” on December 30 and former Chief Minister and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti wrote a letter to Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor (LG) Manoj Sinha and demanded that the families of those killed “be allowed the burial as per their wishes”. Shops and private offices remained closed in the commercial hubs of Srinagar’s Lal Chowk and Nowhatta and south Kashmir’s Pulwama and Shopian. The shutdown comes days after the families of the three slain youth claimed “they were students and not militants”. Ms. Mufti’s letter said, “I urge you to intervene and ensure that these families get a chance to perform the last rites as per their wishes. Questions are also looming over this encounter and there are conflicting versions and reports from police and the Army. Justice can be served only if it is swift and I request you to initiate an impartial investigation into the matter.” She also called for a rethink of the ‘strategy’ of the government to not return bodies. “This callous decision will only exacerbate their sense of loss and pain. One hopes you rethink the decision and allow them to get closure...This decision is simply inhuman and unacceptable,” she said. National Conference (NC) Member of Parliament Hasnain Masoodi also raised the issue with the LG. “MP Masoodi spoke to the J&K L-G on Thursday and expressed his anguish over the reports surrounding Wednesday’s encounter. L-G Sinha assured an impartial enquiry into the matter,” party leader Omar Abdullah tweeted. Have evidence: police A police spokesman said the claims of the parents of slain Aijaz Maqbool Ganai that he had gone to a varsity to fill up a form “could not be verified”. “Contrary to the claims, the verified digital evidence revealed and corroborated that Aijaz and Ather, another militant, had gone to Srinagar’s Hyderpora and from there to the place of encounter,” the police said. The police said the third youth, Zubair, had gone first to Pulwama, then to Anantnag and then to Shopian before heading to the encounter site.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/shutdown-in-valley-over-killing-of-3-men/article33476720.ece
02 January 2021||CHENNAI,||AMMK striving to make its presence felt||The constitution of a high-level administrative committee by the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) is an indication that the party, which has been lying low, is striving to make its presence felt, according to a cross-section of office-bearers. On Thursday, the AMMK general secretary T.T.V. Dhinakaran announced the formation of the seven-member panel with former legislator from the Harur constituency of Dharmapuri district, R. Murugan, as the chief. The committee includes former Pollachi MP K. Sugumar and two former MLAs, R. Balasubramani and M. Kothandapani. The selection of Mr. Murugan, who belongs to the Adi-Dravidar community, assumes importance as the panel’s main functions include identification of right candidates at the time of elections and holding negotiations with prospective allies. Launched in March 2018, the AMMK, now a registered political party, contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election and Assembly by-polls virtually alone. At that time, the party did not get the ‘pressure cooker’ symbol, which was given to Mr. Dhinakaran, as an independent, during the 2017 by-election to the R.K. Nagar Assembly constituency, and proved lucky for him as he was elected from there. In 2019, the symbol assigned to the AMMK was ‘gift box’. The organisation netted 22.25 lakh votes in the Lok Sabha election with a vote share of 5.25% and around 3.19 lakh votes in 22 Assembly seats with 7.23% vote share. In the rural local body polls held in 27 districts in December 2019, the party bagged 62 panchayat union wards. AMMK functionaries, expressing happiness over the recent allotment of the ‘pressure cooker’ symbol by the Election Commission, assert that their party has formed committees at all levels almost everywhere, which have been “functioning”. Their claim is that the media has not given any attention to their functions. But “this does not mean that our party is inactive”, says an office-bearer. As for the Assembly election, the office-bearers hint that the party is receptive to the idea of having an alliance with others, even though it is for Mr. Dhinakaran and his aunt and mentor V.K. Sasikala to decide. One of the functionaries said the general secretary had indicated to him that the AMMK would be part of a “strong front”. The office-bearers are all waiting for the release of Sasikala, which is expected by the end of this month.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dhinakarans-ammk-striving-to-make-its-presence-felt/article33476830.ece

02 January 2021||SURYAPET,||22 of Telangana family test positive||The District Medical & Health Office in Suryapet on Friday confirmed that 22 members of a family in the town had tested positive for COVID-19. However, none of them has any symptoms and their condition is being monitored, while they are under home isolation, officials said. According to officials at the DM & HO, all the family members are residents of a gated community in the town. The suspicion of coronavirus infection in the family group arose after one relative, who has been a Tuberculosis patient, who had attended the funeral ceremony in Suryapet last week and later as part of his regular check-ups the COVID-19 diagnosis proved positive. The last rites were of a 70-year-old man, in which anti-COVID measures such as physical distance and masking was not followed. RT-PCR tests were carried out for 38 suspects, and results of 22 of them showed positive. According to DM & HO K. Harshavardhan, “There is no community transmission. None of them have a foreign travel history or anything such as a UK strain. The transmission is among family members only, from the last rites.” Following the diagnosis, which has put Suryapet on alert once again, officials have sanitised the township, and taken samples of the neighbours. They are also closely monitoring the situation. Officials said residents should not panic over the latest diagnosis. However, physical distancing, mask-wearing and good hygiene must continue as a preventive medicine, they added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/22-of-telangana-family-test-positive/article33477353.ece
02 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||India urges China to help stranded sailors||India on Friday urged China to provide “urgent” assistance to 39 crew members of the stranded cargo vessels m.v. Jag Anand and m.v. Anastasia . Both the ships have been stuck for months near the Jingtang and Caofeidian ports. The statement came soon after the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) took suo motu cognisance of the condition of the stranded sailors and asked the External Affairs Ministry “to ensure immediate relief” for the crew. A Ministry official said the men were in “increasingly difficult conditions” as Chinese rules did not permit change of crew because of the pandemic. “We have noted the statements of the Chinese side expressing their willingness to extend their assistance in this matter. We expect that this assistance will be provided in an urgent, practical and time-bound manner, given the grave humanitarian situation that is developing on board the ships,” said the official spokesperson of the External Affairs Ministry, Anurag Srivastava. The Indian comments came a day after Ji Rong, spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy here, said that Beijing had been in “close communication with Indian side and provided timely assistance and necessary supplies to Indian sailors”. Several months The exchanges began as m.v. Jag Anand with 23 Indian sailors has been stranded on anchorage near Jingtang port in Hebei province of China since last June 13; m.v. Anastasia with 16 Indian crew has been stuck on anchorage near Caofeidian port since September 20 of last year. The official said the Chinese authorities had conveyed to India that in view of various COVID-19-related restrictions imposed by the local authorities, the vessels were not being allowed change of crew.

02 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||It’s in Hindu nature to be patriotic: Bhagwat||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said on Friday that it was in the basic character and nature of a Hindu to be patriotic and that the love of motherland flowed from his or her dharma or spiritual and religious beliefs, something which, he said, even Mahatma Gandhi spoke of in his writings. Mr. Bhagwat was speaking at an event for the release of the book, Making of a Hindu Patriot: Background of Gandhiji’s Hind Swaraj , authored by J.K. Bajaj and M.D. Srinivas. Describing the book as an authentic scholarly research document on Gandhiji, Mr. Bhagwat said Gandhiji suggested that for him, his dharma and patriotism were not different as love for his motherland originated from his spirituality. “Gandhiji had said that his patriotism originates from his dharma,” Mr. Bhagwat said, asserting that dharma did not merely mean religion; it was wider than religion. “If someone is Hindu he has to be patriotic, that will be his or her basic character and nature. At times, you may have to awaken his or her patriotism, but a Hindu can never be anti-India. But we have to be conscious of the fact that if one loves his country, that doesn’t mean only the land, it means its people, rivers, culture, traditions and everything,” he said. Underlining that Hinduism believes in the existence of unity, he said, “Difference does not mean separatism and Gandhiji has suggested that Hinduism is the religion of all religions.” Releasing the book, Mr. Bhagwat said there was no need for speculation that the Sangh “is trying to appropriate Gandhiji ”. “That is not the case, no one can appropriate great personalities like him,” he said. Talking about Gandhiji ’s Swarajya, Mr. Bhagwat said by it he meant not only changing rulers or becoming self governed — for him [Gandhiji] the struggle for Swaraj was the reconstruction of society based on civilisational values.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/its-in-hindu-nature-to-be-patriotic-bhagwat/article33476701.ece
02 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Yediyurappa may push for Cabinet expansion||The State executive of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), to be held in Shivamogga over the weekend and to be attended by Arun Singh, party general secretary in-charge of Karnataka, is expected to again turn into a platform for Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to push for a Cabinet expansion/reshuffle. However, a resolution to the long-pending issue may not materialise during the two-day meet, party sources said. “Union Home Minister Amit Shah is scheduled to visit the State on January 15-16, on an official visit. Given that he will also be meeting party leaders in the State during his visit, the Chief Minister is unlikely to be given the green signal for the Cabinet exercise before this meeting,” a senior leader said. A section of the party believes that the Cabinet exercise is now intricately linked to the question of leadership in the State. “The high command is yet to take a call on the issue and only after that decision will the Cabinet issue be resolved,” a party strategist speculated. Meanwhile, Mr. Yediyurappa has politically asserted himself by saying that he “would complete the full term”. This came in the wake of statements made by dissident MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, who has been hinting at a leadership change. Mr. Yatnal has also demanded a legislature party meeting to discuss all issues threadbare. According to sources, Mr. Yediyurappa is upset over the party’s inaction against Mr. Yatnal. “Despite a series of statements undermining the Chief Minister, the party has not even served him a show-cause notice,” a close associate of Mr. Yediyurappa said. The Chief Minister’s camp is expected to lodge a complaint against Mr. Yatnal over his remarks, and the subject is likely to come up at the State core committee meeting to be held in Shivamogga as well, sources said. This is Mr. Arun Singh’s second visit to the State after taking over as the party’s Karnataka in-charge. During his previous visit, he was reportedly flooded with complaints from party old-timers about Mr. Yediyurappa’s style of functioning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/yediyurappa-may-push-for-cabinet-expansion/article33477002.ece

02 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Jacobite faction in Kerala launches protest||An indefinite stir by the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church demanding the Kerala government to frame a law to guarantee justice for the Jacobite faction of the Malankara Church began here on Friday. Metropolitan Trustee Joseph Mar Gregorios Metropolitan, who inaugurated the agitation in front of the Secretariat, said the court verdict had failed to resolve the feud between the Orthodox and Jacobite factions and legislation was the only solution. Churches in legal tangle The Jacobite Syrian Christian Church has temporarily lost possession of 52 churches, and more than 600 churches are entangled in court cases. It is the desire of society in general that the government should intervene to thrash out a solution, the Metropolitan said. Hoping for a solution, the Jacobite church was going ahead with the stir with prayers and in peace, he said. The indefinite stir is being led by the Metropolitans of the Church. Yuhanon Mar Militious Metropolitan presided over the inaugural function. Metropolitan Geevarghese Mar Coorilos, Thomas Alexandrios Metropolitan, convener of the Jacobite Movement for Justice, and other church leaders were present. CM’s stand The State government is optimistic of finding a solution to the feud between the two factions of the Malankara Church, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan indicated on Friday. The Kerala government, however, had not considered framing legislation in this regard, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said while replying to questions during his Friday evening briefing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jacobite-faction-launches-protest/article33476687.ece
02 January 2021||Kozhikode,||Uneasy truce among Cong. factions in State||An uneasy truce appears to have been reached among the warring factions of the State unit of the Congress after the categorical statement of All India Congress Committee general secretary in charge of Kerala Tariq Anwar that the Central leadership wanted the Oommen Chandy-Ramesh Chennithala binary to stay. The high command has refused to buy the argument that their tussle led to the poor show of the Congress-led United Democratic Front in the recent local body elections. Nevertheless, the Kerala Pradesh Congress Congress seems keen to take corrective action on the organisational structure before the Assembly polls due in April/May. For the time being, the dust may have settled in the party, but leaders from north Kerala, especially K. Muraleedharan and K. Sudhakaran, would have to bide their time until the appointment of a new Congress president and the Assembly polls. Both MPs lost no time to put the blame on the State leadership without naming the troika — KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and senior leader Oommen Chandy. On the face of it, it seemed like an unfruitful bargain though both are keen on KPCC president’s post. After AICC meet A clear picture on the electoral strategy of the party will emerge only after the AICC convenes its session in January. Unlike the previous elections, both factions will be compelled to get more of their own legislators in the Assembly as they know a defeat in the see-saw electoral battle between the UDF and Left Democratic Front would be disastrous for the Congress. Having lost in the semi-finals, the UDF may still have an opportunity to fight the polls and that too in direct contest with the LDF.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/uneasy-truce-among-cong-factions-in-state/article33476689.ece
02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Expert panel gives the go-ahead for Covishield||In the U.K., the vaccine has been recommended to be given in two doses 4-12 weeks apart. This, even though the vaccine’s performance was evaluated in volunteers who were given doses four weeks apart and there’s still no clarity on how long the protective effect of a single first dose lasts. The U.K. regulator allowed this after a spike in cases in recent weeks and decided to ensure that maximum people get at least one dose of a vaccine. SII officials have said India will have a stockpile of 100 million doses as of the first week of January but there is no clarity on how many of these will be available for Indians. A longer dosage interval means that potentially more Indians could get at least a single jab of the vaccine. Covishield is currently being tested in 1,600 volunteers as part of its Phase-2/3 trial. However the results from these trials haven’t been published or publicised in scientific journals. “The Phase-3 trial is ongoing and we will continuously keep reviewing the data,” the person added. “Other than the case from Chennai of a reported severe adverse event from the vaccine, no other safety events have been reported. We’ve also conclusively ruled out that the said reaction was directly linked to the vaccine.” The preliminary efficacy data from India seemed to suggest that it was “similar to” what was seen in the U.K. and Brazil which formed the bulk of the data set that the U.K. relied on to accord approval. Ministry yet to comment The Health Ministry was yet to comment on the approval accorded but a set of conditions under which the approval was accorded is likely to be spelt out on Saturday. This is the second time in three days that the committee has met to review applications for emergency use approval by SII, BB and Pfizer India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covishield-gets-nod-from-vaccine-panel/article33476691.ece

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||GST collections touch an all-time high in Dec.||It also attributed part of the gains to better compliance following an official crackdown on malpractices to weed out taxpayers evading GST or using fake bills to defraud the exchequer. “During the month, revenues from import of goods was 27% higher and the revenues from domestic transactions (including import of serviices) are 8% higher that the revenues from these sources during the same month last year,” the Department of Revenue in the Finance Ministry said in a statement on Friday. “This has been due to the combined effect of the rapid economic recovery post pandemic and the nation-wide drive against GST evaders and fake bills alongwith many systemic changes introduced recently, which have led to improved compliance,” the statement said. “This shows industry is bouncing back to normalcy,” said Chandrajit Banerjee, director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), pointing to the increase in revenue from import of goods as an indicator that the economy is on the ‘fast track of growth now after a long dip due to COVID lockdown’, Abhishek Jain, tax partner at EY, also said collections crossing 1.15 lakh crore for the first time despite the persistence of the pandemic, suggests a recovery in the economy, even though administrative changes to the system also helped. “Some of it could also be due to the plugging of GST revenue leakage by the government on account of fake credits through fradulent invoicing and introduction of e-invoicing,” he said. Among the States, Odisha recorded a 20% growth in GST revenues in December, followed by Rajasthan (16%), Andhra Pradesh (14%) and Gujarat (13%).

02 January 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Central forces sought for civic polls||Ahead of local body elections in Punjab that are due next month, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday urged the State Election Commission (SEC) to requisition paramilitary forces for the conduct of free and fair elections. In a letter to commissioner Jagpal Singh Sidhu of the SEC, former Minister and senior SAD leader Daljit Singh Cheema demanded that videography be conducted both inside the booth as well in the office of the returning officers to ward off attempts of booth-capturing and other malpractices. He also demanded that online filing of nominations be allowed and candidates be issued ‘no dues certificates’ on the basis of self-declarations pending verification.  A delegation of the Punjab BJP, led by party leader Anil Sarin, also met the Commissioner and demanded that civic elections be held under the watch of central police forces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/central-forces-sought-for-civic-polls/article33476707.ece
02 January 2021||CHENNAI,||Health Ministry plans communication strategy||As further steps are being cleared for the release of a COVID-19 vaccine in India, the Union Ministry of Health has come up with an elaborate communication strategy to counter issues arising out of vaccine hesitancy, and ‘eagerness’ among the people. Seeking to “disseminate timely, accurate and transparent information about the vaccine(s) to alleviate apprehensions”, the strategy, elaborated in a comprehensive document, is structured to guide national, State and district level communication channels. The idea is to make sure that the “information on the COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination process reaches all people, across all States in the country. The strategy also seeks to build trust and enable greater confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine amongst all people by employing transparency in communication, while also managing any mis/disinformation and rumours around it.” It hopes to take on the “challenging task of managing and mitigating any potential disappointment expressed by unmet demand for the vaccine or ‘eagerness’ amongst people.” The entire strategy will be implemented across three main platforms — influencers/celebrities, through community groups, and all forms of media from social media to hoardings and wall posters. A media rapid response cell at the Ministry will be tasked with media monitoring and social listening and responding real time, the document said. “The communication strategy is absolutely necessary at this point to inform people about the details. There is still a lot of vaccine hesitancy. In a survey we did recently among health care professionals, only 45% said they would take it as soon as it was made available,” says Abdul Ghafur, consultant, infectious diseases, Apollo Hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/health-ministry-plans-communication-strategy/article33476721.ece

Mr. Soumendu, who was the administrator of the Contai municipality till a few days ago, joined the BJP with a number of councillors of the civic body in Purba Medinipur district.

Addressing the agency officials via videoconferencing, Mr. Shukla paid condolences to the family members of the officials who lost their lives due to the pandemic. He emphasised the need for officials to keep themselves updated with the latest tools of investigation through sustained training. New and well innovated online training modules were now available as a fallout of the pandemic-induced restrictions. Mr. Shukla said efforts were made to fill up the existing vacancies, hold maximum Departmental Promotion Committee meetings, whereby a number of officials were promoted. The CBI had recently taken up a large number of high value bank fraud cases, which marked an emerging challenge before it. The agency registered about 190 cases of bank fraud in 2020, involving alleged misappropriation of close to Rs. 60,000 crore.

02 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Techies’ return to office unlikely anytime soon||The workforce of IT and ITES firms in Hyderabad is unlikely to return to office anytime soon as a survey by Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association (HYSEA) found that Work From Home (WFH) will continue, albeit to a lesser extent, well beyond 2021. A trend bound to impact other sectors and service providers dependent on the firms, WFH could well be here to stay as the survey, involving 62 member-companies, said none of the respondents spoke of 100% employees switching to work from office. One factor behind this could be the limited impact on productivity levels. “More than 63% companies reported above 90% productivity, compared to pre-pandemic levels. A few reported above 100% productivity,” the survey report said. What is likely to make return to office a complex, time consuming process is 25-50% employees working from their native places (outside Hyderabad). The number is high and it is anybody’s guess when and how many will relocate to Hyderabad, the release from HYSEA on Friday said. Return to office will thus be very gradual and will peak towards the end of 2021. It will never be 100%, it said. This despite work environment at home remaining the single largest factor impacting WFH. Power cuts and broadband limitations were other issues. On the work from office (WFO) plans, the survey said 60% of companies plan to have less than 20% of workforce operating from office by end of March. It might increase to 40% by June. By December 2021, WFO percentage for large and very large companies is likely to be 50-70%. Vaccination drive The IT/ITeS sector in Hyderabad is bracing for a prolonged process of employees’ return to office that might extend beyond 2021. The success of soon-to-be started vaccination drive was critical to return to office planning and therefore, the process is likely to gain momentum only in the latter half of 2021, the release said. For now, WFH percentage remains high. Nearly 75% of large (headcount of 1,000-5,000) and very large companies (over 5,000 employees) reported work from office to be 0-5%. Two models are preferred when return to office picks up pace — one in which only essential employees WFO and another Partial Week WFO. Some large Indian IT/ITeS companies, however, said client imperatives were driving them towards asking workforce to return to office. “Some of them have even said it could be made mandatory when the time comes. But GICs (Global Inhouse Centres) took a more expected approach of voluntary return to office,” the report said. In this backdrop, majority of the companies do not anticipate any increase in office space requirement post return to office. In the past nine months, 20% of large and very large companies terminated some office space, 6% terminated lease fully while 3% of the respondents said they leased some new space anticipating growth. “Only very few cases of stress and inclusivity issues were observed during the prolonged WFH. Many companies handled the situation well with proactive measures,” HYSEA said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/techies-return-to-office-unlikely-anytime-soon/article33477451.ece

02 January 2021||B. Tilak ChandarMadurai,TAMIL NADU||High Court quashes recruitment notification of university||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has quashed the notification issued by Bharathidasan University, Tiruchi, pertaining to the direct recruitment to the posts of Professor, Associate Professor and Assistant Professor that treated the entire University as one unit while applying the reservation policy. The court was hearing a batch of petitions that challenged the notification issued in 2019. The petitioners complained that instead of treating each department individually for applying the reservation policy, the entire University was taken as one unit which was not in consonance with the State government’s reservation policy. Taking cognisance of reports submitted in the case, Justice Krishnan Ramasamy observed that a mere perusal of the same would show that the Vice-Chancellor had sent a letter to the Higher Education Department in 2019 stating that the communal roster system taking each department in the University as one unit for the direct recruitment in teacher cadre will lead to create legal issues since an advertisement had already been issued and applications received from the candidates. Therefore, the University sought the support to proceed with the appointment with the already published advertisement, taking all departments as one unit. To avoid legal issues, the Bharathidasan University had requested the State Department to ratify its notification by considering the entire University as a single unit, as a special case, the judge observed. Takes serious note The judge also took serious note of the fact that Higher Education Secretary Apoorva permitted the University to proceed with the appointment of teaching posts by applying the University as one unit for reservation. By doing so she has completely ignored the reservation policy of the State as well as the law settled by the Supreme Court. “A member of all India service is expected to act in accordance with the Law, Rules and Regulations and established practices. The discretion conferred upon them cannot be abused or taken as a licence to do what they like or dislike. They are expected to act utmost professionalism of the highest degree and set a benchmark for their subordinates to follow”, the judge said. In the present case, the court is constrained to remark that no professional approach or proper application of mind is evidenced from the conduct of the Secretary as she had not adhered to or followed the conduct rules of All India Service. Therefore, the ability and suitability of her to hold the present position in the government required serious consideration, the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-quashes-recruitment-notification-of-university/article33477522.ece
02 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||City to get flood forecasting system by February 2022||Chennai and its suburbs will get real time flood forecasting system by February 2022. According to official sources, the forecasting system will cover waterbodies in 4,974 sq km of area in the limits of Greater Chennai Corporation and other local bodies. The consultant has submitted the hydrology report for six river basins in Chennai and its neighbouring districts. At a meeting of officials to discuss key aspects of the hydrology report, civic agencies have been asked to take efforts to integrate their own eco restoration projects with the flood forecasting system. At present, eco restoration projects in rivers such as the Cooum and the Adyar are under way. Cameras at 150 spots After the launch of the real time flood forecasting system, residents will get information about floods through the control centres in Ripon Buildings, Ezhilagam, district headquarters in Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu and Tiruvallur. The work on installation of infrastructure such as pole mounted cameras at 150 locations and real time data acquisition systems at 388 locations for rivers and lakes will be taken up this year. “Most of the infrastructure will be ready before this year’s northeast monsoon,” said an official. The consultant has proposed a new link between the Buckingham Canal and Eranavur to drain water during floods. Similarly, a new link between Buckingham Canal and the sea near Okkiyam Maduvu will be created this year for flood diversion, said the official.

02 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State can heave a sigh of relief this summer||Tamil Nadu is unlikely to face any major problem in water availability this summer, with a comfortable storage in reservoirs and irrigation tanks. This will assume added importance as the Assembly election is due in April-May, when drinking water shortage is normally felt in many parts of the State. The main reason cited for the present situation is the rainfall received in the last three months. Nine districts received excess rainfall, while 16 registered normal rainfall with positive departure. As against the expected 45 cm, the State registered 47 cm of rain. Though Cauvery water realisation during 2020-21 was not so high as it was in the previous year, the State got about 30 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) more than its due between June and December. Around 195 tmc ft was realised by the State on the inter-State border, as measured by the Central Water Commission. Around 30% of the irrigation tanks are full, compared with 23% a year ago. Likewise, the storage is 90% and above in around 41% of the tanks, while the figure for 2019 was around 36%.  20 tmc ft less The present combined storage of reservoirs is about 20 tmc ft less than what it was at the end of 2019. This was owing to the storage in the Mettur dam, which was around 91 tmc ft a year ago. The dam’s storage stood on Friday at about 71.8 tmc ft. Water managers expect that about 15 tmc ft more will have to be released in the next few weeks, and when the dam’s shutters are brought down, the storage is expected to be around 55 tmc ft. Likewise, another 15 tmc ft will have to be released from the Bhavanisagar dam for irrigation. In the southern districts, Papanasam and Manimuthar are having comfortable storage. The sore point is the storage of Vaigai, which has about 3.3 tmc ft against the capacity of 6.091 tmc ft. The water managers are confident of meeting Chennai city’s drinking water needs in the coming months as the storage in all the reservoirs is, on an average, around 90%. Until Friday, about 5.2 tmc ft of Krishna water was received by Tamil Nadu from Andhra Pradesh.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-can-heave-a-sigh-of-relief-this-summer/article33477416.ece

The project would include social amenities such as a ration shop, two anganwadi centres, a library, a milk booth and six shops, besides a sewage treatment plant and an electrical sub-station. In his speech, Mr. Palaniswami said, “This work will be completed within 15 months. This technology will ensure eco-friendly construction fit for diverse climatic quality standards and disaster-proof houses. These tenements will be allotted to the urban poor/slum families living on the banks of waterways and other unapproved areas in Chennai city...” He thanked the Prime Minister for selecting Tamil Nadu for the project. To overcome the difficulties faced by the urban slum families, the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had unveiled Tamil Nadu Vision-2023, which, he said, envisaged slum-free cities in the State by 2023. Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban), sanction has been accorded for building 1.62 lakh storeyed tenements and 3.42 lakh individual houses at a total cost of over Rs. 27,000 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pm-unveils-housing-project-for-city/article33477396.ece

02 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||MKU professor develops respirator that picks up atmospheric oxygen||An assistant professor of Physics at Madurai Kamaraj University says he has come up with a prototype of a unique respiratory mask that can pick up oxygen from the atmosphere for the wearer. T. Arockiadass says he has developed a ventilator-cum-respiratory mask that ensures more than 40% of atmospheric oxygen is available within the mask. Called LIDS-VR mask, it contains sensors to regulate the level of oxygen. “The present LIDS ventilator-cum-respirator (LIDS-VR) works by providing a high concentration of oxygen into the available air within the mask,” he said. “The atmosphere has 20.9% of oxygen. I have developed a nanomaterial that can absorb oxygen. It requires energy to release the oxygen for the wearer. For this, we use 1.5-cm-2-cm lipo 3.7 volt battery. The mask can be charged like a mobile phone,” he said. The mask weighs around 100 gm. The use of battery does not make it heavier. Mr. Arockiadass said the respirator could be used when a sick patient is waiting for ambulance or by festival shoppers at a heavily crowded mall. “An ambulance can take 5 to 10 minutes to arrive. A person who has difficulty in breathing can use it till then. This is particularly helpful for asthmatic persons. It can also be used in aeroplanes,” he said. When necessary, the respirator can double up as a ventilator. “Where more oxygen is needed we can attach a cartridge to supply oxygen externally,” Mr. Arockiadass said. He said he had used masks from the market and modified them to develop his respirator version. He is working with a company to transfer the technology.

02 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Ease norms in temples: devotees||Many devotees, who have been just filing past the main deity in temples for several months now, are seeking a relaxation in the standard operating procedures at places of worship. They want distribution of theertham ( holy water ) and archana to be restored. “Over 10 months have passed since I received the theertham at our temple. Devotees like me consider the theertham an important part of visiting the temple. Priests can stand at a distance and distribute this along the queue,” said K. Ramanujam, a resident of Triplicane. Akkarakkani Srinidhi, a scholar, said the theertham , also called as Thiruvaai Amudham , is believed to be nectar from the Lord’s body and is said to cleanse the body, the mind and the soul of those who consume it. M.K. Ramanan, a devotee from Tiruvottiyur, said the various rituals associated with temples help the devotee create a connect with the respective deities. “In many temples we are not able to visit all the sannidhis since they are outside this queue system. We need to be able to perform archanais in the name of relatives who are unwell or on their birthdays,” he said. When people fall sick, an abhishekam using dry amla soaked in water called Roga Naashakaari Dhaathri is prescribed in Saivaite temples, said an agama expert. “People give amla powder for this ritual,” he said. A former official of the HR&CE Department, which controls over 40,000 temples in the State, said performing archanais and distributing theertham were possible within the existing norms. “Temples have been doing these all along. Archanais can be allowed with devotees paying the amount in the temple and a token issued for the same,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ease-norms-in-temples-devotees/article33476808.ece

Besides the relatively favourable rainfall, the State realised a higher amount of Cauvery water than its share during the period between June and December. Around 195 tmc ft was realised on the inter-State border, as measured by the Central Water Commission. This was about 30 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) more than its due, though it was not so high as it was during the previous year. The present combined storage of reservoirs is about 20 tmc ft less than what it was at the end of 2019. This was due to the storage of the Mettur dam, which was around 91 tmc ft a year ago. But, on Friday, the dam’s storage was 71.8 tmc ft. Water managers expect that about 15 tmc ft more will have to be released in the next few weeks, and when the shutters are brought down, the storage is expected to be around 55 tmc ft. Likewise, another 15 tmc ft will have to be released from the Bhavanisagar dam for irrigation. In the southern districts, Papanasam and Manimuthar are having extremely comfortable storage. The only sore point is the Vaigai, which has about 3.3 tmc ft against the capacity of 6.091 tmc ft. Around 30% of the irrigation tanks are full, compared with 23% a year ago. Likewise, the storage of around 41% of the tanks is 90% and above, while the figure for 2019 was around 36%. The managers are confident that Chennai’s drinking water needs can be easily met in the coming months as the storage of all the reservoirs is, on an average, around 90%.  Around 30% of the irrigation tanks are full, compared with 23% a year ago||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-registered-around-47-cm-rainfall-during-oct-dec/article33476816.ece
02 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vaccination dry run to be held at 17 places||Tamil Nadu will conduct a dry run for the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out at 17 health facilities in Chennai, the Nilgiris, Tirunelveli, Poonamallee and Coimbatore on Saturday. Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar told reporters on Friday that vaccination was not an easy task and it required protective measures and precise planning. “We need to follow the guidelines issued by the Centre and the World Health Organization. This is a new virus [the novel coronavirus]. So, we need to carry out the administration of a new vaccine carefully. So, a trial run is required for proper planning,” he said. The plan is to vaccinate 25 persons in two hours. So far, 21,170 Health Department employees have been trained. “The Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation and the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine have taken up the work of creating infrastructure to preserve the vaccine for 2.5 crore persons in the first phase,” Mr. Vijayabaskar said. The objective of the dry run was to see that the process — starting with the identification of beneficiaries, the cold chain points from where the vaccine will be moved, vaccinators and vaccination sites — is conducted smoothly, according to health officials. “No vaccine will be administered in the dry run. The list of identified beneficiaries, vaccination sites, vaccinators, the cold chain points and persons who will coordinate the logistics is being uploaded on a separate portal. We will have 25 dummy beneficiaries who will visit the vaccination site during the dry run,” said T.S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine. The vaccination site will be like a polling booth. A staff member will check whether the name of a beneficiary is on the list and then allow him/her in. The second officer will match the person’s identity with the database on the portal. The next is the process of vaccination. Thereafter, the beneficiaries will get an update on the second dose. “For the first dose also, we would like to generate an SMS wherein the beneficiary will know in advance when, where and at what time he/she needs to come for vaccination. This will be synchronised with the movement of the vaccine from CCPs [cold chain points] at appropriate time/temperature and in doses as required for that site,” Dr. Selvavinayagam said. “At the end of the first dose, we want to schedule the second dose so that we can avoid crowds at the vaccine site. Every beneficiary will be asked to wait for 30 minutes to check for any adverse event. If there is an adverse event, how to manage it is part of the trial,” he explained. At every site, there will be a minimum of five staff members. Healthcare workers would first receive the vaccine once it is available. He said that of the estimated five lakh healthcare workers, 3.8 lakh beneficiaries had been identified in the State. So far, the Health Department has identified 50 district-level storage points. A total of 2,660 places have been identified as cold storage points with ice-lined refrigerators. It has identified 40,000-47,000 vaccination points. Dry run sites In Chennai, the dry run will be held at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and two Urban Primary Health Centres at Santhome and Ekkatuthangal. The Government Ooty Medical College Hospital; Coonoor Government Hospital; and the Nellakottai Primary Health Centre are the sites in The Nilgiris. In the Tirunelveli health unit district, it will be held at the Government Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital; the Urban Primary Health Centre at Samathanapuram; and the Reddiyarpatti Block Primary Health Centre. The Government Hospital at Poonamallee; and the Primary Health Centres at Nemam and Thirumazhisai are the sites in the Poonamallee health unit district. The dry run will be held at five places in the Coimbatore health unit district — the Government Medical College and ESI Hospital; the PSG Institute of Medical Sciences; the Government Hospital, Sulur; SLM Home Urban Primary Health Centre; and the Pooluvapatti Community Health Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vaccination-dry-run-to-be-held-at-17-places/article33476811.ece
02 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||For this ex-Railway employee, life began after retirement||The trouble with retirement is that you never get a day off, so goes a saying. And this holds true in the case of 77-year-old N. Subramanian. It seems as if he was indeed waiting for retirement, to launch himself headlong into another sector — giving him great pleasure and peace of mind, besides touching the lives of several others to make them better. After retiring from the Railways, he has been working towards helping children of government primary schools, and for the cause of pensioners for nearly two decades now. A resident of Kumaran Nagar, Virugambakkam, in Chennai, Mr. Subramanian retired from the Railways in 2001. Since then he has been providing copies of the Thirukural, Atlas and dictionary to government school students in Kilpenathur, Kuruvimalai, Vanakambadi, Ramapalayam and Pelathur villages located in Tiruvannamalai and Vellore districts. He spends close to Rs. 75,000 for this purpose, dipping into his own pension and savings. “I always felt guilty that I had not pursued higher education. When I told my wife about this, she asked me to do something for the students of my school in Kuruvimalai, it wasn’t too late to do that. Distributing books to them seemed like a good place to start, so I began by distributing the books and other material there and then extended this to other rural schools too.”He mostly hands out copies of Thirukural , English dictionaries and Atlases. “While Thirukural will instil virtue in young minds, the dictionary will help them learn English. There are not many maps in government schools in villages. So I thought of providing them Atlases,” he explains. He also used to supply the books to Chennai Corporation schools in Koyambedu, Virugambakkam and Arumbakkam, but he stopped as the schools were well-equipped. “As some of the schools are far away, I stick to the schools in the villages of Vellore and Tiruvannamalai — Kuruvimalai, Vannakambadi, Ramapalayam and Pelathur. I also donated over Rs. 1 lakh to these schools under the School Patron Fund so that they can use it for the children. I have also been donating mats, almirah, benches and other essential items needed by the schools,” says Mr. Subramanian. It’s his regret that he was not able to visit any of the schools or hand over books, due to the lockdown. But this does not mean he was not helping people during the pandemic. He helped eight retired persons, including those from the Railways, get their pensions and arrears. “I have been helping pensioners since 2001. I coordinate with the banks and Centralised Pension Processing Centre,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/for-this-ex-railway-employee-life-began-after-retirement/article33476820.ece

02 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Train us to handle leaking LPG cylinders’||Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder delivery men have urged the State-run oil companies to conduct in-plant training programmes for them at bottling plants. The programmes can help them and mechanics deal with emergencies, including leaks in cylinders. “A couple of weeks ago, a delivery boy with 10 years of experience got injured in a fire when he was trying to fix a leaking cylinder in Tirunelveli district. We are not saying he did not know the job, it could have been an error of judgment. Regular training at the plant could have helped him avoid it,” said Shanmugam, a delivery person from Tiruchi. Most times customers call delivery personnel in case of leaks since they are the first point of contact when it comes to cylinders. A long-time distributor said earlier oil companies used to hold regular training programmes for delivery boys and mechanics. “Nowadays the companies only bother about cylinder deliveries on time. It seems as though consumer safety has taken a back seat, ” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/train-us-to-handle-leaking-lpg-cylinders/article33477660.ece
02 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||I am firm on contesting against Stalin: Seeman||Naam Tamilar Katchi founder Seeman has said he is firm on contesting against DMK president M.K. Stalin in the 2021 Assembly election. Accusing the DMK of being the root of all evils plaguing the State, Mr. Seeman on Thursday said that since Mr. Stalin had assumed that he would be the next Chief Minister “there is no need to fight against any sidekicks, but the main antagonist himself”. He would fight Mr. Stalin in any constituency and but wouldn’t contest in a second seat. “I am not afraid of a loss. Why should I contest a second or third seat?” he asked. The film director-turned-politician, who has been espousing the Tamil nationalist cause, holds the DMK and its ally Congress responsible for the genocide against ethnic Tamils in the Eelam-IV civil war in Sri Lanka. “I have nothing against the DMK as a party. I have a personal anger against Karunanidhi and his family who kept quiet during the Eelam massacre. Also, Karunanidhi jailed me five times, in an attempt to silence my voice,” he told The Hindu.  He accused the DMK of hypocrisy on all issues that it had supported earlier when it was part of the Congress-led Central government, such as GST, NEET, NIA, among others. According to him, despite being in various Union Cabinets for 18 years, the DMK did nothing to ensure the State’s rights. He felt that if the DMK had replaced the AIADMK government after winning the Assembly bypolls, it would have supported the BJP-led Centre. He said he did not want to contest against the Chief Minister or his deputy, as people “will automatically want a change” from the AIADMK, which has been in power for nearly 10 years. The NTK was not in favour of an alliance with the MNM, he said. “Kamal Haasan is my elder brother. He has said MNM is also a Dravidian party. I will keep my leader [LTTE chief] Prabhakaran’s photo on stage while campaigning. Our main opponents are the DMK and the BJP.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/i-am-firm-on-contesting-against-stalin-seeman/article33476832.ece
02 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State will send samples for genomic analysis to Bengaluru: Radhakrishnan||With the State sending 42 samples for genomic analysis to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan on Thursday said arrangements were being made to send samples to two national institutes in Bengaluru — National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences and National Centre for Biological Sciences — to expedite the process. “We had earlier sent 30 samples of U.K. returnees and their contacts who had tested positive for COVID-19 to NIV, Pune, for genomic analysis. Another 10 samples were sent on Wednesday, and two more on Thursday. “As the next step, we spoke to the Central government and got the authorisation to send the samples to the two national institutes in Bengaluru to expedite the works,” he told reporters. Of the 30 samples, two results were known till now. While a sample of a Chennai resident had returned positive for the new U.K. strain early this week, the sample of a patient in Madurai has returned negative. “Genomic sequencing is a tough job. As of now, 28 samples are being run, and 12 more are on the way,” he said. Four test positive According to the bulletin issued by the Health Department on Thursday, four more U.K. returnees have tested positive for COVID-19. Till date, 24 U.K. returnees and 20 of their contacts were found to be infected. So far, 1,936 passengers who returned from the U.K. were traced and tested. Though 1,853 of them have tested negative, as a precautionary measure 1,554 close contacts were traced and tested and all were found to be negative. The Health Secretary said they were tracing the remaining passengers who had returned between November 25 and December 23. The department had arrived at a reconciled figure of 2,080 passengers. About 54 persons had returned to the U.K., while some of them, especially in Chennai and Chengalpattu, had provided different addresses. He added that all U.K. returnees and their contacts who had tested positive for COVID-19 were isolated in separate wards and were stable. No difference “According to doctors, there is no difference in the clinical manifestation in the existing COVID-19 and new variant.

One of them, a 45-year-old man, was discharged from the hospital after 103 days of treatment, while the other, a 37-year-old man, returned home after undergoing treatment for 95 days. According to a press release, the 45-year-old was admitted with symptoms of COVID-19 — fever, cough and breathlessness — on September 18. RT-PCR test confirmed that his infection and a CT scan showed 95% lung involvement. He spent 62 days in the intensive care unit and required oxygen support for 40 days. During the course of his treatment, doctors found that he had pneumothorax — collapsed lung due to leakage of air into the pleural space — and an intercostal drain was performed. He also received physiotherapy due to weak muscles. His condition improved after 103 days, following which he was discharged from the hospital on Thursday. The second patient was admitted on September 25 with fever, cough and breathlessness. A RT-PCR test returned positive for COVID-19 and a CT scan showed 75% lung involvement. He was admitted to the ICU for 45 days and was on oxygen support. Doctors diagnosed him with pneumothorax following which intercostal drain was performed. He was discharged after 95 days of hospitalisation. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan met the two patients while they were being discharged on Thursday. E. Theranirajan, dean of the RGGGH, said, “During our daily reviews, we found that pneumothorax was one of the causes of sudden deaths in patients. Spontaneous pneumothorax was one of the complications of COVID-19.” “When the lungs collapse, patients come down with dyspnea and lose consciousness. Timely intervention will help,” he said.

On the same day in 2019, the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) sold liquor worth Rs. 150 crore. On December 30, sales were Rs. 113 crore in 2020, as against Rs. 92 crore in 2019. The zone-wise break-down provided by Tasmac shows that on December 31, the Chennai region sold liquor worth Rs. 48.75 crore and Salem reported Rs. 26.49 crore in sales. Regions in and around Tier-2 cities such as Madurai and Coimbatore registered Rs. 27.30 crore and Rs. 28.40 crore in sales. In the Tiruchi division, sales were Rs. 28.10 crore. Low liquor consumption Tasmac officials said the sales had been low for the last few days, and that had been the main reason for the government to allow bars attached to the Tasmac shops to resume operations. “Liquor consumption was not as expected. The night curfew was one key reason,” said a source at Tasmac. He said tipplers had cut down on spending. The person in charge of a Tasmac outlet near Anna Salai said, “Usually those who go to the beach pick up liquor from here. But sales were quite low this year.” This has been the trend during New Year’s Eve for the past few years. Even in 2018, the government’s cash cow registered sales worth Rs. 130 crore on December 31 and Rs. 113 crore the previous day. Tasmac has over 5,338 shops, and together they sell liquor worth Rs. 130 crore-Rs. 140 crore a day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tasmac-sells-liquor-worth-rs-160-crore-on-new-years-eve/article33476834.ece

Stalin on Friday urged the Tamil Nadu government to take a cue from the Punjab and Kerala governments and adopt a resolution against the three Central farm legislations -- against which farmers are protesting in Delhi. “Farmers have been protesting for the last 37 days unmindful of the piercing cold climate. The legislations have denied them minimum support price and seek to make them the slaves of corporate houses,” Mr. Stalin said in a letter to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami. He said the Assembly should be convened for the purpose of adopting a resolution as has been done by the Kerala and Punjab Assemblies. Mr. Stalin said it was the need of the hour that Tamil Nadu, the first state to introduce free electricity to farmers, stood by farmers. “It is the wish of the farmers that the State Assembly should adopt a resolution to reflect their sentiments. The DMK is firm that it should be done,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-chief-demands-assembly-resolution-against-farm-laws/article33476824.ece

02 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vintage Nectar, a lyricist’s 5-year project to redeem and enrich film songs||A five-year project — Vintage Nectar or Naatpadu Theral in Tamil — seeking to enrich the content and quality of Tamil film songs has been unveiled by lyricist Vairamuthu as he felt that the need for songs in films was slowly diminishing. “Among the great artists I know, I joined hands with those I could reach out to. Hundred new songs will be created with the help of 100 composers, 100 singers and 100 directors. This is my dream plan. One could term this a five-year plan for songs,” he said in a statement. He recalled that Naatpadu Theral , a phrase borrowed from Sangam poetry, refers to the honey fermented in a bamboo pipe for years. Elini, the son of Athiyaman, one of the seven philanthropist chieftains, would offer poet Avvaiyar the nectar which would be felt like a sting of scorpion in the tongue. “Even now, some songs in some movies are extraordinary, but in many movies, there’s just an emptiness. Where are the film songs that resounded with Sangam literature and Thirukkural? Where are the movies that sing aloud the devotion of Bhakti literature? Where is the film poetry which enabled socialism and Dravidian emancipation,” he said. Pointing out that though technology was soaring above the skies, the artistic notion is perishing like a wild flower in a forest fire, Mr.Vairamuthu said in many cases the songs seemed like a market for selling sound and mostly an unsatisfactory union of language and music. “There are no lines for those in love to quote; there are no songs to teach children Tamil; there are no lullabies for mothers to croon to their babies.....” he said, explaining the reason behind launching the project. Mr. Vairamuthu, who would pen the lyrics for the project, said every song would be recorded visually and he had planned to personally render an introduction for each song and aid the audience’s mind in deeply relishing and experiencing each creation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vintage-nectar-a-lyricists-5-year-project-to-redeem-and-enrich-film-songs/article33476873.ece

Chinnaraja G. Naidu, Deputy Registrar of Geographical Indications, confirmed that an application seeking GI tag for ‘Cumbum Panneer Thratchai’ has been filed. “A unique factor is that in this Cumbum valley the ‘panneer’ grapes are available and harvested all through the year as against only during January and April in the rest of India. The grapes grown are suitable for making wine, spirit, jams, canned grape juice and raisins,”said P. Sanjai Gandhi, IPR attorney and nodal officer, Geographical Indication Registration of Products, government of Tamil Nadu.

The ball of his hip bone was too large and would not fit into the socket to enable him to sit cross-legged or kneel. He approached G. Leonard Ponraj, head of the arthroscopy and sports injury department at the Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital in Omandurar Estate. Dr. Leonard said a thorough examination found that his ball and socket joint were malformed. “He was not able to sit cross-legged for over two years,” Dr. Leonard said. From being a blob of bone, the hip joint differentiates into a head, neck and shaft. In the patient, the bone stopped remodelling, making it a birth anomaly. “In his case, the ball did not narrow and remained a bony bump. We call this a ‘cam lesion’. This does not allow the ball to enter the socket. Through a 5mm keyhole, we skimmed the excess bone,” Dr. Leonard said. The excess bone was burred to enable the ball to glide into the socket smoothly. Two days later, the man was able to sit cross-legged. He would have to undergo a similar surgery on his right hip as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/surgeons-expertise-helps-man-sit-kneel/article33476875.ece
02 January 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Coimbatore sees less rainfall in 2020||The year that just passed by, 2020, has been a year that gave Coimbatore less than the normal rainfall. Data available with the Agro Climate Research Centre at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University shows that as against the annual average of 674 mm, the district had received 638 mm rainfall. But there is a positive point to be noted in the rainfall received in 2020, says the centre head Prof. S.P. Ramanathan and points out that the number of rainy days in 2020 was 52. The average number of rainy days is 46. A day that sees over 2.5 mm precipitation is accounted for as a rainy day. Of the four rainy seasons – winter, summer, south-west and north-east – the district had received excess rainfall in only two seasons – summer and south-west. During the summer season that covers March, April and May, the district received 170.5 mm in nine rainy days. The average rainfall for the season is 136 mm and nine rainy days. In the south-west monsoon season that extends from June to September, the district had received 296 mm in 26 rainy days. The average for the season is 210 mm and 16 rainy days. The deficit was in winter and north-east monsoon seasons, says Mr. Ramanathan and points out that the shortfall in the latter is to be noted as the north-east monsoon season brings the maximum rainfall for the district. As against the average rainfall of 305 mm for the season that covers October, November and December, the district had received 171 mm in 17 rainy days. And, in the winter season that covers January and February, the district had received 0.5 mm as against the average, 23 mm. Compared to 2019, the district had received less rainfall. The year 2019 gave surplus rainfall in that the annual rainfall stood at 859 mm with the north-east monsoon alone accounting for 450 mm in 27 rainy days. October 2019, in particular, was good because the district had received 246.9 mm, he adds. The water level in the Siruvani Reservoir remains a cause for concern, say sources in the Corporation. As of January 2021, the water level is 38.8 feet. The full reservoir level is 49.5 feet. The Kerala Government is maintaining water level at less than the promised level, they point out and recall that it had promised to maintain the water level at five feet less than the full reservoir level – around 44.5 feet. A deficit of 5.7 feet from the promised level and 10.7 feet from the full reservoir level will leave the city with very little Siruvani water in the coming months, the sources add.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/coimbatore-sees-less-rainfall-in-2020/article33477419.ece

02 January 2021||Coimbatore,TAMIL NADU||Early admission key to recovery of elderly patients, say experts||As apprehension over the spread of a variant strain of the COVID-19 virus continues into the new year, doctors and authorities stressed the importance of early admissions in hospitals for elderly patients, as they are more vulnerable to the virus. “Any patient will recover [from COVID-19] if they are hospitalised on time,” said Deputy Director of Health Services (Coimbatore) G. Ramesh Kumar on Friday. Highlighting that the overall COVID-19 death rate of Coimbatore district was 1.24%, he noted that the death rate was declining. However, senior citizens must continue to take adequate precautions and get hospitalised even if they experience mild symptoms, Dr. Kumar said. Echoing similar sentiments, Dean of Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) P. Kalidas said that the hospital had seen the recoveries of patients aged over 70 years from COVID-19 in the past year as they were admitted at an early stage. Delayed hospitalisation, particularly of those with co-morbidities such as diabetes, was the major reason for many of the COVID-19 fatalities, he said. One such example of timely hospitalisation of an elderly COVID-19 patient recently occurred at a private hospital here. A 69-year-old man with diabetes who contracted COVID-19 was admitted at G.K.N.M. Hospital on November 28, 2020. According to his relative, he had experienced mild symptoms of COVID-19 a few days earlier. “On the morning of November 28, he experienced breathlessness,” the relative said. The senior citizen was hospitalised the same day. At the hospital, doctors, under the supervision of the hospital’s Director – Intensive care unit G. Sathyamurthy, began treatment. Critical care physician Karthiraj Natarajan said that the elderly patient suffered from severe hypoxia (deprivation of oxygen) and was first placed on mechanical ventilator support, following which the doctors went in for prone ventilation where the patient receives ventilation while lying face-down. His health gradually improved and he was discharged nearly 20 days later on December 17, after recovering from COVID-19, he said. Dr. Natarajan said that age was the major concern among doctors during the treatment. “After his recovery, we are also feeling more optimistic,” he said. The team, who treated the patient also included Dr. Senthilkumar, Dr. Sabarish and Dr. Prasad, he noted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/early-admission-key-to-recovery-of-elderly-patients-say-experts/article33477429.ece
02 January 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||SIDCO industrial estate manufacturers seek better infrastructure||The Coimbatore SIDCO Industrial Estate Manufacturers Welfare Association has appealed to the State government to upgrade facilities at SIDCO industrial estates across the State to match world-class standards. This is among the resolutions passed at the annual meeting of the association held here. The concessions provided for industrial estates developed by the government should be extended to industrial estates developed by private units and industrial associations. Further, the subsidy given for infrastructure development at the industrial estates should be made available without conditions. At the Kurichi SIDCO Industrial Estate, there is no supply of drinking water and this is one of the long-pending demands of the industries at the estate. However, there is no relief. The government should provide drinking water supply and lay roads at the Estate. A technology centre for MSMEs should be established in Coimbatore, the association said. The manufacturers also said the working capital made available to MSMEs should be increased to 40% of the turnover instead of 20%. The current subsidy of 15% provided under the CLCSS should be hiked to 25%. The sanction process for additional loans given to MSMEs should be relaxed and simplified so that the units get loans soon, the association said. The Coimbatore Corporation should waive all taxes that the MSMEs should pay during the lockdown period, it added. The units urged the Central government to regulate export and import of raw materials so that domestic MSMEs get the materials at affordable prices. A committee should be formed with representatives of industrial associations to monitor the movement of prices of raw materials.  The association also sought time for payment of taxes so that working capital is available for the MSMEs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sidco-industrial-estate-manufacturers-seek-better-infrastructure/article33476867.ece

A release said the technology was developed by a team of researchers at BIT and about eight units were installed at NBNP in December 2020. The animal repellent system is equipped with a high-volume hooter to drive the animals away and is completely automated. The sensitivity level of the system can be adjusted to detect the ground vibrations generated by the footsteps of various animals ranging from cats to elephants, according to the release. Real-time ground vibration detection technology had varied applications and possessed many advantages over other comparative technologies such as hidden underground sensors and higher resilience against climatic hazards, the release said. The researchers also adopted a noise cancellation technique which made the animal repellent system capable of rejecting any extraneous noises like that of rain or vehicles. Further research was under way to improve the performance of this system, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/animal-repellent-system-installed-at-anaikatti/article33476848.ece

At the annual meeting of the Association held here recently, it was decided to appeal to the governments for subsidy for solar energy plants (roof top or ground) set up by mills with maximum annual turnover of Rs. 50 crore. The government financial institutions should extend loans for such projects without collateral. The MSME mills should get loans at 7 % interest, it said.

In a memorandum to the Minister for Railways, the Association said the Railway Board had issued two circulars directing officials to clear the bill payments for MSMEs. Yet, there were huge arrears to be cleared. The officials reportedly told the suppliers in many places that they were not having adequate funds. At the New Bongaigaon Carriage Workshop, the officials said that funds were not available for six months. But bills submitted about a year ago were also pending. Though there was a delay in the MSMEs getting the payments, they were levied penalties for not supplying the parts on time. The MSMEs did not have funds to continue production. Hence, funds should be released for the MSMEs supplying to the Railways and the units should be exempted from all penalties liquidated damages on delayed supply till June this year, the Association said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/railway-suppliers-demand-release-of-funds/article33476846.ece

02 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||No decent place to bid adieu to the departed||The cremation ground at Thathaneri, the largest in Madurai which functions round-the-clock, is in dire need of maintenance. The lack of basic facilities - wild growth of prosopis juliflora (karuvela trees) and unhygienic conditions at the cremation ground irk the public. The traditional burning area and the burial ground are situated next to the gasifier crematorium building. The wild growth of karuvela trees at the burial ground makes it difficult to bury bodies, says V.P. Manikandan, a social worker who conducts last rites for the abandoned. “Two years back, a clean-up drive was conducted and ‘karuvela’ trees were removed from the burial ground. But, today, the invasive weed has again proliferated at the burial ground, causing severe inconvenience to the public,” he said. These bushes also act as a haven for anti-social elements, says a worker at the cremation ground. “Many locals use this place for relieving themselves,” he adds. CCTV cameras must be installed to monitor the cremation ground day and night, says Mr. Manikandan. The cremation ground complex presents a picture of neglect with empty liquor bottles and remains of last ritual material left behind by the mourners. “A dedicated team of sanitary workers of Madurai Corporation must be deployed to regularly clean the premises,” says Mr. Manikandan. Workers’ grouse The cremation ground workers also complain about the lack of basic facilities for them. A worker says they have no room to have food or change clothes. “We have no choice but to eat near the smoke from the burning bodies. The problem is more pronounced during the rainy season as rainwater seeps from the roofs of the mandapams where the bodies are burnt, making the situation difficult for workers,” he says. Mr. Manikandan says drinking water facilities and benches for those who come to perform the last rites must be provided at the cremation ground. A Corporation official says steps will be taken to remove the wild growth of karuvela trees juliflora from the burial ground. Currently, four bathrooms - two each for men and women - are being built on the campus of the crematorium. A project to repair the damaged portions of the compound wall is also under way, he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-decent-place-to-bid-adieu-to-the-departed/article33477530.ece
02 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||High Court permits caretaker to keep custody of elephant||In a significant order, Justice G.R. Swaminathan of the Madras High Court taking into consideration the bond between an elephant ‘Lalitha’ and her caretaker of 20 years, permitted the caretaker to continue to keep the custody of the elephant. The court also permitted the authorities concerned to inspect the elephant at any time. Justice Swaminathan observed, “Elephants are known to be sensitive and are possessed of self awareness. They have passed what is known as a “mirror test”. The German naturalist Peter Wohlleben, after years of direct, personal observation, had said that animals also feel the very same emotions which humans are capable of. The court was hearing a petition filed by caretaker Sheik Mohammed of Virudhunagar district. He had purchased the elephant in 2000 from the previous owner and applied for the transfer of ownership in 2002. The request was rejected in 2020. He sought the rejection order to be set aside and the certificate of ownership be granted to him. Considering the plight of the elephant and her caretaker, the judge made a surprise inspection to ascertain the status of Lalitha in Chokkanathanputhur in Virudhunagar district. “When I reached the spot, I found her being sumptuously fed. What pleased me was that she was not at all chained……..I checked if there are any injury marks on her. There were none. The elephant looked happy and healthy. Lalitha exhibited great friendliness”, the judge said. “Article 51A (g) of the Constitution of India calls upon us to have compassion for living creatures. Lalitha is entitled to express her normal patterns of behaviour. She has been with her caretaker for more than twenty years………..The department was issuing directives from time to time and they were complied with by the petitioner. Microchip has been implanted in her body so that her movements can be tracked. She has developed a great bonding with her caretakers. Forcible relocation in alien surroundings is sure to traumatise her. I therefore felt that the approach that we adopt in child custody cases must be followed in the case of Lalitha also”, the judge observed. Further, the judge said that when he questioned the caretakers regarding Lalitha's maintenance he was told that she was taken to some of the well known temples and dargahs of south Tamil Nadu and the organisers of the religious functions pay for her majestic participation. “Lalitha does not beg on the roads. Her dignity is maintained intact”, the judge said. He took cognisance of the fact that veterinarians appointed by the department had certified that she was being maintained properly by the petitioner. The State had argued that no person without previous permission in writing of the authority concerned can keep in possession, custody, control or transfer any wild animal. The court held that therefore the request for the certificate was rightly rejected. The court directed the authorities to permit the caretaker to keep custody of the elephant and granted them the liberty to inspect the elephant at any time.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-permits-caretaker-to-keep-custody-of-elephant/article33476826.ece
02 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||High Court quashes BDU recruitment notification||The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has quashed the notification issued by Bharathidasan University, Tiruchi pertaining to the direct recruitment to the posts of Professor, Associate Professor and Assistant Professor that treated the entire University as one unit while applying the reservation policy. The court was hearing a batch of petitions that challenged the notification that was issued in 2019. The petitioners complained that instead of treating each Department individually for applying the reservation policy, the entire University was taken as one unit which was not in consonance with the State government’s reservation policy. Taking cognisance of reports submitted in the case, Justice Krishnan Ramasamy observed that a mere perusal of the same would show that the Vice-Chancellor of the University had sent a letter to the Higher Education Department in 2019 stating that the communal roster system taking each department in the University as one unit for the direct recruitment in teachers cadre will lead to legal issues since an advertisement was already been issued and applications were received from the candidates. Therefore, the University sought the support to proceed with the appointment with the already published advertisement taking all departments as one unit. In order to avoid legal issues, the Bharathidasan University had requested the State Department to ratify its notification by considering the entire University as a single unit, as a special case, the judge observed. The judge also took serious note of the fact that Higher Education Secretary Apoorva permitted the University to proceed with the appointment of teaching posts in Bharathidasan University by applying the University as one unit for reservation. By doing so, she has completely ignored the reservation policy of the State as well as the law settled by the Supreme Court. “A member of all India service is expected to act in accordance with the Law, Rules and Regulations and established practices. The discretion conferred upon them cannot be abused or taken as a license to do what they like or dislike. They are expected to act with utmost professionalism of the highest degree and set a benchmark for their subordinates to follow”, the judge said. In the present case, the court is constrained to remark that no professional approach or proper application of mind is evidenced from the conduct of the Secretary as she has not adhered to or followed the conduct rules of All India Service. Therefore, the ability and suitability of her to hold the present position in the Government required serious consideration, the judge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-quashes-bdu-recruitment-notification/article33476880.ece

02 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Two arrested for duping aged women||Madurai City police have arrested two persons - Karthik and Saravanan - on a charge of robbing two women of their gold ornaments at different places with the guise of helping them get additional benefits from government. The police said a youth had approached G. Shantha, 76, of North Masi Street and promised to get her an additional Rs. 800 widow pension. He asked her to come to a nationalised bank on West Masi Street. After getting her documents, he asked her to remove her two-sovereign gold ornaments.

02 January 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Delta farmers seek adequate number of harvesting machines||With harvest of samba/thaladi paddy set to begin in the delta region soon, progressive farmers are looking up to the authorities to ensure the availability of harvesting machines in adequate numbers so that the reaping of paddy is done on time without hassles. Last samba season, hundreds of huge combined harvester machines were pressed into service in the delta districts and the crop was harvested on time. The Agriculture Engineering Department which had moved its own machines from other districts had also encouraged the private parties owning combined harvester machines to divert them to the delta districts. This timely action ensured the farmers realise their yield before the panicles of samba paddy sprouted. Since a similar situation prevails all over the delta this season also, farmers expect prompt and timely action from the authorities to help them harvest samba paddy in good condition. Financial support Meanwhile, the Madukkur farmers producers’ organisation (FPO) has submitted a memorandum to the Thanjavur district administration seeking financial support for purchasing a combined harvester machine for the use of its members and as well as other farmers in Madukkur and Pattukottai region. Speaking to The Hindu , the president of Madukkur FPO, G.Suresh said that around 160 farmers had enrolled in the organisation as members. Farmers in this region usually went in for a single paddy crop cultivation. Making an investment of around Rs. 20 to Rs. 25 lakh on a harvester machine could not be considered an unwise decision considering the demand for this machine in the delta region , he said. Further, of late the farmers in some pockets of rain-fed areas preferred to raise paddy as summer crop by tapping the groundwater potential. Another reason which had influenced the Madukkur FPO to own a harvester machine was the `extra’ charges levied by the private parties. “If we own a harvester, our members and fellow farmers can hire the machine from us at the price fixed by the government,” Mr.Suresh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/delta-farmers-seek-adequate-number-of-harvesting-machines/article33477414.ece
02 January 2021||THANJAVUR,TAMIL NADU||Thanjavur Corporation steps up professional tax arrears collection||The Thanjavur Corporation has stepped up the professional tax arrears collection exercise by forming a special team exclusively to realise the outstanding amount of Rs. 3.50 crore. Stating that several private companies/business houses functioning the civic body limits have not remitted the professional tax deducted from the salary of their respective employees, the Corporation Commissioner, Janaki Ravindran, in a press release, pointed out that the professional tax deduction and remittance of the same to the civic body was being done without fail by the Union and State governments, the public sector undertakings and some private companies/business houses. At the same time, several private entities have not attached much importance to this process and a sum of Rs. 2.95 crore had been kept as arrears towards remittance of profession tax.

02 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Tenders called to complete ROB||The Highways Department has called for tenders to complete the remaining portion of the incomplete road overbridge (ROB) near the Railway Junction in the city hoping to get the Defence land required for the project soon. With the State government offering land of equal value from the adjacent Tamil Nadu Special Police (TSP) battalion grounds, a proposal for the exchange of the land has been forwarded to the Defence Ministry on December 21, sources in the Highways Department told The Hindu . “Since the land offered in exchange was adjacent to the piece of land we have sought, we expect the Defence Ministry to accept the offer. We expect the Ministry’s nod any time now and hence have called for the tender so that once the clearance is given, the work could resume without any further delay,” an official of the Department said. The original contract for the project was terminated by the department due to the delay in getting the 67 cents of Defence land sought for the first phase of project by the Highways Department. Construction of the ROB remains suspended for more than two years now. Ninety percent of the first stage of the project has been completed but for the Chennai arm of the bridge, which needs to be connected to a new approach road to be laid across the Defence land. The Chennai arm is the final segment of the first stage of the two-stage project. Only upon completion of the first stage of the project, the old narrow bridge could be dismantled for the construction of second stage of project. The first stage of the bridge was scheduled to be completed by February 2017 and the second by 2019. But delays in land acquisition, initially from the Railways and now from the Defence Ministry, has caused time overruns much to the consternation of the city residents. Despite several attempts to take up the issue with successive Defence Ministers and several rounds of talks between the State and Centre, stalemate had persisted over the land transfer. In an attempt to break the deadlock, the district administration came forward to offer land of equal value in the adjacent TSP campus, which the State government hopes would be accepted by the Defence Ministry. Highways Department officials say that the tender for completing the ROB has been called now in anticipation of getting the Defence Ministry’s nod for transfer and avoid procedural delays. With the Assembly election round the corner, the Highways Department move is widely viewed a welcome step as once the election notification is issued, fresh tenders could not be called. The remaining portion of the ROB would be completed within six months, once the Highways Department gets possession of the land or given enter upon permission, official sources indicated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tenders-called-to-complete-rob/article33477648.ece

Sree Krishna, General Manager - Projects, Airports Authority of India, Tiruchi Airport, told The Hindu on Friday. The new tower forms part of the mega project under which construction of a new passenger terminal building and a new Apron were currently under way for upgradation of the non-metro Tiruchi airport. With the height clearance having come through, the Airports Authority of India would prepare the preliminary estimate for the construction of the new structure and initiate the tendering process. “The new building would enable the Air Traffic Controllers to have a 360 degree view of the airport, besides providing them with a clear view of both ends of the runway. The proposed technical block-cum-air traffic tower control would come up between the existing apron and the new passenger terminal building,” said Mr. Sree Krishna. Mr. Sree Krishna, who is monitoring the pace of the new passenger terminal coming up, said nearly 80 % of the works relating to construction of the new Apron have been completed.

02 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Momentum of teaching-learning slows down||The requirement for teachers to attend colleges for handling online classes for students does not seem to have gone down well with many. Teachers are unable to make out how better the online teaching-learning process has been after they started performing their duties from the confines of empty classrooms in the colleges from last month. If anything, there are enough indications that the momentum of teaching-learning process has slowed down, due to connectivity issues, according to students. According to teachers, Wi-fi enabled campuses are not a commonality. "We depend on our mobile phone hotspot connectivity to reach out to students. Weak signals reflect in frequent disruptions in the lectures," a senior teacher said. Another problem faced by senior teachers who were hitherto comfortable with desktop computers is that they are now to required to operate laptops. Quite often, the teachers go home to complete the portions planned for the day, much to the discomfiture of students. "It is not about attending the online classes as such. We are now accustomed to the daily routine. But, prolonging the duration of the daily routine causes fatigue," a student said. Acknowledging the difficulties that the teachers and students go through, a principal of a city college observed that reverting to the earlier system will serve the purpose of teaching-learning will indeed be better until the situation turns conducive for offline classroom sessions. "There are also instances of students logging out their systems and blaming their non-participation in the online interface on poor connectivity," he said, seeking an appropriate intervention by the Higher Education Department in right earnest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/momentum-of-teaching-learning-slows-down/article33477646.ece

02 January 2021||Tirunelveli,TAMIL NADU||Neglected Nainarkulam to become a picnic spot||Commissioner for Municipal Administration and Chairman of ‘Smart City’ projects K. Baskaran on Thursday reviewed the progress of the development works being implemented here on an outlay of Rs. 996 crore after chairing the third annual general meeting with the directors. The highlight of the meeting that approved the annual accounts of ‘Smart City’ programme being implemented with the Centre’s funding was that plans are afoot to transform the now neglected Nainarkulam in Tirunelveli Town into an attractive picnic spot. The Tirunelveli Smart City Limited has created new parks at 16 places and renovated existing parks in two phases. Construction of truck terminal in Pettai, micro compost centres to convert the degradable waste getting generated in the wards into manure, solar rooftop photovoltaic system in the Corporation buildings etc., where other projects that were being undertaken. After inspecting a few ‘Smart City’ development works along with V. Narayanan Nair, Chief Executive Officer, Tirunelveli Smart City Limited, Dr. Baskaran exhorted the officials to expedite the works while ensuring superior quality. When he visited Nainarkulam tank in Tirunelveli Town after reviewing the progress of other projects being implemented under the ‘Smart City’ programme, District Collector V. Vishnu joined Dr. Bhaskaran to discuss the possibilities of developing the waterbody into a full-fledged ‘leisure spot’. As similar attempt was mooted by the Corporation a decade ago to add visitor-friendly features to Nainarkulam, it was then decided to install a replica of Eiffel Tower on the eastern side of the waterbody a decade ago. But it was not translated into action. Though ornamental rails and lights were installed along the eastern bank of Nainarkulam with walkers’ path, poor quality of the work and ‘zero maintenance’ have left the water hyacinth-filled waterbody in a worse shape. When Mr. Vishnu visited the tank recently while flagging off a cycle rally to create awareness among the public on conserving birds, he informed that concrete steps would be taken to add more colour to the waterbody wherein sewage is now flowing uncontrollably. An hour-long discussion between Mr. Vishnu and Dr. Baskaran is likely to give a new face to Nainarkulam . Sources privy to the discussion said the badly damaged walkers’ path would be renovated besides installing ornamental lights. After repairing the road connecting Nainarkulam with Thatchanallur, due space along the bunds of the waterbody would be created to park vehicles. “The major challenge of the work would be to check the influx of sewage into this system tank. To go ahead with the waterbody’s makeover, the sewage flowing into the tank should be stopped first. After removing the water weeds, growth of this should be checked scientifically. Boating inside the tank, eateries, lights and walkers’ path etc. will certainly attract more people,” an official said.   A major challenge will be to check the influx of sewage into this system tank and after removing the weeds, its growth should be checked scientifically Corporation official||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/nainarkulam-to-become-a-picnic-spot/article33476828.ece

Statistics from the Horticulture Department that maintains most parks and gardens in the Nilgiris revealed that the total number of visitors to the Garden stood at just 6.2 lakh, when compared with 28.11 lakh in 2019. The statistic is important as the Tourism Department and the district administration use the figures as a barometer to estimate the number of visitors to the district. According to officials from both the departments, the COVID-19 pandemic was the sole reason for the steep decrease in the number of visitors to the Garden in 2020. The Garden was closed to visitors between March and September. The number of visitors to the district prior to the pandemic between January and March constituted almost 73 % of the total number of visitors to the garden this year. Since the reopening of the district to tourists, only 1.63 lakh tourists visited in the last three months, the officials said. “This shows that even after the district was reopened for tourism, people remain wary of travelling due to the pandemic and that has severely affected hotels, restaurants, homestays and other small businesses dependent on the tourism industry,” said a hotel owner from the Nilgiris.

Life cycle The Wynter-Blyth Association (WBA), stated that in 2020, members of the group have successfully “rediscovered” the Branded Royal ( Tajuria melastigma) after a period of 130 years, while also recording the early life cycle of the Nilgiri tit ( Hypolycaena nilgirica ), which the team found laying eggs on a species of ground orchid. “Based in Coonoor, the WBA has made quite a few revelations and discoveries in documenting rare butterflies in the Nilgiris this year,” said Manoj Sethumadhavan, a trustee of WBA. “The Branded Royal, which was last observed in the Nilgiris in the 1880s was not only rediscovered in the hills, but has also had its entire lifecycle documented. This elusive butterfly has been sighted hardly in three places in Tamil Nadu and there are only a handful of overall sightings of the adult from the Peninsular India. It was observed and recorded that this butterfly breeds in a species of Loranthus ( Scurrula parasitica ) during its larval stage after which it goes through a series of physiological changes to dissolve itself into a beautiful pupa and to finally emerge as an adult,” a statement from WBA read. Meanwhile, members of WBA also recorded that the Nilgiri tit lays its eggs on a species of ground orchid ( Eupholia epidenraea ). There had been little understanding of which the species of orchid the butterfly prefers to lays its eggs on previously. Other rare butterfly species such as the Common Onyx, Silver Royal, Banded Royal, Yellow-breasted flat, Pointed lineblue, White-tipped lineblue, Tawny Raja, Black Raja, Silver streak blue, Silver-streaked acacia blue, Clipper, Striated Five-ring, Large Guava Blue, Common Tinsel, Acute sunbeam, Pale four-lineblue and Restricted spotted flat, all considered as uncommon species, were also sighted by the team this year, a press release from WBA said. Timely monsoons “WBA considers this as one of the best years in which so many rare species have been sighted and attribute this to the timely monsoons and abundance of botanical diversity which flourished because of this,” said Vinod Sriramulu, another trustee of WBA.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/butterfly-trackers-help-lift-mystery-surrounding-rare-species-in-the-nilgiris/article33476871.ece

The park has been set up in a 200 metres-long and 15 meters-wide area. “This area was lying unused so we decided to use it for the park. We decided to inaugurate it using a member of the public as it is mainly for them,” said Komal Kumar, Superintendent of Post Offices, Vellore region. The park contains boards with stamps released on Vellore including its personalities and monuments. It mentions the year of release, the denomination of the stamp and also some details about the person or monument on the stamp. There are boards with a stamp on Christian Medical College which was released in 2006, on Kirubananda Variyar who was born in Kangeyanallur, Vellore, in 1906 and a stamp on Vellore Fort released in 1984. “We also have a board for the stamp on Vellore mutiny, which took place in 1806 and which was released in 2006 to observe its 200th year and one on Voorhees College which was also released in 2006,” said Mr. Kumar. Apart from this, there are boards with a collection of stamps on famous women from Tamil Nadu, and historical places in the State. “The children can take a stroll in the park to spend time and also learn about the history of the district at the same time.

Virudhunagar district Joint Director of Agriculture, Uthandaraman, said that the disease causing black spots on the leaves and earheads have been found in paddy crops in Kariapatti and Watrap regions. Stating that the disease had affected paddy crops of particular varieties like BPT5204 (Deluxe Ponni), Ambai 16 and ADT 43, he said the weather condition with continuous rain for several days followed by dew drops settling on the leaves, has caused a conducive atmosphere for the fungal disease. Initially small specks originate on leaves and subsequently enlarge into spindle-shaped spots. Subsequently, it gives a burnt appearance. The black spots would lead to rotting of the earheads. To prevent infection of blast disease, farmers should spray Pseudomonas 0.2% mixture. Two grams of the chemical in one litre of water or 2.5 kg for a hectare) should be sprayed on the crops 45 days after transplantation. It should be sprayed thrice with a gap of 19 days. ‘Mix with neem cake’ Nitrogen-based fertilizers should be used by mixing them with neem cake, he said.

But that does not matter much as the party workers are united. Workers decide the fate of a party and not leaders,’’ KPCC working president Satish Jarkiholi said in Belagavi on Friday. He was responding to questions from journalists about the differences between Siddaramaiah and D.K. Shivakumar. He also said that there was no need to focus on such issues. “Also, such differences are not to be connected with the hypothetical question as to who will be the Chief Minister if the Congress comes to power in the future. That question is irrelevant now. The only question ahead of us is how we will strengthen the party at the grassroots and build a confident cadre,” he said. He admitted that C.M. Ibrahim, senior leader and MLC, was upset about some developments in the party. “But he is not leaving the party. He has expressed his feelings over some problems in the party and they are being set right. I have already spoken to him,” he said. He said that the Congress election committee will take a decision about the Belagavi Lok Sabha candidate this week. That is the party’s priority in North Karnataka now, he said.

This is the third attempt of Mr. Itagi in hoisting the flag of North Karnataka. He had tried, unsuccessfully, to hoist the flag in front of the Suvarna Soudha in 2018 and in Hire Bagewadi in 2019.

02 January 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Excise revenue surpasses previous year’s figures||Despite a nearly 8.5% decline in sale of Indian Made Liquor (IML) this year, the growth in the excise revenue collection has turned positive for the first time this financial year. While the IML sale has remained at 417 lakh carton boxes as of December 31, 2020, it was 455.24 lakh carton boxes in the corresponding period of 2019. Incidentally, 600.92 lakh carton boxes had been sold in the financial year 2019-20. At the end of third quarter in 2020-21, the excise duty collection has been at Rs. 16,405 crore as against Rs. 16,218 crore in the corresponding period of 2019-20. In terms of absolute numbers, the excise duty collections, which remained slow due to the lockdown and other restrictions, for the first time surpassed the 2019 figures. The revenue collection has increased despite the sales going down since the State government brought in a steep increase in the excise duty slabs in the middle of COVID-19 crisis to augment the State’s resources. The additional duty is expected to mop up about Rs. 2,500 crore to the government this year. This was besides the hike proposed in 2020-21 budget. The Excise Department data shows that the growth in sale of IML this financial year has been slow over the last financial year even as the excise collections have been consistently higher since June 2020. The growth in IML sales have been consistent only since September, and December saw the highest month on month growth of 12%. A total of 61.24 lakh carton boxes of IML were sold in December 2020 as against 54.38 lakh in December 2019. Meanwhile, December also saw a record excise duty collection of Rs. 2,436.34, the highest monthly collection so far this financial year. When the liquor outlets were allowed to open post the lockdown, Rs. 2,404.76 crore was collected in June.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/excise-revenue-surpasses-previous-years-figures/article33476914.ece

Yediyurappa held a meeting with senior IAS officers and instructed them to expedite the implementation of Smart City projects in different cities in the State. The Chief Minister has taken a pledge to “change the face” of many cities, particularly Bengaluru, which have been facing traffic congestion and problems related to housing, drainage, and drinking water. Karnataka has been implementing Centrally sponsored Smart City projects in Bengaluru, Belagavi, Davangere, Hubballi-Dharwad, Mangaluru, Shivamogga, and Tumakuru. With nearly 40% of the State’s population residing in urban areas and city corporation limits, the Chief Minister told officials to establish better coordination among various civic agencies such as electricity supply companies, city corporations and traffic police for expediting the implementation of Smart City projects. ‘Prepare blueprints’ The Chief Minister, who chaired the meeting with senior officials on the outskirts of the city, asked them to prepare the blueprints for various development projects/schemes to be included in the 2021-22 State Budget. By 2022, the developmental map of Bengaluru and other cities are to be changed, he said. With the State facing revenue shortage of Rs. 30,000 crore owing to COVID-19 in 2020-21, the Chief Minister is expected to start preparations for the new Budget soon to chalk out plans for revenue mobilisation. During the meeting, Chief Secretary P. Ravi Kumar promised all support to the Chief Minister and said officials would support the government to make Karnataka a model State on the development front. The Principal Secretaries of various departments attended the meeting. Earlier, Mr. Kumar met Mr. Yediyurappa and extended New Year’s greetings, while Mr. Yediyurappa called on Governor Vajubhai Vala and did the same.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/expedite-smart-city-projects-cm/article33477077.ece
02 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Cong. ridicules BSY’s ‘self-certification’||The Congress has ridiculed as “self-certification” the assertive posture of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who on Thursday remarked that he would complete his full term and that none of the legislators or the people of the State had any doubt in it. Speaking to reporters in Bengaluru on Friday, KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar questioned the necessity of making such a declaration. He said leaders of the ruling BJP have been predicting a change in leadership in the State after January 15. Some political developments in the party have forced Mr. Yediyurappa to issue the statement, Mr. Shivakumar claimed. On Thursday, Mr. Yediyurappa said he would continue as Chief Minister till the next Assembly elections and ruled out any possibility of a change of guard. On the government’s inability to trace people who have returned to the State from the U.K. and spread of a new strain of the coronavirus, Mr. Shivakumar blamed the regime’s laxity on the matter. Going by the common sense, the government should have conducted COVID-19 tests at airports on all passengers returning from the U.K., he said. He said the failure of both the Union and State governments to contain COVID-19 spread had caused a lot of hardship for the common man. On the gram panchayat election results, the KPCC chief said he was satisfied with them. Despite the “money power of the ruling BJP”, a good number of Congress-backed candidates won across the State, he claimed. He said the party would focus on organisation in 2021 and launch battles against the BJP government by motivating block-level office-bearer. Mr. Shivakumar also welcomed the government’s decision to reopen schools and colleges in the State on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cong-ridicules-bsys-self-certification/article33477079.ece

Teachers armed with a thermal scanner recorded the body temperature before letting them in. D.H. Chandre Gowda, Headmaster of Government High School at Haralahalli near Hassan, said, “If any student has COVID-19 symptoms, we will ask him or her to sit in a separate room and inform the doctors. They will come and check the health in the school itself”. The schools have been told to keep one room empty to isolate students with symptoms. The students were also thrilled to visit the school after so many days. Ajay, a student in Haralahalli, told The Hindu that all these days he had not met his friends. “I am genuinely happy to return to school to meet my friends”, he said.

02 January 2021||Hassan,KARNATAKA||VTU withdraws circular on ‘technical hubs’||Visvesaraya Technological University (VTU) on Thursday withdrew its circular on establishing ‘technical hubs’ in engineering colleges in the association with a private firm, following objections from a few affiliated colleges. The colleges raised objections to the fee proposed by the company to be collected from students for establishing the hub, besides expressing doubts about the efficiency of the firm. VTU Registrar A.S. Deshpande, in a circular on December 21, had told the colleges that the university had signed an MoU with M/S Rnurays Technologies Pvt. Ltd. to establish ‘industry hubs’ in colleges. “They offer hands-on experience to students by bringing industry experts to the campus and delivering industry-oriented services, including internship opportunities, project work, soft skill training, and placement of students of all streams,” the circular said. Stating that the private firm had proposed a charge Rs. 17,864 per final-year student, the Registrar asked the colleges to provide them exclusive space for an industrial hub on the campus. Considering the number of students, the total fee would run into several crores. The colleges were also asked to submit action-taken reports on this before January 25. The project was proposed to involvenearly one lakh students from 225 affiliated colleges. However, the Registrar issued a clarification on December 31 withdrawing the previous circular. In the latest circular, he stated, “This is to clarify [that] industry hub is desirable for strengthening industry connect. The university has not made it mandatory to tie up with Rnurays Technologies Pvt. Ltd.” When The Hindu contacted Karisiddappa, Vice-Chancellor of VTU, he said the circular was withdrawn to clear up any confusion. “The concept of an industrial hub is helpful for students. However, the colleges are free to tie up with any firm that can provide the necessary service,” he said.  A faculty member, who wished not to be named, said, “A customary visit to the company’s website will be enough to doubt its credentials. It has no previous experience in building industrial hubs. The profiles of those in chief posts are not only unimpressive but also lack basic information.” Taken aback The decision of the VTU has upset the private firm. Ningappa Uppal, founder and CEO of Rnuray Technologies, said , “We had begun the process of recruiting people to set up industrial hubs in all 225 colleges. Suddenly, the circular has been withdrawn.” He said he had no prior information about the withdrawal. When it was brought to his notice that some colleges doubted his company’s efficiency, he said, “We have not been allowed to work on this project yet.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vtu-withdraws-circular-on-technical-hubs/article33477081.ece

02 January 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||Minister takes to task officials coming unprepared to KDP meeting||Officials coming unprepared on subjects related to their department listed on the agenda of the quarterly review meeting of Karnataka Development Programmes (KDP) faced the ire of Deputy Chief Minister and Kalaburagi district in-charge Minister Govind Karjol here on Friday. Questioning National Rural Drinking Water Project (NRDWP) officer Azizuddin about total mini water supply schemes, piped water supply schemes and hand pumps in the district, the Minister charged the officer with failing to provide details of defunct and working water schemes. The government had earmarked Rs. 1,757 lakh for 203 works, of which 172 works were completed by spending Rs. 1,116.24 lakh. Afzalpur MLA M.Y. Patil complained that 80 % of reverse osmosis (RO) plants installed for providing pure drinking water in the district were not functioning. Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer P. Raja replied that of the total 442 units, 284 were working and 158 were not operating. “He assured me that all RO units will be repaired by February. The respective gram panchayats will be paid Rs. 3,000 per month for maintenance of RO plants,” he added. Mr. M.Y. Patil and MLC Sunil Valayapur and the former Minister Priyanka Kharge hurled a series of complaints against Panchayat Raj Department officer Sharnabasappa for not taking up road maintenance works. He also failed to give details of roads upgraded to State Highways. Mr. Karjol slammed Mr. Sharnbasappa for misleading the representatives about the Panchayat Raj works with those of the Public Works Department. The Minister also ordered the suspension of the officer. Mr. Karjol also took Deputy Director for Food and Civil Supplies Dayanand Patil to task for failing to distribute ration cards under the Public Distribution System. As many as 62, 837 applications were received, of which 45,344 were approved of and 10,185 were rejected. As many as 7,318 applications were pending since April. The Minister lambasted Mr. Dayanand Patil for not distributing ration cards to the needy during the lockdown. Mr. Kharge said that 33 cases were filed against racket in the sale of PDS foodgrains. Levelling charges against the officer, the legislators present in the meeting, including Dattatreya Patil Revoor, Subhash Guttedar, Avinash Jadhav and Rajkumar Patil Telkur, said that the officers are hand in glove with criminals selling PDS foodgrains in the black market. Mr. Karjol directed that licence of PDS shops selling foodgrains illegally be cancelled. Mr. Karjol also directed the officer of Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited to prepare a project proposing a 400 kV station under the Green Energy Corridor scheme of the Union government. “At least 100 acres of land and Rs. 800 crore is required to set up a 400 kV station. If the State government provides 100 acres of land, the Centre will bear the project cost (Rs. 800 crore),” he said. Joint Director for Agriculture Rithedranath Sugoor providing details of damage during the recent floods said that the district suffered crop damage on 4.33 hectares of land affecting 2.90 lakh farmers. The government has released Rs. 70 crore and nearly 1.04 lakh beneficiaries in the district received flood relief, he added. Mr. Kharge expressed displeasure after the meeting came to an abrupt end without reviewing works of various departments. Taking a serious note of the recent incidents of ganja seized, IPL racket raids in the district, the legislator held the local police responsible for lapses in maintaining law and order. He also urged Mr. Karjol to convene a review meeting to discuss works taken up under Kalyana Karnataka Regional Development Board.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/minister-takes-to-task-officials-coming-unprepared-to-kdp-meeting/article33476896.ece

02 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Halt sand extraction from rivers in CRZ: Traditional fishermen||At a time when the State government has been allowing sand extraction from river beds in coastal regulation zones (CRZ) in the guise of clearing sand dunes for fishing boat movement, the Moola Nadi Meenugarara Sangha (association of traditional river fishermen) on Friday urged the authorities concerned to immediately halt such activities as sand extraction was affecting traditional fishermen. Fishermen leader Vasudeva Boloor told reporters here that traditional fishing was being taken up for time immemorial and the present generation of fishermen too was engaged in traditional fishing in rivers in CRZ area. Fishermen get into the river directly to lay nets and these methods were called Bolpubale, Rampani, among others. On the other hand, fisherwomen collect Maruvai (clam) from rivers, he said. However, extensive sand extraction from riverbeds in CRZ in the recent past has been threatening traditional fishermen wherein riverbeds have become deep. Even women were finding it difficult to collect Maruvai. While fishermen were negotiating rivers using Jalle (long poles), they were unable to do so now because of the increased depth, up to 30 ft at some locations. Nets of fishermen were getting damaged as sand extractors were leaving their boats anchored in rivers for long, Mr. Boloor said. Some extractors were using machinery too to extract sand due to which the riverbed becomes too deep. Limestones and other chemical material have come up because of deep sand extraction affecting fishing activities. On the other hand, well water on the river banks have become saline even as sand transporting trucks were polluting the environment. ‘Destroying marine life’ A factory producing edible oils on the banks of the Phalguni (Gurupura) near Kulur has been letting effluents into the river thereby destroying the marine life, Mr. Boloor said. The authorities have not acted upon the representations given by fishermen so far, Mr. Boloor said and warned launching an agitation if sand extraction was not halted or regulated. Even the Karnataka Karavali Meenugarara Sangha has extended support to the cause, he added. Sangha president Harish Puthran, general secretary Naveen Salian and others were present.  Nets of fishermen were getting damaged as sand extractors were leaving their boats anchored in rivers for long, fishermen leader Vasudeva Boloor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/halt-sand-extraction-from-rivers-in-crz-traditional-fishermen/article33477546.ece

SDPI State Secretary Ashraf Machar told reporters here that three members were arrested by the Belthangady Police in connection with the video shot during counting of votes at Ujire in the taluk on Wednesday. He said that the police barged into their houses at midnight and took them away. Condemning this, Mr. Machar said that it was not necessary for Indian Muslims to raise pro-Pakistan slogans. It was the Sangh Parivar that always spoke about Pakistan, he said. He said that SDPI members were celebrating the victory of candidates supported by the party and were raising slogans in favour of the party. A few people with communal mindset have doctored the video and inserted pro-Pakistan slogans, he said and added that it was a strategy adopted by a private television channel and the Sangh Parivar to malign SDPI. Mr. Machar said that the police have arrested the three under pressure. The Superintendent of Police should hold a detailed probe into the incident and take action against those who doctored the video, he demanded. SDPI National Committee member Riyaz Farangipet said that the Superintendent of Police should hold a detailed and unbiased probe into the incident and withdraw cases filed against innocent party members. If the police failed to withdraw the cases within three days, SDPI would take out a protest march to the Superintendent of Police’s office, he said. Mr. Farangipet said that the police did not book Belthangady MLA Harish Poonja for delivering a provocative speech after the incident. The police were working at the behest of the Sangh Parivar, booking suo motu cases against Muslims while keeping quite when it comes to Sangh Parivar, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sdpi-threatens-protest-if-arrested-members-are-not-released-in-3-days/article33477544.ece

Mr. Rauf told reporters here that the concrete road constructed under the Smart City project on Car Street has witnessed cracks within a month of its construction. In other areas of the city, cracks on newly built concrete roads have been filled with cement, he said. He added that rules were flouted in awarding contracts for projects. At the same time, several road concreting works taken up in haste two months ago have come to a standstill, Mr. Rauf said. Because of stoppage of works at Hampanakatte, patients visiting the district Government Wenlock Hospital were put to severe discomfort, he said. Stating that the city and district administration have no proper plan in place, Mr. Rauf noted that Rs. 1.5 crore spent to offer an alternative market place for traders displaced from the Central Market at the Football Ground has gone waste. The High Court of Karnataka recently ruled that the ground should not be used for any other purpose other than playing games, he noted.

02 January 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||KSOU awaits UGC approval to launch 10 new courses||The Karnataka State Open University (KSOU) is gearing up for the launch of 10 new courses under open and distance learning mode from this year on and is awaiting the nod from the University Grants Commission (UGC) for admissions to these courses from January cycle. “We are confident the UGC will give its approval to our proposal on the new courses, which are set to improve admissions, and also cater to the needs of students wishing to pursue science courses,” said Vice-Chancellor S. Vidyashankar. KSOU is already running 30-plus courses. The programmes awaiting UGC approval include B.Sc., Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA); Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA); Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (B.Sc. IT); Bachelor of Science in Human Development (B.Sc. Human Development); M.A. in Education; M.A. in Telugu; Master of Science in Information Technology (M.Sc. IT); Master of Science in Botany (M.Sc. Botany); Master of Science in Zoology (M.Sc. Zoology), and Master of Science in Food Science and Nutrition. KSOU has the infrastructure to run these courses. The UGC will go through the facilities before giving its nod, he said. The KSOU’s proposal for launching new programmes in online mode is also before the UGC. “KSOU does not need a top-three NIRF rank or NAAC ‘A’ grade for the nod like conventional universities for running courses online. The UGC can directly give its permission based on our project proposal since we are an open university,” said Registrar Lingaraj Gandhi. Digitisation drives, ICT push, skill development initiatives, and digitisation of examination procedures are among the strengths of the university where admissions have gone online in a transparent way, he explained. The courses proposed for the launch in online mode are Master of Commerce (M.Com); MBA; M.A. Economics; M.Sc. Information Technology; M.Sc. Computer Science; M.A. English; M.A. Hindi, and M.A. Kannada. Mr. Vidyashankar said the admissions for coaching in competitive examinations like IAS and KAS has crossed 1,200 from 250 in a span of one year. Jainahalli Satyanarayana Gowda, who heads the Centre for Competitive Examinations in KSOU, said the success achieved by students in the past drove admissions since last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ksou-awaits-ugc-approval-to-launch-10-new-courses/article33476912.ece
02 January 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||As a New Year ‘gift’, KSOU gets exclusivity for ODL courses||The Mysuru-based Karnataka State Open University (KSOU), the State’s lone open university celebrating its silver jubilee, finally got the exclusive right of running Open and Distance Learning (ODL) courses in the State with the government issuing a gazette notification in this regard, after amending the Karnataka State Universities and Certain Other Law (second amendment) Act, 2020, two days ago. Henceforth, no other university in the State other than KSOU can offer ODL courses. “The KSOU has the sole right on distance education in the State and I consider this a New Year gift to it. I thank the Governor, the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Higher Education for making it happen,” Vice-Chancellor S. Vidyashankar told presspersons here on Friday. Registrar Lingaraj Gandhi, Jainahalli Sathyanarayana Gowda, head, Centre for Competitive Examinations, KSOU, and other officials were present at the V-C’s press conference. Claiming that the exclusivity would give an edge, helping the university’s growth, admissions, and improvement of gross enrolment ratio (GER), the VC said, “It took a lot of effort for over a year to persuade the government to make it possible as we wished to retain KSOU’s identity that was in danger with conventional universities running ODL courses, endangering its existence.” Prof .Vidyashankar said the gazette notification has given new energy and drive to KSOU to initiate various reforms, including preparation for NAAC accreditation, 12 (B) of UGC inspection, introduction of new courses, technology-based education, launch of ODL courses in online mode and so on. To a question, the V-C said the conventional universities had not taken admissions last year over the KSOU exclusivity issue and the students pursuing courses in second and third years can complete the courses without any hurdles. “But, no more new admissions hereafter.” In the last one and half years, especially post-COVID-19, the KSOU has seen many developments such as digital initiatives like KSOU Student App, KSOU Connect etc. 18,000-plus admissions Despite the year hit by COVID-19, the KSOU managed to attract nearly 18,000-19,000 admissions in the July cycle. “The last date for admissions ended on December 31, 2020, after two extensions. MBA alone got 1,200-plus admissions and BA got 5,615 admissions. We hope to see a big jump in admissions this year, thanks to the KSOU getting the exclusive ODL right,” he maintained. Prof. Vidyashankar said two more regional centres will come up in Bidar and Bagalkot increasing the number to 20 and 100 learner support groups are in force across the State for supporting students. Induction programme The first-ever simultaneous induction of all students admitted in 2020 to 30-plus courses will happen on January 18 virtually. Deputy CM and Minister for Higher Education C.N. Ashwathnarayan had been requested to inaugurate the programme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/as-a-new-year-gift-ksou-gets-exclusivity-for-odl-courses/article33476916.ece

02 January 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||As KSOU turns 25, alumni set to come together||The two-and-a-half-decade old Karnataka State Open University (KSOU) will soon have its Alumni Association becoming a reality ahead of its silver jubilee with the varsity management preparing for registering the association and launching a dedicated website. The past students of KSOU, which turns 25 in 2021, are in various positions. The university has produced many achievers, including IAS and KAS officers, top government officials and heads in top private sector institutions and companies. Some of its alumni are also top politicians in the State and include KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar and BJP national general secretary C.T. Ravi. “I had approached Mr. Shivakumar and others who promised all support for the alumni initiative. More than a dozen past students had cleared the KPSC examination to become KAS officers. We have proposed to compile the achievements of past students in the form of a book for brand building of KSOU and circulate it across the State,” said Vice-chancellor S. Vidyashankar. The V-C said former students play a key role in the growth of their alma mater as noticed in many foreign countries where some universities are run by their alumni. “This can help in building the universities’ infrastructure.” As its social responsibility, KSOU has adopted five government schools to help improve their infrastructure, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/as-ksou-turns-25-alumni-set-to-come-together/article33476910.ece
02 January 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Cleaning up Chamundi Hills||As part of the “Shramdaan” planned on January 3, the Mysuru Ex-Servicemen Movement (MEM) will be cleaning the steps of Chamundi Hills and its surroundings. “The concept is to climb the 1,000 steps leading from Chamundi foothills to the Chamundeswari Temple cleaning the surroundings of the 1,000 steps by picking up all the used and thrown plastic bags, empty bottles, plastic cups, and discarded footwear,” said Mandetira N. Subramani, Honorary Legal Advisor to MEM. The participants are expected to assemble at the foothills on January 3 at 6.45 a.m. and start the programme by 7 a.m. Mr. Subramani said MEM is an association of military veterans who have chosen Mysuru as their home after retiring from the Armed Forces. One of the main objectives of the MEM is to serve society by taking up community service apart from projecting the problems and just causes of ex-servicemen and dependent family members to the appropriate authorities and requesting them to resolve their problems, he said. The members of MEM will join hands with VeKare Ex-servicemen Trust and Sainik Academy, Mysuru, to organise the “shramdaan,” he said.

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Private schools make changes to infrastructure for student safety||The reality of an altered school life in times of COVID-19 hit home for thousands of students who returned to their classrooms on Friday after a gap of nine months. Apart from wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, and following the SOP listed by the government, students found that there were additional changes on campus. Many private schools in Bengaluru have made infrastructural changes to ensure the safety of students and staff, such as expanding the size of the classroom and installing foot-operated taps in washrooms. A majority of schools have put permanent markings in all areas of their campus to ensure that students maintain physical distance from each other at all times. However, these changes will come at a cost, one that schools have decided to pass on to parents in the form of a separate COVID-19 fee or sanitisation charges for this academic year. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said that many schools had procured fogging machines, sanitiser dispensing machines and oxygen cylinders that may be needed in case of an emergency. Mansoor Ali Khan, member, board of management, DPS Group of Schools, said that they had deployed additional maintenance staff. “On an average, we have 300 people to clean the school campus when students from kindergarten to class twelve are present. Now, for just students of classes ten and twelve, we will have 125 maintenance staff coming every day. We want to ensure that the toilets are sanitised after every use. The health of our students is our utmost priority,” he said, and added that they had procured sanitisers, face shields and masks for students. Srinivasan M., chairman, Gear Innovative International School, said that they will resume classes on January 4. “We have rearranged classrooms and removed many desks and chairs to maintain social distancing. A large chunk of our expenditure was incurred in sanitising the classrooms,” he said. Many private schools in the city, particularly those affiliated to central boards, chose not to reopen. While some managements made this decision as they did not want to risk the spread of infection, others decided to do so as they did not have enough funds to follow the SOP laid down by the Department of Primary and Secondary Education. S.R. Umashankar, Principal Secretary of the department, said that the State government had only issued SOP for schools who wish to reopen classes. “It is not mandatory. We cannot insist that all private schools should be reopened,” he said.  It was great to attend classes after nine-and-a-half months even with all the precautionary measures. I prefer coming to school over attending online classes, as I can clarify all my doubts with the teacher instantly Prajwal D.S., class 10, Blossoms School   The class strength in schools was a little low on Friday. Even students who had submitted consent forms from parents did not attend classes. Many students are in their hometowns and will probably attend classes next week H. K. Manjunatha, president, Karnataka High School Teachers’ Association   In our school, as many as 84 out of 94 students reported physically to class on Friday.

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||As we enter a new year, this is Bengaluru’s wish list||Last year, the pandemic either put on hold or delayed plans that civic and other agencies had mapped out for the city. But with the government now better equipped to fight COVID-19, improving the quality of life of citizens should not be de-prioritised, say urban planners, activists, and residents’ welfare associations. Some of the key areas that need improvement are better pavements and pothole-free roads, a well-connected and affordable public transport network, and a more robust public health care system. Roads and footpaths With more than 80 lakh vehicles in the city, motorable roads and wide footpaths are a priority. Most roads in the Central Business District are dug up on account of various infrastructure development projects, including white-topping and TenderSURE. Roads in outer zones, especially in the 110 villages, are in no better condition as they have been dug up for laying of drinking water and underground drainage pipelines. Most of these works have dragged on for months with authorities blaming the slow progress on the lockdown and exodus of labourers. Potholes and bad reaches remain a perennial problem. Though the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) had established a hot mix plant years ago, it was only recently that it was commissioned. It remains to be seen if the BBMP and other agencies will complete ongoing projects in a timely manner. A cleaner, greener city As the city, like most parts of the world, saw pollution levels drop to unprecedented levels as lockdown and work-from-home brought down vehicular movement and industrial activities, Bengalureans will wish the pandemic-induced restrictions away while hoping to preserve the gains from them. For instance, the highly polluted Vrushabhavathi river got a brief respite during the lockdown. The city will hope that major polluters will start treating effluents at source. As the quality of air saw a marked improvement, with reduced vehicular movement being a major contributor, citizens and experts will hope that the government finds ways to sustain this through measures such as strengthening the public transport system, which faces new challenges, while dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. On a deeper level, with the threat of zoonotic diseases a glaring reality, they will hope for a new decade of environmental policies that factor this in while developing plans for the ever-expanding city as contentious projects such as the PRR are drawn up. Focus on primary healthcare Bengaluru’s healthcare facilities may be far better compared to those available in rural areas, but experts feel prominence is given to secondary and tertiary care, making primary care inaccessible to most. Although most of the bigger hospitals – both government and private – are situated in Bengaluru, the lack of ventilators and adequate number of Intensive Care Units (ICUs) has always been an issue. On several occasions, people have been forced to run from one hospital to another in search of a bed in an ICU. People are often forced to visit referral tertiary care centres even for minor health issues. Giridhar R. Babu, member of the State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), said the city requires strong, accountable and responsive comprehensive primary health care. “It is also important to ensure continuity of care and feedback from higher centres to ensure that people are provided comprehensive services. Over-reliance on secondary and tertiary care by neglecting primary health care services is not tenable in the long run,” he said. Public commute Citizens are waiting for the much-delayed commercial operations of the extended Namma Metro on Kanakapura Road and Mysuru Road, which are expected to start this year. In the past, the BMRCL had fixed several deadlines but failed to deliver on its promises. Fed up with delays, Bengalureans are demanding that BMRCL prioritise Namma Metro projects on crucial corridors, such as Whitefield and Electronics City. This year, the BMRCL is likely to start work on the 55-km ORR-airport line after getting approval from the Central government. Citizens are also hoping that work on the suburban rail network takes off as it has been a 30-year-long wait while bus commuters are looking forward to a more robust BMTC fleet. BMTC was unable to add new buses to its existing fleet in 2020. This year, the city might see operation of electric buses. People relying on public transport also hope for authorities to introduce a common mobility card, which will help them to travel in various modes of transport. Boost for business Micro and small businesses from the high-street retailer to the roadside dhobi carts need succour and sustenance. “Bengaluru in 2021 is a hungry animal. The hungriest of them all are the micro and small businesses,” said Harish Bijoor, founder of Harish Bijoor Consults Inc. Industry experts estimate that 87 such businesses are on the negative list and have gone into de-growth or perished. Those who operate in commercial areas have lost customers due to work from home. Many expressed hope that banks and lending organisations will step in and lend a helping hand. “Banks must step out of their brick and mortar space, and get proactive in their lending approach. The Equitas SFB and the Jana SFB are the type of lending institutions that must take this initiative. They are closest to the market and its problems,” he added. The work from home culture which has now become the norm has also highlighted the need for better internet connectivity and power supply. Tapping technology to improve policing The city police is keen on tapping into technology in 2021. Ensuring the implementation of the Safe City Project, that will put 7,500 CCTV cameras on the city's streets with live AI powered video monitoring and analysis systems, is high on the agenda. “We are also keen on bringing at least 50,000 private CCTV cameras already installed in the city on board, and get their feed to our control room, under the Karnataka Public Places Security Act,” said Police Commissioner Kamal Pant. These measures will increase the surveillance capacity of the police many-fold, on the lines of London, capital of the UK. Meanwhile, the city police also want to introduce a Cyber Crime Incident Report helpline where victims can call and register a complaint immediately so that accounts are frozen and transactions cancelled immediately, if possible. They are also keen on implementing synchronisation of traffic signals to ensure smooth flow of vehicles. “Road conditions need to improve and the civic body needs to take up junction improvement works to help us improve commute,” Mr. Pant said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/as-we-enter-a-new-year-this-is-bengalurus-wish-list/article33477376.ece

The group headed by G. Gururaj, in charge director of NIMHANS, comprises 38 doctors from across specialities. The first meeting of the group was held on Friday. Addressing presspersons after the meeting, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said the State has plans to bring about a comprehensive transformation in the health sector. “As per the existing National Health Policy, 2017, we are committed to provide quality healthcare to the people of Karnataka. The roadmap to achieve this has been discussed in the meeting,” he said. Integrating services Pointing out that presently healthcare is available at the primary, community and district levels, the Minister said: “We need to integrate the services of facilities at the primary, community and districts levels with medical colleges to provide quality healthcare to the public. We also need to focus on prevention.” Mr. Sudhakar said preventive measures like regular blood check up for people aged above 35, treating non-communicable diseases at the earlier stages, apart from other reforms had been discussed in the meeting. Part of team Sub-committees, including specialists in each committee, have been formed to prepare a comprehensive report. Both allopathy and Ayush doctors are part of the group. The final report will be submitted to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/arogya-karnataka-vision-group-to-submit-report-in-six-months/article33476908.ece

Retired judge B.G. Kolse Patil, one of the organisers of Elgar Parishad in Bhima Koregaon on December 31, 2017, presided over the event in Bengaluru on Friday. “Most of those arrested in the case were not even present at the Elgar Parishad organised by Justice P. B. Sawant and me. We do not even know many of them. If any, action ought to be taken against the organisers but ironically, political dissenters are being intimidated and targeted,” he said alleging the entire case was a “conspiracy by right-wing forces to suppress dissent”. “I am very clear that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the fountainhead of Hindutva, is enemy number one for a secular and just India. It is difficult to win this battle against right-wing forces if we fight in the electoral fray alone. We need to ideologically challenge them. “We need to set aside all identity markers and unite to fight for Roti-Kapda-Makaan and Shiksha-Arogya issues,” Mr. Patil said. He urged right thinking citizens to fearlessly fight State repression within the constitutional framework. The Bhima Koregaon Horata Samiti - Karnataka, that organised the event, demanded that all “political prisoners”, not just the 16 arrested in the Bhima Koregaon case, but also others related to anti-CAA protests and Delhi riots, “arrested on trumped up charges”, be expeditiously tried on merit or be released on bail with immediate effect.

Prohibitory orders were clamped in the city from Thursday noon to avoid crowding in the light of the pandemic, and police presence on the streets through the night, ensured “an incident-free” New Year's eve. Guidelines followed Apart from police personnel making their presence felt on the streets, several of them were in mufti at noted party joints and pubs to crack down on any gathering. However, in most cases, the police guidelines were followed and there was no occasion for any police action, sources said. “There was not a single untoward incident reported in the city. There was also no crowding. Most celebrations were indoors, where large crowds were not allowed. Such severe restrictions were necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” said Police Commissioner Kamal Pant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/new-year-celebrations-peaceful/article33477378.ece

The play, Halla Bol, supported workers’ demands led by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions. The theatre group’s founder, Safdar Hashmi, 34, succumbed to injuries the following day. Hashmi, however, became an icon and inspiration for many theatre artists. Which is why Theatre For Change (TFC), a Bengaluru-based group, wanted to begin a new year with his works. “His relentless effort for the working class and peasantry was an important part of his life. It resonates well with the current migrant labour crisis and other injustices in the country,” says Sujatha Balakrishnan, the group’s founder. On January 2, TFC will revisit three works of Hashmi: Machine, a play on capitalism, which he co-wrote with Rakesh Saxena; Duniya Sabki, a narrative poem for children involving a conversation between Akbar and Birbal; and Aurat, a play about violence against women.  Machine , Sujatha says, will be staged as a play. “The play is a metaphor for capitalism. The script lends itself to a dramatic choreography. The actors, individually and collectively, move like the parts of a machine.”  Duniya Sabki will be a dramatic reading. “Social justice and welfare are big words for children who are about 10. But they must know them. Hashmi’s poems [in Duniya Sabki ] are so rhythmic and colourful that children are introduced to these concepts in a fun way. They don’t sound like moral science lessons.” “ Aurat will be short. We are just planning to read an excerpt,” she adds. Hashmi’s works will be the first theatrical production to be staged at the Alliance Française de Bangalore after the pandemic.

The first period across all schools and PU colleges was dedicated to educating students on the precautionary measures that need to be taken in light of COVID-19. More girls in class Mr. Suresh Kumar said that for the most part, more girls attended classes than boys. “Girl students said that they were happy to be back in school as they had spent a large chunk of their time over the past nine months doing household chores.” The Minister added that they expected the attendance to improve from Monday. “Many students probably celebrated the new year last night and may not have been able to come to school,” he added. Two schools in Udupi district did not open as some of the teachers tested positive for COVID-19.

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Bank ordered to pay Rs. 3 lakh compensation||The Mandya District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has directed a public sector bank to pay compensation of Rs. 3 lakh for its failure to return the original documents pertaining to a property in Bengaluru deposited with the bank for raising a house building loan. According to a complaint filed by Suguna, a resident of Arakere village in Srirangapatna, her late husband A.M. Ramachandriah had obtained a house building loan for his property in Judicial Layout in Jakkur Allalasandra in Bengaluru. Though Mr. Ramachandraiah died after the loan was sanctioned, his legal representatives had cleared the entire outstanding loan amount on February 21, 2018. Though Ms. Suguna and her children had completed all the formalities to receive the property documents deposited with the bank by submitting the necessary application form with Mr. Ramachandraiah’s death certificate and the affidavits of the three legal heirs, the bank authorities had not returned the documents. The reason cited by the bank authorities was that the property documents had been kept in a safe locker of the bank in Mysuru and they would be returned after due verification. Despite several correspondences with the bank and issue of a legal notice on May 11, 2019, the bank had not returned the documents, the complainant said. The complainant, who required the documents to change the khatha and for other purposes to safeguard the property that was standing in her husband’s name, lodged a complaint with the Commission on June 18, 2019, against State Bank of India, Local Head Office, Bengaluru, the bank’s RACPC (Retail Assets Central Processing Centre) in Saraswathipuram in Mysuru, and managers of bank’s branches in Krishnamurthypuram in Mysuru and R.P. Road in Mandya. After hearing the arguments in the case, the Commission, headed by its President M.S. Ramachandra, noted that the bank represented by its counsel, who filed a written version, had admitted that the entire loan amount had been cleared and there is no due from the complainant. The bank also admits that there has been a delay in returning the original documents, but the reason for the delay is not explained, the Commission has observed. The Commission, in its order on December 14, 2020, said that the act and conduct of the opposite party bank shows that there is a deficiency in service on their part and also said that the delay in returning the original documents to the complainant is not explained with reasonable cause. The Commission referred to a judgment rendered by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Delhi, upholding a State Commission’s ruling ordering the petitioner bank to pay a compensation of Rs. 5 lakh for losing original documents deposited by a complainant. In this case, the Mandya District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission said, the bank had either misplaced or lost the documents deposited by the husband of the complainant and said payment of Rs. 3 lakh would be an appropriate compensation for loss of the original documents. The Commission has also ordered the bank to return the documents within 45 days from the date of the order failing which it shall pay a penalty of Rs. 100 per day till the order is complied with, besides Rs. 10,000 towards deficiency and mental agony and Rs. 3,000 towards costs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bank-told-to-pay-rs-3-lakh-compensation-for-failure-to-return-property-documents/article33476906.ece

The State has faced incidences of new and emerging diseases caused by viruses such as Nipah in the recent past and is presently facing the wrath of COVID-19, Vice Chancellor M.R. Saseendranath said. “Precise diagnosis and early treatment of infectious diseases; analysis of feed, food, and their products for various toxins; and appropriate forecasting of disease incidence in livestock based on an epidemiological calendar assume significance to mitigate disease prevalence among animals, Dr. Saseendranath said.  In two years Creation of facilities for timely detection and accurate reporting of hazardous and infective organisms was crucial for control measures, he said.  The proposed laboratory complex would be set up at a cost of Rs. 32 crore on the premises of the College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences at Mannuthy in Thrissur district. The project would be materialised in two years, he added. Advanced research The laboratory complex would be equipped with facilities for advanced molecular-level research and would consist of as many as 22 laboratories, including a sophisticated instruments laboratory, radio tracer and micro- nutrient laboratory, molecular biology laboratory, cell culture laboratory, embryo technology laboratory, hybridoma technology laboratory, and RNA processing and zoonoses laboratory. “It also envisages the installation of a lab with Biosafety level-3 facility for diagnosis of organisms belonging to category III as per WHO guidelines, taking into account all precautionary measures,” Dr. Saseendranath said. A common infrastructure facility with appropriate biosecurity precautions, pooling manpower and sophisticated equipment, ensures delivery of the results of physio-chemical analysis of food and food products, detection of organisms, and provides disease-preventive measures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/getting-a-good-grasp-of-zoonoses/article33476931.ece

Jn.-Poothotta road to be widened||The PWD (Roads Wing) and the Kerala Road Fund Board (KRFB) have set an 18-month time frame to widen the narrow but congested 13.40-km-long Thripunithura S.N. Junction-Poothotta corridor into a four-lane road. KIIFB had earmarked Rs. 450 crore in the second quarter of 2020 to acquire land and to hew out a 22-m wide road, in order to augment connectivity with Vaikom and Kottayam. Official sources said that the government recently gave financial sanction to acquire approximately 12 hectares for the project. The land acquisition process is set to begin this month itself. As per the alignment, the road ought to have 11-m width on either side, from the centre of the existing road. It would vary between 10 m and 12 m in a few places, where the alignment would have a marginal change, in order to straighten steep curves. Currently, drawings of plots to be acquired are being readied, with their corresponding survey numbers. The tahsildar will then submit a report to the Revenue Department to kick-start the land-acquisition process. The PWD had laid boundary stones over a year ago, despite encountering protests in a few locations. The road from S.N. Junction and ending at Poothotta Bridge can be widened in another 15 to 18 months, if everything go as scheduled. Thripunithura MLA M. Swaraj convened a meeting a week ago to fast-track the works which suffered delay due to local body polls, PWD sources said. The development of the arterial road as a four-lane corridor gains relevance since the Kochi metro’s Thripunithura SN Junction extension is set to be commissioned in 2021 and its further extension up to the terminal station proposed near Thripunithura railway station in yet another year. It would also considerably decongest Thripunithura town and nearby areas. Narrow roads, mostly owned by the PWD, abound in the densely populated temple town.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/sn-jn-poothotta-road-to-be-widened/article33477520.ece

Except for a few with ailments, attendance was almost close to 100%, as students, teachers, and parents appeared to accept the ‘new normal’ triggered by the COVID-19 situation. Day one of the sessions was focussed on revision lessons for the next few weeks and the safety guidelines to be followed to check the pandemic spread. “One student each was seated on a bench in line with the physical distancing protocol. Local body authorities had disinfected classrooms ahead of the partial reopening,” said Meena Paul, headmistress, Government Girl’s Higher Secondary School, Aluva. Sahiba, a Class X student, said students were aware of the safety guidelines to be followed on the campus. “We are supposed to wear masks and use sanitisers. Care should be taken not to share pens or other belongings with others,” she added. Bindu K.M., principal of the higher secondary section at the school, said the 182 students in the Plus Two section had been asked to report in batches. “Today, we had 90 students in two batches of 45 each in two different sessions. The morning batch was from 9.30 to 12.30, while the afternoon batch was from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Parents have to either drop or pick up their children, as schools are not operating buses in view of the pandemic situation.

02 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||MVD takes motorists by surprise||The Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) chose to tread a different path and give a positive spin to enforcement on New Year. Rather than issuing check reports and slapping fines, a section of the enforcement team of the MVD choose to look at the positive side and actually presented gifts to law-abiding motorists, taking some of them quite by surprise. The concept was developed by the flying squad of the Deputy Transport Commissioner (DTC), Central Zone II. Regi P. Varghese, DTC, launched the campaign, which was randomly held at chosen junctions. “The idea was to give a morale boosting experience to motorists complying with the law and something for them to remember for the rest of the year, We plan to run more such campaigns on and off depending on the success of this one and also based on the availability of funds,” said Mr. Varghese. A diary for 2021 and a quality pen was what was in store for law-abiding motorists. “We are often cursed on social media for the steep fines we slap on offenders. While we couldn’t help it as it is what the law suggests, we still didn’t want to be talked about for the same reason on the first day of the New Year as those on the receiving end would have cursed us for the rest of the year. Instead, we wanted to adopt a positive approach considering the occasion just like we talk about positive parenting when it comes to handling children,” said Najeeb K.M. Assistant Motor Vehicle Inspector, part of the DPC’s flying squad. So, the rider and the pillion rider wearing helmets, occupants of cars wearing seat belts, the ones complying with lane traffic and respecting pedestrian rights, and even pedestrians obeying rules and chose to cross the roads along zebra crossings rather than jaywalking were all stopped on the tracks in select locations and presented gifts as a token of appreciation for respecting laws. “We plan to approach the District Road Safety Authority on the need for undertaking such positive enforcement from time-to-time,” said Mr. Najeeb.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mvd-takes-motorists-by-surprise-on-new-year-day/article33477504.ece

The arrested is Vishnu aka Kannan aka Mind Kannan, 28, of Thoppumpady. The incident took place on Chittoor Road near SRV High School last Tuesday around 11.30 p.m. The transgender who had come to withdraw money from an ATM counter with friends came under attack from the motorcycle-borne gang. The key accused held the victim on knife’s edge and demanded money. When she swept away the knife and ran, the assailant chased her down and stabbed on her thigh with another knife. The victim sustained a deep wound on her palm on staving off the stab aimed at her chest. She sustained many stab wounds, including on the head. The police registered a case on the victim’s petition. A hunt is on for the two absconding accused. A team led by Central Station House Officer S. Vijayasankar and comprising Sub Inspectors Vipin Kumar K.G., Thomas K.X., and K. Fuljan and Assistant Sub Inspectors Gopi and Govindan made the arrest.  The Central police arrested a man on charges of stealing a mobile phone and abusing a woman and her daughter over phone and trespassing into their home. The arrested is Santhosh, 26, of Kottayam. He was initially arrested for stealing a phone from a ladies’ hostel in the city on the New Year’s eve. A resident of the hostel spotted him and raised a ruckus, following which he fled from the scene, during the course of which he lost his purse containing Aadhaar card and two mobile phones, including the stolen one. The police tracked him down within hours. However, it soon emerged that he was the one who rang up a woman and her daughter residing on St. Benedict Road and allegedly abused them. On interrogation, he confessed to the crime.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/man-arrested-for-bid-to-murder-transgender/article33477517.ece

The arrested are Sujay, 39, Arun Aravind, 30, and Dhanesh Prabhakaran, 38, all residents of Parakkadavu, and Lenin, 35, of Kurumassery. They are office-bearers of the Hindu Aikya Vedi. They were later released on bail. The incident came to light after the notice issued by the Parakkadavu unit of the Hindu Aikya Vedi and signed by its president Arun and secretary Dhanesh went viral. Mody bakery, which was opened just a month ago, promptly took down the sticker informing the availability of halal food on receiving the notice. “The notice was issued on December 28, but the shop owner chose not to report it. We traced the owner on being informed about the incident through social media and recorded his statement based on which a case was registered,” said T.K. Josey, Station House Officer, Chengamanad. The police invoked IPC Sections 153 (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 506 (1) (criminal intimidation), and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention). The notice sought the removal of the sticker notifying halal within seven days of receipt of the notice and avoiding the use of discriminatory descriptions from future advertisements of the shop, failing which the Hindu Aikya Vedi warned of boycotting the shop and launching protests. It was issued on the pretext that the area did not have enough members of the community that preferred halal food. The shop largely sold bakery items and only served Al-fam and Shawarma, two chicken-based snacks, that fall under the category of halal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/four-held-in-halal-info-removal-case/article33477518.ece

He was talking to The Hindu over phone after assuming charge at the Kochi City Police Commissionerate here on Friday. Aishwarya Dongre also assumed charge as the new Kochi City Deputy Commissioner (Law and Order and Traffic). Mr. Nagaraju said that he would like to continue the good work of his predecessor Vijay Sakhare, who was promoted as Additional Director General of Police. “A glance through the statistics suggest that Kochi city has a problem of drugs that lured the youth and took them down the path of crime. So, addressing that will be one of my top priorities,” he said. People’s feedback Emphasising on the significance of people-centric policing, the top cop said that he attached much significance on collecting feedback from people to assess their expectations from the force rather than unilaterally imposing policing methods, making life difficult for them. “The idea is to instill a sense of security and safety in people without being on their face. Vulnerable sections like women and children should feel safe all the time, especially in public places in the knowledge that police are there for them. We have some very good officers who are capable of achieving very high standards of policing,” Mr. Nagaraju said. He said that technology remained a ubiquitous facilitator and backbone of all policing initiatives. “The relevance of technology need not be specifically mentioned as it remains central to all our endeavours whether it is about collecting feedback from people or improving the response time in patrol,” Mr. Nagaraju said. He served as Deputy Inspector General (Administration) at the Police Headquarters for one-and-a-half-years before being promoted and posted here. A 2003 Kerala cadre officer, Mr. Nagaraju did his M.Phil. in Criminology from Cambridge University in the United Kingdom. He had also served in the Central Bureau of Investigation for over five years in Mumbai where he headed the anti-corruption branch and bank fraud investigation branch.

Scattered batches of immature sardines have been spotted in southern coastal Kerala thanks to a seemingly favourable condition in the marine ecosystem. But the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) cautioned against catching them extensively, as it might badly impact the expected revival of the fish. Reproductive stage Upon assessing sexual maturity, a team of CMFRI researchers found that the sardines with a size of 14 cm to 16 cm were yet to reach the reproductive stage. Flagging concern over the indiscriminate fishing of small sardines, the researchers pointed out that they would require another three months to attain full maturity. Meagre in count The CMFRI study also revealed that the spawning stock biomass of sardines in the Kerala waters was meagre. “Considering the unusual and unfavourable status of the stock, we advise not to catch sardines even though they fall above the minimum legal size [MLS] of 10 cm,” said E.M. Abdussamad, principal scientist, CMFRI, who led the study. “CMFRI has brought the matter to the attention of Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma,” said CMFRI Director A. Gopalakrishnan. For the past five years, there has been a sharp decline in oil sardine population along the State’s coast. Slight increase It registered a slight increase in 2017 but continued to fall deep again during the following years. Last year witnessed the lowest catch of sardines in two decades at 44,320 tonnes. The CMFRI had earlier found that unfavourable conditions in the ocean ecosystem following El Nino were behind the fluctuations in the availability of the fish variety. According to CMFRI, imposing a self-regulation in fishing sardines will immensely help in augmenting their revival.  The Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute cautions against catching the fish variety extensively||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/scientists-caution-as-oil-sardines-on-revival-path/article33477012.ece

They were proceeding in the direction of Koonammavu from Varapuzha when their motorcycle was suspected to have been knocked down by a lorry going in the same direction, following which they were thrown under the wheels. Both of them died instantly.  No eyewitnesses “The exact nature of the accident is not clear, since there were no eyewitnesses. The place where the accident took place is a potential accident hotspot, with the otherwise wide road narrowing down to a bottleneck. Making matters worse, there is disparity in levels and steep edge separating the surfaced portion of the road and its side making motorists, especially two-wheeler riders, highly vulnerable,” the police said.  Case registered The police registered a case invoking IPC Section 304A (causing death by negligence). The lorry driver was arrested and released on bail. Enforcement officials of the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) also visited the site and conducted a special drive in the area. “Many motorists were found engaged in rash and negligent driving. We asked them to offer flowers before the flex boards of the deceased youngsters to make them aware of the seriousness of their offence,” said Shaji Madhavan, Enforcement Regional Transport Officer (Ernakulam).  Eight squads He added that over eight squads had been deployed on the New Year’s eve to avoid accidents. “While we were able to check the number of accidents, we could not yet avoid the tragedy that claimed two lives,” the officer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/two-killed-in-accident/article33477521.ece

The court made the observation on Friday while dismissing a petition filed by Amina from Kollam, a candidate challenging the denial of her claim for special reservation in the category of Persons with Disability (PwD) for admission to medical courses. A State-level committee had found that the petitioner was eligible for the PwD quota, but not suitable for medical courses. Besides, a report of the special medical board said the petitioner was ineligible for admission to medical courses. It was argued that the medical boards had exceeded its powers in determining the suitability of students for medical courses. The government contended that the percentage of disability alone was not the criteria for determining the eligibility of a candidate for admission in the PwD quota.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/plea-against-medical-boards-rejected/article33477052.ece
02 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Accused in multiple cases held||The Ernakulam Rural Police arrested a man who was accused in multiple cases in various stations in the past four years under the Kerala Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act (KAAPA). Manaf, 30, of Keezhmadu stands accused in seven cases in Aluva East and Edathala. Among the charges levelled against him were assault, theft, and rape.

The court passed the directive on a petition filed by Shidhu T.D. from Thrissur and Antony Godwin Wilson, a donor from Ernakulam. According to Shidhu, he was advised to have transplantation of kidney. Since the kidneys of his close relatives were not suitable for transplantation, Antony had come forward to donate his kidney. Though they had submitted applications along with all documents before the local monitoring committee, they had not been forwarded to the district level authorisation committee. The district level committee has to examine the applications for transplantation of kidney as the donor was not related to the patient, as per provisions of the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act and Rules. The court also directed the district-level authorisation committee to examine the applications along with relevant documents received from the local-level committee after obtaining a report from the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Mattancherry, and take a decision on them in accordance with the provisions of the Act and Rules.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-court-relief-for-kidney-patient/article33477502.ece

Junction-Thripunithura metro rail viaduct, simultaneous with work on the viaduct, Hibi Eden, MP, has said. He was speaking after inaugurating a hunger strike by members of Thripunithura Rajanagari Union of Residents’ Associations (TRURA) at East Fort Junction on Friday, deploring the “inordinate delay” on the part of the Kochi metro and civic agencies in finalising road connectivity to the proposed metro terminal near the Thripunithura railway station. “The availability of other modes of transport is a must near metro stations. I will submit a memorandum to KMRL in this regard,” Mr. Eden said. Speaking at the valedictory of the agitation, Thripunithura MLA M. Swaraj said he would take up with Finance Minister Thomas Isaac or, if need be, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan the necessity of a proper road connectivity to the metro terminal. Thripunithura Municipal Chairperson Rema Santosh said she would strive to ready a new bus terminal proposed in the vicinity at the earliest. Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) had said it was premature to comment on establishing road connectivity to the metro’s terminal station at Thripunithura. “In such a scenario, commuters from Thripunithura, towns in Kochi’s eastern suburbs, Kottayam, and Idukki will have to enter the station through the narrow entry to the Thripunithura railway station,” said V.P. Prasad, chairman, TRURA. For the record, KMRL had laid survey stones on the stretch in the third quarter of the year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/demand-for-road-link-to-metro-terminal/article33477510.ece
02 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Activists warn of stronger stir||With the Thripunithura Bypass project making no headway even 32 years after land acquisition began for it, the action council constituted to surmount obstacles in its commissioning placed wreaths on a survey stone on NH 85, on Friday. It was the latest among the string of protests undertaken by the council against the inordinate delay in completing land acquisition for the project, the work on which began in 1989. “Little has been done at the ground level, despite the inclusion of the project in the Centre’s Bharatamala Pariyojana in November,” said Alias A.V., president of the council that is spearheading the agitation. With neither the PWD (NH Wing) nor the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) committing to develop the bypass, he shot off a letter to the Prime Minister’s Office in 2020. Subsequently, he received a communication from the Kochi office of the NHAI that the bypass had been included in the Kochi-Theni-Munnar Economic Corridor whose DPR was being prepared. “Wreaths were placed on Friday, hoping that it would open the eyes of politicians to the plight of a few thousand land owners and others who have been affected by delay on the part of government agencies. We also placed boards nearby, saying that the bypass project would remain in our dreams even if we die before it was realised,” Mr. Alias said. Addressing protesters, council representatives spoke of how there was much opposition to land acquisition for road projects. But that is not the case here, since people were willing to surrender land. Still, the project lagged for the past over three decades. Government agencies are not proactive in realising the project, which will decongest Thripunithura. The action council will step up protests and organise more wreath-laying protests if the authorities fail to respond, they said. They added that the bypass was a necessity, since several industrial units, including the Kochi Refinery, are located in its vicinity. Wide roads are a must to ferry goods from such units and to handle emergency situations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/activists-warn-of-stir-over-lag-in-bypass-project/article33477509.ece

Students were permitted entry on campuses after being screened using thermal scanners. Teachers had arranged classrooms in such a way as to ensure physical distancing. All friendly gatherings were restricted. The first hour of class was mostly used to explain safety measures and guidelines to be followed while on the campus. As part of the Education Department’s directive, classes were held in two shifts. All arrangements were made to disinfect premises and keep sufficient quantity of hand sanitisers for students’ use. Only drinking water was allowed to be brought from home to prevent the sharing of meals. Education Department officials said block-level meetings had been held under the leadership of people’s representatives to discuss safety measures to be followed in schools. It would be reviewed further, they said. Meanwhile, some higher secondary teachers have raised concerns about the COVID-19 guidelines issued. According to them, the directive to admit only 15 students to a class and allotting one bench to each student would not be practical in schools with limited space and facilities. The leaders of the Aided Higher Secondary Teachers Association (AHSTA) also highlighted the safety risks involved in case of students who used public transportation. They said the safety arrangements at schools would turn meaningless if the majority of students depended on public transportation. Sebastian John, a higher secondary school teacher and functionary of AHSTA from the city, said it would be difficult to ensure physical distancing among students and compliance with the safety protocol outside classrooms. He said Plus Two students who turned up for classes would miss their usual online lessons on Victers channel. “As we are now focusing on revision classes in schools, the TV sessions will have to be explained again for students using various online media,” he added.

02 January 2021||KOZHIKODE,KERALA||BJP reviews poor poll performance||Wrong choice of candidates and cross voting by rival political parties in many divisions led to the defeat of some of the nominees of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Kozhikode Corporation Council polls held last month. This is what the BJP district leadership, which took stock of the poor performance of the party in the civic body polls, felt. The party nominees could win only seven seats in the 75-member council even after securing 22.82 % of the total votes. At the same time, the vote share of the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the Kozhikode Corporation was 44.06 % and the Congress-led UDF, 31.79 %. The LDF and the UDF with their independent backed nominees, got 51 and 17 seats respectively. The last time too, the BJP had emerged victorious in seven seats. But this time, the party lost four seats - Beypore, Beypore Port, Marad, and Civil Station divisions, to LDF candidates. However, it was able to retain Karaparamba, Cheverambalam, and Meenchanda, and captured the Puthiyara, Chakkorathukulam, East Hill and Athanikkal divisions. The decision of the party to field former councillor Navya Haridas, who had won from Karaparamba, then reserved for women, again when the division was unreserved, not only helped the party win the seat but had a ripple effect on the neighbouring divisions of Chakkorathukulam, East Hill and Athanikkal, all won by the BJP this time. Ms. Haridas, who was credited with undertaking development programmes, won by a margin of 474 votes against her nearest rival. Besides, the decision of the party to field C.S. Sathyabhama, who was Congress councillor during the 2010-2015 period, from Athanikkal, also paid off. However, sources said that the decision to field former member E. Prasanth Kumar, from the Civil Station division, backfired. Also, a BJP member Jisha Gireesh had won from this reserved division for women in the 2015 polls. Had she been been a candidate, chances were that she would have retained the seat just like Ms. Haridas, they said. Interestingly, the party candidate Saritha Parayeri won from the reserved Chevarmbalam division, from where Mr. Prasanth Kumar succeeded in 2015 polls. Loss of three seats The loss of three seats – Beypore, Beypore Port and Marad, were unexpected drubbings the party received in these polls. All adjoining seats were won by LDF, which the BJP leaders attribute to cross voting by SDPI and IUML workers in the divisions to defeat their candidates. The last time Satheesh Kumar of the BJP had defeated the CPI(M) by 367 votes in Beypore port. This time, the party candidate Vindya Sunil lost by 399 votes. In the case of Marad and Beypore, the situation was no different. In the last election, Anil Kumar ensured victory from Beypore but this time, Sreeja Anilkumar lost the seat. In Marad, BJP councillor Ponnathu Syma, who stood again now, lost the poll by 14 votes. The last time, she had won by a margin of 26 votes.  BJP nominees could win only seven seats in the 75-member Corporation Council even after securing 22.82 % of the total votes||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-reviews-poor-poll-performance/article33476932.ece

The centres have been asked to remove the plastic dumped there and vacate the premises at the earliest. Corporation Secretary Binu Francis said that none of the units had the licence to operate and that they were all functioning under dangerous conditions. They had scrap heaped in unmanageable proportions, he added. The six centres were involved in collecting unsegregated scrap from agencies that bought it from houses and establishments across the district. They would either export it to other States or dump it at various places, said Mr. Francis. The Corporation’s material collection facilities at West Hill and Njeliyanparamba too are in a precarious situation, with plastic waste heaped up during the lockdown reaching unmanageable levels. “We had controlled the use of plastic in the city to a great extent from January to March 2020, after the State-level ban on single-use plastic. Our plastic waste collection per day had reduced to 10% by the end of February. But of late, it has increased to 40%,” said Mr. Francis. He cited the increase in door delivery of food by restaurants as a major reason for the increasing use of plastic. “Recently, we found that more than one lakh disposable cups were used in the city per day,” he said. The inefficiency of the Haritha Karma Sena in several wards had resulted in people handing over plastic waste to other agencies. “We need some time for enforcement of law, as our health wing is still busy handling COVID-19,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/six-scrap-collection-units-ordered-shut/article33476927.ece

On the last day of the year, the Customs Intelligence unit at the airport seized 2.596 kg of gold worth Rs. 1.32 crore from two passengers who arrived on a Jeddah flight. The gold in compound form was concealed in automatic hydraulic speed door closer kept in the check-in baggage. On December 30, the Customs wing, based on an input received from the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), intercepted a native of Bhatkal, a town in Uttara Kannada district, who arrived from Sharjah, and recovered four capsules of gold compound from his rectum that weighed about 635 grams and was valued at Rs. 24 lakh. On the same day, the Customs seized gold worth Rs. 95 lakh from a passenger who landed from Dubai. The passenger hailing from Kozhikode had concealed the gold in a waistband inside his pants. Officials said gold worth Rs. 73 lakh was recovered from international passengers in the past one week. The Customs wing also seized 72,000 cigarettes worth Rs. 2.25 lakh and 8.5 kg of saffron. Customs sources said that attempts to smuggle gold had decreased when travel restrictions were in place during the nation-wide lockdown that began in March. However, smuggling commenced again in May when the Centre launched the Vande Bharat Mission for evacuating stranded Indians across the globe. Bhatkal-based gangs Bhatkal-based gangs travelling in groups have been found attempting to smuggle gold on Vande Bharat Mission flights. Most of them operating through syndicates in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations, especially Dubai, reached the Calicut airport from August onwards. The seizures were made even from chartered flights that had secured permission to bring Indians who wished to return from other countries.

Andiyappu has alleged threat on his life from a section of Congressmen after his vote in the presidential election in the Kavassery grama panchayat was declared invalid. Mr. Andiyappu’s invalid vote had helped the Left Democratic Front (LDF) grab power in Kavassery on Wednesday.   Mr. Andiyappu said that he had forgotten to sign when he voted, and that he never betrayed the Congress in his public life lasting over half a century. He has sought the intervention of the Congress State leadership to end the threat on his life. ‘Tremendous pressure’ “It was unfortunate that I forgot to sign on the ballot in the panchayat presidential election. It happened because I was emotionally upset and under tremendous mental pressure when the polling took place,” he said here on Friday. The UDF had earlier decided Mr. Andiyappu, a senior member, to the post of president. But later the Congress district leadership replaced him with Anand Kumar following pressure from some quarters. The Congress leadership expelled him from the party after his invalid vote. “I did it inadvertently. And I am now being hunted down by a section in the party,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/congress-leader-alleges-threat-to-life/article33477593.ece

In the capital city, the dry run for vaccine administration will be held at the Poozhanad primary health centre (PHC), Peroorkada district model hospital and the KIMS hospital in the private sector. The dry run will also be held at the Vazhathoppu PHC in Idukki, Nenmara community health centre in Palakkad and the the Kurukkamoola PHC in Wayanad. At each session site, 25 health-care workers, who will be the immediate beneficiaries of COVID-19 vaccination, will take part in the dry run, to be held from 9 a.m. till 11 a.m. and is essentially a mock drill of beneficiary vaccination and reporting.

The schools remained closed during this academic year in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools were all geared up to usher in students for revision classes and practicals in preparation for the public examinations scheduled to begin on March 17, but not all students were upbeat. Thermal scanners and sanitisers welcomed students at the school gates. Inside, they headed in small groups of 10 and 15 to classrooms allotted to them in order to maintain physical distancing. Guidelines issued by the General Education and Health Departments were followed to make arrangements and guide students on the dos and don’ts. The first day went off smoothly. At Government Higher Secondary School for Girls, Cotton Hill, of the 1,031 total students in Classes X and XII, a maximum of 10 students from each division attended each shift. Classrooms were also disinfected at the end of the session. Parents had been asked to drop off and pick up students to minimise health risks to their wards, the school authorities said. Conveyance issues were reported from other schools too. With school authorities not operating own buses owing to difficulties in enforcing safety norms and many parents not in a position to drop off or pick up their children, a number of students failed to show up. Many students who depended on public transportation had to wait for hours. Crowded buses did not ease students or teachers’ worries, leaving them wondering about the risks of contracting COVID-19 despite precautions in schools. Students were attending tuitions where they were packed together on a bench, thus increasing the risk of infection, teachers pointed out. Their coming to school put other students and teachers at risk too. Also, students did not seem entirely comfortable coming to school after months at home, especially against the backdrop of the annual examinations. Some students had missed a few digital classes, while others had missed quite a bit. Even during regular classes, getting some students to perform at a par with others required a lot of effort. In the absence of such access to students, many had not taken these classes seriously, teachers said. The digital classes were making rapid progress, so much so that students were finding it tough to keep up with them. Some preferred to attend classes conducted by individual schools, rather than those telecast, they said. Bit low Even in school, the students seemed a bit low at the changed environment. The atmosphere of fun was missing. In many cases, so were their friends, having been grouped into separate batches and classrooms. The couple of months left for the examinations had also dimmed students’ hopes, teachers said, expressing hope that things would improve in days to come.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/schools-reopen-minus-the-cheer/article33477626.ece

The water treatment plant received power connection from the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) on Friday, enabling the launch of the trials, officials of the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) said. The process is expected to take two weeks to complete. If things go as planned, the plant would be commissioned in the second half of January. Although the commissioning of the plant was delayed by eight months due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Rs. 56.29 crore facility now comes as a New Year gift to the capital city. Tested for defects Over the next two weeks, all components of the water treatment plant, including raw water pumps, the Lamella Clarifier and the clear water pump house, will be tested for defects. “We have to be fully satisfied that all components are functioning properly. Work on the plant infrastructure had been completed in December. Soon after, the KWA had also linked the new plant to the transmission mains carrying water from the existing 86- mld plant and the 74-mld plant at Aruvikkara to Peroorkada and PTP Nagar in the capital city,” a KWA official said. Constructed by Chicago Constructions International Ltd under the centrally-sponsored AMRUT scheme, the project was initially scheduled to be completed in 18 months. The KWA had handed over the site to the contractor in October 2018, but the outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown and delays in making payments to the contractor hit the progress of work. Due to power connection-related work on the 75-mld plant, the operation of the 72-mld plant at Aruvikkara was halted on Friday. This had disrupted normal supply in some city areas. Pumping was restarted by evening. Restoration Full supply restoration of drinking water was expected by Saturday morning, KWA officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/75-mld-water-plant-to-start-trial-runs/article33477628.ece

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan announced the much-needed leg-up to the ailing film industry with certain restrictions. Cinema theatres could admit viewers only half to their capacity. Screening at theatres Managements should pre-screen visitors for fever and flu symptoms before allowing them into the darkened halls. They should insist that viewers follow the mask mandate and seat themselves in a spaced manner. The government had shut down theatres last March to stem the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The lockdown had severely impacted the film industry, resulting in a lower number of productions and a resultant loss of jobs. The administration has allowed religious places of worship to conduct festivals and religious events with a limited number of adherents from January 5. Sectoral magistrates and police should ensure that attendees should not number more than 100 for indoor events and 200 for outdoor functions. Mr. Vijayan said the ten-month ban on religious festivals had cost artistes dear. They had lost lucrative stages and opportunities to perform, driving many to poverty. The government also allowed swimming pools to open from January 5. However, only a minimum number of persons could train in water at a time. Expos too The government has also lifted the ban on exhibitions. Organisers should ensure that visitors wore masks and maintained physical distancing.

02 January 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Overall decline in crime rate in Anantapur||Anantapur police detected some key crimes in the district in the current year, boosting the morale of the force, though the loss of five frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic duties had cast a shadow and brought caution among the personnel. While there was a general decline in the overall crime rate during 2020, the nabbing of accused within 24 hours in the SBI outsourced employee Snehalatha case, or the unearthing of a huge quantum of silver (80 kg) and gold (2.5 kg) from a Treasury employee, at a time when the police were searching for guns or firearms, gave professional satisfaction to the force, said Superintendent of Police B. Satya Yesu Babu at the annual briefing on Wednesday. Achievements Filing a ‘Zero FIR’ against a person allegedly harassing a woman on a bus while they were travelling from Hyderabad to Bengaluru, was one of the achievements, he said. The district police received ABCD Awards for detecting some key murder cases and some national awards for leveraging technology in crime detection and prevention. Putting out fire in the Government General Hospital in the shortest possible time was one of the examples of using ‘High Alert’ App and putting behind bars a fake certificates gang kingpin Glenn Bricks, nabbing Chattisgarh-based naxalite leaders transporting detonators on the highway, and rescuing a Hyderabad-based dentist from the clutches of kidnappers did us proud, he explained. There were 24,636 calls to Dial 100 and all of them were attended and resolved in a reasonable time frame, with the first contact made within six to 7 minutes. ‘Cricket betting curbed in big way’ Cricket betting could be curbed in a big way with 307 cases filed and 584 persons arrested, confiscating Rs. 34.87 crore compared to Rs. 10.97 crore last year (in 68 cases). Conviction saw a surge due to COVID-19 violations, but the general convictions came down due to lesser number of days of courts working or police not able to produce documents due to COVID-19 duties, Mr. Yesu Babu claimed. Murders saw a slight reduction from 107 to 94, but attempt to murder went up from 199 to 200. The number of rape cases remained almost the same at 84. House breakings (225-191) and dacoities (5-0) saw a slight downtrend compared to last year. Anantapur Deputy Superintendent of Police G. Veeraraghava Reddy was present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/overall-decline-in-crime-rate-in-anantapur/article33477564.ece
02 January 2021||CHINTOOR (EAST GODAVARI),ANDHRA PRADESH||Companions of the sacred Sabari on tri-State border||For nearly two decades, the sacred river Sabari and a group of four migrant fisherfolk families have remained steadfast companions near Chintoor village along the tri-State border of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Chattisgarh in East Godavari Agency. The strong survival skills of the fisherfolk motivated them to make the river their permanent home by developing a tiny settlement by it. Migrating from Dowleswaram village in the Godavari delta in early 2000, the four families decided to make a living by taking up fishing in the Sabari, and are operating four houseboats in which they live as well as fish on the tri-State border. Their habitat now comprises four house boats, four temporary houses on the sands of the river, where four families with 25 people have settled, eking out a livelihood by fishing in the river. Survival “We have ten children with us. All of them attend school in Chintoor village,” says Volisetti Durga, one of the eight women who live in the settlement and join their families for fishing. The eldest in the settlement, Gudem Venkateswarlu, narrates how life is by the river. “Except the children, everyone including women go for fishing in the Sabari, covering the stretch of 13-km river until Konta in Chhattisgarh, Motu in Odisha and Chintoor. We never fish in the Sileru that joins the Sabari at Konta,” he says, adding that many a times, they go for fishing during the night. A majority of the day’s catch is sold at their settlement that is thronged by locals, while the rest is sold in Chintoor village. Another family elder, Volisetti Kamaraju, 40, says: “We never felt the need to return to our native place. Life by the Sabari is comfortable thanks to the low cost of living. Here, we have everything we want — water, fish, family and a market.” Post the floods in the Godavari and Sabari, many fisherfolk began thronging this area for fishing but later returned to their native places. “Recently, local authorities have sanctioned a ration card to my family. Our children have enrolled at the government school in Chintoor. Here, we have never faced any problems as the Koya tribe is always there to help us at any time,” says Durga, Mr. Kamaraju’s wife. On October 23 last year, Nutti Harikrishna and Nutti Vijaya got married on this settlement. The bride, Ms. Vijaya, belongs to Dowleswaram. “I wanted my marriage to be performed along the Sabari. We even invited our relatives and guests from outside for the wedding,” Mr. Harikrishna says. “I am happy to live in the houseboats and spending the days with my husband going fishing,” Ms. Vijaya says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/when-a-sacred-river-offers-shelter-livelihood-to-4-families/article33477352.ece
02 January 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Tourist spots come alive with New Year celebrations||After a long hiatus induced by the pandemic, tourist destinations in the district came alive on the eve of New Year as more people stepped out of their homes to celebrate the occasion.

Hundreds of devotees thronged the temple of Lord Pallikondeswara Swami temple at Surutupalle in Nagalapuram mandal, one km away from the Tamil Nadu border.

Chandramouli Reddy said that it was a welcome sign that the places are abuzz with people. “Apart from Horsley Hills, all other tourist destinations are now brimming with picnic lovers.

02 January 2021||Harish Gilai,ANDHRA PRADESH||An initiative to create win-win situation||On December 10, Disha Counselling Centre for ‘Women In Need’, one of the flagship programmes launched by the city police as part of ‘Neti Yuvathe-Repati Pourulu’ initiative, started its operations. An elderly person approached WIN and informed them that his young son is a drug addict. Very often he comes home and beats his wife, the senior citizen complained and sought help. The police teams resolved the issue within a short time. In another case, a girl student from a reputed college had been facing the problem of stalking by an unidentified person since five years, but was unable to approach police due to stigma. However, she had come forward and informed the WIN. The police caught the person and found that he was mentally-ill. Parents of the boy are mulling to admit him to a hospital for mental care. WIN, which was set up to solve women issues, is helping a number of women and girls, who are unable to approach police due to various reasons. The murder case of Intermediate girl by a jilter lover at Gajuwaka in November, last year, has sent shock waves not only among the general public but also the police personnel. After the incident, the police had immediately launched ‘Neti Yuvathe-Repati Pourulu’ to conduct awareness camps in educational institutions right from Class VIII to address such issues, especially for girls. However, again the attempt to murder a girl at One Town has led the police to come up with WIN. “If we observe cases at Gajuwaka, Vijayawada, One Town, none of these issues were known to police before the incidents occurred. Confidentiality is very important to many in this society. Many do not want to disclose their names. So the WIN was formed, where women can come forward and inform their issues. Their details will be kept completely confidential,” said Police Commissioner Manish Kumar Sinha. According to Assistant Commissioner of Police (Disha Women PS) and a member of WIN, Prem Kajal, the motto of WIN is to resolve the grievances received from women. The WIN works every Tuesday and Thursday, operates from Swarna Bharathi Indoor Stadium and includes three officials from police, GVMC and Women & Child Welfare. “Since December 10, the WIN team received 38 petitions which include various types of women issues. Out of them,19 have been already resolved and 19 are under counselling,” she said. Ms. Prem Kajal said that during the year 2020, the Disha PS had received 1,594 petitions. Among them 604 petitioners reached compromise and 217 petitions were registered as FIRs. Ms. Prem Kajal said that efforts are being made in all possible ways to ensure that women reach out to the police without any stigma in case of any issue. In the 23 police stations, 43 Mahila Mitra Coordinators and 294 volunteers are actively bridging the gap between police and women. Disha patrolling was launched in November along Beach Road stretch.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/an-initiative-to-create-win-win-situation/article33477675.ece

02 January 2021||KADAPA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Smuggling of red sanders, sand kept Kadapa police busy in 2020||Red sanders smuggling, illegal mining and transport of sand and gambling kept the Kadapa district police on their toes in the year 2020. The police cracked the whip against the perpetrators in a bid to keep the crime rate in check. The dense Seshachalam forest in the district has been a hotbed for smuggling of the high quality red sanders and its porous nature makes it difficult for the forest and police officials to keep a watch on the woodcutters and smuggling operatives. The number of smuggling cases rose by 10% in 2020 with the arrest of 283 people in 54 cases and seizure of 643 logs and 43 vehicles. In 2019, 223 people were arrested in 48 cases, apart from seizure of 887 logs and 43 vehicles. The PD Act was invoked against Lal Basha and Zakir Basha, who were wanted smugglers with international links. With the illegal mining and transportation of sand on the rise, the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) intensify surveillance on the reaches and seized 15,950 tonnes of sand being ferried in 688 vehicles, along with the arrest of 1,018 persons. The police got better its record as the seizure of sand was put at 2,781 tonnes and arrest of 860 persons in 2019. Cricket betting Gambling and betting on the cricket matches also saw a rise in 2020 in view of the IPL series that was held in Dubai. “We conducted frequent raids against cricket betting, matka, gambling and banned cock fights. In total, 1,360 cases were registered when compared to 1,728 cases booked in 2019,” Superintendent of Police K.K.N. Anburajan told the media on Thursday. Referring to the other policing measures, the SP said 454 persons, who were identified as ‘factionists’, were counselled. The police also conducted foot patrols, ‘Palle Nidra’, ‘Grama Sabha’, Nakabandi (surprise vehicular checking) . Crimes against women The police also laid a special focus on the crimes against women. As amny as 9,491 awareness programmes were organised and 1,438 facing eve-teasing charges were counselled. The police also thwarted 113 child marriages. A whopping 13, 679 women downloaded the Disha app on their phones. In total, 28 ‘Disha’ bikes were pressed into service for patrolling in every sub-division. As the impact of Covid-19 loomed large over the district, 642 police personnel on lockdown duty tested positive and eight breathed their last. Nearly 1,000 persons were evacuated to safety during the Cyclone Nivar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/smuggling-of-red-sanders-sand-kept-kadapa-police-busy-in-2020/article33476772.ece
02 January 2021||KAKINADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Green vending zones for street vendors identified in Kakinada||Authorities of the Kakinada Municipal Corporation (KMC) have identified several green vending zones (GVZ) across the Smart City, enabling street vendors to run their business without any disturbance to vehicular movement and parking. On Friday, East Godavari Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy and Superintendent of Police Adnan Nayeem Asmi inaugurated a green vending zone at the Mc Laurin College area and issued identity cards to street vendors to run their business with all the prescribed hygiene and safety conditions. Each street vendor has been sanctioned a loan of Rs. 10,000 under the PM Street Vendor’s Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PMSVANidhi) scheme and the State government would bear the one-year interest on the loan.

02 January 2021||KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||Bringing cheer to frontline workers||If the streets of Kurnool city are clean and people could breathe easy during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is due to the untiring work done by the ground-level sanitation workers and only when they are given the place they deserve, the entire system can be run properly, believes Kurnool Municipal Corporation. To make them feel wanted in society, and the administration cares for their feelings, Municipal Commissioner D.K. Balaji began a new tradition of celebrating the birthdays of all sanitation workers in a division on the last day of every month. “There were instances when they came to tears as never in their life their birthday was celebrated anywhere. We make them cut a cake, honour them with a shawl and present them with something that is useful for their household,” Mr. Balaji told The Hindu.  This small gesture brought a massive change in the behaviour of these workers in all the 15 divisions of the city resulting in a lower number of complaints against them. As a tribute to the exemplary work done by the sanitation workers during the COVID-19 pandemic when the Kurnool municipal limits was the hotspot of COVID-19 and the entire country’s eyes were on it, statues of an ordinary male and female frontline sanitation worker were installed at the busy Puchhalapalli Sundaraiah Junction to immortalise their contribution, he observed. Very soon an NGO will start composting wet waste from the city and give some percentage from the sale proceeds or contribute in the form of manure needed for the KMC’s parks. The door-to-door garbage collection would also be made more effective by bringing in a minivan adding to the battery-powered auto to remove all transit points. To reduce its carbon footprint, seven electric cars have been bought for the KMC officers and one of the best things to happen in 2020 was setting up of a Quality Control Lab that can check/audit civil and engineering works, which were hitherto done only by a third-party. Meanwhile, renovation of all KMC and R&B Roads within the city were made at a cost of Rs. 10 crore, Mr. Balaji said. Oximeters did the trick The fatality rate in Kurnool city, which once touched 28%, suddenly showed a sharp decline from July end and now it stands only at 1.05% thanks to the charity from Rural Development Trust, Anantapur, who donated 3,000 oximeters. “We equipped each and every volunteer and Ward Secretariat staff with Oximeter and began door-to-door survey every day to monitor the condition of those above 60 or with any comorbid condition. Any suspicion about anyone’s saturation levels, they were brought to a hospital, which saw a decline in fatalities,” Mr. Balaji observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bringing-cheer-to-frontline-workers/article33477566.ece

The new year dawned on a positive note as the caseload dipped to a new low in the region. The death toll too abated in the districts of SPSR Nellore and Prakasam. Only 19 new cases were registered in the two districts, taking the cumulative confirmed tally to 1,24,142, a health bulletin released by the State government said on Friday night. The number of active cases came down to 566 in the region as 1,22,492 patients have been cured of the disease so far. A little less than 60 persons were treated in the five designated COVID-19 hospitalised in Prakasam district, while 30 positive persons were treated from their homes. Only five patients needed oxygen/ventilator support. SPSR Nellore District Collector K.V.N.Chakradhar Babu said training for medical staff had been successfully completed for taking up the vaccination programme. In the first phase, the vaccine would be given to medical professionals followed by other COVID-19 warriors in the second phase and to those above the age of 50 in the third phase, he said after overseeing the arrangements for the COVID-19 dry run. Even those who have been cured of the disease should undergo vaccination, he explained. Overseeing the arrangements for the dry run, Prakasam District Medical and Health Officer P.Ratnavalli said 25 persons have been selected for the dry run from three medical centres-- Ramesh Sanghamitra hospital, Government General Hospital and the Maddipadu Public Health Centre. Though the health situation had improved vastly in the last two months, people should not be complacent. Social etiquette of COVID-19 times like wearing face masks and washing hands with sanitizers from time to time should be fully adhered to avoid getting infected, she cautioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/all-set-for-vaccination-dry-run-in-south-coastal-ap/article33477559.ece

The Forest Department declared the pelicanry open for the public on Friday (January 1). Thousands of tourists from Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Puducherry and other States visit the sanctuary, also known as bird’s paradise, every year. Due to COVID-19 norms, the tourist spot was closed for eight months. Tourists were being requested to follow COVID protocol while visiting the sanctuary, forest officials said. The Forest Department set up a park, environmental centre with the paintings and the sounds of the birds visiting the lake, washrooms and other facilities at the sanctuary. Thousands of birds visit Kolleru, the largest fresh water lake in the country, during winter season. The winged visitors will breed and brood in the mudflats and bushes in the lake and fly off with the young ones. Increase in numbers “This year, the number of birds in the lake was very high as Kolleru was filled to the brim due to heavy rain in the last few months. Many birds are roosting in the bushes and the water birds and other small ones laid eggs in the kikkisa grass and hyacinth in the lake,” said Divisional Forest Officer (Wildlife Division) C. Selvam. “The Forest Department, in association with State Bank of India arranged iron stands and created artificial mounds in Atapaka Bird Sanctuary for the winged visitors,” he said. Kaikalur Assistant Conservator of Forest (ACF) S.N. Siva Kumar said that pelicans, painted storks, ibis, stilts and other birds were sighted in big numbers in the sanctuary. “We are counting the birds every Saturday. The number of birds has crossed 10,000 in the sanctuary. Many tourists visited the bird’s paradise on Friday,” said Mr. Siva Kumar. “More than 150 iron stands have been arranged on the artificial mounds arranged for birds in the lake. Eggs were seen on some stands and the birds hatched the eggs on some mounds,” the ACF said. “We will treat the birds as our guests. The birds will visit the small water bodies on the lake-bed villages in Krishna and West Godavari districts, and we will not cause any harm to them,” says V. Venkateswara Rao of Penchikalamarru village. “We visit Atapaka Bird Sanctuary every year. Thousands of birds from Siberia and other parts of the country visited Kolleru lake this year,” said a visitor S. Varshini from Nellore ditrict.

Speaking to reporters on Friday, Mr. Deodhar said though it is obligatory on the part of the State government to respect the religious sentiments of Hindus, it is not the case in Andhra Pradesh. “While on one hand a massive temple for Lord Rama is being rebuilt in Ayodhya, instances of idols of various deities being vandalised are on an increase. This is the reason that I am praying to Lord Venkateswara to protect all the temples and their lands,” Mr. Deodhar said. Adding that he also prayed for the well-being of all, he cautioned the public not to be complacent and strictly adhere to all COVID-19 precautions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/protect-temples-deodhar-urges-govt/article33477585.ece
02 January 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Looking back at 2020’s impact on Tirupati temples||For the first time in a century, temples in Tirupati had to remain closed for months together in view of the COVID-19 situation and the subsequent lockdown triggered by it. It was exactly 129 years ago that Sri Venkateswara temple at Tirumala was kept closed only for three days for reasons unknown. The year 2020 witnessed the second such closure, that too for nearly three months, and the first ever since the formation of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) in the 1930s. Though the lockdown and the restriction on public movement was prevalent across the country, the standstill at Tirumala and the inactivity in Tirupati downhill was unprecedented and beyond anybody’s imagination. When the lockdown was partially lifted and restrictions on inter-State vehicular movement eased, the first thing that many Hindu devotees contemplated was undertaking the ‘long-delayed’ pilgrimage to the abode of Lord Venkateswara. “When we look back, the pilgrim footfall tumbled from 2.75 crore to a mere 80 lakh devotees this year,” TTD Executive Officer K.S. Jawahar Reddy told The Hindu . In an informal chat, Mr. Jawahar Reddy said that the average number of visitors, usually pegged at 20-25 lakh per month, slid to 4.5 lakh to 8 lakh this year. “Naturally, the Hundi collections took a dip from Rs. 1,281 crore to Rs. 500 crore so far this financial year,” he said. Rising to the occasion Rising to the occasion, the TTD management got down to providing meals to the stranded pilgrims during the entire period of the lockdown. Food prepared in the mammoth kitchens were packed into tens of thousands of packets and distributed among the stranded pilgrims, starving alms seekers and jobless workers during this period. As the TTD’s cash flow took a severe hit, it also had a cascading effect on its finances. In this tough period, thousands of employees had to take a partial pay cut, which was to the tune of 50% for the supervisory staff and 10% at the lower level. The health workers and security staff were spared, in view of their pivotal role in ensuring continued sanitation and enforcing lockdown. Going a step further, the TTD offered its accommodation complexes like ‘Srinivasam’, ‘Vishnu Nivasam’, ‘Sri Padmavathi Nilayam’ and Govindaraja choultry to be converted into COVID Care centres. The munificent gesture proved a boon for not only Chittoor district, but the entire Rayalaseema region, as the facilities were extensively used to isolate and treat the COVID-19 positive cases, which was crucial in tackling and taming the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/looking-back-at-2020s-impact-on-tirupati-temples/article33477587.ece

The Chief Minister received the awards from the Prime Minister virtually. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the Housing-for-All by 2022 scheme was of particular relevance to Andhra Pradesh as it was prone to cyclones, heavy rains and floods. Distribution of pattas He pointed out that the State took the lead in the implementation of PMAY (urban) and launched a special drive for providing house sites to 30.75 lakh poor people. Under this programme, 68,677 acres of land, including 25,433 acres of government land, had been plotted and distributed to eligible poor families. Over 16,000 housing colonies for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) were being developed in the urban areas, the Chief Minister said. PM thanked It was estimated that a sum of Rs. 12,410 crore was required for providing the infrastructure in the colonies. A total of 20.21 lakh houses had been sanctioned so far. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy thanked the Prime Minister for encouraging the State in this regard and also congratulated him on launching the GHTC for identifying sustainable, eco-friendly and disaster-resilient technologies from around the world for housing and construction sector. He said the State government travelled a great distance towards achieving the goal of Housing-for-All by distributing plots to all the eligible poor families and sanctioning houses to 67% of them.

Chandrababu Naidu has urged Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan to take steps for “restoration of democracy, rule of law and fundamental rights” in the State. In a letter to the Governor, Mr. Naidu, while drawing his attention to the attacks on the house of TDP leader J.C. Prabhakar Reddy, said there was a need to instil confidence among the people on the rule of law. “It is important to provide security to Mr. Prabhakar Reddy and his family while initiating steps to prevent such attacks in the future,” Mr. Naidu said in the letter. “Armed with swords and knives, Tadipatri MLA K. Pedda Reddy and his henchmen had barged into the house of Mr. Prabhakar Reddy, a former MLA, and attacked his house. The attack was carried out in broad daylight when Mr. Prabhakar Reddy was out of station. The MLA led the attack and Mr. Prabhakar Reddy’s assistant was injured in the incident. The police remained mute spectators. In spite of the availability of CCTV footage as evidence, the police, instead of bringing the attackers to book, framed charges against the victims,” Mr. Naidu alleged. ‘Instigating remarks’ He further objected to the “instigating remarks” of the MLA telecast in an electronic media channel. “A section of the police is actively abetting the attacks being carried out by the ruling party leaders,” Mr. Naidu charged in the letter. “If an elected representative from the ruling party is abetting violence, one can imagine the law and order situation in the State,” he said, and added that such incidents would not have happened without the tacit support of the Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-urges-governor-to-restore-rule-of-law-in-state/article33477577.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy of encouraging his party’s Rajya Sabha member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy and others to make false and baseless allegations against him for narrow political gains. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Lokesh said the charges being made against him by the YSRCP leaders had already been proved wrong in the people’s court. “They failed to prove the charges made against me with respect to the missing pink diamond at the Tirumala temple. It has exposed the hollowness in their propaganda,” he said. Stating that he was ready to swear in front of the presiding deity at Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple at Simhachalam that he had done nothing wrong and that the allegations were baseless, Mr. Lokesh asked the Chief Minister if he was also ready to swear by the Lord on the charges being levelled by his party leaders. The Chief Minister had no respect for the Hindu sentiments going by how he had not given the declaration of faith at Tirumala, he alleged. “Now, the YSRCP government has appointed a person with questionable personal credentials as vice-president of the TTD’s Hyderabad Advisory Committee,” Mr. Lokesh charged. ‘Media muzzled’ Mr. Lokesh also slammed the government for “suppressing the voice of the media” and cancelling the accreditations of the journalists through GOs. “Journalists and their associations have been removed from the accreditation committees. The voice of the media was suppressed by G.O. 2430,” he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-making-allegations-for-political-gain-lokesh/article33477574.ece

Speaking after assuming the office as Chairman of the Apex handloom weavers’ cooperative society in the State, he said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was keen on improving the living standards of handloom weavers. He had got nearly Rs. 130 crore released by various departments that owed the amount to the society, keeping in view the welfare of weavers. Referring to the YSR Nethanna Nestham scheme, which provides financial assistance to handloom weavers, he said Rs. 24,000 was credited directly into the bank accounts of the weavers who own looms, annually. The beneficiaries of the scheme receive a total aid of Rs. 1.2 lakh in the next five years. Mr. Mohan Rao expressed gratitude to people of the State for extending patronage to APCO fabrics even during the COVID pandemic times and said the department had done business worth Rs. 26.44 crore in the current year. He said the government move of collaborating with e-market giants to provide e-commerce platforms to the weavers to sell their products to buyers across the globe was a step in the right direction. Collaboration with e-commerce giants such as Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra would have a positive impact on the sale of weavers' fabrics, he said. APCO Managing Director B.R. Ambedkar informed that business worth Rs. 11 lakh was done through e-commerce platforms, and expressed hope that the sales would go up in the days to come.

In a statement on Friday, party State secretary K. Ramakrishna said the attacks on temples were on the rise ever since the YSRCP came to power in the State. As many as 125 idols had been damaged and 22 temples attacked so far, he said. Recently, the Kodanada Ramalayam, a 400-year-old temple at Ramatheertham village in Vizianagaram district, was attacked and the idol of Lord Rama was desecrated. Instead of nabbing the culprits, YSRCP Rajya Sabha member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy was attributing motives to the opposition TDP, he said. Surprisingly, Government Adviser Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy had suggested the opposition parties to speak about welfare schemes of the government, but not on such incidents, he said. Such incidents give rise to the suspicion whether the police department was functioning in the State, he said. The government should honour sentiments of people of all faiths, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpi-condemns-attacks-on-temples/article33477572.ece

It will be a part of the Industrial Information System (IIS), which helps the entrepreneurs in identifying preferred locations for their investments. A national-level land bank is being developed by integrating the IIS with the State industrial GIS systems, according to official sources. Plot-level info The IIS will give the entrepreneurs plot-level data and availability of updated land related information in real time. The other States where IIS is in the process of being created are Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Telangana, Goa, Haryana, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand. The State Industry Department is preparing to make land allotments as per the new Industrial Policy - 2020-23. The endeavour is to allot industrial plots only after pre-clearances are given and zoning is done, while ensuring that basic facilities are available. A crucial reform that has been introduced by the government is replacing the existing “lease and buy option” in the AP Industrial Infrastructure Corporation’s (APIIC) land policy with “lease + buy model” with low upfront payment, and the choice of buying land after 10 years of successful operations. The lease will be for 33 years. The APIIC is mandated to do environmental impact assessment for the notified industrial parks before land is allotted. The State has 300-plus industrial parks with prominent ones like Sri City (Chittoor) and JNPC and Brandix India Apparel City in Visakhapatnam district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/gis-enabled-database-of-industrial-areas-to-be-prepared-in-state/article33477581.ece

Organise some games like ‘anthakshari’ and musical chair. Later we go to Beach Road. But due to COVID-19, this year we celebrated in a low-key manner. But we hope that 2021 will be a good one, unlike the 2020,” said P. Sai Sumanth, a resident of Akkayyapalem area. Beach Road, usually flocked by thousands of people on New Year eve, wore a deserted look due to police restrictions. A large number of police were deployed along the coastal stretch right from Naval Coastal Battery to (NCB) to Rushikonda and BRTS Roads, to curb racing and overspeeding by youth. Patrolling vehicles were deployed at many areas which conducted surveillance to prevent gathering at public places. In a few areas, police made announcements urging people not to gather in the wake of COVID-19. By 11 p.m., most of the roads were empty, probably for the first time in the city. On Friday morning, a large number of people flocked to temples. Sai Baba Temple in East Point Colony, Sampath Vinayak Temple in Assilmetta. Since morning, especially college going students thronged restaurants, bakeries and coffee shops to meet their friends. Many eateries made brisk business with special offerings on the first day of the year. In order to meet demand for cakes, several shops arranged exclusive stalls to sell cakes since Thursday evening. There was also a huge demand for flowers at stalls arranged on roadside at Siripuram Junction. On Friday evening, a large number of people thronged Beach Road. Severe traffic congestions were reported. Similarly other tourist spots, including Kailasagiri, Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (IGZP), Rushikonda Beach and a few others also received good crowds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vizagites-usher-in-new-year-with-low-key-celebrations/article33477681.ece
02 January 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘Tumultuous year in recent history’||“From 1942 to 1945, during World War II, we saw large-scale migration of people from Visakhapatnam after the city witnessed aerial attacks by the Japanese on April 6, 1942. During the 1962 Chinese aggression, there were many people who lived in bunkers. In 1965 and 1971, during the wars with Pakistan, there was apprehension of an attack on the city. During the 1975 emergency, we saw democracy at its lowest. Cyclone Hudhud had brought the city to its knees in 2014. But never did we feel so helpless and our sensibilities so numbed, as we felt during 2020,” said Prof. A. Prasanna Kumar, former Rector of Andhra University. The professor’s statement summed up the year that just passed by, putting into perspective the emotional turmoil that the city and district went through during the pandemic. It was a challenging year for the district, especially for the administration, as it had to handle challenges like COVID-19 on one hand as well as other events such as the styrene monomer vapour leak from LG Polymers on the other. While frontline workers were on the ropes dealing with the outbreak of the pandemic, it was business time as usual for corporate hospitals who raked in money by charging exorbitant fees from COVID-19 patients. Rising to the challenge For the district administration, it was a challenge as the city was earmarked as a potential hub for the spread of the virus in the State. The district has a population of 47 lakh, of which 30 lakh live in GVMC limits. It has an international airport, two ports and houses a number of PSUs and important government organisation, which bring in a steady flow of visitors. But luckily, the spread was gradual and there was no sudden flare-up, observed District COVID-19 Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar. The main challenge was improving the existing health infrastructure, which was not ready to handle the pandemic. From just one case in March, there was a peak of 40,000 cases in July and August. By the end of the year, there were over 59,600 cases and 522 deaths. Within a short time, the district administration readied close to 7,000 beds with 3,000 beds connected to oxygen supply and 500 to ventilators, in around 22 Category-A and 20 Category-B hospitals. It also brought in close to 5,000 beds in COVID Care Centres. The high point was readying the CSR Block at King George Hospital (KGH) with 500 beds in just 42 days, said Prof. Sudhakar. The challenging was fighting the pandemic while losing boots on the ground at the same time. Around 20 medical professionals, including doctors and nurses, succumbed to the virus from the health department alone. Over 700 were infected in the police department and over 30% of the staff contracted the virus from the GVMC and district administration. Teamwork Probably for the first time, team work and convergence of departments was at its best. This aspect received plaudits from the British Medical Journal (BMJ), which appreciated the district administration for managing the pandemic through ‘convergence in an urban setting’. “We constituted 22 committees such as an isolation committee, cluster containment committee and testing committee, and each committee comprised experts and men from various fields and their task were clearly cut out. This saw the convergence of departments and it worked well,” said Collector V. Vinay Chand. On the bright side, KGH was selected for trials of COVISHIELD vaccine that has been developed by Oxford University, with Serum India Limited and ICMR as partners and the drug 2-Deoxy D-Glucose, a drug developed by DRDO. Styrene leak At a time when the pandemic was raging, the city was hit by the styrene monomer leak from the LG Polymers plant on May 7, in which 12 persons lost their lives and over 500 were hospitalised. The incident received global attention and sent shockwaves across the city. For people across the departments and for the general public – 2020 was a year to forget.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tumultuous-year-in-recent-history/article33477677.ece
02 January 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||COVID-19 vaccination: officials gear up for dry run today||District Collector V. Vinay Chand held a review meet with the officials on Friday to ensure implementation of the guidelines for the successful conduct of the COVID-19 vaccine trial run to be conducted in the district on Saturday. The Government ENT Hospital, Pradhama Hospital and the Regional Health Centre at Simhachalam have been selected for the launch of the trial run. A trial run was already conducted in four States in the country and in Krishna district in the State. With prospects looking bright for the vaccine being launched in India, the Central government has ordered conduct of dry runs. The method of transport of the vaccine, storage of the vaccine at the place, where it would be administered to patients and security at the storage centres should be ensured.  Waiting facilities He directed the officials to see that there were at least three rooms to provide waiting facilities to the public, administration of the vaccine and observation of the patients. The present exercise would be a dry run and there would no administration of vaccine or injections. It was only a mock drill and the public should be informed in advance about it. All the arrangements should be properly done just as in the case of polling booths in the general elections. Disposal of biowaste Only those whose names were registered in the list should be allowed at the vaccine centres. Only staff of the Medical and Health Department should be administered the vaccine. Those who were given the vaccine should be kept in the observation room for at least 30 minutes. An ambulance should be kept ready at the vaccine centre. The trial run would begin at 9 a.m. and measures should be taken to see that at least 25 persons were given the vaccine at each vaccine centre. Arrangements should also be made for the safe disposal of biowastes at the vaccine centres. Once the actual vaccine was received, it would be first administered to health care workers followed by frontline workers like Revenue, Police Medical and Health, Municipal Staff and Anganwadi workers apart from workers of other departments, who have co-morbidities. He directed the Revenue Divisional Officers to ensure that the Mandal Tahsildars properly understood the programme as the vaccination programme was likely to be conducted by taking each mandal as a unit. According to the District COVID Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar, as per the protocol SMS will be sent to 25 recipients for each hospital in the dry run. Once they reach the designated hospital the police officer present will check the SMS and the data entry officials will match them with the details and send them to the vaccination room. Post vaccination they will be observed for 30 minutes and in case of any reaction they will be given basic medicines and sent to designated bigger hospitals such as KGH for further observation. All these protocols will be observed in the dry run, said Dr. Sudhakar. GVMC Commissioner G. Srijana, Joint Collectors M. Venugopala Reddy and P. Arun Babu, Paderu ITDA PO S. Venkateswar, Narsipatnam Sub Collector N. Mourya, DRO A. Prasad, RDOs K. Penchala Kishore, Sitarama Rao and Lakshmi Sivajoythi, DM & HO Surya Narayana, DRDA PD V.

02 January 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||No cases booked during New Year-eve revelry in city||Not a single motor vehicle enforcement case was reported in the city during the New Year revelry, as most people remained indoors in the city. Police officials said that public cooperation towards their appeal to celebrate New Year in houses was extremely good. “On December 31st, 2019, three road accident deaths were reported apart from a few non-fatal accidents. Seventy-three drunken driving cases were booked. Beach Road was thronged by about one lakh people and there were huge celebrations and people burst fire crackers last year. This year, due to restrictions, there were no deaths, no injury cases, no drunken driving cases and no public celebrations. This was much needed during this COVID-19 period and it was possible due to cooperation from public,” said Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Ch. Adinarayana. The ADCP said that Police Commissioner Manish Kumar Sinha led the enforcement at Beach Road till late night. According to statistics available from CM dashboard, from December 30 to 31 morning, liquor worth about Rs. 25 crore was sold in Visakhapatnam district. This includes 22,459 IML cases and 11,210 beer cases. However, officials said that enforcement from police and Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) since the evening on December 31 had reduced the alcohol consumption.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/no-cases-booked-during-new-year-eve-revelry-in-city/article33477683.ece
02 January 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Place of worship ‘vandalised’ at Paderu||Unidentified miscreants allegedly vandalised the Padalu (sacred feet) of Komalamma, a village deity, at Vantlamamidi panchayat under Paderu police station limits in Visakhapatnam district. Though the incident is suspected to have occurred a couple of days ago, it came to light after police registered a case on Friday. Modakondamma is the main tribal deity in Visakhapatnam Agency. A large number of tribals from the district attend the Modakondamma Jathara every year to offer prayers to the deity. Local tribes believe that devotees should offer prayers to Modakondamma at Paderu and then also seek blessings from Komalamma at Vantlamamidi, who is said to be her younger sister. Condemning the incident, CPI(M) district secretary K. Lokanadham said some forces were intentionally disturbing the peace in the region by resorting to attacks on Hindu temples. He said that the attack on Komalamma temple was reported barely days after some unidentified miscreants vandalised an idol of Lord Rama at the Ramateertham temple in Vizianagaram district. “The State government should form special teams to identify these unidentified miscreants and put them behind bars,” he demanded. However, police officials who visited the spot opined that it could have also been a case of a road accident and not a deliberate act. “Komalamma Padalu is located on the ghat road near a steep curve. There is the possibility that an unidentified vehicle might have hit it late at night due to poor visibility in thick fog,” said a senior police officer from the district. Further investigation into the incident is on. The incident comes on the heels of the vandalising of an idol of Lord Rama at the 400-year-old temple at Ramatheertham, in Vizianagaram district. Protests over the incident are continuing to this day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/place-of-worship-vandalised-at-paderu/article33477588.ece

The rake was loaded for ACC Limited private siding, served by Thondevhavi station under South Western Railway (SWR), which is 944 km. The fly ash generated at NTPC stations, causes environmental pollution and also safety hazards. It is ideal for use in the manufacture of cement, concrete, concrete products, cellular concrete products, bricks/blocks/ tiles etc. The fly-ash is being transported mostly by road, which is leading to environment pollution. This freight train consisting of 59 Box-N wagons, transported 4,000 metric tonnes of fly ash. This would have been transported in 250 trucks if it were sent by road, thus making transportation via train eco-friendly and fuel-efficient.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/waltair-division-handles-first-fly-ash-rake/article33477592.ece

02 January 2021||VIZIANAGARAM/SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Major geographical changes for Vizianagaram, Srikakulam||Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts are expected to witness major geographical changes in the year 2021 with regard to their jurisdiction, thanks to the government’s initiative to create new districts in accordance to the boundaries of Parliamentary constituencies. Etcherla and Rajam Assembly constituencies of Srikakulam district will be a part of Vizianagaram district as both are currently under the jurisdiction of Viziangaram Parliamentary constituency. Parvatipuram, Kurupam of Vizianagaram district and Palakonda of Srikakulam district are currently under the limits of Araku Parliamentary constituency. The government is likely to create a new Parvatipuram district as the proposed Araku district would be located at more than 200 km distance from those constituencies. The two districts will be split into three districts. Former Minister and TDP senior leader Kondru Muralimohan suggested that the government should take the opinions of everyone as some had been objecting to the merger of Rajam and Etcherla with Vizianagaram district. “The government can make Vizianagaram and Srikakulam into four districts to ensure more development in the backward region since almost other existing districts have two Parliament segments,” said Mr. Muralimohan who represented Rajam constituency from 2004 to 2014. Srikakulam Backward Classes Association president P. Chandrapati Rao and secretary Badana Devabhusana Rao strongly objected to the proposal of including Etcherla constituency in Vizianagaram district. “Pydibhimavaram industrial zone in Etcherla constituency is the lifeline for the district. It should be with Srikakulam district forever. We will convey the same to the government’s committee when it visits the districts,” said Mr. Devabhusana Rao. Srikakulam BJP leader Hanumanthu Udaybhaskar urged the government to consider Tekkali Revenue Division as a new district since it would be convenient for many areas, including Ichchapuram and other border areas of Odisha. Meanwhile, the officials have been identifying properties and infrastructure in various places for the creation of districts in a smooth manner. The government’s committee is expected to visit Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts in a couple of months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/major-geographical-changes-for-vizianagaram-srikakulam/article33476767.ece

02 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Dry run of coronavirus vaccination today||A dry run of COVID-19 vaccination will be conducted at six centres in Hyderabad and Mahbubnagar districts on Saturday as part of a nationwide assessment of preparedness of State health departments to implement the programme when the vaccine is made available. It will be merely a demonstration and no physical administration of any drug for a few hours, said Director of Public Health G. Srinivasa Rao.

The health workers, who will undergo training, will be informed about the temperatures in which the vaccination is to be stored. They will also be trained in shifting vaccines from storage points to vaccination centres. The recipients of the vaccine will be made to queue up adhering to COVID-19 norms and guided to waiting rooms. For the purpose of dry run, the health workers and recipients will be drawn from the list uploaded on CoWIN (COVID Vaccine Intelligence Network) app. Principal Health Secretary Syed Ali Murtaza Rizvi said it is an internal administration measure to look at the system. Separately, Health Minister Eatala Rajender told mediapersons that 10,000 health workers will be deployed for vaccination. About 10 lakh persons will administered the vaccine every day. He refuted reports of a second wave of COVID-19 in the State and said the first wave was slowing down.

02 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||SCCL struggles to meet the targets||The impact of COVID on the coal business of Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL) is likely to be much deeper than expected this financial year, although coal production has crossed the five-million-tonne mark in a month for the first time in December. Production of coal in the first nine months of the fiscal remains over 30% less compared to the last financial year and it’s 33% less against the target set by the company for 2020-21. In the backdrop of economic and industrial activity coming back to near normalcy, the company management had planned to produce 6.2 million tonnes of coal in December at 2.1 lakh tonnes every day. However, according to the company officials, the production achieved during the month was 5.72 million tonnes. “For the first time this COVID-hit fiscal, the production was better this December (2020) than in the previous year with a nominal improvement of 0.07%. We hope to carry on the trend through the last quarter and reach as closer as possible to the last year’s production of 64.02 million tonnes, lest the production target of 67.5 million tonnes this fiscal,” a senior official in the production wing of SCCL said. Realising the fact that even meeting the last year’s production of 64.02 million tonnes is not possible practically as the production in the first three quarters of the fiscal is only 32.66 million tonnes, the company has decided to make the most of the remainder of the financial year so that business loss is controlled as much as possible. “The company has suffered a business loss of about Rs. 5,000 crore during the lockdown and it continues to grow bigger with every passing month,” an official source in the company said. Production this year is likely to be around 50 million tonnes, first time after 2015-16 when it crossed 60 million tonnes. In dispatches of coal to customers too, the company is lagging behind its plans and targets with over 31.4% lower achievement in the nine months of this fiscal compared to the same period last year. For December, the company had plans to send 5.73 million tonnes to its customers but could go up to 5.27 million tonnes itself, mainly due to low off-take (demand) from the customers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sccl-struggles-to-meet-the-targets/article33477475.ece
02 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||A year of consolidation on the industrial front||Telangana remained focussed on growth through industrial development in 2020 by facilitating operations at units allowed to function during lockdown, hand holding others when Unlock began while continuing to attract fresh investments. A frontrunner with a progressive, pro-industry approach, the State unveiled a clutch of policies, including one to generate more employment opportunities for locals, and readied a few more. “Most dominant thing was the pandemic. People appreciated the way we responded to [needs of] industries and IT sector,” said Jayesh Ranjan, Industries and IT Secretary. Telangana example was cited at the national level, how it ensured least amount or practically zero inconvenience during the lockdown to ensure functioning of pharma and other industries permitted to operate as well as the switch to work from home in the IT sector. “All paperwork was liberalised, no one was required to run around,” he said, adding once lockdown restrictions were relaxed the focus shifted to ensuring resumption of operations at other industries. Efforts were made to reach out to MSMEs and make them aware how they can benefit from Atmanirbhar Bharat as well as schemes of the State government. In partnership with companies, the State pushed for technology adoption by MSMEs. Enterprises, big or small, the “more digital tools they use, better their recovery process will be. MSMEs in Telangana are still not completely integrated with the digital world. So we took special steps to convince all companies and brought lot of digital tools,” he said. As a measure to help to small IT firms hit by the pandemic, the government decided to give them work such as development of portals and dashboards of its departments. Likewise, startups with products relevant to the government would be considered. On policy initiatives, the senior official said during the year policies on electric vehicle and energy storage; the GRID policy to promote growth of IT industry in rest of Hyderabad, especially eastern parts; and another to encourage local employment through additional incentives for investors were launched. For the IT industry, policies on Drones and Cloud Adoption were unveiled. Food Processing, Logistics, Grassroots Innovation and Social Innovation policies are likely to be launched by this fiscal. In terms of investments, Telangana received its largest FDI when cloud platform Amazon Web Services announced Hyderabad as its second AWS region in India, a decision involving setting of data centres at an estimated investment of $2.77 billion (Rs. 20,761 crore). Other prominent investment commitments received during 2020 include those from automotive major Fiat Chrysler Auto mobiles (FCA) on a $150 million global digital hub as well as from Medtronics, Goldman Sachs, drugmakers Granules and Laurus Labs, EV makers and RE firms Mytrah, Olectra and Eto. “If you compare, previous two years the numbers were much higher. This year was also good given the situation we were confronted with,” Mr. Ranjan said. While the pandemic could have brought everything to a standstill, it did not happen. “Some good investments came our way, we used the time to clear pending policies and ending the year on a very satisfied and optimistic note, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/a-year-of-consolidation-on-the-industrial-front/article33477616.ece
02 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||State’s GST collection in December up by 5%||The State has registered a marginal rise in the collection of Goods and Services Tax revenue during December but it appears to be still a long way to go for reaching the target set for the current financial year. According to the latest figures released by the Union government, the State reported GST revenue collection of Rs. 3,543 crore during December. This is 4% higher than the Rs. 3,420 crore GST revenue reported during December last year. The growth however continues to be on the low side as the GST collection had been adversely affected since the onset of the novel Coronavirus pandemic. As against the target of Rs. 32,671 crore GST revenue collection during the current financial year, the State could not reach even half of the target till November. According to the monthly key indicators for November in the Comptroller and Auditor General of India website, the State managed revenue collection through GST of Rs. 15,247.17 crore till November-end. This was just 46.67% of the target for the first eight months of the fiscal as against the 58.42% achieved during the corresponding period of the previous fiscal. The GST collections appeared to have picked up during October reporting Rs. 3,383 crore against the Rs. 3,280 crore of the same period previous financial year marking five per cent growth. But the GST collection showed a decline in the next month. The GST revenue collection dropped by five per cent during November from Rs. 3,349 crore to Rs. 3,175 crore of the current year. The revenue collection reported a positive trend during December and the officials are hopeful that the trend will continue for the next three months so that the gap between the target envisaged and the actuals achieved is not too high.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/states-gst-collection-in-december-up-by-5/article33477477.ece
02 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||City stinks for dearth of garbage shifting vehicles||On Friday, the first day of the New Year, the city’s garbage transfer stations overflowed with waste, due to scarcity of vehicles to transport it to the Jawaharnagar land fill. The term of hired vehicles expired on December 31 and has not been renewed by the GHMC, while the corporation’s own vehicles are too few to shift the entire garbage. GHMC authorities intended to hand over the component of garbage transportation from transfer stations up to the dump yard to Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited (REEL), the concessionaire agency for Solid Waste Management in city. However, despite promising stench free garbage transfer through state of the art vehicles, REEL did not have enough number of trucks to carry the brief, and had to seek services of the hired vehicles. Talks between contractors of hired vehicles and REEL authorities, mediated by the GHMC Transport wing officials on Thursday, have not reached any agreement in this regard. The contractors sought two days’ time to arrive at a decision. As a result, there were very few vehicles with large capacity to carry the waste from transfer stations up to the land fill, say sources. While trash piled up at all the 17 major transfer stations in city, the situation was especially bad at the ones in Lower Tank Bund and Yusufguda. President of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Employees’ Union (GHMEU) Udhari Gopal, however, blamed devious deals between circle level officials and contractors for the situation. “Thus far, officials were receiving kickbacks from the contractors to show inflated amounts of garbage, and with the latest decision, they are apprehensive of loss of income. That’s why they did not allow GHMC’s own garbage trucks to pick up waste from a few transfer stations,” he said. GHMC has condemned several of its vehicles, and is left with too few 25-tonners for transportation from the transfer stations. It is forced to depend on hired vehicles, which are now terminated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/city-stinks-for-dearth-of-garbage-shifting-vehicles/article33477464.ece

02 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Taking a resolution to fight for KBR park||Protests have erupted against construction of multi-level flyovers and grade separators close to KBR park yet again, following the shrinking of the Eco Sensitive Zone around the park. Citizens and environmentalists gathered at the park on Friday, and took a New Year resolution to protect the eco system of the city from the “unplanned and unsustainable” development by civic authorities. Messages written on recycled paper were tied to the trees in KBR park that are feared to be axed to make way for the SRDP project, using jute threads. The protesters drew rangolis using chemical free organic colours on the walk way, with the message ‘Save KBR’. Those participating in the protest included ordinary citizens, activists, walkers in the park, and NGOs. The Save KBR Citizens’ Movement is five years old, launched when the government initially proposed flyovers and other structures around the park as part of Package I in SRDP. They approached the National Green Tribunal challenging the decision, to which the tribunal responded by asking the government to demarcate the Eco Sensitive Zone. Following this, the State government submitted proposals restricting the ESZ from three metres to 28 metres at various locations around the park, evoking another round of protests. The expert panel under the Union Ministry of Environment & Forests, taking note of the public outcry, asked the State government to conduct a public hearing for demarcation of the ESZ. “Initially, it was decided to conduct a public hearing in February last year, which was not done. Later, they said they finished the public hearing, but could not submit the report due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The report is not being shared with the public. We have gathered here to renew our vows and keep the movement alive till the State government revokes the project,” said Kaajal Maheshwari, a city environmentalist working actively on the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/taking-a-ny-resolution-to-fight-for-kbr-park/article33477466.ece

A third vehicle ploughed into it from behind. Five others were injured. Uppal police identified the victim as Kaitha Ramchandar, a resident of Banjara Hills, who hailed from Medak. He used to work as a driver of a van engaged in film shootings. According to Uppal sub-inspector Mahboob Ali, the incident took place around 6.30 a.m. near the Sri Abhaya Anjanaya Swamy temple opposite Genpact office, when the victim was riding from Banjara Hills to Bhongir. The gruesome accident led to the severing of the victim’s body in half. “Four vehicles were involved in the accident. The DCM behind the victim’s vehicle was hit by other vehicles. An auto which was going towards Uppal was also hit. The injured in the auto are Kondanna, the driver, Kareemuddisa and Satyamma.

02 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||KCR should apologise to people: Bandi||Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party president and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Friday demanded that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao apologise to people, especially the poor, for the delay in allowing Centre’s medical insurance scheme of ‘Ayushman Bharat’ to be made applicable here. “Mr. Rao should explain why he sat on the proposal for the last two years when the scheme could have come to the rescue of scores of people suffering from COVID-19 last year. He should also clearly state why he is supporting the farm Acts now after bitterly opposing and even organising a bandh,” he said. Talking to press persons outside the Raj Bhavan after he led a party delegation to the Governor Tamilisai Sounderarajan, Mr. Sanjay Kumar denied any kind of new understanding with the ruling TRS in view of the latter’s volte face with regard to the Farm Acts and the Ayushman Bharat. “Our line is very clear. We will be striving to form the next government in Telangana in 2023 as people are ready to teach a lesson to the current regime. There is no need for any confusion about this. It is Mr. Rao who has answer for his ‘U-turns’,” he maintained. The Bharatiya Janata Party president also claimed that at least 20-25 TRS and Congress MLAs as well as corporators are “in touch” with the party but because of the “respect for democratic principles”, it was not acting in haste. ‘SEC owes explanation’ The Bharatiya Janata Party chief also wanted the State Election Commission (SEC) and the Government to explain to people for the reasons for holding Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls three months in advance and now dilly-dallying on issuing a gazette notification, swearing in of the newly elected corporators and holding elections to the Mayor post. “We have said it before and are saying it again - the State Election Commission is a puppet in government hands and this has once again been proved as he is only implementing the agenda decided by KCR-Owaisi combine. They are insulting the people’s verdict, murdering democracy and throwing constitutional norms to the winds even as people who elected the corporators feel cheated,” charged Mr. Sanjay Kumar. He said the party pleaded for postponing the polls but neither the SEC nor the Government paid heed. “They went ahead, completed the entire poll process in days and held the polls when half of the city was under water. What was their motive? Now, we have this unsavoury situation of defeated corporators attending official functions and underhand deals being stuck? Who are the real corporators - victorious ones or those defeated?,” he questioned and claimed that the daily efforts are being made to “entice our corporators offering crores of rupees.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kcr-should-apologise-to-people-bandi/article33477476.ece
02 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||A walk in the right direction||When Ronit Ranjan, life coach, NLP practitioner, author and fitness expert, all rolled into one, was on a transit halt in the city en route to his final destination, the indomitable spirit was palpable. He started a campaign asking the Ministry of Education to incorporate the mandatory mental health curriculum in Indian schools (classes 9-12). “The curriculum (non-graded) is not about adding more syllabus, but rather educating and sensitising students through dialogues, discussions, activities, feedbacks, exercises, and skill training. It’s high time that the trend of ‘observing’ a ‘mental health week/day’ in schools once a year changes to all-year round curriculum,” the 23-year-old said. Ronit, whose career with the National Defence Academy ended because of a spinal injury in 2017, says mental health is a hushed matter in several households. “With COVID, depression has further skyrocketed. Help is available but hardly availed. This is because we are never educated to recognise the signs and seek care,” he said. His walk, covering about 4,000 km from Kanyakumari to Leh, started on November 16 this year and in his journey, he will be meeting various government officials, making pit stops at schools, local government bodies, private institutions, and social activists, getting petition signatures, spreading awareness and working towards his cause. “My objective is to ensure that mental health should be accessible to all. As of now, I have covered 1,250 km, visited over 20 schools and colleges and have met 10 government officials from different districts of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and AP,” Ronit, who is now in Hyderabad, said. Currently, the spirited ‘walker’ has 18,641 petitions signed by citizens. His target is one lakh. “Once I reach Delhi, I will approach Union Minister for Education Ramesh Pokhriyal to present the petition. I would love to see the day when every Indian teen can openly talk about their issues, seek support from their parents and peers without being judged, and enhance not only their well-being but that of entire Indian society,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/a-walk-in-the-right-direction/article33477610.ece

02 January 2021||Hyderabad/Nalgonda,TELANGANA||Cong. MLA Rajgopal Reddy to join BJP||Congress MLA from Munugode Komatireddy Rajgopal Reddy reiterated that he would join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but did not specify when or whether he would resign as a MLA or not. He had made similar statements a few months after the Assembly elections in 2019 that Congress was a dying party and only the Bharatiya Janata Party was the hope. His comments at that time were seen as an expression of agony as he was not made Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader. However, after the Congress bounced back in the Lok Sabha elections winning three seats, including his brother Komatireddy Venkata Reddy emerging successful from Bhongir, he retracted, saying he would continue in the Congress. The sudden announcement that he would join the Bharatiya Janata Party in the near future saying it was the only party that can take on the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has not taken anyone by surprise, according to Congress leaders. “How serious he is not known as he would have to forego his Assembly membership if he switches to another party,” a senior party leader remarked. If he resigns Congress would lose another MLA bringing its number to five. ‘No issues’ Mr. Rajgopal Reddy also made it clear that his brother would have no issues with him for changing the party as they were two individuals. His elder brother and Bhongir MP Venkata Reddy has categorically stated several times that he was a staunch Congressman and would continue to be in the party. He is also in the race for the new Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president to be appointed soon. On Friday, on the New Year’s Day, he chose the Venkateswara temple premises on Tirumala hill town, and sharpened his statements. “I was the first one to speak about Bharatiya Janata Party prospects in Telangana, even though I am from the Congress, and it is coming true and I will still stand by it. I have also not attended any programmes of the Congress since. I would join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in future,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/komatireddy-to-join-bjp/article33477478.ece
02 January 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Farmers warn of intensive agitation||The speakers at a roundtable organised by the CPI(M) district committee here on Friday warned of an intensive agitation on the lines of the ongoing steadfast stir by farmers on the borders of New Delhi if the State government fails to drop its alleged move to close the procurement centres in the State. The roundtable attended by leaders of a host of farmers’ organisations has resolved to undertake mandal-level deekshas for five days from January 3 all over the district in protest against the Centre’s new farm laws and other “anti-farmer” policies. Speakers representing various farmers’ groups pledged their unstinting support to the agitation being spearheaded by farmers on the Delhi borders against the new agricultural laws braving severe cold wave for the past one-and-a-half months. They alleged that the farm laws enacted by the Centre will allow the big corporate firms to take control of the vast farm sector and thrive at the cost of millions of small and medium farmers across the country. Accusing the TRS dispensation in the State of contemplating to close the paddy procurement centres, they warned of a joint agitation by farmers’ organisations if the State government fails to drop the “anti-farmer” move. The leaders of the farmers’ wings of the CPI (M), the CPI and the CPI (ML-ND) and others spoke on the occasion. CPI (M) district secretary and Telangana Rythu Sangham State leader Nunna Nageswara Rao presided over the roundtable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/farmers-warn-of-intensive-agitation/article33477483.ece

02 January 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Centre must withdraw farm Acts: CPI(M)||Former CPI(M) MLA and Rythu Sangham State president Julakanti Ranga Reddy demanded that the Union government withdraw all the three farm Acts passed by the Parliament. Addressing a gathering at the district headquarters on Friday before commencing the month-long bus yatra in support to the ongoing agitation for the past 37 days in New Dehli by farmers from Punjab and Haryana, he alleged that the BJP government passed the laws with its numbers in the Parliament, despite serious opposition from farmers. “For the past 37 days, farmers are agitating against farm laws despite freezing cold. Besides, 37 farmers died due to the cold. The Union Government has been dragging the issue in the name of discussions. We have to stand in support of the agitating farmers,” he said, alleging that the Modi government is working to protect the interests of corporate organisations Adanis and Ambanis. The CPI(M) leader wondered how Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao changed his stance all of a sudden after visiting New Delhi. “Mr. Rao had announced during the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections that he would wage a war against the three farm laws passed by the Centre stating that they would harm the interests of farmers. Now, the same person says that the State government would not buy paddy and other crops from farmers. Farmers would be forced to revolt against the government,” he warned, and urged the Chief Minister to pass a House resolution against the Acts -- like that of other States. Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) president Chukka Ramulu, Rythu Sangham State secretary Sagar, Vyavasaya Karmika Sangham president R. Venkata Ramulu and others participated in the programme. The bus yatra will criss-cross all the districts for one month and the concluding programme would be held in Hyderabad on January 31st.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/centre-must-immediately-withdraw-farm-acts-cpim/article33477495.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao that procurement centres will be closed in the State. Addressing a gathering after unveiling the statue of former minister Ch. Muthyam Reddy at Toguta mandal headquarters along with party working president A Revanth Reddy on Friday, Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy said that the agitation would be intensified if the government did not withdraw its decision. “Mr Chandrasekhar Rao is friendly with BJP while putting up a show of fighting with that party only to fool the public. Party candidate Ch. Srinivas Reddy was defeated in elections with a mischievous campaign. Mr. Srinivas Reddy will win the elections in 2023 and fulfil his father’s dreams,” said Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy. ‘Where’s the MLA?’ The TPCC president alleged that the police and officials have been acting at the behest of ruling party and troubling the land oustees.

The minimum temperature recorded was the coldest in 15 years. The India Meteorological Department declared that the city was under the spell of a severe cold wave, but relief from the dipping mercury was on the horizon as light rain is expected under the influence of a western disturbance between January 3 and January 5. The showers will most likely cause a rise in the minimum temperature by a few notches. A severe cold wave is declared when the minimum temperature dips to 2 degrees Celsius or the departure is more than 6.4 degrees from the normal. The maximum temperature in the city settled at 19.2 degrees Celsius, which is normal for the season. However, very dense fog lowered visibility to zero metres at Safdarjung and Palam around 6 a.m. According to the IMD, “very dense” fog is when visibility is between 0 and 50 metres. In case of “dense” fog, visibility is between 51 and 200 metres, “moderate” 201 and 500 metres, and "shallow" 501 and 1,000 metres. The air quality also deteriorated on the first day of the year and settled in the ‘severe’ category. The AQI reading for Delhi based on the average 24-hour reading from 34 stations was 441. Faridabad, Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida were also in the ‘severe’ category while Gurugram was in the ‘very poor’ category. It has been a cold winter this season with November 2020 being the coldest in 71 years and October 2020 being the coldest in 58 years. December 2020 was the second coldest in 15 years with a mean minimum temperature of 7.1 degrees Celsius. On January 8, 2006, the city had recorded a minimum of 0.2 degrees.

02 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||New Year’s Eve sees 93% dip in drunken driving fines||Number of challans issued for drunken driving has seen a 93% dip as compared to last New Year’s Eve, data shared by Delhi Police showed. According to the data, 26 challans were issued for drunken driving on Thursday night as compared to 352 on the night of December 31 in 2019. The police said that a total of 1,336 challans, including 174 for dangerous driving and 706 for unauthorised parking, were issued. Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Manish Agrawal said that one of the reasons behind reduced drunken driving cases is people taking precautions due to the COVID-19 pandemic because of which there were comparatively less vehicles on the road, adding that another major reason was officials not using alcometers. He said that the force did not use alcometer since the outbreak of the virus and no drive was conducted. He also said that on Thursday night, traffic police officials on duty stopped only those who were visibly drunk or were drinking on the side. “It is very tough to stop people while they are speeding because we could not have used any alcometer on them and that there needs to be a basis to issue challan,” he said. Talking about the 26 challans that were issued, Mr. Agrawal said that the officials conducted a test with the help of doctors instead, in an attempt to ensure that those challaned do not contest the action. However, doctors were not available at all points, he added. Mr. Agrawal also said that the “campaign and appeal done by the media had a very good effect and the people of Delhi exhibited very restrained behaviour on the roads”.

02 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||60-year-old man arrested for duping people of Rs. 2.5 crore||A 60-year-old man was arrested for for allegedly duping people by alluring them to invest in fake cryptocurrency, police said on Friday. The accused has been identified as Umesh Verma. Verma was arrested from IGI Airport while he was returning from Dubai, they said. So far, 45 victims have complained that they were duped of Rs. 2.5 crore by the accused, police said. A case was registered after the complainants alleged that Verma, his son Bharat Verma and others induced them to invest in the scheme of cryptocurrency being operated by the accused under the name of Pluto Exchange, they said. The accused assured the complainants fixed return between 20 and 30% of the invested amount per month. They also promised commission on introducing more clients to the business. The victims invested money with the accused in 2017, a senior police officer said. However, the accused persons did not give the promised return. They closed their offices and ran away. Verma changed his residential addresses frequently and finally shifted to Dubai, the officer added. Key accused “Investigation revealed that Verma was the sole proprietor of M/s Pluto Exchange formed for the fraud. He was the authorised signatory in bank accounts opened in the name of the firm,” Joint Commissioner of Police (EOW) O.P. Mishra said. Verma opened an office in Connaught Place and convinced the complainants to invest in the scheme of Pluto Exchange cryptocurrency in November 2017, Mr. Mishra said. The accused hosted their own website and launched mobile application Pluto Exchange for the sale and purchase of their new cryptocurrency launched in the name of ‘Coin Zarus’. They induced people to invest on the pretext of giving higher returns and assured that their value would increase manifold, police said. Coin Zarus, in the form of cryptocurrency, issued by the accused company has no legal authenticity. The RBI has already banned such types of coins and currency in virtual form, he said. Escaped to Dubai After cheating the victims, Verma ran away to Dubai and started a new business of trading in essential commodities, they added. Verma was arrested in a gold smuggling case by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) in December 2017, police said.

The submission by the country’s central bank was made in an affidavit filed in the High Court in response to the court’s observation that instead of leaving it to the PMC Bank to decide which emergencies cited by its depositors were to be considered for disbursal of Rs. 5 lakh to them, the RBI should have been taking the call. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan had said that since the RBI has imposed withdrawal restrictions on the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank, the central bank should have been the one taking the decision on allowing disbursals on hardship grounds. “The RBI was to apply its mind and not act as a post office. If you [RBI] have imposed the restrictions, then you have to apply your mind. You cannot accept what PMC Bank says as gospel truth. You cannot leave it to PMC bank to decide to whom it will disburse funds,” the court had said during a hearing on December 1 last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/cash-withdrawal-from-pmc-bank-hc-raps-rbi/article33477433.ece

02 January 2021||CHANDIGARH,||In Punjab, stir reaches BJP leaders’ doorsteps||Protesting against the Centre’s farm laws, several farmers associated with different unions picketed residences and commercial premises of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in Punjab on Friday. Behaviour condemned Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said attempts by some protesters to enter the homes of political leaders and workers in support of the farmers’ agitation went against the spirit of ‘Punjabiyat’ and could not be condoned. Condemning such behaviour, the Chief Minister appealed to the protesters not to cause any harassment or inconvenience to families of political functionaries of any party. “Invasion of privacy of people brings a bad name to the peaceful agitation of the farmers and defeat its very objective,” he said. After months of showing exemplary restraint and not indulging in any violence or lawlessness in Punjab, as well as at the borders of the national capital, some protesters were losing their restraint despite being asked by farmer leaders to keep the protests peaceful, Captain Amarinder said. The CM cautioned that attempts of forcible entry into the houses of political functionaries, or picketing of their homes, had the dangerous potential of vitiating the atmosphere of peace and destroying the harmony amongst people of diverse castes, religions, communities etc., a move that was contradictory to the Punjabi spirit of harmony and unity.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/in-punjab-stir-reaches-bjp-leaders-doorsteps/article33477437.ece
02 January 2021||Ghaziabad,||Baghpat farmer dies at Ghazipur border: BKU||The cold wave claimed a life at the Ghazipur border on Friday morning. A farmer allegedly protesting against the farm laws at the Ghazipur border passed away because of cardiac arrest. In his late 50s, the deceased has been identified as Galtan Singh of Bhagwanpur Nagla in Baghpat district by the Bhartiya Kisan Union. Hundreds of farmers from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand are protesting against the farm laws at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border. Heart attack “Galtan Singh was at the protest site from the beginning. He suffered a massive heart attack this morning. He was taken to a private hospital where he was declared brought dead,” said Rajpal Singh, national vice president of BKU. Describing the government as “insensitive”, Mr. Singh said the government should repeal the laws and not make it a battle of egos. “ Sarkar ise moonch ki ladayi bana rahi hai ,” he said. On whether BKU could halt the movement for some time considering the drop in the temperature, Mr. Singh said even if the 40 leaders whom the government was interacting with returned home, the farmers on the ground would not return without their demands being met. “We have crossed that stage,” he asserted. “The number of martyrs has crossed 40 and considering the cold wave it could rise further,” he added. Later, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said they didn’t want to turn the death into an opportunity to take an aggressive stance. “We quietly handed over the body to the relatives. The local administration was helpful,” he said. “Despite provocations,” he said, “we are giving peaceful negotiations a chance and hope something productive would come out of the talks on January 4. I pray the government would work for the welfare of the farmers in the New Year.” ‘Bigger goals’ On the demand for a compensation to those who lost their lives during the protest, he said it could wait. “We have bigger goals, right now. It would be raised later.” Meanwhile, in his characteristic style, he said he had appealed to the farmers to walk for some time in the morning on the Expressway. “The area beneath the flyover is polluted and smog makes it worse. The farmers are not used to it,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/baghpat-farmer-dies-at-ghazipur-border-bku/article33477435.ece
02 January 2021||Mumbai,||Kangana committed ‘grave violation of plan’ while merging her flats: court||Actor Kangana Ranaut violated the sanctioned plan while merging her three flats, a civil court in Mumbai remarked while rejecting her plea seeking to restrain the Mumbai civic body from demolishing the unauthorised construction. A court in suburban Dindoshi dismissed an application filed by Ms. Ranaut last week. The detailed order became available on Thursday. Judge L.S. Chavan noted in the order that Ms. Ranaut, who owns three flats on the fifth floor of a 16-storey building in Khar, merged them into one. In doing so, she covered the sunk area, duct area, common passage and converted free Floor Space Index into habitable area, the judge observed. “These are grave violations of the sanctioned plan for which the permission of the competent authority is required,” the court said. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation had in March 2018 issued a notice to the actor for “unauthorised constructions” at her Khar flats. Another notice asked her to restore the structure to its original position as per the original plan, warning that otherwise the unauthorised portion will be demolished. Ms. Ranaut challenged the demolition notice and requested the court to restrain the civic body from carrying out demolition. The court then ordered status-quo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/kangana-committed-grave-violation-of-plan-while-merging-her-flats-court/article33476990.ece

During the same period in 2020, the registrations grew to 12,56,224 and the revenue earned was Rs. 9,622 crore. State Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat said, “The government reduced stamp duty to boost the real estate market, which was facing a slowdown due to COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown. It gave excellent results and the State Treasury has benefited from it.” He said even the Centre praised the move and has appealed to other States to follow Maharashtra’s example. “It kicked off transactions which were halted due to the pandemic. It helped both builders and buyers as the dream to buy a house in Mumbai, Pune and other big cities turned out to be a reality,” Mr. Thorat said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/stamp-duty-cut-led-to-rise-in-revenue-says-thorat/article33476993.ece
02 January 2021||Mumbai,||Efficiency of Mumbai Police beyond doubt: CM||Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday praised the Mumbai Police saying nobody can raise a question mark over their efficiency, and added that he would never allow anyone to malign their image. He said the police force led from the front during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to ensure the safety of people. Mr. Thackeray was speaking at a programme held at the Mumbai Police Commissioner’s office, in which stolen belongings recovered by the police were returned to the owners. “There is no end to the accomplishments of the Mumbai Police and the tradition of policing dates back to 150 years. With this long tradition and their efficiency, no matter how much one tries, he will not be able to malign their image and I promise that if anyone attempts to do so, I will not allow that to happen,” he said. “The mouths of those who tried to defame the Mumbai Police were shut as the police’s accomplishments are huge,” he said. “During the pandemic, police worked hard, due to which thousands of these personnel contracted the infection, with some of them getting martyred in the line of duty,” he added. Later, speaking at the launch of an e-pledge initiative, ‘Majhi Vasundhara’, for environment protection and conservation, Mr. Thackeray said that the need of the hour was to make environment protection a people’s movement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/efficiency-of-mumbai-police-beyond-doubt-cm/article33477000.ece

02 January 2021||Navi Mumbai,||Four held for killing friend||The Rabale police have arrested four men who allegedly killed their friend while ringing in the new year. On Thursday night, Santosh Gaikwad (25), Shankar Gaikwad (23), Rohit Jumade (22), and Akash Gaikwad (20), who lived in the same locality and worked as drivers, were were partying and drinking alcohol with their friend Sachin Patil (35). According to the police, Patil was in charge of maintenance of a garden in a private company. At 1.45 a.m. on Friday, Akash went to relieve himself near the compound wall of a house and Patil objected to this. “A quarrel broke out and the other friends joined Akash in beating up Patil,” senior police inspector Nitin Gite said. Patil sustained head and abdominal injuries, and internal bleeding. His wife and another friend rushed him to hospital, where he was declared dead. Initially, an accidental death case was filed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/four-held-for-killing-friend/article33476994.ece

02 January 2021||Pune,||Aurangabad renaming row: BJP hits out at Congress, Sena||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has hit out at the ruling Congress and the Shiv Sena over renaming Aurangabad city as Sambhajinagar. The party said it was just a game of political ‘arm-wrestling’ between the two coalition partners of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said the Sena typically kicked up the emotive ‘Sambhajinagar’ issue just before local elections, only to jettison its soon afterwards. “It hardly matters if the Congress opposes or supports the renaming issue. However, the Sena conveniently raises it before any election, and then just as conveniently sets it aside,” said Mr. Fadnavis. On Thursday, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee chief Balasaheb Thorat ruffled feathers by remarking that his party would strongly oppose any proposal to rename Aurangabad. He said changing names of places was not a part of the Common Minimum Programme of the MVA government. “If any proposal about renaming Aurangabad as ‘Sambhajinagar’ comes up, then the Congress, despite being part of the MVA, will oppose it strongly as our party firmly believes that such actions do not lead to any development,” Mr. Thorat had said. Meanwhile, BJP State president Chandrakant Patil said the friction between the Congress and the Sena over the renaming issue was clear proof of the sheer lack of cohesion between the MVA partners. “Frankly, we could not care less whether the Congress opposes it or the Sena wants Aurangabad to be renamed. For the BJP, the renaming of Aurangabad to Sambhajinagar is an article of faith and not an electoral issue. We are firm that the city should be renamed,” Mr. Patil said. He pointed out that the proposal to rename Aurangabad to Sambhajinagar had first originated from late Sena founder Bal Thackeray. Rebuking the Congress, Mr. Patil feigned surprise that the former still had any ‘love’ for the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. “Do the Congress have any affection for Aurangzeb that it should oppose the renaming of Aurangabad to Sambhajinagar [proposed to be renamed after Chhatrapati Sambhaji, who was slain at the behest of Aurangzeb],” Mr. Patil said.  The Shiv Sena conveniently raises the issue before any election, and then just as conveniently sets it aside Devendra Fadnavis Leader of Opposition||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/aurangabad-renaming-row-bjp-hits-out-at-congress-sena/article33476995.ece
02 January 2021||Pune,||‘Maharashtra mulling setting up modern jails’||To resolve the problem of overcrowding in prisons, the Maharashtra government is planning to set up modern jails, State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said on Friday. The proposal is for seven to eight new facilities to be set up in different cities, including one each in Pune’s Pimpri-Chinchwad and Mumbai, Mr. Deshmukh said during his visit to Yerwada Central Jail. “All jails are currently overcrowded. A proposal to decongest them was recently tabled before Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. It speaks of establishing multi-storeyed jails as in countries abroad, where undertrial prisoners can be housed as well,” he said. The State has more than 30,000 inmates in 45-odd jails, with an excess of nearly 10,000 than the actual holding capacity. Mr. Deshmukh said the State government’s move of releasing around 11,000 inmates on temporary parole during the COVID-19 pandemic helped stave off the contagion to a large extent. “While there were COVID-19 cases inside prisons, all were successfully treated,” he said, adding that besides the proposal to build modern jails, a plan for housing for police personnel was also under way. On Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis’s remarks that Maharashtra Director General of Police Subodh Kumar Jaiswal chose the Central deputation as CISF chief over his position in the State, Mr. Deshmukh said, “Mr. Fadnavis criticises us [the ruling MVA government] even if we do good work. It is the Opposition’s job to criticise. If he does not do so, the BJP will be irrelevant in Maharashtra.” Mr. Fadnavis had earlier said Mr. Jaiswal’s choice would demoralise the police force. On Thursday night, Mr. Deshmukh had visited the police control room in Pune where he received calls from citizens. He also congratulated police personnel for their remarkable work during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-mulling-setting-up-modern-jails/article33476996.ece
02 January 2021||SAN DIEGO,||Trump extends visa ban until March 31||President Donald Trump on Thursday extended pandemic-related bans on green cards and work visas to large groups of applicants through March 31, while a federal appeals court sided with him on a rule that requires new immigrants to have their own health insurance. The twin developments on the final day of 2020 encapsulated how Mr. Trump has made U.S. immigration policy more restrictive without support from Congress. Biden’s promise President-elect Joe Biden has promised to undo many of Mr. Trump’s actions but it is unclear how quickly and even to what extent. Federal judges have limited the impact of the pandemic-related visa bans, which were set to expire on Thursday. Mr. Biden, who is now forced to decide when and whether to lift them after taking office January 20, doesn’t specifically address the issue in his immigration platform. Mr. Biden also doesn’t directly address the health-insurance requirement in his platform. In April, Mr. Trump imposed a ban on green cards issued abroad that largely targets family members of people already in the U.S. After a surprisingly chilly reception from immigration hawks, the administration went much further in June by adding H-1B visas, which are widely used by American and Indian technology company workers and their families; H-2B visas for nonagricultural seasonal workers; J-1 visas for cultural exchanges; and L-1 visas for managers and other key employees of multinational corporations. Mr. Trump said the measures would protect American jobs in a pandemic-wracked economy, while business groups said they would hamper a recovery. “The effects of COVID-19 on the U.S. labour market and on the health of American communities is a matter of ongoing national concern,” Mr. Trump’s proclamation on Thursday read. On asylum-seekers By contrast, the administration’s edict to immediately expel asylum-seekers and others who cross the border illegally from Mexico was justified on grounds of containing the coronavirus, though reporting by The Associated Press and others found that government scientists saw no evidence for it. A temporary ban on non-essential travel across the Mexican and Canadian borders was also done for public health. In its ruling issued on Thursday, a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel voted 2-1 to clear the way for Mr. Trump’s requirement that immigrants have health insurance. New immigrants must demonstrate they can obtain coverage within 30 days and pay their medical expenses. A Federal Judge blocked the rule from taking effect almost immediately after it was announced in October 2019. Judge Daniel P. Collins, a Trump appointee, wrote that the President acted within his authority, relying largely on the Supreme Court’s ruling that upheld Mr. Trump’s travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries. He was joined by Judge Jay Bybee, who was appointed by President George W. Bush. Judge A. Wallace Tashima, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, dissented, calling the policy “a major overhaul of this nation’s immigration laws without the input of Congress — a sweeping and unprecedented exercise of unilateral Executive power.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-extends-visa-ban-until-march-31/article33476676.ece
02 January 2021||LONDON,||U.K. in ‘eye of storm’ as cases surge||British hospitals around the country face a perilous situation in January, medical workers warned Friday amid surging coronavirus infections blamed on a new virus variant. Authorities pressed to reactivate field hospitals previously mothballed just to handle the crush of new patients. Concerns are mounting about the ability of the already stretched National Health Service to cope with the anticipated increase in people seeking treatment for COVID-19 infections. On Friday, the U.K. recorded another 53,285 new infections, down slightly from the previous day’s record high of 55,892. Although comparisons with the outset of the pandemic are difficult given that testing was limited in the spring, the U.K. has recorded its four highest daily new infection numbers over the past four days — all above 50,000 and around double the daily number of a few weeks ago. The Royal College of Nursing’s England director, Mike Adams, said that the U.K. was in the “eye of the storm” and that it was “infuriating” to see people not following social distancing guidance or wearing masks. A leading physician also warned of burnout among health workers on the front line of the outbreak in hospitals, while also urging people to follow the rules. “I am worried,” Adrian Boyle, vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said. “We are very much at battle stations.” New infections have more than doubled in recent weeks after a new variant that is said to be around 70% more contagious was found to be behind a big spike in cases around London and the southeast of England. Around 1 million people have received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, with a small minority also getting the second dose as planned after 21 days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uk-in-eye-of-storm-as-cases-surge/article33476675.ece
02 January 2021||WASHINGTON,||‘Dangerous ploy to fight Biden win’||Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska has issued a pointed rebuke of GOP attempts to object January 6 to the Electoral College tally of the presidential election, warning colleagues against a “dangerous ploy” that could damage the nation’s civic traditions. Mr. Sasse, a potential 2024 presidential contender, posted a lengthy explanation on Thursday of his views on social media, including a paragraph by paragraph dismantling of allegations of voter fraud in key States won by President-elect Joe Biden. Mr. Sasse said he felt compelled to speak “truth” as constituents and those supporting President Donald Trump wanted to know where he stands on the issue. “I will not be participating in a project to overturn the election,” Mr. Sasse wrote. He said he wanted to explain “why I have been urging my colleagues also to reject this dangerous ploy.” The missive from Mr. Sasse offers the Republican Party a different path for the post-Trump era, in stark contrast to other Republicans — most notably, Senator Josh Hawley, — who are leading the challenge during next week’s joint session of Congress. Mr. Hawley became the first GOP Senator this week to announce he will raise objections when Congress meets to affirm Mr. Biden’s victory in the election, forcing House and Senate votes that are likely to delay — but in no way alter — the final certification of Mr. Biden’s win. Other Republican senators are expected to join Mr. Hawley, wary of ceding the spotlight to him as they, too, try to emerge as leaders in a post-Trump era. Some Republicans in the Democratic-majority House have already said they will object on Mr. Trump’s behalf during the January 6 count of electoral votes, and they had needed just a single Senator to go along with them to force votes in both chambers. “Since Election Day, the president and his allied organizations have raised well over half a billion (billion!) dollars from supporters... But in reality, they’re just giving the President and his allies a blank check that can go to their super-PACs, their next plane trip, their next campaign or project. That’s not serious governing. It’s swampy politics,” he wrote.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/dangerous-ploy-to-fight-biden-win/article33476665.ece
02 January 2021||Tehran,||‘Soleimani killers not safe on Earth’||Iran's judiciary chief warned on Friday that Qasem Soleimani’s killers will “not be safe on Earth”, as the Islamic republic began marking the first anniversary of the top General's assassination in a U.S. strike. Ebrahim Raisi, speaking at an event in Tehran to pay tribute to Soleimani, said not even U.S. President Donald Trump, who ordered the strike, was “immune from justice". Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike at Baghdad airport on January 3, ratcheting up tensions between decades-old arch foes the United States and Iran. “They will witness a severe revenge. What has come so far has only been glimpses" of it, Mr. Raisi told the gathering at Tehran University. “Do not presume that someone, as the President of America, who appeared as a murderer or ordered a murder, may be immune from justice being carried out. Never,” he said. “Those who had a role in this in this assassination and crime will not be safe on Earth.” The event was attended by Iranian officials, and speakers included representatives from allied regional countries and forces, namely Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen. A separate event is expected to be held in the coming days in Kerman, Soleimani's hometown where he is buried. Soleimani headed the Quds force, the foreign operations arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Top Iranian authorities, including supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had previously said that all those involved in his killing would face retribution. Days after Soleimani’s killing, Iran launched a volley of missiles at Iraqi bases housing U.S. and other coalition troops, with Mr. Trump refraining from any further military response. The Iranian leadership has called the strikes a “slap” and vowed that "severe revenge" awaits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/soleimani-killers-not-safe-on-earth/article33476668.ece
02 January 2021||Karachi,||Petition against Sindh govt.’s refusal to free Pearl’s killers||The lawyers for British-born al-Qaeda leader Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and his three aides have filed an appeal petition in a Pakistani court against the refusal of the authorities to release them from jails despite their convictions in the kidnapping and murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl being set aside last month. In a surprise move, a two-judge bench of the Sindh High Court on December 24 directed security agencies not to keep Sheikh and other accused under “any sort of detention” and declared all notifications of the Sindh government related to their detention “null and void”. However, the provincial and jail authorities have not released them as yet. On Thursday, the lawyers for the four accused filed an appeal in the Sindh High Court and also asked for contempt proceedings against the provincial and jail authorities, following which the court issued notices to the two authorities for a hearing on January 7. In April, a two-judge Sindh High Court bench commuted the death sentence of 46-year-old Sheikh to seven years imprisonment. The court also acquitted his three aides, who were serving life terms in the case — almost two decades after they were found guilty and jailed. Keeping public order However, the Sindh government refused to release them and kept them in detention under the Maintenance of Public Order. Their continuous detention was challenged in the Sindh High Court, which ordered their release last week. However, the Sindh government said it will not release them in view of the Supreme Court’’s September 28 order. A three-judge apex court bench , which is hearing the appeal by the Sindh government and the family of the slain journalist, on September 28 noted that till the next date of hearing, the accused shall not be released.  Early this week, the U.S. said it is ready to take custody of Sheikh, asserting that Washington will not allow him to evade justice. Sheikh, along with Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar, was released by India in 1999 and given safe passage to Afghanistan in exchange for the nearly 150 passengers of hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/petition-against-sindh-govts-refusal-to-free-pearls-killers/article33476662.ece
02 January 2021||Seoul,||In a hand-written letter, Kim thanks N. Koreans for support||Kim Jong-un thanked North Koreans for supporting his leadership in “difficult times” in a rare hand-written New Year letter released on Friday ahead of a crucial ruling party congress that will set the country’s economic goals. The personal message came after the isolated North put on a performance featuring fireworks, singing and dancing in Pyongyang’s Kim Il-sung Square to usher in the new year, despite the coronavirus pandemic, which the North insists has yet to reach its shores. Mr. Kim usually delivers a televised speech on January 1 that is scrutinised by Korea-watchers for signs of where the reclusive state is headed in the new year. But he skipped the occasion last year, replacing it with an address he had delivered at a party meeting the previous year. It is widely expected that he will again drop the televised speech this year ahead of the country’s first congress in five years. State media have said the event will be held in early January but have yet to specify the exact dates. “I sincerely wish all the families across the country greater happiness and beloved people, good health,” Mr. Kim said. “In the new year, too, I will work hard to bring earlier the new era in which the ideals and desires of our people will come true. “I offer thanks to the people for having invariably trusted and supported our Party even in the difficult times,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/in-a-hand-written-letter-kim-thanks-n-koreans-for-support/article33476670.ece
02 January 2021||Kabul,||Gunmen shoot dead Afghan radio journalist in car ambush||An Afghan radio journalist was shot dead on Friday in a car ambush in the central province of Ghor, officials said, the fifth media worker to be killed in two months. Besmullah Adel Aimaq, editor-in-chief of Voice of Ghor radio, was killed en route to Firoz Koh city, the capital of Ghor province, said Aref Aber, the governor’s spokesman. In recent months, other prominent Afghans have been ambushed by gunmen or killed in bomb attacks. No group has yet claimed responsibility for Aimaq’s murder. The Afghan Journalists Safety Committee, a group working for the security of journalists in the violence-wracked country, confirmed the incident. It comes weeks after the December 12 killing of Rahmatullah Nekzad, who was shot dead with a silenced pistol near his home in the restive eastern city of Ghazni. Two Taliban inmates who were freed ahead of peace talks between the insurgents and the Afghan government have been arrested in connection with Nekzad’s murder, Afghanistan’s spy agency the National Directorate of Security (NDS) said late on Thursday. About 5,000 Taliban inmates were released last year as part of a contentious prisoner swap ahead of the long-delayed peace talks that finally commenced on September 12. The NDS said that after their release the two Taliban inmates joined a “terrorist group” in Ghazni which has carried out several assassinations. The two, who have confessed to their crimes, had also assassinated a judge and two government employees, the agency said. The Taliban had denied responsibility for the murder of Nekzad. Peace talks are currently on a break, but are due to resume on January 5 in Doha.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/gunmen-shoot-dead-afghan-radio-journalist-in-car-ambush/article33476666.ece

Their development model suits Pakistan the best,” Mr. Khan said while speaking at a ceremony in Islamabad. “The speed with which China developed in the last 30 years is something we can learn from,” he added. Mr. Khan said that Beijing had managed to prove that poverty alleviation is real development. “The way they industrialised, made special export zones, brought investments from abroad, and used those investments to increase their exports, all resulted in China increasing its wealth,” he said. “They used that money to bring their population out of poverty [...] there is no other example of this in history.” Last month, China said that all registered impoverished counties in the country have shaken off poverty. Mr. Khan said that the government had made special economic zones to attract and relocate Chinese industries so that they can export their products from Pakistan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pakistan-can-learn-from-chinas-development-model-says-imran/article33476672.ece
02 January 2021||Beirut,||‘Truck bomb detonates near Russia base in Syria’||A car bomb detonated near a Russian military base in northeastern Syria on Friday in the first such jihadist attack in the area against the ally of Damascus, a war monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported several wounded in the attack after midnight in the Tal Saman area in Raqa province, but did not give an exact figure. There was no immediate Russian report of the incident, which occurred in a broader area controlled by Kurdish-led forces but where the Syrian regime and its ally Russia are also present. A statement circulated on social media and attributed to the al-Qaeda-linked Hurras al-Deen jihadist group claimed the attack. The Observatory said two men parked an explosives-laden pickup truck outside the base and fled, in what was a rare such assault by Hurras al-Deen in the area. “It’s the first such direct attack against a Russian base in northeastern Syria,” Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. Hurras al-Deen has fighters in the country’s last major rebel bastion in the northwestern region of Idlib, but very rarely operates outside that area. Russia entered Syria’s war in 2015, and its Air Force has backed Damascus regime forces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/truck-bomb-detonates-near-russia-base-in-syria/article33476663.ece

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Priest, nun, and the murder of a witness||Seated between two plainclothesmen, Father Thomas Kottoor, a 71-year-old Catholic priest, looked out of the window of the police vehicle. His eyes were fixed on something distant. “I have not committed any crime. God has a plan and things will work accordingly,” he muttered while adjusting his face mask as television journalists jostled for sound bites. Flanked by women officers in another vehicle was Sister Sephy, 57, who was trying to control her tears. As the vehicles left the premises of the Special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Court in Thiruvananthapuram, it was curtains down, at least for now, on a sensational case that, paraphrasing Judge K. Sanilkumar’s introduction to the judgment, stood still as judges moved, for 28 years. On December 23, 2020, Judge Sanilkumar found Father Kottoor and Sister Sephy guilty of murder and handed them a sentence of imprisonment for life besides a fine of Rs. 5 lakh each. Father Kottoor was also found guilty of house trespass. The story began on March 27, 1992, when the body of a novitiate was found in the well of St Pius X Convent Hostel in Kottayam in central Kerala. The hostel and the nunnery were both managed by the Knanaya Catholic Church, an affluent and influential Christian denomination with deep roots in the State. Fire brigade officials soon fished out the body of Sister Abhaya, 21, an inmate of the hostel. A pair of slippers belonging to her was found on the ground floor of the hostel near the kitchen. Her head cover remained trapped in the outer door. A hand axe was lying in a corner. The State Crime Branch, which took over the investigation from the local police 17 days after the incident, was quick to conclude that this was a case of suicide by an emotionally troubled novitiate. The CBI, which was later handed the case, concluded that it was a case of homicide, not suicide. However, unable to prove who murdered Sister Abhaya, the agency tried to close the case. Given that this was a case involving a priest, nun, novice, and a murder, and it coursed through countless twists and turns over nearly three decades, the verdict by the Special CBI Court came as a moral victory for those who remained steadfast in the pursuit of justice. A shoddy investigation Sister Abhaya, born Beena Thomas, had taken holy orders in May, 1990, and was pursuing a pre-degree course at the BCM College in Kottayam. Her father, Thomas A. Mathai, was the first to dismiss the suicide theory as he firmly believed that his daughter had no reason to take the extreme step. On the eve of her death, Sister Abhaya, along with other inmates of the hostel, had gone for a Bible Convention and was cheerful. She had asked her room-mate to wake her up the next morning so that she could prepare for her exams. The CBI prosecution case was that Sister Abhaya had gone downstairs to the kitchen to fetch drinking water early morning on March 27 when she accidentally caught Father Kottoor, who had sneaked into the hostel, being intimate with Sister Sephy, the sole occupant of the ground floor room that day. To cover up the wrongdoing, they attacked her with a blunt weapon and flung her into the well. Days after the death, people in the locality formed an Action Council seeking justice, with Jomon Puthenpurackal, also a member of the Knanaya Church, as the convener. While the Action Council comprised political leaders such as Ramesh Chennithala, T.K. Ramakrishnan and Uzhavoor Vijayan, it was Puthenpurackal, 52 now, who stayed the course, doggedly pursuing justice despite personal setbacks. After the Crime Branch closed the case as suicide, it was largely due to his efforts that the court handed over the case to the CBI. But the premier investigation agency, which took over the case in March 1993, was set to receive a major snub from the judiciary as the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ernakulam, refused to accept its closure reports and ordered reinvestigation thrice between 1996 and 2005. It took the CBI 15 years to arrest the accused and another 12 years to secure conviction in what should have been an open and shut case, say legal experts. There were reasons to suspect that attempts were made from the first day to derail the investigation. The Mother Superior of the convent, Sister Lessieux, who called the fire brigade, apparently told them that Sister Abhaya had fallen into the well while operating the pump. V.V. Augustine, additional sub-inspector who prepared the First Information Report, allegedly destroyed the inquest report. He was arraigned as an accused by the CBI. Augustine died by suicide in November, 2008, soon after the first arrests were made in the case. Sister Lessieux’s death also dealt a blow to the investigation. Material evidence collected from the scene had already been destroyed when the CBI took over the case. Crime Branch Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) K. Samuel and Superintendent of Police K.T. Michael were involved in the destruction of evidence, asserted the court while pronouncing the judgment. To its credit, the CBI had made Samuel an accused, but he died, and Michael was exculpated by a court. Several early investigating officials including Samuel, shows the judgment, were also involved in fabricating cases against one of the key witnesses, Raju aka Adacka Raju, a petty thief whose evidence proved valuable in the case. The second accused in the CBI case was Father Jose Poothrikkayil, who, like Father Kottoor, was teaching at the BCM College where Sister Abhaya was a student. He was also manager of the Catholic Mission Press, while Father Kottoor, besides teaching psychology, was also secretary to the then Bishop. Father Poothrikkayil was discharged from the case even before the trial began. “Shoddy investigation and interminable delays in the judicial system meant that the case needed constant following-up. It is a classic case of delay in justice becoming denial of justice. But I’m determined to pursue it to its logical end,” says Puthenpurackal, whose interventions kept the case alive in the public imagination. He says the Church succeeded in turning his family against him, but that only strengthened his resolve. Among those who tried to scuttle the case, he alleges, was a former Supreme Court judge with a stake in the case. No suicide, this The CBI probe into the case had a stormy beginning with the investigating officer, DySP Varghese P. Thomas putting in his papers nearly 10 years before superannuation and subsequently accusing his superior of forcing him to parrot the suicide theory. An oblique head injury sustained by Sister Abhaya was what caught his attention, first. “It was unusual. By the time the CBI took over the case, most of the documentary evidence including Sister Abhaya’s personal diary had been destroyed,” Thomas recalls. At first, he also thought of it as a case of suicide, maybe out of depression, but circumstantial evidence and witness statements alerted him to look for something sinister behind the death. As he dug deeper, he felt that Sister Abhaya had been hit on the head with a blunt object after which the body was dumped into the well – something that the judgment under discussion came to infer based on the post-mortem report and statements made by two doctors: an expert and the one who performed the post-mortem. That the door to the kitchen had been latched from the outside on the morning of the occurrence also raised Thomas’s suspicion. “The statements of the convent inmates too backed the inference of homicide, although a majority of the witnesses turned hostile later,” he says. When the CBI approached the court saying it was at a loss to conclude if it was homicide or suicide and therefore the case be closed, the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ernakulam, turned it down. “All the arguments,” says K.K. Utharan, who was then Chief Judicial Magistrate, “to prove that the nun died by suicide were indefensible ones.” An expert doctor produced by the CBI as its witness deposed that the victim was under severe mental trauma after failing in her college exams and had a history of mental illness. He also submitted that women might develop suicidal tendencies during their menstrual period. “After going through the case diary, I was convinced that there was enough substance in the case. Moreover, all the contentions of the CBI to buttress the suicide theory were inadmissible. Therefore, I rejected the report and ordered a re-probe,” Utharan says. Interestingly, in its second final report, the CBI found out that it was homicide, but pleaded helplessness in identifying the culprits, which invited the wrath of the court. Again, the Chief Judicial Magistrate of Ernakulam ordered a reinvestigation. Later, the Kochi unit of the CBI took over the case from the Delhi unit and filed one more report, in 2005, reiterating the request to close the case as an ‘untraced’ one, which was once again rejected by the Chief Judicial Magistrate. “The reasons put forth by the CBI were unconvincing and unacceptable,” says P.D. Sarangadharan, one of the three Chief Judicial Magistrates to turn down requests for closure of the case. “It was not a perfect crime which would leave the investigators clueless. This was a murder that took place in a convent, a walled property, where access was restricted. Hence, the possibility of some unknown person or an outsider committing the crime was non-existent. The details of those who could enter the compound and the inmates of the hostel could be easily ascertained and the culprits identified,” he explains. Moving at snail’s pace The suicide theory of the CBI had many holes in it. It was hard to believe that a young girl, who had asked to be woken up to prepare for an exam and went down to fetch water from a fridge, would suddenly throw herself into the well and end her life, says Sarangadharan, who retired as a District Judge. After the incident and investigations, several nuns were transferred out of the convent. Some were even despatched abroad. A few nuns were posted in places that were inaccessible to the investigators. Evidence was also destroyed. The proactive role of a Crime Branch official in the investigation and the assurances he reportedly gave the nuns of the congregation to take proper care of the investigation were sufficient enough to raise doubts about the conclusions arrived at, Sarangadharan says. “It could be found from the documents that the nun was alive close to 5 a.m. I had a strong feeling that the culprits could be identified and brought to book by interrogating the nuns and the other inmates of the hostel,” recounts Sarangadharan. V. Jayakumar, journalist with the Kerala Kaumudi daily, who was among the first to be permitted to the scene on that day, clearly remembers that initially they were told that a nun had ended her life by jumping into a well. Once inside the compound after a brief argument with the police, he saw “clear signs of a physical fight at the spot”. However, the Branch SP, Michael, kept saying how the novice suffering from depression had ended her life. Despite allegations about the manipulation of FIR and other evidence, a section of the local media, which was regarded as pro-Church, warmed up to the theory of suicide, while others looked for unknown sides and attempted to piece together the puzzle, he says. “The prevailing political situation was also favourable to the Church. M.M. Jacob was Union Minister in the Narasimha Rao government while K. Karunakaran and K.M. Mani, who were powerful, were leading the State government. The attempts to scuttle the probe were so explicit that even a section within the Church raised their voice against it,” notes Jayakumar. In 2007, Father Kottoor, Father Poothrikkayil and Sister Sephy were subjected to a narcoanalysis test. Their arrests were recorded by a CBI team led by DySP Nandakumar Nair in November 2008. Amidst this cropped up allegations that the narcoanalysis CDs had been tampered with. The High Court asked the CBI to submit the result of the narcoanalysis in a sealed cover. In 2019, as the trial of the case was progressing in Thiruvananthapuram, the Kerala High Court ruled that narcoanalysis would not be admissible as evidence in the case. As the case moved at a snail’s pace, Sister Abhaya’s parents, who had actively pursued it, died, and her brother got a job in West Asia. The trial began in 2019 and as it entered the final stage, a defence counsel passed away. What the judgment says The 229-page judgment, pronounced after wading through a maze of evidence, material and circumstantial, on December 23, mentions Sister Abhaya as a “pious, smart and punctilious girl, meticulous in all aspects, leading an altruistic life and that it was impossible for her to have ended her life on her own…” The court was satisfied that it was a case of sex and murder and that Sister Abhaya was killed for chancing upon the amorous liaison of Father Kottoor and Sister Sephy. The position and nature of head injury on her body lent credence to the argument that she was subjected to assault. A majority of the hostel inmates turned hostile, while the court relied on Raju’s evidence to establish the presence of Father Kottoor in the convent that night. “PW3 [Raju] may have been a thief but he was and is an honest man, a simple person without the need to dissemble, a human being who became a professional thief by the force of circumstances, but a speaker of truth nonetheless,” the court observed, analysing his depositions at great length. Raju had been detained and tortured by the Crime Branch for 58 days to extract a confession that he had murdered Sister Abhaya and when he did not budge, lucrative offers were made. “I still live in a two-cent property, but I am happy with my family,” he says, turning down offers of support pouring in from all around now. The court evaluated his depositions and demeanour and was convinced that he had gone to the convent to steal copper plates from the lightning arrester that night when in the early hours, he spotted Father Kottoor and another man with a torch on the terrace. While the defence tried to paint Raju as a witness planted by the CBI, the unschooled man demonstrated strength of character and was unmoved. “I stood for Sister Abhaya like a father would for his child and I am happy that my child has finally got justice,” says Raju. According to the court, Father Kottoor failed to “give a proper explanation for his presence in the Convent during the wee hours.” The location of the murder, observed the judge, “is exceedingly significant. It is a Convent, a place from which male presence is completely and unequivocally banned. The murder is that of a nun, a Bride of Christ.” The court also took serious note of Father Kottoor’s extra-judicial confession said to have been made to a public interest litigant that being human he was also prone to go wrong. A medical examination of Sister Sephy suggested she underwent hymenoplasty “almost on the eve of her arrest by the CBI” to create the impression of being a virgin. The court thought it was significant to also take into account her past sexual experience gleaned from the medical examination. Dwelling on the attempts to subvert the case, the court said that while the witnesses connected to the congregation turned hostile en masse, it was “fascinatingly bizzare” that Achamma, a poorly paid cook at the hostel, approached the Supreme Court against the constitutional validity of narcoanalysis. Harish Salve argued the case. When Achamma was asked about it, she pleaded ignorance and said it was paid for by the Convent. Despite a barrage of allegations against it, the Church has remained silent, with its only response coming in the wake of the judgment. It termed the charges against Father Kottoor, who last served as Chancellor of the Diocese, and Sister Sephy as “unbelievable” while asserting their right to go in appeal and prove their innocence. B. Raman Pillai, the defence lawyer who represented Father Kottoor from 2008, also refuses to buy the conclusion arrived at by the trial court as he prepares to move the Kerala High Court against the verdict. It was a case which was highly influenced by the media and some campaigners and the end result was a travesty of justice, he laments. The CBI, which came under pressure, cooked up a story, framed witnesses and argued the case. A judge of the Kerala High Court had castigated the CBI that the investigation in the case would be handed over to some hand-picked officers of the State Police if it failed to arrest the accused. This forced the agency to change its earlier stance that it was a case of suicide, he argues. Nearly three decades have passed since Sister Abhaya’s death. The well in which the body was found has been levelled by the Church. But another round of legal duel is on the horizon.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/priest-nun-and-the-murder-of-a-witness/article33476661.ece
02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||An ill-conceived, overbroad and vague ordinance||Article 213 (1) of the Constitution of India provides: “If at any time, except when the Legislative Assembly of a State is in session, or where there is a Legislative Council in a State, except when both Houses of the Legislature are in session, the Governor is satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary for him to take immediate action, he may promulgate such Ordinances as the circumstances appear to him to require: …” There are, therefore, three pre-conditions to be satisfied before the Governor promulgates an ordinance: first, the State Legislature should not be in session; circumstances should exist for promulgating an ordinance and importantly, those circumstances must warrant immediate action. Circumstances, urgency There is no established practice requiring the Governor (or the President under Article 123 of the Constitution) to state the circumstances for immediate action. Therefore, while the recent Commission for Air Quality Management Ordinance (https://bit.ly/3rEj4WJ) gave a four page justification for immediate action, the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce Ordinance (https://bit.ly/3rK24OH) merely stated in the preamble what the ordinance provides for, but did not disclose the circumstances and urgency for immediate action. I believe a healthy convention should develop and the preamble to any ordinance should state the immediacy for promulgating it when the Legislature is not in session. This would greatly enhance transparency in legislation, but, more importantly, enable legislators to understand why they are, in a sense, by-passed and why a debate and discussion in the Legislature could not be awaited. The reason for immediate action is, as yet, not justiciable and it is unlikely that any court will delve into this arena. But the Supreme Court of India has held that the existence of circumstances leading to the satisfaction of the Governor can be inquired into. In other words, the court can inquire whether circumstances existed that enabled the Governor to be satisfied of the necessity of promulgating an ordinance. However, the court will not delve into the sufficiency of circumstances. Therefore, why not disclose the circumstances and reason for immediate action in the first instance rather than require people to go to court to find out? In the normal course, these are unlikely to be a state secret. The U.P. ordinance The preamble to the The Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance (https://bit.ly/3n943bH), commonly called the anti-love jihad ordinance, merely indicates what it provides for, namely, unlawful conversion from one religion to another by coercion, misrepresentation and so on “or by marriage”. It then proceeds to record the satisfaction of the Governor of the existence of circumstances and the necessity for “him/her to take immediate action”. Let us try and imagine the circumstances requiring promulgation of the ordinance as far as marriage is concerned. If one fraudulent or coercive inter-faith marriage is taking place, the police can certainly prevent it, as they supposedly do in child marriages. An ordinance is not required for it. However, if more than one such fraudulent or coercive inter-faith marriage is expected to take place, the State government would have information of mass conversions for the purpose of marriage. In the normal course, it is unlikely that these mass conversions would be in secret and almost simultaneous. A more realistic expectation would be specific information of some or many unwilling religious conversions likely to take place. Surely, these can also be prevented by an alert police force by invoking existing legal provisions. Assuming a somewhat unbelievable scenario does exist, how does one justify immediate action for promulgating an ordinance? It is not as if dozens or hundreds of inter-faith marriages were expected virtually overnight. However hard one might think about it, the need for immediate action is very difficult to understand. Provisions and impact Consider the consequences of some provisions of the ordinance, and we are actually witness to them. Section 3 prohibits conversion or attempt to convert any person from one religion to another by coercion or fraud etc. or by marriage. To the extent of conversion by coercion or fraud, etc. there is no problem and nobody supports it. What is conversion by marriage? Nobody gets converted by marriage. If a Hindu marries a Christian, who gets converted — the husband or wife or both or neither? One can understand conversion for marriage, but if an adult person desires to get converted to the religion of the other before marriage, what objection can anybody have? Rights issues The offence of attempting to convert poses a bigger rights issue. Section 7 provides that upon receiving information (it may be fake news) that a religious conversion is designed to take place, a police officer is authorised under the Criminal Procedure Code without orders from a Magistrate and without a warrant, to arrest the person so designing, if it appears that the commission of the offence cannot be otherwise prevented. The nature of information includes an allegation of allurement which includes an offer of any temptation in the form of a gift or gratification. So, if a boy and girl of different religions are seen talking together or eating out, it is easy for a so-called aggrieved person (who could be any stranger) to complain to the police that he overheard a conversation in which a temptation was offered to the girl, including a pizza, as has been recently reported. This could trigger the arrest of the boy offering the allurement, his friends and family (as conspirators) with no questions asked. Shotgun weddings were always an offence, but now even pizza-induced weddings are an offence. Should someone genuinely desire to convert but not get married, that person would have to inform the District Magistrate (DM) two months in advance of the plan through a declaration, under Section 8. The DM requires the police to inquire the real purpose of conversion and file a report (in a sealed cover?) with the DM. What is the true purpose of the police inquiry? If the report concludes that the desire to convert is not for a good enough reason, can the DM refuse permission to convert? Is a pre-crime scenario contemplated? Assuming conversion is not objected to, even thereafter the DM must be informed by the converted through a declaration under Section 9. Interestingly, the DM is expected to exhibit the declaration on the notice board of the office till the contents of the declaration are confirmed. Meanwhile, the ubiquitous aggrieved person has an opportunity to object to the conversion. What next — does the DM ‘cancel’ the bona fide conversion and have the converted arrested? Finally, the burden of proof — Section 12 provides that the burden to prove the conversion was not on account of coercion, fraud, etc. or by marriage will be on the person who has caused the conversion. How is that person expected to know the mind of the converted? It is only the person converted who can answer that question and nobody else, as in Hadiya’s case. A danger The ordinance is prone to abuse and we have seen its consequences — of intimidation, bullying, arbitrary arrests and the loss of a foetus. It is ill-conceived, overbroad and vague in many respects. It vilifies all inter-faith marriages and places unreasonable obstacles on consenting adults in exercising their personal choice of a partner, mocks the right to privacy and violates the right to life, liberty and dignity. In short, it is unconstitutional. Justice (retd.) Madan B.

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Taking note of farmer welfare, the Kerala way||For more than a month now, farmers are writing a new history, camping at the borders of Delhi. The concrete barricades, thorny iron fences and powerful water cannons have not been able to prevent their tractor trollies from reaching the vicinity of the national capital. They have been so determined and prepared that the Delhi winter has failed before them. Assembled in their thousands, they have established a new way of life at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur, Noida and Shahjahanpur. In some manner, the upsurge by these farmers resembles the ‘Occupy Wallstreet Movement’ in the United States, in 2011, whose slogan reverberates even today across the world: “We are the 99 percent”. Unflinching willpower The government might have thought that the farmers would retreat to their villages after a couple of days or a week at the most, but this is not the mood at all among the farmers. As a frequent visitor to one or the other centres of struggle, this writer would definitely say that this farmers’ struggle is unique in the history of free India. A self-contained lifestyle with all necessary arrangements for food, shelter, clothing, and sanitation are in place. Scores of them, young and old, with whom this writer could interact with, represent the unflinching will of a people who consider agriculture as their culture. Their utmost proximity to soil and nature has tempered them as steel, while helping them remain calm and cool at the same time. The firefighters in the government who talk in different terms (may be purposefully), might have prepared their own strategy to face this struggle of the annadatas . Some of them say that the doors of dialogue are always kept open. There are certain others who are stubborn in saying that there can be no compromise on the implementation of the three Farm Bills. There are also those who still promise to take a relook if necessary, but only after two years. There is no need to ponder on this as most of these officials have been trained in a certain ideological school. As part of their campaign of malignment, the propaganda managers have labelled the farmers ‘Khalistanis’ and ‘urban naxalites’. But these sons and daughters of the soil, who sow the seeds of hope to feed their fellow beings, have maintained inimitable self-restraint. Their struggle, their unity, their patience, and the massive nature of their battle are having an impact on the cohesive nature of the ruling alliance, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Following in the footsteps of NDA ally, the Shiromani Akali Dal that walked out of the NDA in support of the farmers, the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party has also snapped its ties with the alliance. Another important party that shares power with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana continues to remain unhappy with the central government’s approach to the farmers’ issues. The Narendra Modi government expected the farmers to tire out and slowly retreat from the battlefront. But it is mistaken. The determination by the farmers to go on with the struggle is only strengthening by the day. The Prime Minister himself has come forward to lead a frontal attack on the annadatas . Recently, he minced no words in expressing his disappointment while accusing the struggle of being a politically motivated one. The thrust of his attack was evident when he criticised the Opposition as misleading the farmers and shooting from their shoulders to target the government. In this tirade, the Prime Minister pointed a finger against the Left-led government in Kerala. The situation in Kerala All the allegations that he has levelled against the Kerala government are unfounded, and far from truth. In his exhortation that there are no Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) and mandis in Kerala, he presumed that the concept of the Minimum Support Price is not prevalent in the State. He has shut his eyes to the basic truth about the agricultural scenario in Kerala. It is true that mandis regulated by an APMC are not in existence in Kerala. But it does not mean that the interests of farmers are not taken care of in the State. In fact, Kerala is the State where farmers’ rights are being protected by the government itself, and much more effectively than any other Indian State. While the government of India has fixed the procurement rate for rice at Rs. 18 a kg, the Left Democratic Front government in Kerala is procuring rice from cultivators at Rs. 27.48 a kg. In the same manner copra (dried coconut) is also procured at a much higher rate in Kerala than the price announced by the central government. Kerala is the State where increased basic price is ensured not only for paddy but also vegetables and fruits. Sixteen such items are enlisted by the government where the basic prices (per kg) are guaranteed. To cite some of them, tapioca (Rs. 12), banana (Rs. 30), garlic (Rs. 139), pineapple (Rs. 15), tomato (Rs. 8), string beans (Rs. 34), ladies’ fingers (Rs. 20), cabbage (Rs. 11) and potato (Rs. 20). Apart from crop insurance, paddy cultivators will get the royalty in Kerala at the rate of Rs. 2,000 per hectare. They have a pension too, which is something unique in India. In 2006, when farmers’ suicides became the order of the day across the country, the Left Front government introduced a debt relief commission that extended a helping hand to the farmers, thereby saving them.  There is basis for a counter No BJP-led government in the country can even imagine the measures that the Left government in Kerala has initiated for the welfare of farmers. Instead of understanding those measures, the Prime Minister has chosen to train his political guns on the Kerala government and the farmers. The influence of corporates on his allegations is clear. The Left has the moral and political authority to engage in any polemics with the BJP-led central government in this regard. It is intriguing why the Prime Minister has never said a word about the experience of Bihar where mandis were abolished in 2006 and the plight of farmers that only worsened after this measure was initiated. After the three farm ordinances of June 2020, 40% of mandis in Madhya Pradesh have registered only zero transactions. The corporate stamp This is the reality of the farm Bills. Though they claim ‘to enable’ the protection and the empowerment of farmers, the truth is just the opposite. The purpose of these laws is the enabling of the corporatisation of Indian agriculture and the introduction of contract farming. When Ministers continue to assure the continuance of mandis they are practically pushed out of the scene, as it happened in Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere. The annadatas have been able to foresee the evil in the three farm laws that would eventually find them at the mercy of corporate profit mongers. They know that these laws would ruin the backbone of the agricultural economy and badly affect the food security of India. The farmers are in the struggle in order to prevent such a calamity from happening. It is high time that the Prime Minister and his government understand the patriotic and selfless role being played by the food providers of the country and the genuine nature and cause of their struggle.

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Clear connection||The end of the Interconnection Usage Charges (IUC) regime on January 1, under which one telecom operator paid a charge to another on whose network a subscriber’s voice call was completed, creates a new era in which these companies can focus on upgrading their networks and service. The measure was delayed by a year by regulator TRAI due to concerns that not all operators were ready, and the shift to more efficient 4G networks and compatible subscriber handsets was slower than anticipated. Now that the need to monitor call termination data and make IUC payments no longer exists, and a spectrum auction is also scheduled this year, the focus should shift to giving the users a better deal — as reliable call quality and competitive tariffs. For the subscriber, other than those who had to pay higher access tariffs on one wireless network due to the IUC system, the latest measure may not carry a significant impact, since providers sold unlimited call packs even earlier. One operator, Jio, had a higher proportion of outgoing calls to other wireless operators since its launch a few years ago, thus having to pay significant net interconnection charges, which was six paise per minute since 2017. That imbalance has reduced, and TRAI has now introduced an arrangement called bill and keep, which does away with the IUC. India’s high density telecom market is poised for further growth as it awaits expansion through 5G and Internet-connected devices. Yet, as the Economic Survey of 2019-20 pointed out, intense competition has reduced the number of private players. Public sector operators BSNL and MTNL still face a challenge and their future must be clarified early, with efforts to improve their technological capabilities and service levels. A parallel trend has been the rise in 4G subscribers from 196.9 million in September 2017 to 517.5 million out of a total wireless subscriber base of 1,165.46 million in June 2019. The end of the IUC should spur an expansion of high-capacity networks, going beyond 2G and 3G that some telcos continue to use. The removal of interconnection charges was opposed by them just a year ago. For TRAI, which has stressed the importance of consumer welfare through adequate choice, affordable tariff and quality service, it is important to tread cautiously on claims made on behalf of the sector, that higher tariffs alone can ensure the health of telecoms. India is a mass market for voice and data services that fuel the digital economy. Badly priced spectrum could lead to auction failures and lack of genuine competition is bound to hamper the growth of the next big wave of telecoms, of which the 5G piece is critical for new services. On the consumer side, helping more people migrate to 4G services quickly through affordable handsets will help telcos put their infrastructure to better use.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/clear-connection/article33476648.ece
02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The second dose||With the U.K. regulator granting an emergency-use authorisation for AstraZeneca’s COVID vaccine on December 30, three vaccines have now been greenlighted for use even before a full approval is granted. Unlike the mRNA vaccine platform of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, AstraZeneca uses a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that carries the genetic material of the spike protein to elicit an immune response. Requiring only 2°-8°C for transport and storage, it can be administered in existing health-care settings, allowing rapid deployment. Together with the cost, which is much cheaper than the mRNA vaccines, this is particularly critical to help end the pandemic in the global south. The emergency use approval makes it easier for similar assent to the vaccine tested and manufactured in India. However, the European Medicines Agency, on the same day, clearly said that “additional scientific information on issues related to quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine is deemed necessary” to give a similar nod. While published results show only 62% efficacy when two full-strength doses are administered four weeks apart, the U.K regulator has relied on unpublished data showing efficacy increasing to 73%, 22 days after the first dose when the second jab was delayed. Most of the participants in the phase-3 trial in the U.K. included in the primary analysis received the second dose more than nine weeks after the first. Based on this information, the regulator has permitted the second dose to be administered 4-12 weeks after the first jab. The intent is to maximise the vaccine’s benefits by stretching the time between two doses to allow more people to get vaccinated, an untested strategy to rapidly but partially protect more individuals who are at risk. With the virus running amok, the U.K. has revised its policy to delay the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine too despite no trial data to support this; the second Pfizer jab is originally scheduled three weeks after the first. While the regulator says there is 89% short-term protection from day 14 after the first dose, Pfizer insists that there is “no data to demonstrate that protection after the first dose is sustained beyond 21 days”. Two doses of both vaccines complete the course and prolong the duration of protection. If the pandemic forced scientists, companies and regulators to quickly make available safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccines, delaying the second dose to maximise the benefits is altogether a new strategy. The untested approach might probably be appropriate for the U.K., which is facing the brunt of the virus, as a desperate measure. Since delaying the second dose appears to be increasing the efficacy, and as the U.K. has approved a delayed second dosage, India should carry out large trials to test this.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-second-dose/article33476649.ece
02 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Healthy demand boosts Dec. auto sales||A majority of vehicle manufacturers ended 2020 on a positive note, registering good wholesales growth, and entering the new year with ‘cautious optimism’ driven by expectations of a V-shaped economic recovery. Four-wheeler market leader Maruti Suzuki India said it dispatched more than 1.4 lakh passenger vehicles (PVs) to dealers in December 2020, a growth of 14.6% year-on-year. In addition, the sales of the company’s light commercial vehicle Super Carry more than tripled to 5,726 units, while exports rose 31.4% to 9,938 units. Mitul Shah, head, Research, Reliance Securities, said auto firms delivered better-than-expected volumes in December with continuation of a positive growth trajectory for most segments. He added that he expected volume traction to continue in the coming months. Rival Hyundai posted its highest-ever sales for the December month at 47,400 units, up 25%. S.S. Kim, MD & CEO, said the firm achieved the milestone of highest production in a single month with 71,178 units last month. “We are proceeding with cautious optimism and positively anticipate green shoots of recovery in 2021.” M&M saw PV sales grow 3% to 16,182 units. Veejay Nakra, CEO, Automotive Division, said demand remained strong even after the festival season. “Our overall sales have been affected due to the continuing supply chain challenges, specifically the supply shortage of (semiconductors).” Tata Motors’ domestic PV sales zoomed 84% to 23,545 units. Shailesh Chandra, president, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, said, “In Q3, the PV business posted growth of 89% — (recording) the highest-ever sales in the last 33 quarters.” He added that retail sales in December were 18% higher than wholesales and that pipeline inventory remained thin. Honda Cars India sold 8,638 units in December as against 8,412 units. In CVs, M&M sold 16,795 vehicles in India, a drop of 21.5%. Tata Motors saw CV sales fall 5% to 29,885. While Ashok Leyland saw 14% growth in domestic CV sales at 11,857 units, VE Commercial Vehicles sales declined 7.7% to 4,069 units.  Two-wheelers  Hero MotoCorp saw domestic sales grow 5% to 4.27 lakh vehicles. It said the December volumes indicated the continuously improving consumer sentiment. The company expected the positive trend to continue in the new year. “Hero MotoCorp [clocked] its best-ever third quarter, with a 19.7% growth over [a year earlier]” it said. Yamaha Motor India saw total sales rise 33% to 39,224 units. Bikemaker Royal Enfield said its domestic sales rose 35% to 65,492 units.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/healthy-demand-boosts-dec-auto-sales/article33476634.ece
02 January 2021||Mumbai,||Ford, Mahindra call off plan for auto JV||Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) and Ford Motor Company (FMC) have ‘mutually and amicably’ decided not to complete a previously-announced automotive joint venture between their companies. While Ford said it would continue its independent operations in India as is, M&M said the decision would not have any impact on the firm’s product plan. “The action followed the passing of the December 31, ‘longstop’, or expiration date of a definitive agreement the organisations entered into in October 2019,” M&M and FMC said in separate statements. The outcome was driven by fundamental changes in global economic and business conditions — caused, in part, by the global pandemic — since the agreement was first announced, the statements added. “Those changes influenced separate decisions by Ford and Mahindra to reassess their respective capital allocation priorities,” the statements added. M&M said it was well positioned in its ‘core SUV DNA’ and product platforms with ‘a strong focus on financial performance’. Electric SUV focus Addressing a press conference, Dr. Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, M&M, said both companies were clear that terminating the deal was a prudent decision in the current situation. “We will not build international presence in the short-term. We plan to build a strong SUV portfolio based on Electric Vehicles (EVs) and we will have [a] modern portfolio of gasoline engines.” Ford Motor Company said, “The company is actively evaluating its businesses around the world, including in India, making choices and allocating capital in ways that advance Ford’s plan to achieve an 8% company-adjusted EBIT margin and generate consistently strong, adjusted free cash flow,” it said in its statement.  In October 2019, the two automakers had entered into a joint venture agreement. The new entity was to develop, market and distribute Ford brand vehicles in India while also selling both — Mahindra and Ford — cars in the high-growth emerging markets. M&M was to acquire 51% stake in a wholly-owned arm of Ford — Ardour Automotive Pvt. Ltd., for about Rs. 657 crore. The balance 49% was to be held by FMC. The venture was to also acquire the automotive business of Ford India Pvt Ltd (FIPL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FMC, that has been engaged in the auto business in India since 1995. The business to be acquired included Ford’s vehicle manufacturing plants at Chennai and Sanand but excluded the separate powertrain facility in Sanand.

M&M’s Farm Equipment Sector said domestic sales in the month had risen 23% to 21,173 units. Hemant Sikka, president-FES, M&M, said, “Wholesale volumes continued to be strong, fueled by restoration of channel inventory post the festive season, announcement of a hike in tractor prices by major OEMs and anticipation of sustained demand on the back of higher Rabi acreage, government support in Kharif procurement and rural development schemes. “In the export market, we have sold 1,244 tractors, a growth of 60% over last year.”  Escorts Ltd.’s Agri Machinery Segment said domestic tractor sales grew 90% to 7,230 units. “Post lockdown, this is the first month where we could supply as per the demand of customers, some of whom waited long to get their preferred tractor brand. Going forward, all macroeconomic factors remain in favour of continued growth and we do not expect any significant supply-demand gaps. Rising inflation, however, continues to be a worry,” it said.  Sonalika Tractors registered its highest-ever December sales of 11,540 units.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mahindra-tractor-sales-climb-23-in-december/article33476627.ece

02 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Technolgy, skilling vital for aerospace, defence’||India needs to focus on deploying latest technology and skilling its workforce to become the next major powerhouse in aerospace and defence sectors, according to David Ziegler, vice-president of aerospace and defense, Dassault Systemes. “To make sure India will be one of the next major powerhouses in aerospace and defence, I think there are three parts to that. First, there needs to be people, there needs to be education and workforce of the future. So, the government can do a little bit more in this space.” The second pillar, he said, was to have governmental programmes where he said he believed India to be on the right track with specific investments in defence and in space sectors.

02 January 2021||New Delhi,||Rohit Sharma takes over as vice-captain||Rohit Sharma was on Friday appointed vice-captain of the Indian Test team for the first time in his career, replacing Cheteshwar Pujara, who was entrusted with the responsibility for the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. After regular captain Virat Kohli proceeded on paternity leave after the first Test in Adelaide, Pujara was named Ajinkya Rahane's deputy for the second match. However, it is learnt the team management was always clear that once Rohit joined the squad, he would be Rahane's deputy. “There was never any doubt about who would be India's vice-captain once Virat took a break and Ajinkya was elevated. “It was always going to be Rohit. Pujara was just a stop-gap arrangement till Rohit joined the squad,” a senior BCCI official told PTI. "Rohit has been India's white-ball vice-captain for a long time, so it was only natural that, in Virat's absence, he would be a part of the team leadership group," he said. Quarantine completed Rohit completed his 14-day quarantine in a Sydney apartment only a few days ago and joined the squad in Melbourne on Wednesday. It is still not clear whether Rohit will prefer opening the innings alongside Shubman Gill, with Mayank Agarwal being dropped from the playing eleven due to his prolonged bad patch, or bat in the middle-order in place of Hanuma Vihari, who looks like a certain casualty in terms of team combination. Rohit started training on Thursday and the full-fledged session of the Indian contingent after the New Year break will start on Saturday. The Indian team will leave for Sydney on January 5 for the third Test scheduled to start on January 7.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rohit-replaces-pujara-as-vice-captain/article33476736.ece
02 January 2021||Mumbai,||Planning, training sessions helping Rahane||Ajinkya Rahane’s meticulous planning and execution of his training sessions during the COVID-19 break is helping him immensely on the ongoing tour of Australia, feels his coach Pravin Amre. Turning point Rahane’s dogged 112, which according to head coach Ravi Shastri was the turning point of the game, became the cornerstone of India’s famous win in the second Test in Melbourne. Asked what message he gave Rahane before the tour, Amre said he just told him to keep things simple.  “We don’t think about multiple tours at one time. We try to be in that one tour, (take) one tour at a time and try to give best in that basically. And that is what Ajinkya did,” Amre, himself a former India player, said. Amre said credit must be given to Rahane as he visualised what he was going to face in Australia. Hard work “We have to give credit to him, especially this year (2020), because as coaches most of the time we plan the sessions and practise, but he planned his own sessions, worked hard, basically harder than before and did two practice sessions instead of one. “But those are the small small things he worked (on) and visualised this is going to be my preparation for this tough tour of Australia. And success can’t come without preparation,” said Amre, who played in 11 Tests and 37 ODIs. Rahane also received praise for his captaincy in the second Test in the absence of Virat Kohli. Amre lauded him for leading from the front. “That credit (of captaincy) is for Ajinkya only because as a coach we never work on things like captaincy, we work mainly on the batting. “Handling the situation wasn’t easy, but credit to him. He is also calm and composed and that is the reason for his success as captain,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/planning-and-training-sessions-helping-rahane/article33476745.ece
02 January 2021||London,||High expectations and the struggles faced by the big name signings||With the January transfer window opening, Premier League clubs have the chance to strengthen their squads for the second half of the season. But the high expectations from new recruits aren’t always reflected in their performances on the field — as the struggles of these high-profile summer signings show:  GARETH BALE (TOTTENHAM)  The homecoming to Tottenham was meant to be Bale’s chance to revitalise a career that stalled at Real Madrid even as the forward won every major title. Still only 31 but prone to injury layoffs, Bale has been unable to find a consistent run in a team he starred for before securing the move to Madrid in 2013. Now the attacking threat comes most consistently from Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. The announcement from Tottenham this week that Bale faces a “few weeks” out due to a calf problem is not the blow to the club it might once have seemed. He has made only one Premier League start since returning to Tottenham on a season-long loan in September, with Jose Mourinho usually deploying him in the Europa League when key players can be rested from the starting lineup. The scoring instinct is still there, but his only goals so far from open play have been a pair of headers. He will need to prove his fitness and form in the second half of the season to secure a longer stay at the north London club.  KAI HAVERTZ (CHELSEA)  Havertz arrived as the new sensation of German football but the 21-year-old forward is struggling to justify his $92 million price tag. While the intensity of the English game could be a step-up from what he experienced in the Bundesliga with Bayer Leverkusen, Havertz might also be the player suffering most from Chelsea’s vast offseason overhaul that has left manager Frank Lampard searching for his best combinations and tactical approach. Indeed, Mason Mount — a fellow 21-year-old whose first-team chances looked to have diminished following the arrival of Havertz and other attacking players — appears to be Lampard’s preferred option in central attacking midfield, ahead of Havertz. Lampard is calling for patience with Havertz, though, especially with the player having been hit hard by the effects of the coronavirus after contracting it in November. “Long term, I have no concerns,” Lampard said of Havertz. “In fact, I feel quite the opposite — he’s going to be a huge player for this football club.”  DONNY VAN DE BEEK (MAN UNITED)  Van de Beek was United’s major offseason purchase at $46 million and the central midfielder appeared an odd signing at the time — not because of the price tag or doubts about his ability, but because of the team’s options already in his position. With Bruno Fernandes the first-choice No. 10, Paul Pogba able to play in different midfield positions and the likes of Scott McTominay and Fred fulfilling the criteria of a box-to-box midfielder, it was always going to be difficult for Van de Beek to establish himself in the team. He has started just twice in the Premier League — and in one of those games, at West Ham, he lasted just 45 minutes — and has mostly come on as a late substitute, like on his debut when he scored a consolation goal against Crystal Palace. That remains his only goal for United. He has had more goals (2) and starts (4) for the Netherlands in that period.  RHIAN BREWSTER (SHEFFIELD UNITED)  Brewster was described by Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder as “one of the country’s hottest properties” when he joined for a club-record fee that was in excess of $30 million in October. Aged 20 and tipped for great things while at Liverpool, the England under-21 striker moved in a bid to get regular game time but has been in and out of Wilder’s lineup despite the team being cut adrift in last place and the lowest scorer in the league. Brewster hasn’t scored, either, or even looked threatening in front of goal. Whether Sheffield United is the best side for Brewster is open to question. It is a hard-running, well-drilled team whose strikers have typically been physical and selfless. Brewster is more of an instinctive player, a pure goal-scorer who finishes off chances rather than getting involved in the build-up. And confidence cannot be high given United has made one of the worst starts ever by a top-flight team.  WILLIAN (ARSENAL)  After averaging seven goals a season during his six-year stint at Chelsea, Willian is yet to reproduce that form across London at Arsenal. The Brazilian hasn’t scored a single goal. While the 32-year-old winger has three assists, two came in Arsenal’s opening-day win at Fulham in September. But he is still being started — when fit — by Mikel Arteta. Willian’s struggles are reflective of the entire team he has joined. The north London club, which last won the league in 2004, is 13th in the 20-team standings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/high-expectations-and-the-struggles-faced-by-the-big-name-signings/article33477088.ece
02 January 2021||Melbourne,||‘Get lost’ comment prompted me to walk out, says Sunil Gavaskar||Sunil Gavaskar has cleared the air on his infamous walk out during the Melbourne Test of 1981, saying it was the Australian players’ “get lost” call, and not his leg-before dismissal, that prompted him to storm off the ground with his opening partner. In the series that was dogged by some inconsistent umpiring, a Dennis Lillee in-cutter caught Gavaskar plumb in front and umpire Rex Whitehead, standing in just his third Test, raised his finger. But Gavaskar, who thought that the ball brushed his bat on the way to the pad, protested by standing his ground long enough. Misconception “The misconception is that I was upset at the leg before decision,” Gavaskar told 7Cricket . “Yes, it was upsetting. But the walk-off happened only because, as I had gone past Chetan (Chauhan) on the way to the change-rooms, the Australians had given me a spray. They told me to get lost, which is where I came back and asked Chetan to walk off with me.” Poor series Gavaskar also slapped his pads with the bat, letting the umpire know about his anger. He had made 60 in that innings, his highest score of what was turning out be a poor series for him. Lillee’s remarks As he reluctantly started to leave, Lillee reportedly made one comment too many and the Indian snapped, returned to the crease and instructed fellow opener Chauhan to walk off the pitch with him. A bemused Chauhan did as he was told, but at the boundary, the batsmen were met by team manager Shahid Durrani and assistant manager Bapu Nadkarni. “I got an inside-edge as you can see from the forward short-leg fielder. He hasn’t done anything, he hasn’t moved. Dennis (Lillee) is telling me, ‘It hit you there,’ and I’m trying to say, ‘No I hit it.’ And now you see, I’ve asked Chetan to walk off with me,” said the former India captain. In his earlier interviews, Gavaskar had said that he regretted the decision to leave the field.  The misconception is that I was upset at the leg before decision... But the walk-off happened only because the Australians had given me a spray. They told me to get lost”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/get-lost-comment-prompted-me-to-walk-out-says-sunil-gavaskar/article33477091.ece

02 January 2021||Melbourne,||Natarajan replaces Umesh in Test squad||Tamil Nadu’s T. Natarajan on Friday replaced injured pacer Umesh Yadav in the Indian Test team for the remaining two games against Australia. Earlier, Shardul Thakur had replaced the injured Mohammed Shami in the squad before the second Test. "Umesh Yadav sustained a strain in his left calf muscle on Day 3 of the second Border-Gavaskar Test in Melbourne... The fast bowler will not recover completely ahead of the remaining two Test matches and has been ruled out of the series," BCCI secretary Jay Shah stated in a media release. "The All-India Senior Selection Committee has named T. Natarajan as Yadav’s replacement. Ahead of the Boxing Day Test, Shardul Thakur was added to the Test squad as Mohd. Shami's replacement after the senior fast bowler suffered a hairline fracture in his right forearm," the release added. The 29-year-old Natarajan had started off as a nets bowler during the series and then subsequently made it to the T20 and ODI squads.   The squad: Ajinkya Rahane (Capt.), Rohit Sharma (Vice-Capt.), Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw, K.L Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara, Hanuma Vihari, Shubman Gill, Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Jasprit Bumrah, Navdeep Saini, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, R.

02 January 2021||London,||James Milner says Liverpool must ‘kick on’||James Milner says Liverpool has to “kick on” in 2021 after two disappointing draws left Manchester United breathing down its necks at the top of the Premier League. Jurgen Klopp’s defending champion heads into the New Year with a three-point lead despite dropped points against West Brom and Newcastle.  “I think it’s a positive (Liverpool is top) but it seems to be at this moment in time that nobody wants to take it by the scruff of the neck,” Milner told Liverpoolfc.com . “We’ve dropped points, everyone seems to be dropping points. United have had a good run and they’re probably the only team who are putting a run together. “It’s important that we need to kick on now and try to get a few three-pointers.” Liverpool has already dropped as many points in 16 matches this season as it did in the whole of the previous campaign, when it became English champion for the first time in 30 years. Last season, Klopp’s side did not lose a league match until February 29, having won all of its games except one — against United — up until that point. But Milner accepts it could still have done better despite its defensive injury crisis. “There’s points we’ve dropped this season where we feel we could have done better but to still be in the mix going into the New Year is good, especially with the problems we have,” he said. “But we are a quality squad of players who have been together a long time and we are used to winning. “We are disappointed not to get the three points (at Newcastle) but we want to get back on the winning track as soon as possible.”s||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/james-milner-says-liverpool-must-kick-on/article33477086.ece
02 January 2021||London,||‘Trimming bloated squad a priority’||Mikel Arteta says Arsenal’s priority in the January transfer window is to trim its bloated squad as he seeks to build on a mini-revival at the Premier League club. The Gunners were able to offload Emiliano Martinez and Henrikh Mkhitaryan in the summer window while Matteo Guendouzi and Lucas Torreira departed on loan. But forgotten man Mesut Ozil remained at the Emirates along with Shkodran Mustafi and Sead Kolasinac, who have barely featured in the Premier League this season. Arsenal has been linked with a loan move for Real Madrid playmaker Isco next month, but first of all technical director Edu will attempt to raise funds by moving on those who are surplus to requirements. “There are some players that are going to go on loan and going to leave and that is the priority at the moment,” Arteta said ahead of Saturday’s trip to West Brom. Unsustainable “We cannot sustain the numbers that we have in certain positions and we are looking to do that, and then we will see if we have the right opportunity in the positions where we need some more help.” The pressure on Arteta has eased after wins against Chelsea and Brighton lifted Arsenal to 13th in the Premier League table following a miserable run. Bukayo Saka, who starred in the 1-0 win at Brighton on Tuesday, is expected to be fit for the match against Sam Allardyce’s West Brom. The teenager was forced off during the latter stages of the victory after a strong challenge, but should recover while David Luiz and Willian, who both tested negative for COVID-19 earlier this week, may return this weekend after a bout of illness. Allardyce this week called for a “circuit-breaker” in the Premier League as coronavirus cases spike in Britain but league bosses said the competition would continue as planned. Working system “I think we have shown the system is working,” said Arteta. “In the last week or so something has happened and we will have more restrictions and more tests to try to be as efficient as we were before and we will see, but I think it can work and we can carry on.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/trimming-bloated-squad-a-priority/article33477087.ece
02 January 2021||BERLIN,||Haaland expected to be back in action for Dortmund||Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Braut Haaland is expected to make an eagerly-awaited return from injury as his side looks to battle back into the Bundesliga top-four with a win over high-flier Wolfsburg on Sunday. The prolific Norwegian prodigy has missed the last four league games and the last seven in all competitions after suffering a hamstring injury in early December. Yet the 20-year-old returned to team training this week, and Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc confirmed he would be back in action this weekend. “Erling’s recovery has gone well. We are working on the assumption that he can play against Wolfsburg,” said Zorc. Haaland’s return is timely, with his side in desperately in need of a win after a miserable run of form before Christmas saw it drop to fifth, eight points behind leader Bayern Munich and two behind Sunday’s opponent Wolfsburg. Defeat to Wolfsburg would see Dortmund lose four home league games in a row for the first time in 20 years. Many clubs have had just a week off in the shortest winter break in the league’s history. Yet after its pre-Christmas cup tie was postponed until January, champion Bayern has had an extra week to recover and is expected to waltz past struggling Mainz on Sunday and defend the two-point lead at the top. Second from bottom and without a win in six games, Mainz parted ways with both its coach and sporting director over Christmas. Huddersfield boss Jan Siewert will take over as interim coach against Bayern. There has also been a change of the guard at bottom club Schalke, where new coach Christian Gross will take charge of his first game away to Hertha Berlin on Saturday. Having not won since last January, the seven-time German champion is now just two games away from equalling Tasmania Berlin’s unwanted record of 31 games without a win, set way back in 1966. Meanwhile Bayern’s Manuel Neuer is just one game away from equalling Oliver Kahn’s club record of 196 Bundesliga clean sheets.   Erling’s recovery has gone well. We are working on the assumption that he can play against Wolfsburg— Michael Zorc, Dortmund sporting director||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/haaland-expected-to-be-back-in-action/article33477093.ece
02 January 2021||Melbourne,||‘Warner brings more than just his bat’||Australia batsman Marnus Labuschagne is looking forward to the return of David Warner for the third Test against India in Sydney as he feels the hosts will benefit not just from his batting but also the "terrific energy" he will bring to the field. Warner, who has missed out on a major chunk of the India assignment due to a groin injury, was brought back into the squad for the last two Tests with the series locked at 1-1. The third Test begins on January 7. "He's a big inclusion for us if he does come back in," Labuschagne told reporters in an online interaction. "He's someone with over 7,000 Test runs and averaging near-on 50, he’s a superb player. “He's in that top calibre of players and his energy around the group and in the field will be terrific. It will be great to have him," he said. In Warner’s absence, Australia's batting failed miserably in the first two matches. On Thursday, assistant coach Andrew McDonald had said the home team is prepared to risk playing Warner in the third Test even if he is not 100% fit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/warner-brings-more-than-just-his-bat/article33476737.ece

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Ragas in Agamas||In the Vishnu Purana sage Parasara tells Maitreya that the Universe is the embodiment of sound (nadaathmajam jagat), and it is from nada that the Vedas, Agamas, Itihasas and Puranas came. Vishnu is nada roopa, says Parasara. Pancharatra Agamas govern worship in many Vishnu temples like Srirangam, Kancheepuram Varadaraja, Kumbakonam Sarangapani and Melkote temple, to name a few. The Pancharatra Agamas are said to have been given by Lord Vishnu Himself, and hence they are known as Bhagavad Sastra. While these Agama texts lay down ritual procedures for worship, they also contain many references to music. The Agamas show us the importance of music in temple worship, said P.T. Seshadri, in a discourse. The Agamas give the names of many ragas like Kaisika. Parameswara, Paadma and Aniruddha samhitas mention the following ragas: Kamada, Kedara, Gowlai, Gowleeya, Kaisika, Gandhara, Gouda, Gowli, Ghanta, Cholapaani, Takkesi, Daksha, Desakshi, Panchama, Poornachandra, Bhupala, Mangala, Madhyamavati, Malathi, Malavi, Megharadha, Mohana, Varalika, Shreekamada, Sriraga, Hamsadhvani, Natabhashaka and Mallaka. Aniruddha Samhita gives ragas for the different directions — Gandhara (East), Kaisika (South), Kamada (West) and Takka (North). The Pancharatra samhitas talk of many musical instruments — anaka, kaamsya, kaahala, ghanta, chihsha, jallari, jalli, dhakka, dhakkari, damaruka, timila, dudduka, tooriya, dundubhi, naaga, nissaana, pataha, panava, beri, brihadberi, madduka, mardala, malla, mridanga, mooraja, varoota, veena, venu, sankha, sringa, hasta ghanta, harsva mardala, harsva pataha. In Srirangam temple, 38 instruments were played in the past, of which only a few are now played.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/ragas-in-agamas/article33476742.ece

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Cold weather comfort||There is an old jungle saying (one of my own, I must admit) that I try and follow. If the air is cold and crisp, the food should be warm and soft. That explains why I have been countering this cold spell with steaming dim sums. I mentioned the mouth-watering momos I had last week, but now I must tell you about the delicious Prawn Har Gao dumplings (Rs. 350) that did a jig in my heart a few days ago that came from Yang & Yum. The casing was delightfully thin and translucent; the filling was soft and warm. I had quite a few (with home-cooked broccoli soup), and then focused on the other appetisers from the eatery: fiery salmon sushi, Katsu chicken volcano (Rs. 335 for four) and chicken and chives dumplings (Rs. 295). I have always held that if you get your sushi right, you are on the correct track. These rolls were perfect: soft within, but with a mildly vinegary rice coating. The menu — with Japanese, Chinese, Burmese and Thai dishes — is an interesting mix, with dishes such as the Vietnamese pho, southeast Asian laksa and Burmese khao suey. I wanted to taste some of their Thai dishes, as I have been a diehard fan of the cuisine ever since I visited Thailand some years ago and discovered the unadulterated joy of its fish and meat dishes. I had Yang & Yum’s Chiang Mai banana leaf fish (Rs. 475), Bang Bang chicken (Rs. 395), diced chicken in black bean sauce (Rs. 345) and minced chicken in Thai basil (Rs. 345). I must admit that I was a bit nervous when I saw that two of the chicken dishes looked almost the same – dark in colour and thick in texture. But the tastes turned out to be remarkably different. The diced chicken consisted of chunks of chicken steamed in black bean sauce. It was pleasantly spicy, and I enjoyed it as much as I did the minced meat, which came wrapped in a sauce flavoured with basil leaves. The somewhat fiery Bang Bang chicken (crispy fried chicken in a hot and sweet sauce, a roadside favourite) was superb. The fish, however, was disappointing. The fillet marinated in a Thai curry paste came wrapped in a makroot leaf, but I felt the spices that the fillets had been coated with were a little raw. The outlet delivers food across Delhi and NCR (12 noon to 2 am; 7860000420). The menu includes chicken chilli oil dumplings, a Kowloon special (with spicy chilli oil, Rs. 295) and Drunken Chicken Kwei Chow (Mongol inspired sliced chilli wine chicken with crisp spinach, Rs. 425). There are options for vegetarians, too, including Thai curried veg dumplings (Rs. 245), and Guangzhou mushroom and asparagus dumplings, flavoured with spicy chilli oil (Rs. 275). Yang & Yum is good news. The food is excellent, the packing sturdy, and the prices are reasonable. It is a good way to usher in the New Year.

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||2 0 2 1 things to do||Year after year, I make those resolutions to eat less and exercise more, and remain fanatically disciplined. Until 10 am on January 1, when the last of the Christmas cake yells out to me, “Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou?” And though my name isn’t, and never was Romeo, who am I to deny the beseeching tones of true love? This year I am pinning more prosaic, achievable targets. I will learn how to use the many magical features that my phone claims to have. I mean, they sold me the latest configuration of bits, bytes and magic carpet. And a battery that dies every 11 months, when the new configuration hits the market. I will use my apps and features to find the lost library of the Moscow Czars, auto-clip my toenails, toilet-train the pigeons on my windowsill. I will clean my cupboards, files and friends list, and lighten my life. I will discard anything that weighs me down (especially the weighing scale itself). I will unfriend people who send me motivational quotes to live an active life when I’m cuddled up with Korean dramas and chips. I will set rule-conforming passwords with upper-lower-italics, prime numbers, special characters, and change them every three months, and remember them later — and not fight with the chatbot when I don’t. I will reskill and help the needy. I will offer an online course on my A-star talent — elbow butting. How to direct your elbow into paunches, spectacles or chins. How to say “Hello darling” or “I hope your teeth rot” through your elbow. Because, anyway no one knows what you’re saying through your mask. I will grow a terrace garden, calf muscles and more sophisticated taste like that lady who matches her nail polish with her handbag. I will wear masks that match my underwear. I will never wear orange socks even just to irritate my teen. I will detox. I will buy multiple scented candles to scare away the virus and purify the energy, though the last time everyone coughed out their intestines. Oh yes, I will detox my intestines too — by eating raw cabbage every morning — ensuring the need for those scented candles later. I will gain inner peace. Through doorbells, whistling cookers, construction chaos, neighbours learning to sing, hallucinatory deadlines by annoying colleagues, dying batteries, starving family… I will drown everything out and bury myself in Korean dramas and chips.

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||‘I’m either stubborn or consistent’||2020 saw luxury watchmakers finally go online to boost sales. Some, like IWC Schaffhausen and Japanese watchmaker Grand Seiko, went a step further, working Augmented Reality into their storytelling or creating Spotify playlists and virtual boutiques. Ulysse Nardin, the 175-year-old watch brand that still occupies its original headquarters in Le Locle, Switzerland, wasn’t lagging behind either. E-commerce was introduced in June, the futuristic Blast was launched in August, and, in November, their first watch constructed from recycled fishing nets, Diver NET, made headlines. As Patrick Pruniaux, chief executive of both Ulysse Nardin and another Kering-owned luxury watch brand, Girard-Perregaux, points out during a video call, exploration, innovation and sustainability were the key brand values highlighted in the pandemic year. Ditching his usual suit for what is now known as the Zoom sweater, the athletic Pruniaux, 48, begins by saying that a Ulysse Nardin timepiece is for people ‘‘who know who they are’’ and who they want to be. “It is a symbol of self-confidence more than a status symbol. It says something about me to me first,” he shares. Like other luxury watch brand CEOs, Paris-born Pruniaux spent many hours last year sitting in front of cameras and screens, talking about his new timepieces. The Ulysse Nardin Blast collection at Geneva Watch Days, with its stealth aircraft inspiration and in-house produced UN-172 caliber, received a lot of airtime. Built with the brand’s trademark X-shaped framework, does the ‘shape within a shape within a shape’ (the double X inside a rectangle inside a circle) geometric detail make it one of 2020’s most memorable watches? “I don’t think it should be associated with the year,” he is quick to correct. ‘‘The Blast is the dramatic evolution of a timepiece that existed, the Executive Tourbillon,” he adds. Pruniaux isn’t obsessed about decoding the millennial or Gen Z mindset. “The most important thing is who we are and how we identify ourselves, regardless of the age group,” he states. That being said, he is aware that sustainability and what is being done by his brands for the environment is keenly tracked by younger clients. One of Ulysse Nardin’s sustainability partnership stories from last year involved PhD students and scientists studying the ecosystem and migration habits of sharks. It was why their latest ‘face’ of the brand back in August was a female great white shark named Andromache. The brand’s commitment to the marine circular economy is commendable and their connect with the sea heightens their visual storytelling. I wonder if they plan to amp up the retail experience with AR or VR. “Not really, to be honest it doesn’t bring much to our client,” says Pruniaux. There is that other question he is unfailingly asked each year. After all, he was at Apple and involved in the introduction of their smart watch in 2015, before joining the French luxury conglomerate, Kering. Are you considering one, I venture. “No. I’m either stubborn or consistent, pick the one you want,” he chuckles. “For us it will bring very little and it would be confusing for our clients.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/im-either-stubborn-or-consistent/article33477327.ece
02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Alibaug, the new Antibes||I am no oracle, but the promise of a new year typically fills me with hope. Apparently, Bill Gates feels the same way; he told a US tech news site that, despite all that transpired this past year, he’s “upbeat,” because societies are making progress overall. To be honest, I wasn’t all that sanguine about 2021 a few days ago. As I sat in blissful Alibaug, outside Mumbai, thankful for a getaway, I did have some foreboding, what with a new virus strain emerging and renewed travel restrictions. That is, till I chanced upon a local pottery exhibition at Mati Moksh Ceramics, close to where we were staying. At the show, I chanced upon a group of 60-something women sitting under the shade of a tree. They were chatting and laughing, all clearly old friends and long-time Alibaug-ers. As we struck up a conversation, one of them, Rina Singh, introduced herself as a dowser. “What’s that?” I asked. Apparently, it is someone who identifies the Earth’s negative energy and tries to heal it. Singh told me that the world’s “geopathic stress,” that is, its energy, is shifting for the better. I had heard of water diviners but not this. Looking at these friendly women, who were in the somewhat high-risk Covid category, but were enjoying each other’s company as they sipped wine, made me shake off my ambiguity about the future. If these women were so joyful, why shouldn’t I be? At a time when an injection is the most coveted thing on the planet, are better days ahead? In a few months, will we once again dream of planning vacations, without worrying about countries sealing borders? Will we see family we haven’t seen in a while? Will we feel safe standing next to the mask-less? It would certainly seem so, with hordes of Indians travelling to Dubai, Maldives, Goa, and other local scenic destinations. Take Alibaug, which is booming. The Roll-On Roll-Off car ferry (RORO), initially introduced in March 2020, but closed due to the lockdown till September, has become wildly popular. In the last week of December, it was completely packed. I keep reminding myself that even though 2020 was ghastly, there were some positive developments, like this. Vacay homes and fine wine Despite the pandemic and economic distress, it is interesting to see how buoyant certain sectors of the luxury market were. Luxury homes sales  in Mumbai, for instance, were stronger than expected, according to Anarock Property Consultants. Homes in Alibaug — to rent and to buy — are in huge demand. It is the same story in Goa. As people spent so much time at home and experienced a more inward-looking life, those with means spent on both art and decorative items. Auction houses like Christie’s, Sotheby’s, Philips and Bonhams, which had to suspend live auctions during the pandemic, did well both digitally as well as in private sales. Bonham’s, for example, saw a 40% rise in buyers for its online offerings, including many under 40. Christie’s reported that 30% of its  jewellery buyers were first-time purchasers. In December, a 21.86 carat emerald ring with diamonds sold for $3.7 million (against a pre-sale estimate of $1 million) at Sotheby’s Magnificent Jewels sale. The entire auction brought in $46.9 million, the highest total for a Sotheby’s New York auction since 2017. Indian auction houses also reported solid sales and local galleries noted how tech enabled them to interact with many prospective clients. Hybrid-electric cars and boutique hotels As for cars, companies like Maserati, Ferrari, Aston Martin and Rolls Royce introduced pricey new models, some of which are hybrid-electric. Clearly, there are enough takers for vehicles costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. Commercial air travel took a big beating, but private aviation looked rosy. According to an article in Forbes a few months ago, Jetcraft, the largest buyer and seller of business jets worldwide, saw an uptick in sales. Chad Anderson, president, told the magazine that “Covid-19 was a catalyst… I have customers saying they’ll never fly on a commercial airliner again, to protect the health of themselves, their families, and their employees.” Those who can afford to, will spend to make life more comfortable. The hotel  industry is betting on it. Last month saw the opening of a fancy Anantara in the Seychelles and this year will see new luxe properties across Africa, Europe and Asia. Closer to home, my friend Siddharth Kasliwal just opened the Johri, a gem of a boutique hotel, converted from an old family home, in the heart of Jaipur. Taking fashion slow And what of fashion? Will it go back to the way it was? Today’s consumer is more aware about the impact of their buying behaviour than in years past. Movements like #govocalforlocal and #slowfashion will continue, with people gravitating towards niche, homegrown brands. But there will always be a market for high-end luxury. Even as we throw on kaftans and sweatpants, people will find an excuse to wear figure-flattering clothing. Once the pandemic is truly over, I know many who will want to dress up and go all out. After all, these are the same people who shopped their closet and put on their pretty frocks while stuck at home, just for a mood lift. So be ready for more Halpern-meets-Peacock style blinge-y party wear and body-con dresses. Given the focus on exercise and wellness, how else to show off our newly toned silhouettes? Everyone I know took to working out digitally online with their trainers or via apps and Zoom group classes. And companies like Physique57 Mumbai, an offshoot of New York-based Physique57, which uses ballet barre exercises to tone, dropped their rates for virtual classes and attracted new customers from around the country. Of course, the digital world is not an all-encompassing panacea to our woes. Restaurants and retail definitely need an in-person shot in the arm. As for socialising, given that people continued to do so despite the hazards of Covid, I am sure it will be back with a vengeance.  Gayatri Rangachari Shah will be back withFlight of Fancy, on the antics of the one percenters who defied logic to grow in wealth during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/alibaug-the-new-antibes/article33477334.ece
02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Back to the theatre||Streamers saved our entertainment souls in 2020, but for 2021, let us imagine a theatrical future, going forward a few months. It is March 2021. Spring is in the air, vaccines are rolling out in the millions, and we are stampeding towards cinemas to watch The King’s Man , the prequel to the Kingsman franchise. That enjoyed, we set our calendars to April 2, Easter, the day when, after multiple postponements, the James Bond film No Time To Die hits cinemas, a full year after its scheduled release date. From the 2020 holdovers, another film I’m looking forward to is Kenneth Branagh’s Death on the Nile , but that is not due until September. While there are several world cinema and arthouse films in the release pipeline, you’ll pardon me if I’m hankering after big screen experiences after a year where the only time I braved the cinema was for Tenet . Thankfully, there are plenty of big-ticket releases coming up. In April, nearly four years after Baby Driver , Edgar Wright returns with Last Night in Soho , a horror-thriller set in swinging 60s London, featuring Anya Taylor-Joy fresh off her The Queen’s Gambit triumph. The Marvel Cinematic Universe will resume in May with Black Widow . I’ll let that play out and wait a couple of weeks instead for Godzilla vs. Kong . Speaking of guilty pleasures, and skipping forward to July, Tom Cruise in and as Top Gun: Maverick promises to be a breathtaking big screen experience. And, while on the star, let’s hope that Mission Impossible 7 transcends Cruise’s on-set rant during the film’s shoot in 2020. If you ask me to choose just one film for 2021, that would be Peter Jackson’s The Beatles: Get Back , where he works from 56 hours of hitherto unseen footage to craft a documentary about the Fab Four. The few minutes of preview footage he released in December promise a joyous, irreverent experience. The film is due in August. October will see the release of Dune , another Hollywood adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel after David Lynch’s 1984 attempt. This time, the novel is in the capable hands of Denis Villeneuve ( Blade Runner 2049 ), so forgive me if my expectations are unreasonably high. November is due to bring Baz Luhrmann’s untitled Elvis Presley project — yes, the same one on which Tom Hanks became one of the first high-profile people who contracted the virus. The riches of December include The Matrix 4 and Steven Spielberg’s interpretation of West Side Story . Elsewhere, there is Robin Wright’s feature directorial début Land , where she also plays a woman starting a new life in the great outdoors. Another actress making her directorial début is Maggie Gyllenhaal with The Lost Daughter , featuring Olivia Colman, Jessie Buckley, Dakota Johnson, Peter Sarsgaard and Paul Mescal, where a woman’s beach vacation goes awry. The luminous Rebecca Hall is also making her directorial début with an adaptation of Nella Larsen’s novel Passing , about how the lives of two childhood friends are altered forever when they reunite. And finally, actress Olivia Wilde made a tremendous directorial début with Booksmart , and she’ll be back with psychological thriller, Don’t Worry Darling .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/back-to-the-theatre/article33477333.ece
02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Oleander for your ear||Spending much of 2020 at home also meant that we began paying extra attention to product design, from the kitchen sink to that chaise longue that turned out to be more sculptural than comfortable. Diwiks, a five-year-old luxury speaker brand with ‘Remade in India’ as its tagline, is one example where the product doesn’t stop with checking only the art and design boxes. Diwik Singh Chhalani, 37, says his handcrafted speakers, 75 so far, have seen customers pleasantly surprised by their superior sound as well. Essentially via word of mouth, the speakers have been sought after by designers, industrialists and art collectors, with the most recent consignment going out from the studio in Bikaner to each of the five family members of a well-known Mumbai businessman. With only 12 made in 2020 as part of the Art Deco Meets 2020 collection, Raw Mango’s Sanjay Garg is another client patiently waiting for his Diwiks speaker. “There is a void in terms of design in this country. We live in the world of craft, yet it is still a rare marriage between design and craft,” the designer explains, when I ask him what prompted this purchase. As for Chhalani, the former advertising professional says sound was never going to be an afterthought for these speakers. “Our sound system and components are exclusively designed for us. It is a proper stereo set-up where you can enjoy pristine two channel sound. Our kevlar cone woofers and silk dome tweeters are powered by a highly efficient class-D amplifier and a toroidal transformer,” he elaborates. The Art Deco Meets 2020 line was inspired by a haveli that stood opposite his childhood home in Bikaner but was razed down this year. Built in the art deco style, Kasturi Nivas was the erstwhile home of Rai Bahadur, a companion of maharaja Ganga Singh of Bikaner, and Chhalani used the reclaimed wood from its doors and windows to create his speakers. With a surge in demand during the pandemic, he began paying more attention to details like the inlay work on the Burma teak speakers. “I had this idea of using oleander wood from my garden, which I had planted myself in 2016. It is a craft traditionally seen in Rajasthan’s havelis , and my artisans are well versed with it,” he says. A bit embarrassed about using the much-abused term ‘sustainable’, he recalls how he began by restoring old radios but did not want to buy new wood. “I am not going to use materials that are not environment-friendly. I would rather take wood that is salvaged and good for another 100 years. There is the motivation to make something that outlives us,” he continues. With Rs. 1.5 lakh as the average pricing, this device will see a rising demand this year. Hopefully, it will also inspire other successful design+craft experiments from across the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/oleander-for-your-ear/article33477315.ece
02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Palm Springs to peacock feathers||Colour becomes Matthew Williamson. And the British fashion designer — who dressed celebrities like Sienna Miller and Kate Moss for 20 years before venturing into interior design — confesses he is “endlessly inspired” by the vitality and heritage of India. “I’d say that Indian design plays a part in the inspiration for all my designs; it could be a pattern or a colour combination that I’ve always admired.” He brings this love into his latest collaboration with Obeetee. The duo has rolled out a limited edition SS21 collection of rugs that brings together ikats and sun-steeped landscapes with the hand-knotting expertise of the Jaipur-based carpet makers. “I am an admirer of craft in all its forms, from mesmerising woodwork to the brutal beauty of ironmongery. Working with handwoven rugs, for this reason, is a dream come true, especially with Obeetee’s respect for provenance, authenticity and unrivalled skill,” he says.  For the love of space  Across the collection, Williamson has explored varying inspirations. For example, ‘Sunrise Haze’ emulates the pastel sun rising over the Cala Deià (in Majorca, Spain); ‘Palm Springs’ looks to the fronds of the eponymous palm trees of the area; ‘Peacock Feathers’, a signature motif of his, is showcased in a rare large-scale form; while ‘Ikat’ explores how colours, and the way they bleed into each other, add movement to a space. “Colour and pattern can be such vital elements in our lives and our homes. They speak to us at an aesthetic and an emotional level,” he says over an email interaction, adding that designing the collection was intuitive. “Thinking outside the box, about ways to add vibrancy, joy and optimism to a space, will always lead you to unexpected decorating ideas, and I think rugs are the perfect vehicle for this kind of thinking.”  Master of collabs  Williamson broke away from the “relentless fashion circus” (as he called it in a Guardian article a few years ago) in 2015 and did a deep dive into interiors. Since then his whimsical patterns and bold colours have graced everything from bespoke suites at the Belmond La Residencia hotel in the Majorcan town of Deià, where he lives part of the year, and a collab with designer Bertrando Di Renzo (on a range of textiles, tablecloths, and trays), to a wallpaper capsule for Osborne & Little, and lampshades for Britain’s Pooky Lighting. Recently, he even did a product edit for Vinterior, an e-commerce platform that specialises in vintage furniture. What’s next? “There is so much in the pipeline; it is incredible to see the way the world is reacting to interior design since we’ve been locked down. One of the next launches I’m looking forward to is a collection of decorative furniture with some of my quintessential colours and patterns,” he concludes.  Carpets from Rs. 37,800 (5x8 ft) onwards, on obeetee.com.   “Matthew has a creativity that is rarely seen, effortlessly creating designs in a kaleidoscope of colours that spark joy. He is also a passionate advocate for sustainable handmade goods. The collection consists of eclectic patterns and several colours in each design, which makes them very distinctive and yet lends a positive, uplifting mood to a space.”   Angelique Dhama, Chief Marketing Officer, Obeetee||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/palm-springs-to-peacock-feathers/article33477321.ece

However, last year’s lockdown saw health and fitness app downloads growing by 46% worldwide, with India recording a whopping 157% surge (Moengage report). So 2021 might keep up with the trend, with many of us continuing to opt for workouts on TV, apps or WhatsApp groups. From group sessions to personalised meditation classes, we bring you a list of lockdown launches.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/the-virtual-fitness-pass/article33477296.ece
02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The engendered endangered||Just like #UnderwearMondays, last year had brought much change — some of it good and nice to smell. But while so much stands redefined, we still have much ground to cover. So as we set about throwing out the dirty bathwater, why not go all the way and… wait, I think I have mixed up my idioms. Maybe this is the thought-equivalent of autocorrect, or having another person’s Freudian slip. Moving on then. It is high time, I feel, that we did away with gender — not anatomically, of course, because every body has specific needs and doctors are best equipped to comment on that. What I am talking about is the quotidian quandary about using pronouns or places that should by default be understood as not being gender-specific. Here are some suggestions:  Toilets: Let’s do away with gender-based toilets. Let’s just learn to clean up after ourselves. Cis-gender men, I am looking at you.     Heels: Either abolish heels on grounds of cruelty or else make it okay for men (outside of Prince) to wear them. For once men start wearing heels, they will tech the hell out of it, all for sake of comfort — retractable heels is one such idea in the wings.     Pink: Blue is not a colour for men, it is one of a classist social structure — lighter shades for the working class and the royal ones for, well, royalty. Pink is the colour of democracy. Or it should be. It starts with brands stopping using pink for their women’s collections (sneakers to clothes). Either add more colours or make pink for men too.     Perfumes: Banish the guy in history who said peonies and jasmines are for ladies while ogreish men should only reek of tree barks. If florals were good enough for Napoleon, I’ll be the bigger man (literally) and graciously accept them too. 2021 is no time for aromas to pick genders.     Clothing: If women can wear skirts why can’t men (outside of Scots)? Why does it only have to be a lungi or a mundu ? Can’t men like pleats? As long as a common denominator of decency is respected, clothing should be a form of self-expression and not conformity.     Abuses: I would love to campaign for gender-neutral abuses, but I feel they just won’t feel as cathartic rolling off the tongue. So let’s keep the wordage and agree to reinterpret the meaning, one that is free for gender. Sure it makes the world a less civil place but we’d have a lot fewer basket cases if we could express freely more often. By now everyone knows who the new American president is, but do we know what’s happening in Bihar or who our local district magistrate is, for that matter? Change, as the adage goes, starts small. So don’t worry about affairs 9,000 miles away; instead focus on revisiting and breaking ground with rooted gender-ideas that we have held on to firmly for so long.  This column is for anyone who gives an existential toss.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/the-engendered-endangered/article33477332.ece

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||8 weeks to better sleep||Last year, we lost sleep: working at odd hours, worrying about the future, about falling ill, about financial security. The time we saved on the commute or evenings out didn’t always translate into better work-personal life balance. Instead, confinement and anxiety turned many of us into night owls. Insomnia is never good news. While it is a nascent subject, sleep research tells us that without the right amount of zzzs (different for each of us) our reaction time slows down, our attention becomes short and scattered, and we risk the increase of serious health problems such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dementia and Alzheimer’s. It is not just social distancing that’s becoming the new norm, it is tiredness from lack of sleep, too. Even as studies look into sleep as the latest casualty of the pandemic — a recent review of Covid-19 sleep research by Northumbria University, of over 50,000 people from 13 countries, indicated that around 40% have experienced sleep problems — research is exploring if melatonin, the hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, could play a role in the fight against Covid-19 (preliminary research was published inPLOS Biology, the peer-reviewed scientific journal). The bottom line, sleep is key. So this year, why not pay attention to the night rather than the day? Not only will it help you get up on the right side of the bed, but there are also added benefits such as better cognition and memory consolidation. Dr Abhinav Singh, Medical Director of the Indiana Sleep Center in the US, who has practised sleep medicine for 15 years, helps us through a two month, step-by-step guide to better sleep.                                                     Week 1   Turn off the (night) light  The bulb heralded the death of sleep Thomas Edison patented the light bulb in 1879, and while we can’t blame him for today’s light pollution, “light has been rapidly invading our nights”, says Dr Singh. Physiologically, our bodies are not designed to experience light at night, as it upsets the circadian rhythm, the body’s natural sleep-wake cycle. “When the sun sets, it is a signal for the hormone melatonin to cyclically rise. When you expose yourself to bright artificial light, it suppresses your melatonin,” he says. Take away Don’t wear sunglasses in the morning. Getting sunlight between 9 am and 12 pm optimises the wake-sleep cycle.Use motion sensors at floor level rather than having a night light.Stare at the dark sky to help your pupils dilate and melatonin to kick in before you head to bed.  Week 2 Dull down screens What junk food is to nutrition, screens are to sleep Blue light (repeated ad nauseam by now) impacts wakefulness and sleepiness, suppressing sleep rhythms. “If you must expose yourself to light, yellow is a touch better than the tube light [white light has a higher spectrum of blue light],” says Dr Singh. And for screen time, use the built-in filters to block the blue spectrum. Take away Set devices to night mode at 7 pm and be screen free from about 9.30 pm onwards until bedtime. Week 3 Perform sleep ‘fourplay’ Look to babies who can sleep anywhere We are born with the intrinsic knowledge of how and when to eat and sleep, but “as we grow older, we fight the feeling of sleep with substitutes: the access to caffeine, screens”. Dr Singh suggests we follow zeitgebers (natural cues that help our circadian rhythm) such as “the first rays of the sun [being a] signal to the brain that it is time to wake up”. Take away  Finish your last meal with the setting of the sun, or about three hours before sleep. Avoid heavy meals, alcohol, or any stimulating activity that revs up your brain in the evening.It is possible to put your body into sleep mode. An hour before bedtime, take a warm shower to dilate the blood vessels. You lose heat from the skin, so the core (head, neck, chest, abdomen) cools down, signalling the body to release more melatonin.For 15 minutes each, journal, read a book or listen to an audio book, meditate or do a slow breathing exercise.  Week 4 Give anxiety a chair Research says sleep deprived people perform worse on tasks involving alertness and cognition than those intoxicated with alcohol A stressful episode during the day will make the body release cortisol, a stress hormone that wakes us up. “It chops your sleep up, so [the hours in bed] are never good quality,” says Dr Singh. Higher cortisol levels also lead to disruptive dreaming during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Take away Aerobic exercise, meditation, listening to soft music, all reduce cortisol levels.Schedule worry, to offload the brain. Dedicate a time to it — 15 or 20 minutes — to jot down your troubles. You could designate a space or chair to it, so you take the time to acknowledge it and then move on. Week 5 Take the exercise superdrug It lowers everything from diabetes to anxiety Exercise — “which will get your heart rate to above 120 beats per minute, about 30 minutes, five times a week” — is anti-diabetes, cholesterol lowering, anti-hypertensive, anxiety controlling, an anti-depressant, appetite regulator, and a sleep promoting agent. In terms of mental exercise, it is OK to do a crossword or Sudoku close to bedtime, “as long as you’re not fighting to win”. A gentle hobby like playing the piano, or unwinding with a walk, is good too. Similarly, intimacy is a window to sleep. Take away Wrap up exercise before 6 pm (before sunset) because it increases cortisol levels.Even if you’ve had a bad night’s rest, it is best to do some form of exercise with a reduced intensity, because you’re using it as a zeitgeber. Week 6 Regulate environment temperature The body warms up in the daytime and cools down at night to prompt sleep A couple of hours before bedtime, the body’s temperature begins to drop, reaching its lowest point at about 4 am (the deepest phase of sleep), and then begins to rise. In its cool down phase, the body sends its warmth out to the extremities (arms and legs), so you may find that in winter, your feet are warm at night, but cold during the day. Take away A colder room drinks the heat from the body, aiding sleep. Sleep promoting temperatures range from 15 to 20 degrees Celsius. “The idea is to just feel cold enough to want a sheet or light blanket,” says Dr Singh. Week 7 Skip the wine, wind down with water Coffee takes six hours to break down into half, so a potent cup at 8 am will still see half of it in your system at 2 pm, and a quarter at 8 pm. Staying hydrated through the day is important, because symptoms of dehydration — headaches, dry mouth — may wake you up at night. Heaters, some medicines (like allergy and blood pressure), and breathing through the mouth can also cause a dry mouth. Snoring at night or having a bladder condition (like in menopausal women) could rouse you too. If this is happening regularly, do check with your doctor. Take away Taper off drinking water after 7 pm to have uninterrupted sleep. Later in the evening, green tea or herbal teas work better than coffee.Alcohol triggers snoring, and while it is a sedative that helps in the initial hours of sleep (acting in the same place as Valium does in the brain), in the second half, it interrupts slumber. If you’re drinking, three to four hours before bedtime is a good gap, and not more than a couple of small drinks. Week 8 Breathe to kill cortisol Yoga andpranayama activate the parasympathetic (rest system) in the body A block of five hours of good sleep is better than eight hours of broken sleep. Social jet lag — coined by German researcher, Till Roenneberg, in 2006 — is the concept of not sleeping enough during the week and trying to catch up on it over the weekend. “Sleep loss is sleep loss. You cannot drive on a road with potholes five days a week, and on day six and seven, drive on an expressway,” says Dr Singh, because the damage is already done. Take away Pranayamaexercises the lungs. Studies haven’t clearly established its benefits, but it does help with reducing anxiety. If you do have a bad night’s rest, the next day, aim to get to bed at the same time as usual.A short nap (less than 40 minutes) is OK in the afternoon if you need one. “I have always been an early riser, getting up at 5 am. So I need my seven hours of sleep. Ten months into the pandemic, my sleep cycle has changed. I’ve always had trouble sleeping [especially post menopause], but a combination of homeopathy — which I started soon after the intense lockdown was lifted — putting aside my digital devices after 9.30 pm, and having a hot shower, allowing the water to fall on the back of my neck [an energy point], have helped a lot. My yoga teacher has also taught measanasfor the end of the day, though I often forget to do them.” Anita Ratnam,dancer “Sleep used to frame each part of my waking hours rather neatly. This once dependable routine, however, started becoming unpredictable over the last year. The first of my bedtime rituals is to ensure that my mobile and tablet are on silent mode and placed face down, so I wouldn’t be disturbed if the screen lights up. Once in bed, being an addict of serials, I stream a couple of episodes before tuning out. I then read for a bit. By this time I’m really drowsy and fall asleep quickly. Sometimes I slip into deep, dreamless sleep, but occasionally, the evening’s on-screen action colours my dreams. That’s not very nice!” David Abraham,fashion designer “I’ll never compromise on my eight hours for anything, including work, because those hours of sleep help me recover not just physically but mentally and be charged up for the next day. I’ve realised how much I love early mornings, which means I need to be in bed by 10 pm. Going early to bed has really made me a happier person through the day. During the pandemic, it became a routine.” Taapsee Pannu,actor “I’m in tune with my circadian rhythm, I use a Fitbit to monitor my sleep, and the recent connect discovered between Covid-19 and melatonin is a good reason to sleep on time. I didn’t go out for New Year’s Eve. I did what I’ve done for many years: woke up at 5.30 am, took my car out for a drive, listened to classical music, stopped at Humayun’s Tomb, took a walk and looked at my beautiful city. Around 8.30 am, I turned up at The Oberoi for a sumptuous breakfast. It is a much better way to wake up to a new year than with a hangover.” Tarun Tahiliani,fashion designer Bedtime stories||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/8-weeks-to-better-sleep/article33477311.ece

Week 8 Breathe to kill cortisol Yoga andpranayama activate the parasympathetic (rest system) in the body A block of five hours of good sleep is better than eight hours of broken sleep. Social jet lag — coined by German researcher, Till Roenneberg, in 2006 — is the concept of not sleeping enough during the week and trying to catch up on it over the weekend. “Sleep loss is sleep loss. You cannot drive on a road with potholes five days a week, and on day six and seven, drive on an expressway,” says Dr Singh, because the damage is already done.

If you do have a bad night’s rest, the next day, aim to get to bed at the same time as usual.A short nap (less than 40 minutes) is OK in the afternoon if you need one. “I have always been an early riser, getting up at 5 am. So I need my seven hours of sleep. Ten months into the pandemic, my sleep cycle has changed. I’ve always had trouble sleeping [especially post menopause], but a combination of homeopathy — which I started soon after the intense lockdown was lifted — putting aside my digital devices after 9.30 pm, and having a hot shower, allowing the water to fall on the back of my neck [an energy point], have helped a lot. My yoga teacher has also taught measanasfor the end of the day, though I often forget to do them.” Anita Ratnam,dancer “Sleep used to frame each part of my waking hours rather neatly. This once dependable routine, however, started becoming unpredictable over the last year. The first of my bedtime rituals is to ensure that my mobile and tablet are on silent mode and placed face down, so I wouldn’t be disturbed if the screen lights up. Once in bed, being an addict of serials, I stream a couple of episodes before tuning out. I then read for a bit. By this time I’m really drowsy and fall asleep quickly. Sometimes I slip into deep, dreamless sleep, but occasionally, the evening’s on-screen action colours my dreams. That’s not very nice!” David Abraham,fashion designer “I’ll never compromise on my eight hours for anything, including work, because those hours of sleep help me recover not just physically but mentally and be charged up for the next day. I’ve realised how much I love early mornings, which means I need to be in bed by 10 pm. Going early to bed has really made me a happier person through the day. During the pandemic, it became a routine.” Taapsee Pannu,actor “I’m in tune with my circadian rhythm, I use a Fitbit to monitor my sleep, and the recent connect discovered between Covid-19 and melatonin is a good reason to sleep on time. I didn’t go out for New Year’s Eve. I did what I’ve done for many years: woke up at 5.30 am, took my car out for a drive, listened to classical music, stopped at Humayun’s Tomb, took a walk and looked at my beautiful city. Around 8.30 am, I turned up at The Oberoi for a sumptuous breakfast. It is a much better way to wake up to a new year than with a hangover.” Tarun Tahiliani,fashion designer Bedtime stories||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-weekend/8-weeks-to-better-sleep/article33477293.ece
02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Looking forward to the New Year||While 2020 has been an unprecedented year globally, it has been able to create certain unique opportunities for the real estate sector. Going forward, these opportunities are likely to usher in a new era of innovation and digital transformation. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated recalibration at a systemic and an individual level. The realty sector has not remained untouched from this recalibration but has shown remarkable resilience in the face of the pandemic. As we continue to learn to live in these times, the year 2021 would require us to re-imagine the way we have operated so far. Here’s how the segment unfolded this year and what to look forward to in 2021: Office market The commercial real estate sector has made large strides in the past decade. Robust occupier interest, ascension of organised real estate developers and the emergence of institutional capital have accelerated this segment’s growth. While the pandemic has impacted the office sector, it could very well become the flag-bearer of recovery. The quarterly growth in office space absorption was up by 14% from Q2 2020 to Q3 2020, with an increase in absorption of space from 6.9 million sq. ft. in Q2 2020 to 7.9 million sq. ft. in Q3 2020. At an overarching level, the future of the workplace has been witnessing a lot of debate. It has primarily been centred around how office spaces would be used and designed, the role of tech and changing work patterns. The post-COVID-19 new normal has been characterised by the evolution of work patterns, which has altered the way both occupiers and developers have operated so far. While concepts such as wellness, workplace strategies and agility have been around for some time, their enforcement is expected to strengthen in the coming years. In addition, as operations have commenced in a phased manner, companies could, in the future, prefer a more distributed workforce. Therefore, it would be reasonable to believe that our offices would be less centralised and have more widely distributed teams that are appropriately linked through technology. We are also witnessing a growing inclination towards a hybrid work model, wherein, a portion of the workforce would be able to work-from-anywhere (WFA) with the option to operate out of remote locations on certain day/s of the week. However, a majority of the firms would retain the traditional physical space model as they arrive at an optimum remote working / workforce intensity for themselves. Retail spaces The growth of the Indian retail sector has been marked by rapid evolution in consumer behaviour and growing integration of online and offline retail formats. Discussion around the segment’s transformation has intensified in recent years as the industry adopts new technologies and approaches to fulfill consumer demand. COVID-19 has accelerated many of these trends, with e-retail quickly progressing from being a regular habit for a minority of consumers to becoming the new norm of shopping behaviour. The quarterly growth in retail space take was up by 79% from Q2 2020-Q3 2020. Going forward, upmarket and niche grocery stores are likely to expand as Indians become more health-conscious and dine at home more frequently. Within F&B, fast-food players and coffee shops would continue to expand cautiously, with rationalised spaces and a robust home -delivery model. Touchless tech would also be a key trend in this space as retailers increasingly digitise merchandising and transacting mechanisms. The role of brick-and-mortar stores would evolve from just being a point of sale, rather they would be expected to also serve as platforms to engage consumers and amplify brands. This might require a thorough re-evaluation of the location, design and operation model of retail properties. Within retail stores, we also foresee a change in space densities of fitting rooms, product testing zones, pick-up counters and stockrooms. This changing nature of the retail store is likely to spur retailers to diversify their store formats and networks. A higher number of stores with unique features and product mix — all of which would continue to operate under a cohesive brand culture — is expected. Logistics India’s Industrial & Logistics (I&L) RE sector has witnessed a transformation after 2017 in terms of the quality of assets, mode of operations and type of investments. Despite the pandemic affecting leasing activity, it has shown remarkable resilience during the last few months. In 2020, 3PL (third-party logistics) firms and e-commerce operators accounted for more than half of the leasing activity, followed by engineering and manufacturing firms. Hyperlocal delivery gained steam during the pandemic as e-commerce players began sourcing their deliveries from neighbourhood stores to meet customer demand. The quarterly growth in warehousing space take was up by 105% from Q2 2020 – Q3 2020, with increase in absorption of space from 2.2 million sq. ft. in Q2 2020 to 4.5 million sq. ft in Q3 2020. The coming year is likely to see a continuation of this trend as demographic groups that previously displayed resistance towards online shopping. These groups are now showing an acceptance of the format as they’ve realised its convenience. As a result, maintaining higher stock levels is likely to become a norm which, in the future, is expected to generate higher I&L demand from e-commerce players and in turn, 3PL firms. Another outcome of the pandemic on the Indian I&L sector has been the diversification of the supply chain, given the disruption caused by the pandemic in both supply and demand. As a result, occupiers are now adopting a modern, networked supply chain ecosystem that lays equal emphasis on resilience, near-shoring capability, sustainability and agility, thereby ensuring timely and transparent data flow among stakeholders. This digitisation is also moving towards warehousing facilities where, going forward, the use of AI, IoT and Big Data would result in the creation of smarter warehouses that would significantly improve supply chain efficiencies. Residential sector Similar to all RE sectors, the COVID-19 outbreak affected the residential sector as well, with both sales and new launches slowing down as caution pervaded the market. However, green shoots of recovery have now been witnessed as housing sales in Q3 2020 increased by a strong 86% on a quarterly basis. Apartment units covered in the top seven cities were in the 12,000 unit range in Q2 2020, however it grew to 22,000 units in Q3 2020. This was largely due to strong policy support, low mortgage rates, reduction in stamp duty and property registration fee (in a few states) along with incentives and attractive payment schemes offered by the developer community. Furthermore, last-mile funding mechanisms provided by the government for delayed housing projects have helped boost stakeholder sentiments. This has created an enabling environment which has strengthened the confidence levels of end-users and fence-sitters. Going forward, we expect a gradual improvement in sales across all segments, although mid-income (Rs. 45 lakh-Rs. 1 crore) and budget (less than Rs. 45 lakh) categories are expected to be the key focus areas among home buyers and are expected to perform relatively better. The two segments together accounted for a share of more than 80% in overall housing sales in 2020 and are expected to dominate residential sales going forward in 2021 as well. In addition, projects launched in locations with developed physical and social infrastructure are expected to see greater traction in the coming year. Although the demand for ready-to-move-in projects is expected to be stronger, GST rate cuts for residential properties have bridged the taxation gap between an under-construction and completed project, thereby whetting the appetite for under-construction projects. We expect similar policy measures to continue to bolster housing demand and recovery of the residential real estate sector in the coming year. Heightened activity is, therefore, expected in leading cities such as Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune and Delhi-NCR (select parts of Gurgaon and Noida). Alternate segments The year 2020 has witnessed an amplified interest in alternative asset classes such as flexible workspaces, data centres and cold storage units. We expect this interest to continue into 2021 as well:   Flexible Workspaces:  They have been gaining traction in India and the coming years are likely to witness occupiers adopting a service-oriented role, leading to the growth of space-as-a-service model. Providing customised end-user experience is also likely to gain more ground, especially in the wake of COVID-19. This could give a fillip to managed workspace providers.   Data Centres (DC):  The rise in usage of smart devices, coupled with increasing amounts of data consumption post COVID-19, has led to a surge in data storage and processing requirements in India, which has further widened the role of DCs. We believe that occupier demand for data storage is likely to increase in the coming quarters, with the country’s DC capacity expected to cross 600 MW during 2020-21. Supply addition in the coming years is expected to be dominated by the cities of Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Delhi-NCR.   Cold Storage (CS):  Following the COVID-19 outbreak, the demand for CS facilities is now being further fuelled by a huge omni-channel distribution of Food & Grocery (F&G) across tier I and II cities in the country. Currently, the overall cold storage (CS) capacity in India stands at about 37-39 million tonnes. CBRE expects the overall CS real estate stock to rise to 1,400 -1,500 million sq. ft. and the overall CS capacity is expected to reach 70 - 75 million tonnes by 2023. 2021 outlook In these extraordinary times, RE stakeholders across sectors have an opportunity to structurally re-imagine their strategies to ensure sustained recovery. Doing so would require shifting from traditional approaches and embracing new, transformational methods — which would be accelerated by widespread tech adoption, sustained policy impetus and accelerated investor interest across RE in India. We believe that with stakeholders becoming increasingly interconnected and dependent upon one another, they would need to jointly develop their RE strategies going forward. In the long term, most businesses would have to re-look at their space design from a technological and social distancing perspective to streamline sanitisation methods being deployed currently. Another potential shift in long-term occupier strategy would include a stronger preference for buildings with wellness and sustainability features. Overall, we expect demand for real estate to remain robust and the sector to emerge resilient in the future.

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||For a brand new look||Keen to make some changes around the house? Before you head out shopping or hit the online stores, why not see what magic you can create with what you already have? Sometimes all it takes is a bit of inspiration to see your rooms and spaces with fresh eyes. Style the open shelving Glass-front cupboards and open shelving — in the living room, bedrooms, or kitchens — are crying out loud to be styled. Take a look at your shelves, and make a few tweaks: remove the extra clutter, add a candle or a vase of flowers, pile the plates and bowls in matching clusters — and you’re set. Switch the drapes Everyone’s always gushing about how turning furniture around the home gives you a new vibe. We have another take — switch curtains and drapes across rooms to create a new look for free (and just a little hardship!) Change up the art  All thosebooks and magazines that you refused to give away may be the source of frame-worthy illustrations. Just cut out the pages you like and encase them in a set of frames. Changing the picture frames is a sure-shot way to ensure a new look. Colour things bright Raid your child’s art supplies and choose a shade of acrylic paint you like. Use it to give your old fan a brand new look (don’t forget to clean it before that!). Also try painting those boring switchboards. Lime green or aqua work well in the bathroom; cream or coffee are ideal for the living room. Hello, fairy lights The string of lights you bought for Diwali can be used through the year. Toss it artistically — across bathroom mirrors, over the dresser or even atop the AC (when not in use). Add some chutzpah to the fairy lights by decorating with easy-peasy cupcake liner flowers. Great as a lighting option for open areas, especially when entertaining. Experiment with paper Use paper in bright shades to create pinwheels in different sizes and affix them to a wall. It’s an instant décor update that’s ideal for a child’s room, hallway, or staircase landing. A grown-up version would be papering a wall with old maps. All you need to do is decoupage maps on to a freshly cleaned wall. Use those fabric swatches Create instant and stand-out art by displaying pretty fabric differently — encase it in smart frames for a modern look or put it in wooden sewing hoops for a bohemian display. Use scraps to create buntings, which add vintage charm to doorways and rooms. Mismatched fabric swatches can create an awesome jar display. Just cover jar tops (cut and stick on with craft glue) with fabric, and display craft supplies, spices, or what you like. Raid the toy closet If your child has outgrown her toy farm, spray paint the animals a bright colour (we suggest gold). Glue them as you see fit — by the bathroom ventilator, on a window sill, or atop the bookshelf. Interesting displays are waiting to be created with simple things — pencils with toppers, colourful straws, small dolls, or even stationery supplies. Think out of the box Rummage through your cupboards for unusual décor additions. A dupatta can be put to use as a runner, a teapot that’s never used is ideal to hold flowers, and a collection of mismatched serveware works as dresser storage. Give wooden cutlery a rehaul by painting the lower section a bright colour.  Style your glass-front cupboards and open shelves in the living room, bedroom or kitchen||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/for-a-brand-new-look/article33477345.ece
02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Tapping into transit||Realty consultancy Knight Frank India’s latest report — Bengaluru Urban Infrastructure Report 2020 — states that key transit infra projects including the Metro and roadways will unlock possibilities for heightened real estate development across 24 key locations in the city. It is estimated that 127 kilometres (km) of the Metro and 270 km of road projects are under various stages of construction in the city. Bengaluru Metro Phase 2, Extensions and New Lines are expected to be completed between 2021-2025. The major road projects — Peripheral Ring Road (PRR), Satellite Town Ring Road (STRR) and Suburban Rail Network — are likely to be completed beyond 2025. All these projects are being implemented under various models at an estimated cost of more than $11.4 billion. These projects will bring new locations to the forefront and will also be instrumental in driving incremental real estate development across some of the well-established office hubs as also isolated locations which needed public transport connectivity. According to Knight Frank Research’s analysis, 24 locations have been identified to benefit from the transit-oriented infrastructural development in the city. Some of the prominent key impact markets include:  Whitefield: Once operational, this 15.5 km elevated metro line under Phase 2 Extension on Baiyappanahalli-Whitefield route is expected to bring a considerable reduction in the travel time from Whitefield to K.R. Puram by 39 minutes during peak hours. Developers in the city remain bullish on building more commercial inventory in this established office hub as the enhanced connectivity will lure more tenants in the long term. Whitefield is expected to see 13 million sq ft of incremental office space supply set for completion in the next four years.  Electronic City Phase-1: This area is going to have its own metro station, which will ease the situation of traffic snarls for the employees. Once operational, this 18.8 km elevated metro line under Phase 2 on R.V.Road-Bommasandra route is expected to bring a considerable reduction in the travel time from Electronic City Phase- I to Central Silk Board by almost 22 minutes during peak hours. At present, nearly 1.8 million sq ft of additional office space is under construction in Electronic City Phase I.  Electronic City Phase-2: Just like Electronic City Phase – I, this key impact market is also going to benefit from the upcoming 18.8 km elevated metro line under Phase 2 on R.V. Road to Bommasandra route. During peak hours, the metro line is expected to considerably reduce the travel time from Electronic City Phase- II to Central Silk Board by 38 minutes. Few local developers are coming up with nearly 1.4 million sq ft new office spaces in Electronic City Phase – II.  Bellandur-Marathahalli: During peak hours, the 18.5 km elevated metro line — phase 2 A on Central Silk Road-KR Puram route is expected to bring a considerable reduction in the travel time from Bellandur to K.R Puram by 50 minutes. This belt is one of the busiest stretches on Outer Ring Road with many IT Parks, SEZs and non SEZ office assets. The metro line will bring public transport connectivity right inside the IT Parks and help save a lot of time for commuters. Once operational, Metro line Phase 2A will reduce travel time from KR Puram to Bellandur by 50 minutes during peak hours. This belt has an incremental office development potential of 13 million sq ft on private land parcels in existing IT parks.  Mahadevapura-KR Puram: Metro line Phase 2A (Central Silk Board to KR Puram) is expected to heighten real estate development in the Mahadevapura-KR Puram belt. With the metro connectivity under Line 2 and 2A, accessibility to the central and eastern parts of Bengaluru will improve. Once operational, these routes are expected to bring a considerable reduction in the travel time from Mahadevapura Flyover to MG Road by 25 minutes during peak hours. The office development potential along this stretch is estimated to be around 5-6 million sq.ft. in the non-SEZ spaces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/tapping-into-transit/article33477336.ece

We are in dire need of an association to undertake maintenance once the builder leaves. My queries are as follows: 1. Is there a CMDA rule that states a builder should form an association and hand over it to the flat owners before he leaves? 2. Do the flat owners have to form an association as per the Acts prevailing? 3. In such a case, will the owner or the builder automatically become a member of the association for unsold flats? 4. If so, what are his voting rights that are proportionate to the unsold flats or one per the flat? 5. Does he have to pay maintenance fees for all the unsold flats ? N Santhanam Chennai The scope of CMDA is, amongst others, to regulate all physical developments within the Chennai Metropolitan Area in accordance with its master plan and it has no role to play in forming of associations. The Tamilnadu Apartment Ownership Act stipulates formation of an association of apartment owners for maintaining the common areas and facilities and the common interest of the apartment owners. It further states that the administration of every property shall be governed by its bye-laws. The Act does not specifically deal with rights (such as voting) or responsibilities (such as payment of maintenance) of the builder relating to unsold flats. The obligations of the builder in respect of unsold flats can be covered in the bye-laws of the association and implemented accordingly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/forming-an-association/article33477339.ece
02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The 2020 office market report||India’s office market continues to recover witnessing a net absorption of 8.27 million sq.ft., an increase of 52% in Q4 2020 (Oct-Nov-Dec) when compared to Q3 2020. Except for Bengaluru, net absorption of office spaces improved in the other six cities (Chennai, Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune) according to JLL Research. Hyderabad led the pack with the highest net absorption in Q4 2020. While the southern markets of Bengaluru and Hyderabad accounted for more than 50% of the net absorption in Q4 2020, maximum increase in net absorption (when compared to Q3 2020) was witnessed in Mumbai, Delhi NCR and Chennai. Kolkata also witnessed a strong resurgence albeit on a lower base. While IT/ITeS continues to form a majority proportion, leasing activity is being driven by increased demand for office spaces from sectors such as e-commerce, healthcare and FMCG. “The year 2019 saw historic highs with net absorption crossing 46 mn sq ft. In 2020, net absorption dipped by 44% when compared to 2019. However, a comparison to the average annual net absorption levels between 2016 and 2018 elucidates a more realistic and thus resilient nature of the Indian office market. Led by the southern markets of Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru, net absorption levels in 2020 reached 81% of what was observed between 2016 and 2018,” said Ramesh Nair, CEO and Country Head, JLL India. “Notably, net absorption in Hyderabad crossed the average annual levels witnessed during that same time frame.”     Lockdown impact The office real estate market was most impacted as lockdown measures disrupted the way we work. Corporates had to adopt work-from-home (WFH) as an alternative, which brought in its wake a new set of possibilities and challenges. Perceptions around the scale and potential of remote working changed. Earlier, the view was that remote working as a concept would not work in India. This changed with the remote working experiment proving to be fairly successful for a majority of the organisations. However, that does not mean that WFH presents a sustainable long-term solution for all corporates. It presents several physical and cultural challenges, more so for a country like ours with a large proportion of employees staying in multi-generational households. WFH could be, at best, a supplement to the traditional way of working from office and could impact the office market demand by an estimated up to 20% in the medium to long term. This dip will be counter-balanced by increasing demand for office spaces from emerging sectors like healthcare, e-commerce and data centres. De-densification and splitting of offices are expected to further drive demand.  Occupancy chart In another big sign of a continued recovery, new completions during the October-December quarter were recorded at 12.78 million sq.ft., an increase of 39% when compared to Q3 2020. “The southern markets of Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru accounted for a major chunk (71%) of the total new completions in Q4 2020. On an annual basis, new completions across the top 7 cities dipped by 30% to about 36.34 million sq.ft. in 2020 as compared to 51.62 million sq.ft. in 2019. This being said, it is important to point out that new completions surpassed the average annual levels of ~34million sq ft witnessed during 2016-18,” said Samantak Das, Chief Economist and Head of Research & REIS, India, JLL. “2021 is expected to witness close to ~38-40 million sq.ft. of new completions, while net absorption is likely to hover around 32-35 million sq.ft. This will be at par with the annual net absorption levels seen during 2016-2018,” he added. Occupiers, however, continue to review their real estate portfolios and are adopting consolidation and optimisation strategies through the year. The relatively subdued net absorption levels could not keep pace with new completions. This resulted in overall vacancy increasing from 13.5% in Q3 2020 to 14.0% in Q4 2020. Despite the rise in vacancy levels, the markets of Bengaluru and Pune continued to hover in single digits. This augurs well for a strong rebound in these markets as economic and business conditions are expected to gradually improve in the coming quarters. Rentals across markets remain stable Office rents in 2020 remained stable across the major office markets in India. With stable rental values, range-bound vacancy levels and limited upcoming Grade A supply across key markets, the office market in India continues to be landlord-favourable. Hence, reduction of headline rents is not a popular phenomenon and rents are expected to remain stable in the short to medium term. However, landlords are considering the current situation and have become more accommodating to the demands of occupiers. Flexibility is key Q4 2020 saw recovery being sustained in both net absorption as well as new completions. The pace is only expected to increase in the upcoming quarters. However, some changes are bound to happen. Flexibility will be the key to speeding up the recovery process. Landlords will have to be more receptive to the demands of tenants and offer flexible options, in terms of space as well as value. Learnings from the pandemic will also be incorporated in office design along with an increased focus on sustainability and employee wellness. Resultantly, tenant expectations for quality spaces is expected to increase which will lead to a trajectory of graded office space developments  JLL Research   Rents are expected to remain stable in the short to medium term||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/the-2020-office-market-report/article33477341.ece

Within F&B, fast-food players and coffee shops would continue to expand cautiously, with rationalised spaces and a robust home -delivery model. Touchless tech would also be a key trend in this space as retailers increasingly digitise merchandising and transacting mechanisms. The role of brick-and-mortar stores would evolve from just being a point of sale, rather they would be expected to also serve as platforms to engage consumers and amplify brands. This might require a thorough re-evaluation of the location, design and operation model of retail properties. Within retail stores, we also foresee a change in space densities of fitting rooms, product testing zones, pick-up counters and stockrooms. This changing nature of the retail store is likely to spur retailers to diversify their store formats and networks. A higher number of stores with unique features and product mix — all of which would continue to operate under a cohesive brand culture — is expected. Logistics India’s Industrial & Logistics (I&L) RE sector has witnessed a transformation after 2017 in terms of the quality of assets, mode of operations and type of investments. Despite the pandemic affecting leasing activity, it has shown remarkable resilience during the last few months. In 2020, 3PL (third-party logistics) firms and e-commerce operators accounted for more than half of the leasing activity, followed by engineering and manufacturing firms. Hyperlocal delivery gained steam during the pandemic as e-commerce players began sourcing their deliveries from neighbourhood stores to meet customer demand. The quarterly growth in warehousing space take was up by 105% from Q2 2020 – Q3 2020, with increase in absorption of space from 2.2 million sq. ft. in Q2 2020 to 4.5 million sq. ft in Q3 2020. The coming year is likely to see a continuation of this trend as demographic groups that previously displayed resistance towards online shopping. These groups are now showing an acceptance of the format as they’ve realised its convenience. As a result, maintaining higher stock levels is likely to become a norm which, in the future, is expected to generate higher I&L demand from e-commerce players and in turn, 3PL firms. Another outcome of the pandemic on the Indian I&L sector has been the diversification of the supply chain, given the disruption caused by the pandemic in both supply and demand. As a result, occupiers are now adopting a modern, networked supply chain ecosystem that lays equal emphasis on resilience, near-shoring capability, sustainability and agility, thereby ensuring timely and transparent data flow among stakeholders. This digitisation is also moving towards warehousing facilities where, going forward, the use of AI, IoT and Big Data would result in the creation of smarter warehouses that would significantly improve supply chain efficiencies. Residential sector Similar to all RE sectors, the COVID-19 outbreak affected the residential sector as well, with both sales and new launches slowing down as caution pervaded the market. However, green shoots of recovery have now been witnessed as housing sales in Q3 2020 increased by a strong 86% on a quarterly basis. Apartment units covered in the top seven cities were in the 12,000 unit range in Q2 2020, however it grew to 22,000 units in Q3 2020. This was largely due to strong policy support, low mortgage rates, reduction in stamp duty and property registration fee (in a few states) along with incentives and attractive payment schemes offered by the developer community. Furthermore, last-mile funding mechanisms provided by the government for delayed housing projects have helped boost stakeholder sentiments. This has created an enabling environment which has strengthened the confidence levels of end-users and fence-sitters. Going forward, we expect a gradual improvement in sales across all segments, although mid-income (Rs. 45 lakh-Rs. 1 crore) and budget (less than Rs. 45 lakh) categories are expected to be the key focus areas among home buyers and are expected to perform relatively better. The two segments together accounted for a share of more than 80% in overall housing sales in 2020 and are expected to dominate residential sales going forward in 2021 as well. In addition, projects launched in locations with developed physical and social infrastructure are expected to see greater traction in the coming year. Although the demand for ready-to-move-in projects is expected to be stronger, GST rate cuts for residential properties have bridged the taxation gap between an under-construction and completed project, thereby whetting the appetite for under-construction projects. We expect similar policy measures to continue to bolster housing demand and recovery of the residential real estate sector in the coming year. Heightened activity is, therefore, expected in leading cities such as Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune and Delhi-NCR (select parts of Gurgaon and Noida). Alternate segments The year 2020 has witnessed an amplified interest in alternative asset classes such as flexible workspaces, data centres and cold storage units. We expect this interest to continue into 2021 as well:   Flexible Workspaces:  They have been gaining traction in India and the coming years are likely to witness occupiers adopting a service-oriented role, leading to the growth of space-as-a-service model. Providing customised end-user experience is also likely to gain more ground, especially in the wake of COVID-19. This could give a fillip to managed workspace providers.   Data Centres (DC):  The rise in usage of smart devices, coupled with increasing amounts of data consumption post COVID-19, has led to a surge in data storage and processing requirements in India, which has further widened the role of DCs. We believe that occupier demand for data storage is likely to increase in the coming quarters, with the country’s DC capacity expected to cross 600 MW during 2020-21. Supply addition in the coming years is expected to be dominated by the cities of Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Delhi-NCR.   Cold Storage (CS):  Following the COVID-19 outbreak, the demand for CS facilities is now being further fuelled by a huge omni-channel distribution of Food & Grocery (F&G) across tier I and II cities in the country. Currently, the overall cold storage (CS) capacity in India stands at about 37-39 million tonnes. CBRE expects the overall CS real estate stock to rise to 1,400 -1,500 million sq. ft. and the overall CS capacity is expected to reach 70 - 75 million tonnes by 2023. 2021 outlook In these extraordinary times, RE stakeholders across sectors have an opportunity to structurally re-imagine their strategies to ensure sustained recovery. Doing so would require shifting from traditional approaches and embracing new, transformational methods — which would be accelerated by widespread tech adoption, sustained policy impetus and accelerated investor interest across RE in India. We believe that with stakeholders becoming increasingly interconnected and dependent upon one another, they would need to jointly develop their RE strategies going forward. In the long term, most businesses would have to re-look at their space design from a technological and social distancing perspective to streamline sanitisation methods being deployed currently. Another potential shift in long-term occupier strategy would include a stronger preference for buildings with wellness and sustainability features. Overall, we expect demand for real estate to remain robust and the sector to emerge resilient in the future.

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||2 0 2 1 things to do||Year after year, I make those resolutions to eat less and exercise more, and remain fanatically disciplined. Until 10 am on January 1, when the last of the Christmas cake yells out to me, “Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou?” And though my name isn’t, and never was Romeo, who am I to deny the beseeching tones of true love? This year I am pinning more prosaic, achievable targets. I will learn how to use the many magical features that my phone claims to have. I mean, they sold me the latest configuration of bits, bytes and magic carpet. And a battery that dies every 11 months, when the new configuration hits the market. I will use my apps and features to find the lost library of the Moscow Czars, auto-clip my toenails, toilet-train the pigeons on my windowsill. I will clean my cupboards, files and friends list, and lighten my life. I will discard anything that weighs me down (especially the weighing scale itself). I will unfriend people who send me motivational quotes to live an active life when I’m cuddled up with Korean dramas and chips. I will set rule-conforming passwords with upper-lower-italics, prime numbers, special characters, and change them every three months, and remember them later — and not fight with the chatbot when I don’t. I will reskill and help the needy. I will offer an online course on my A-star talent — elbow butting. How to direct your elbow into paunches, spectacles or chins. How to say “Hello darling” or “I hope your teeth rot” through your elbow. Because, anyway no one knows what you’re saying through your mask. I will grow a terrace garden, calf muscles and more sophisticated taste like that lady who matches her nail polish with her handbag. I will wear masks that match my underwear. I will never wear orange socks even just to irritate my teen. I will detox. I will buy multiple scented candles to scare away the virus and purify the energy, though the last time everyone coughed out their intestines. Oh yes, I will detox my intestines too — by eating raw cabbage every morning — ensuring the need for those scented candles later. I will gain inner peace. Through doorbells, whistling cookers, construction chaos, neighbours learning to sing, hallucinatory deadlines by annoying colleagues, dying batteries, starving family… I will drown everything out and bury myself in Korean dramas and chips.

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Alibaug, the new Antibes||I am no oracle, but the promise of a new year typically fills me with hope. Apparently, Bill Gates feels the same way; he told a U.S. tech news site that, despite all that transpired this past year, he’s “upbeat,” because societies are making progress overall. To be honest, I wasn’t all that sanguine about 2021 a few days ago. As I sat in blissful Alibaug, outside Mumbai, thankful for a getaway, I did have some foreboding, what with a new virus strain emerging and renewed travel restrictions. That is, till I chanced upon a local pottery exhibition at Mati Moksh Ceramics, close to where we were staying. At the show, I chanced upon a group of 60-something women sitting under the shade of a tree. They were chatting and laughing, all clearly old friends and long-time Alibaug-ers. As we struck up a conversation, one of them, Rina Singh, introduced herself as a dowser. “What’s that?” I asked. Apparently, it is someone who identifies the Earth’s negative energy and tries to heal it. Singh told me that the world’s “geopathic stress,” that is, its energy, is shifting for the better. I had heard of water diviners but not this. Looking at these friendly women, who were in the somewhat high-risk COVID-19 category, but were enjoying each other’s company as they sipped wine, made me shake off my ambiguity about the future. If these women were so joyful, why shouldn’t I be? At a time when an injection is the most coveted thing on the planet, are better days ahead? In a few months, will we once again dream of planning vacations, without worrying about countries sealing borders? Will we see family we haven’t seen in a while? Will we feel safe standing next to the mask-less? It would certainly seem so, with hordes of Indians travelling to Dubai, Maldives, Goa, and other local scenic destinations. Take Alibaug, which is booming. The Roll-On Roll-Off car ferry (RORO), initially introduced in March 2020, but closed due to the lockdown till September, has become wildly popular. In the last week of December, it was completely packed. I keep reminding myself that even though 2020 was ghastly, there were some positive developments, like this. Vacay homes and fine wine Despite the pandemic and economic distress, it is interesting to see how buoyant certain sectors of the luxury market were. Luxury homes sales  in Mumbai, for instance, were stronger than expected, according to Anarock Property Consultants. Homes in Alibaug — to rent and to buy — are in huge demand. It is the same story in Goa. As people spent so much time at home and experienced a more inward-looking life, those with means spent on both art and decorative items. Auction houses like Christie’s, Sotheby’s, Philips and Bonham’s, which had to suspend live auctions during the pandemic, did well both digitally as well as in private sales. Bonham’s, for example, saw a 40% rise in buyers for its online offerings, including many under 40. Christie’s reported that 30% of its  jewellery buyers were first-time purchasers. In December, a 21.86 carat emerald ring with diamonds sold for $3.7 million (against a pre-sale estimate of $1 million) at Sotheby’s Magnificent Jewels sale. The entire auction brought in $46.9 million, the highest total for a Sotheby’s New York auction since 2017. Indian auction houses also reported solid sales and local galleries noted how tech enabled them to interact with many prospective clients. Hybrid-electric cars and boutique hotels As for cars, companies like Maserati, Ferrari, Aston Martin and Rolls Royce introduced pricey new models, some of which are hybrid-electric. Clearly, there are enough takers for vehicles costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. Commercial air travel took a big beating, but private aviation looked rosy. According to an article in Forbes a few months ago, Jetcraft, the largest buyer and seller of business jets worldwide, saw an uptick in sales. Chad Anderson, president, told the magazine that “Covid-19 was a catalyst… I have customers saying they’ll never fly on a commercial airliner again, to protect the health of themselves, their families, and their employees.” Those who can afford to, will spend to make life more comfortable. The hotel  industry is betting on it. Last month saw the opening of a fancy Anantara in the Seychelles and this year will see new luxe properties across Africa, Europe, and Asia. Closer to home, my friend Siddharth Kasliwal just opened the Johri, a gem of a boutique hotel, converted from an old family home, in the heart of Jaipur. Taking fashion slow And what of fashion? Will it go back to the way it was? Today’s consumer is more aware about the impact of their buying behaviour than in years past. Movements like #govocalforlocal and #slowfashion will continue, with people gravitating towards niche, homegrown brands. But there will always be a market for high-end luxury. Even as we throw on kaftans and sweatpants, people will find an excuse to wear figure-flattering clothing. Once the pandemic is truly over, I know many who will want to dress up and go all out. After all, these are the same people who shopped their closet and put on their pretty frocks while stuck at home, just for a mood lift. So be ready for more Halpern-meets-Peacock style blinge-y party wear and body-con dresses. Given the focus on exercise and wellness, how else to show off our newly toned silhouettes? Everyone I know took to working out digitally online with their trainers or via apps and Zoom group classes. And companies like Physique57 Mumbai, an offshoot of New York-based Physique57, which uses ballet barre exercises to tone, dropped their rates for virtual classes and attracted new customers from around the country. Of course, the digital world is not an all-encompassing panacea to our woes. Restaurants and retail definitely need an in-person shot in the arm. As for socialising, given that people continued to do so despite the hazards of COVID-19, I am sure it will be back with a vengeance.  Gayatri Rangachari Shah will be back withFlight of Fancy, on the antics of the one percenters who defied logic to grow in wealth during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/alibaug-the-new-antibes/article33476960.ece
02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Back to the theatre||Streamers saved our entertainment souls in 2020, but for 2021, let us imagine a theatrical future, going forward a few months. It is March 2021. Spring is in the air, vaccines are rolling out in the millions, and we are stampeding towards cinemas to watch The King’s Man , the prequel to the Kingsman franchise. That enjoyed, we set our calendars to April 2, Easter, the day when, after multiple postponements, the James Bond film No Time To Die hits cinemas, a full year after its scheduled release date. From the 2020 holdovers, another film I’m looking forward to is Kenneth Branagh’s Death on the Nile , but that is not due until September. While there are several world cinema and arthouse films in the release pipeline, you’ll pardon me if I’m hankering after big screen experiences after a year where the only time I braved the cinema was for Tenet . Thankfully, there are plenty of big-ticket releases coming up. In April, nearly four years after Baby Driver , Edgar Wright returns with Last Night in Soho , a horror-thriller set in swinging 60s London, featuring Anya Taylor-Joy fresh off her The Queen’s Gambit triumph. The Marvel Cinematic Universe will resume in May with Black Widow . I’ll let that play out and wait a couple of weeks instead for Godzilla vs. Kong . Speaking of guilty pleasures, and skipping forward to July, Tom Cruise in and as Top Gun: Maverick promises to be a breathtaking big screen experience. And, while on the star, let’s hope that Mission Impossible 7 transcends Cruise’s on-set rant during the film’s shoot in 2020. If you ask me to choose just one film for 2021, that would be Peter Jackson’s The Beatles: Get Back , where he works from 56 hours of hitherto unseen footage to craft a documentary about the Fab Four. The few minutes of preview footage he released in December promise a joyous, irreverent experience. The film is due in August. October will see the release of Dune , another Hollywood adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel after David Lynch’s 1984 attempt. This time, the novel is in the capable hands of Denis Villeneuve ( Blade Runner 2049 ), so forgive me if my expectations are unreasonably high. November is due to bring Baz Luhrmann’s untitled Elvis Presley project — yes, the same one on which Tom Hanks became one of the first high-profile people who contracted the virus. The riches of December include The Matrix 4 and Steven Spielberg’s interpretation of West Side Story . Elsewhere, there is Robin Wright’s feature directorial début Land , where she also plays a woman starting a new life in the great outdoors. Another actress making her directorial début is Maggie Gyllenhaal with The Lost Daughter , featuring Olivia Colman, Jessie Buckley, Dakota Johnson, Peter Sarsgaard and Paul Mescal, where a woman’s beach vacation goes awry. The luminous Rebecca Hall is also making her directorial début with an adaptation of Nella Larsen’s novel Passing , about how the lives of two childhood friends are altered forever when they reunite. And finally, actress Olivia Wilde made a tremendous directorial début with Booksmart , and she’ll be back with the psychological thriller, Don’t Worry Darling .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/back-to-the-theatre/article33476950.ece

02 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Take all precautions as COVID-19 still persists’||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday asked people to take precautions and stay safe until the arrival of COVID-19 vaccine in India. “This year may have come to an end but COVID-19 still persists. We must take all precautions and follow the guidelines to keep ourselves safe. We hope that the vaccine comes to India soon. Until then, please take care of yourselves and your family,” Mr. Kejriwal said. He extended New Year greetings to all wishing happiness, health and prosperity. He took the opportunity to laud COVID-19 warriors, doctors, nurses, medical staff, policemen, sanitation workers, and socio-religious institutions for their service towards the people during the pandemic and said Delhi’s strong healthcare system has set countless examples before the world. He said: “The whole world had to fight COVID-19 — the biggest pandemic faced by humankind. I take this chance to salute and honour our COVID-19 warriors who continued to serve the public even in such a difficult time,” he said. “Delhi has shown that it is on par with other developed countries.

02 January 2021||Guwahati,||Assam Cong. plans ‘one family, one job’ scheme||Shrugging off the loss of two MLAs to the ruling BJP, the Congress party in Assam has outlined a slew of policies, included a “one family, one job” scheme and free electricity up to 120 units, ahead of Assembly elections due early this year. State Congress president Ripun Bora on Friday admitted that the party had received a temporary setback after Golaghat (eastern Assam) MLA Ajanta Neog and Lakhipur (southern Assam) MLA Rajdeep Goala joined the BJP in December 2020. While Ms Neog, a former minister, defied the “BJP wave” to retain her seat for the Congress in 2016, Mr Goala belongs to the “tea tribes”, considered a “vote-swinging” community in at least 40 Assembly constituencies. “We have identified parallel leaders in the constituencies vacated by our MLAs and are focussing on empowering dedicated party workers. Accordingly, we have undertaken booth-level meetings in each Assembly constituency to strengthen the party from the grassroots,” Mr. Bora told journalists at the State Congress headquarters in Guwahati. The party, he said, has been concentrating on feasible beneficiary policies that could help it return to power after the State polls. “We have decided to provide a job per family if we form the government, implement Rahul Gandhi’s idea of NYAY (minimum income scheme) by providing every BPL family Rs. 7,500 per month and making electricity free up to 120 units,” Mr Bora said. “We will also waive the loans of farmers, specifically the loans taken by women from microfinance institutions,” he added. Microfinance institutions in Assam charge a high rate of interest — up to 24% per annum — and allegedly force poor borrowers to pledge or pawn their assets as security. Recovery of dues through coercive action has reportedly made a few farmers end their lives over the years.  Bill passed The Assam Assembly on December 30 passed the Assam Micro Finance Institutions (Regulation of Money Lending) Bill, 2020, which aims to “protect and relieve the economically vulnerable groups and individuals from the undue hardship of usurious interest rates and coercive means of recovery” by microfinance companies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/assam-cong-plans-one-family-one-job-scheme/article33476969.ece
02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||The engendered endangered||Just like #UnderwearMondays, last year had brought much change — some of it good and nice to smell. But while so much stands redefined, we still have much ground to cover. So as we set about throwing out the dirty bathwater, why not go all the way and… wait, I think I have mixed up my idioms. Maybe this is the thought-equivalent of autocorrect, or having another person’s Freudian slip. Moving on then. It is high time, I feel, that we did away with gender — not anatomically, of course, because every body has specific needs and doctors are best equipped to comment on that. What I am talking about is the quotidian quandary about using pronouns or places that should by default be understood as not being gender-specific. Here are some suggestions:  Toilets: Let’s do away with gender-based toilets. Let’s just learn to clean up after ourselves. Cis-gender men, I am looking at you.     Heels: Either abolish heels on grounds of cruelty or else make it okay for men (outside of Prince) to wear them. Once men start wearing heels, they will tech the hell out of it, all for sake of comfort — retractable heels is one such idea in the wings.     Pink: Blue is not a colour for men, it is one of a classist social structure — lighter shades for the working class and the royal ones for, well, royalty. Pink is the colour of democracy. Or it should be. It starts with brands stopping using pink for their women’s collections (sneakers to clothes). Either add more colours or make pink for men too.     Perfumes: Banish the guy in history who said peonies and jasmines are for ladies while ogreish men should only reek of tree barks. If florals were good enough for Napoleon, I’ll be the bigger man (literally) and graciously accept them too. 2021 is no time for aromas to pick genders.     Clothing: If women can wear skirts why can’t men (outside of Scots)? Why does it only have to be a lungi or a mundu ? Can’t men like pleats? As long as a common denominator of decency is respected, clothing should be a form of self-expression and not conformity.     Abuses: I would love to campaign for gender-neutral abuses, but I feel they just won’t feel as cathartic rolling off the tongue. So let’s keep the wordage and agree to reinterpret the meaning, one that is free for gender. Sure it makes the world a less civil place but we’d have a lot fewer basket cases if we could express freely more often. By now everyone knows who the new American president is, but do we know what’s happening in Bihar or who our local district magistrate is, for that matter? Change, as the adage goes, starts small. So don’t worry about affairs 9,000 miles away; instead focus on revisiting and breaking ground with rooted gender-ideas that we have held on to firmly for so long.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/the-engendered-endangered/article33476946.ece

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||Oleander for your ear||Spending much of 2020 at home meant we began paying extra attention to product design, from the kitchen sink to that chaise longue. Diwiks, a five-year-old luxury speaker brand with ‘Remade in India’ as its tagline, is one example where the product doesn’t stop with checking only the art and design boxes. Diwik Singh Chhalani, 37, says his handcrafted speakers, 75 so far, have seen customers pleasantly surprised by their superior sound as well. The speakers have been sought after by designers, industrialists and art collectors, with the most recent consignment going out from the studio in Bikaner to each of the five family members of a well-known Mumbai businessman. With only 12 made in 2020 as part of the Art Deco Meets 2020 collection, Raw Mango’s Sanjay Garg is another client patiently waiting for his Diwiks speaker. “There is a void in terms of design in this country. We live in the world of craft, yet it is still a rare marriage between design and craft,” the designer explains. Chhalani, a former advertising professional, says sound was never going to be an afterthought for these speakers. “Our sound system and components are exclusively designed for us. It is a proper stereo set-up where you can enjoy pristine two channel sound. Our kevlar cone woofers and silk dome tweeters are powered by a highly efficient class-D amplifier and a toroidal transformer,” he elaborates. The Art Deco Meets 2020 line was inspired by a haveli that stood opposite his childhood home in Bikaner but was razed this year. Built in the art deco style, Kasturi Nivas was the erstwhile home of Rai Bahadur, a companion of maharaja Ganga Singh of Bikaner, and Chhalani used the reclaimed wood from its doors and windows to create his speakers. With a surge in demand during the pandemic, he began paying more attention to details like the inlay work on the Burma teak speakers. “I had this idea of using oleander wood from my garden, which I had planted myself in 2016. It is a craft traditionally seen in Rajasthan’s havelis , and my artisans are well versed with it,” he says. Embarrassed about using the much-abused term ‘sustainable’, he recalls how he began by restoring old radios but did not want to buy new wood. “I am not going to use materials that are not environment-friendly. I would rather take wood that is salvaged and good for another 100 years. There is the motivation to make something that outlives us,” he continues. With Rs. 1.5 lakh as the average pricing, this device will see a rising demand this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/oleander-for-your-ear/article33477158.ece
02 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||3 sites in Delhi selected for vaccine dry run||Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital in Shahdara, Urban Primary Health Centre in Daryaganj and Venkateshwar Hospital in Dwarka are the three sites selected for the dry run on Saturday to gear up for the roll out of COVID-19 vaccine in the Capital. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan spoke to health department officials of Delhi, including Amit Singla, Secretary (Health), District Magistrates and District Immunisation Officers of Shahdara, Central and South-West districts of Delhi here on Friday to review preparedness at session sites. During the online interaction, the Delhi government officials noted that designated team has been adequately trained for the dry run and all aspect for the trial run is being monitored. “The idea is to quickly identify any gaps and report them back,” said Mr. Singla. Preparations in place He also apprised the Minister of the preparations done for the dry run, including setting up of session site, process of updating and collation of data, uploading it on CoWIN, training of the vaccinators, preparedness for any adverse event following immunisation (AEFI), cold chain management, security of session sites and vaccine storage sites etc. The Health Minister also updated the officials on the status of the two leading vaccine candidates whose data are being closely monitored by the Subject Expert Committee of DCGI and appreciated the efforts of frontline workers and expressed his condolence for the corona warriors who sacrificed their lives in an attempt to save others. At the same time, 585 new COVID-19 cases were recorded in the Capital on Friday with 21 deaths and 717 recoveries. A total of 80,565 tests were conducted with a positivity rate of 0.73%, according to a heath bulletin released by the Delhi government.

This is the third expansion of the State Cabinet after Mr. Chouhan took over as the Chief Minister for the fourth term in March 2020. The Cabinet expansion is expected to take place around 12.30 p.m. on Sunday, the official said. After that, the newly-appointed Chief Justice of Madhya Pradesh High Court, Justice Mohammad Rafiq, will take oath around 3 p.m., he added. The talks of the Cabinet expansion started gaining ground soon after the results of the bypolls to 28 Assembly seats held on November 3. While the BJP had won 19 of those seats, the opposition Congress had bagged nine. This increased the BJP’s strength in the 230-member House to 126, while the Congress’s tally became 96. Out of the 19 winners of the ruling BJP, 15 were those who had quit the Congress following a similar move by senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, who later joined the saffron party.

A Vacation Bench of Justice Vibhu Bakhru noted that in several cases, the court has held that unconscious possession would not attract the rigours of the Arms Act. Adhiraj Singh Yadav had moved the court, seeking to quash the FIR registered in April last after the live cartridges were recovered from his hand baggage. Mr. Yadav said he is an engineering student and had appeared for Air Force Common Admission Test. Mr. Yadav said he was scheduled to travel to Ahmedabad for appearing in the interview and had borrowed the hand baggage from the wife of his landlord, who is a Colonel. He said he was not aware that there was any live ammunition kept in the sleeves of the said bag. The live ammunition belongs to the Colonel, who also holds a valid Arms licence. Mr. Yadav said he was in a hurry when he packed the luggage. Taking note of the submission, the court said, “it is well settled that an offence under Section 25 of the Arms Act would not be made out in cases where the suspect was not conscious that he was in possession of live ammunition”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/court-quashes-fir-against-student-apprehended-at-airport-with-live-cartridges/article33476973.ece

02 January 2021||January 02 2021 00:00 IST,||8 weeks to better sleep||Last year, we lost sleep: working at odd hours, worrying about the future, about falling ill, about financial security. The time we saved on the commute or evenings out didn’t always translate into better work-personal life balance. Instead, confinement and anxiety turned many of us into night owls. Insomnia is never good news. While it is a nascent subject, sleep research tells us that without the right amount of zzzs (different for each of us) our reaction time slows down, our attention becomes short and scattered, and we risk the increase of serious health problems such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dementia and Alzheimer’s. It is not just social distancing that’s becoming the new norm, it is tiredness from lack of sleep, too. Even as studies look into sleep as the latest casualty of the pandemic — a recent review of Covid-19 sleep research by Northumbria University, of over 50,000 people from 13 countries, indicated that around 40% have experienced sleep problems — research is exploring if melatonin, the hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, could play a role in the fight against Covid-19 (preliminary research was published inPLOS Biology, the peer-reviewed scientific journal). The bottom line, sleep is key. So this year, why not pay attention to the night rather than the day? Not only will it help you get up on the right side of the bed, but there are also added benefits such as better cognition and memory consolidation. Dr Abhinav Singh, Medical Director of the Indiana Sleep Center in the US, who has practised sleep medicine for 15 years, helps us through a two month, step-by-step guide to better sleep.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/8-weeks-to-better-sleep/article33477155.ece
