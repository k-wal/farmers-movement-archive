19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Covaxin not to be used in cases of allergy, fever, poor immunity||Those with a history of allergies, fever and bleeding disorder, people on blood thinners and those with compromised immunity or on medication that affects the immune system have been told by Bharat Biotech, manufacturer of Covaxin, not to take the COVID-19 vaccine. A statement uploaded on the company website on Monday said the vaccine was also contraindicated for pregnant and lactating women, those using other COVID-19 vaccines and people with any other serious health-related issues as determined by the vaccinator or the officer supervising the vaccination. The statement comes amid reports of a slow uptake of the first phase of COVID-19 vaccination that began on January 16. “There is remote chance that Covaxin could cause severe allergic reaction including difficulty in breathing, swelling of face/throat/fast heart beat, rash all over the body and dizziness and weakness,” it said. Bharat Biotech has now released a fact sheet detailing the possible adverse events.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/covaxin-not-to-be-used-in-cases-of-allergy-fever-poor-immunity/article33604922.ece
19 January 2021||MANGALURU,||Soil testing labs on wheels for entire State||Agriculture Minister B.C. Patil said on Monday that his department has planned to provide soil testing laboratories on wheels to all Raita Samparka Kendras in the State. Speaking after releasing to the market “Kaarla Kaje” brand of boiled rice marketed by Parampara Multipurpose Cooperative Society Ltd. at Karkala, Udupi district, the Minister said that 20 such mobile laboratories named “Krishi Sanjeevini” have been given to as many kendras in Koppal district now on a trial basis. If the “laboratory to land” concept is to be implemented covering all kendras in the State, 519 more vehicles will have to be purchased. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has, in principle, agreed to sanction funds to purchase the vehicles. The Finance Department will have to approve of the proposal. He said that the mobile laboratory has a common toll free number, which is 155313, for the State. Farmers will have to call this number to get services on their doorsteps. Each vehicle has an agriculture graduate to guide farmers with the kind of nutrients their plots need to use for the type of soil they have. The farm graduate will also guide farmers on the treatment required for standing crops in case of disease. The Minister said that the State government has also written to the Union government to sanction one stationary permanent soil testing laboratory in each gram panchayat. Mr. Patil said that the department has also introduced “Swabhimani Raitha” cards for farmers, and 1.5 lakh cards have been distributed in Koppal district. This will be extended to the rest of the State to cover 70 lakh farmers. The card will have all details of the farmers, including their RTC and bank details. It is to do away with the need for them to carry multiple identification documents while going to banks for transactions. The Minister said that his department has been imparting training to farmers through the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) in Mysuru in food processing and marketing since the last month. It has been planned to provide training to 500 farmers by this March. Each batch of 50 farmers are being trained for six days. They are trained in food processing for four days and marketing in two days. He also launched the marketing of seeds of Karkala “Bili bende” (lady’s finger) on the occasion. Karkala MLA V. Sunil Kumar was present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/soil-testing-labs-on-wheels-for-entire-state/article33605593.ece
19 January 2021||Belagavi,||Rallies taken out against Uddhav’s tweets||Kannada organisations took out rallies to protest against Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray for his controversial tweets about border areas such as Belagavi. In his tweet on Sunday, the neighbouring State Chief Minister had described Belagavi and other areas as “Karnataka occupied areas”. He vowed to take steps to merge them with Maharashtra. This evoked angry responses from organisations and leaders in Karnataka. In Belagavi, members of the Karnataka Rakshana Vedike and Sangolli Rayanna Yuva Sangha took out a protest rally to the Rani Channamma Circle. They shouted slogans against Mr. Thackeray and urged the President to dismiss his government in Maharashtra. The protestors beat his photos with slippers and tore them up. Ashok Chandaragi, convenor of the action committee of Kannada organisations, however, said that he was more angry about leaders in Karnataka than Mr Thackeray. “He is doing it due to compulsions of his local politics. But what are our leaders doing,” he asked. “Maharashtra has two Cabinet Ministers tasked with the management and coordination of various agencies regarding the border dispute with Karnataka. Karnataka has none. H.K. Patil served as Minister for border affairs in Siddaramaiah’s Cabinet three years ago. We have urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to appoint a Minister from outside Belagavi district to manage the border dispute and coordinate with various agencies. But that has not happened,” he said. “The two agencies handling the dispute — Karnataka State Border Protection Commission and Karnataka State Border Protection Authority — are housed in Bengaluru. Our requests to the government to shift them to Belagavi have not been heard. Our appeal to appoint persons from North Karnataka to these authorities have failed,” he added. He urged the State government to file contempt cases against the Maharashtra Chief Minister and other leaders who speak about the border issue, when it was still pending in the Supreme Court. Ramesh Jarkiholi, district in-charge Minister, Shashikala Jolle, Minister, and Iranna Kadadi, Rajya Sabha member, have condemned the statements of the Maharashtra Chief Minister. Satish Jarkiholi, Congress leader, said that there was no need to consider his [Mr. Thackeray’s] statements seriously.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rallies-taken-out-against-uddhavs-tweets/article33605065.ece

19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Only police should decide on tractor rally, says SC||The Supreme Court on Monday said the Union government and the Delhi Police should take a call on whether or not protesting farmers could hold tractor or vehicle marches on Republic Day in the national capital. The government could not ask the court to decide on issues concerning law and order, it said. “Entry into Delhi is a law and order issue. Who should be allowed entry and on what conditions are all determined by the police. We cannot be the authority to decide it,” Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde told Attorney-General K.K. Venugopal and Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta. The CJI said there was still time for the Union of India and the Delhi Police to “invoke all its powers”. The government wanted the court to pass an injunction order to restrain farmers from holding rallies to “disrupt” the Republic Day celebrations in Delhi. The government said the right to express dissent against the farm laws did not include a right to “malign the nation globally”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/only-police-should-decide-on-tractor-rally-says-sc/article33604924.ece
19 January 2021||CHENNAI,||Western T.N. no longer AIADMK citadel, says Stalin||Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) president and Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Assembly M.K. Stalin on Monday rejected the notion that the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) was strong in the western region of the State and that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s hailing from the region would be a challenge to the DMK in the Assembly election. “The argument that the AIADMK is strong in the western region was demolished in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. It lost every seat by a margin of lakhs of votes there,” the DMK leader said in an interview with The Hindu . Countering the perception that the State government had done a decent job of combating COVID-19, Mr. Stalin said the Chief Minister had erred by delaying the imposition of lockdown. He believed that there was a “tsunami-like wave” under way against the nearly 10-year-old AIADMK government. The DMK leader felt that the people’s anger against the government would reflect in the Assembly elections by way of support to his party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/western-tn-no-longer-aiadmk-citadel-says-stalin/article33604966.ece
19 January 2021||Mumbai,||Sushant case: media trial impacts probe, says HC||The Bombay High Court on Monday held that a media trial interferes with administration of justice and could lead to obstructing investigation and administration of justice. The court, referring to the print and electronic coverage following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, said this amounts to criminal contempt. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni directed the media to exercise restraint from printing/displaying any news item and/or initiating any discussion/debate/interview of the nature, in relation to death by suicide, depicting the deceased as one having a weak character or intruding in any manner on the privacy of the deceased. Commenting on the news coverage by Republic TV and Times Now, the court remarked, “telecast of reports/ discussions /debates/interviews by these TV channels on the death of the actor and events subsequent thereto, is, prima facie, contemptuous having ingredients of criminal contempt.” The court was hearing a bunch of Public Interest Litigations seeking direction from the court to authorities to issue guidelines to be followed by all media houses to refrain from publishing any comments which may jeopardize the reputation of the police and may hinder the case. The Bench directed the media to refrain from any news item that causes prejudice to an ongoing inquiry/investigation. “Referring to the character of the accused/victim and creating an atmosphere of prejudice for both; Holding interviews with the victim, the witnesses and/or any of their family members and displaying it on screen; Analyzing versions of witnesses, whose evidence could be vital at the stage of trial; Publishing a confession allegedly made to a police officer by an accused and trying to make the public believe that the same is a piece of evidence which is admissible before a Court and there is no reason for the Court not to act upon it, without letting the public know the nitty-gritty of the Evidence Act,” the 251-page judgment said. One of the PILs has been filed by former Maharashtra DGPs M.N. Singh, P.S. Pasricha, D.K. Sivanandan, Sanjiv Dayal, Satish Mathur and K. Subramanyam, former Mumbai Police Commissioner Dhananjay Jadhav, and former additional DGP Krishipal Raghuvanshi. Another PIL has been filed by film-maker Nilesh Navlakha; editor of a regional newspaper Mahibub D. Shaikh and retired civil servant Subhash Chander. The Bench further directed the media to not “Print photographs of an accused and thereby facilitating his identification; Criticize the investigative agency based on half-baked information without proper research... Recreate/reconstruct a crime scene and depicting how the accused committed the crime; Predict the proposed/future course of action including steps that ought to be taken...” The court stated, “We have issued guidelines for print and electronic media regarding reporting of cases of death and suicide and made the guidelines by Press Council of India applicable to electronic media”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sushant-case-media-trial-impacts-probe-says-hc/article33605619.ece
19 January 2021||Kolkata,||Stones hurled at BJP’s roadshow in Kolkata||The City of Joy witnessed some violence during a roadshow by the Bharatiya Janata Party on Monday with Trinamool Congress workers reportedly throwing stones and shouting slogans. Videos aired by local television channels and shared by other BJP leaders on social media showed a few youths with flags of Trinamool Congress throwing stones at the rally. The road show was organised from Tollygunje Tram depot to Rashbehari in southern parts of city. Several senior party leaders like State unit BJP president Dilip Ghosh, Suvendu Adhikari, Debashree Chowdhury, and Bharati Ghosh were among those who participated.. Supporters of the BJP chased those who raised slogans and pelted stones. The BJP supporters vandalised several vehicles and also beat up some people. There was a flare up at three places along the route including at Deshapran Sashmal Road. Even before the rally began there was some tension with Trinamool supporters showing black flags and raising slogans “Go back Mir Zafar” directed at Suvendu Adhikari. Speaking after the road show Mr. Adhikari said that he was happy that BJP youth wing supporters went after those pelted stones. The former TMC heavyweight leader who joined the BJP last month said that TMC cannot forget old ways of attacking political opponents. Mr. Ghosh accused a particular community of orchestrating the attack. “It is not that our supporters do not have hands,” Mr. Ghosh said and warned the ruling party that attacks will be met with retaliation. State’s Minister and Trinamool Congress leader Aroop Biswas rushed to the spot and said that TMC supporters were putting posters and flags and were attacked by BJP workers without any provocation.

19 January 2021||New Delhi,||Fewer health workers turn up for vaccine||Delhi witnessed a dip of 16.7% in the number of healthcare workers turning up for the COVID-19 vaccination on Monday as compared to Saturday, the first day of the drive, when 4,319 beneficiaries were administered the vaccine shot. A total of 3,598 workers were inoculated against a target of 8,136 on the second day of the drive, according to the data compiled from the 11 districts in the Capital. There are 81 centres in Delhi and the target is about 100 people per centre. Several officials and hospital authorities said the numbers are less as many healthcare workers want to wait and watch, given the number of COVID-19 cases has dropped considerably. “Since Covaxin is being used, people are apprehensive as its trials are still not complete. Also, many nurses are saying they will wait for a while and take the vaccine later. The numbers would improve if there are more assurances and counselling,” said a member of the nurses’ union of AIIMS. An official at the Lok Nayak Hospital said the workers are “apprehensive” and they are calling them over the phone. “Nothing can be done about it as it is completely voluntary,” the official said. “There were 26 AEFI (Adverse Event Following Immunisation) — 24 of them ‘minor’ and two in the ‘major’ category,” said a Delhi government spokesperson. Media not allowed Mediapersons were not allowed at many vaccination sites, including AIIMS and Lok Nayak Hospital. A guard, who was hospitalised at AIIMS after taking the vaccine on Saturday, was discharged on Sunday evening. The dip in the number of beneficiaries was seen in most hospitals. Only 20 healthcare workers came for vaccination at the Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH) on Monday, down from 45 on Saturday, said the hospital’s spokesperson. The figure was 12 at Lok Nayak Hospital, which inoculated 32 workers on Saturday. Only eight workers turned up at AIIMS, said officials. In the Central government-run Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, the number increased to 69 on Monday from 31 on Saturday. The authorities are trying to “motivate” the healthcare workers to take the vaccine. “All the HoDs (head of departments) of the hospital have been asked to motivate the staffers, tell them about the benefits of taking the vaccine," said Dr. Chhavi Gupta of RGSSH. She said the hospital is calling each beneficiary over the phone as soon as it gets the list of the 100 names for the next day from the district administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/fewer-health-workers-turn-up-for-vaccine/article33605472.ece
19 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||13,666 receive COVID vaccine||On the second day of COVID-19 vaccination drive, 82% of the targeted beneficiaries were immunised across 335 session sites in Telangana. The State Health department officials planned to vaccinate 16,750 healthcare workers from the State and Central government departments on Monday. Out of them, 13,666 were given the jab. State’s Director of Public Health G Srinivasa Rao said that 15 cases of Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) were reported on Monday. “All are stable,” he said.The vaccination drive was launched on Saturday. On the first day, 3,962 healthcare workers were vaccinated and 11 mild AEFI were reported. While 30 healthcare workers per session site were listed as beneficiaries on Saturday, the number was increased to 50 on Monday. And from Tuesday, the beneficiaries per site would be 100. A 29 year old woman who got first dose of COVID vaccine on day one of the immunisation drive was admitted at Gandhi Hospital, Hyderabad, on Monday evening after she complained of vomiting, giddiness and general weakness since Sunday. The healthcare worker, Naveena, was vaccinated at a health centre in Uppal on Saturday afternoon. “Doctors who are on special duty for this vaccine reactions (AEFI Committee) have examined her. Her temperature, pulse, BP, are normal. Oxygen saturation is 100% on room air (without oxygen). She is stable at present,” stated the hospital’s superintendent M Raja Rao. Doctors are closely monitoring her. In another case, an anganwadi worker who underwent the immunisation at Shapoornagar Government Hospital, Quthbullapur, on Monday was sent to Government Area Hospital in Malkajgiri for observation after she complained of giddiness. Officials said that her condition is stable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/13666-receive-covid-vaccine/article33605503.ece
19 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Higher MV insurance premium mooted for traffic violations||Traffic violations may soon become a costlier affair for vehicle owners with a working group of insurance regulator IRDAI recommending for introduction of a new section in motor insurance called Traffic Violation Premium. It will be in addition to Own Damage, the mandatory Third Party, additional TP and compulsory personal accident premium. This section can be attached to any motor insurance cover being purchased, chiefly, OD or TP insurance, the Working Group’s report said. The Traffic Violation Premium will be linked to a system of penalty points accumulated by the vehicle for every traffic violation. Whenever a motor insurance buyer approaches general insurers for cover, whether OD, TP or comprehensive package, he or she will be assessed for the traffic violation points and traffic violation premium that needs to be paid. The premium will be “payable by the registered owner of the vehicle, whether an individual or an entity. Effectively this means that the owner will take full responsibility for the traffic violations caused by authorised vehicle driver,” the report said. The working group, whose members were officials of Delhi Traffic Police, IRDAI, Insurance Information Bureau of India (IIB) and general insurance companies, came up with the recommendations in the backdrop of the Intelligent Traffic Management System proposed by the Centre. Among other aspects it considered international practices on linking motor insurance premium with traffic violations; the legal and regulatory framework governing motor insurance in the country; and types of traffic violations, penalties and its categorisation. The recommendations, which include initiating a pilot project in Delhi that will also involve vehicles from other parts of the country in the national capital, are aimed to serve as a deterrent for reckless motor drivers. The report is based on the fundamentals of sharing of data. The IIB will coordinate with various States Traffic Police and National Informatics Centre to capture the traffic violation data, calculate violation points of each violating vehicle and make this information available to all general insurers through IT system integration with insurers. Placing the report in public domain, IRDAI has invited inputs from the stakeholders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/higher-mv-insurance-premium-mooted-for-traffic-violations/article33605557.ece
19 January 2021||Kolkata,||Over 14,000 vaccinated on Day 2||At least 14,110 people received Covishield vaccine at the planned 207 centres in West Bengal on the second day of the vaccination programme Monday, even as 14 Adverse Event Following Immunisation’ (AEFI) cases were reported from different parts of the state,a senior health department official said. The total number of beneficiaries were around 1,597 less as compared to that on the opening day of the vaccination rollout on Saturday. This was primarily because of the fact that the CoWIN, software prepared for the purpose of vaccination, continued to malfunction like it happened on January 16,the official said. “Covid vaccination was successfully done today. All the planned 207 sessions were held and 14,110 beneficiaries were inoculated. “The performance is little less today mainly due to some communication issues as the CoWIN portal was not working smoothly,” the official said. A total of 15,707 people had received the jabs on the inaugural day of the vaccination programme in Bengal. On the launch day against the target of 21,000, a total of 15,707 people had got the shots against coronavirus. According to the sources in the health department, the target on the second day was roughly to vaccinate 20,000 citizens of whom 14,110 got the jabs. According to the official, because of the glitches, several beneficiaries did not receive any texts for inoculation and the health department officials had to “call them over phone”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/over-14000-vaccinated-on-day-2/article33605160.ece
19 January 2021||Kolkata,||India home to both species of red panda, says ZSI study||A couple of recent scientific publications by the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) have resolved the mystery on the demography and speciation in red panda (Ailurus fulgens), one of the most iconic species in terms of its importance relating to global conservation. Scientists from the ZSI have concluded that India is home to both the (sub) species — Himalayan red panda (Ailurus fulgens) and the Chinese red panda (Ailurus styani) and the Siang river in Arunachal Pradesh splits the red panda into these two phylogenetic species. The red panda was considered a monotypic species till 2020 until the scientists studied its genetic make-up with respect to the geographical distribution and described the occurrence of the two species. Genetic evidence “This study provides pragmatic genetic evidence and demonstrates the Siang river as a potential boundary of species divergence in red panda by contributing samples from Indian Himalayan Region,” Mukesh Thakur, scientist from the SZI said. Dr. Thakur is also the author of the paper “Siang River in Arunachal Pradesh splits red panda into these two phylogenetic species” published last week in the German Society of Mammalian Biology . For this study, scientists of the ZSI intensively carried out field sampling in eastern Himalayas for three years and collected over 250 faecal samples of the red panda. Dr. Thakur said the analysis carried out from such samples collected from West Bengal, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh revealed the clustering of all the samples in two major group. The clade 1 represented the Himalayan red panda which was formed by the samples originated from the north West Bengal, Sikkim and central and western Arunachal Pradesh and South Tibet, located in the west of the Siang river. Clade 2 represented the Chinese red panda with samples originated from the Dibang valley of eastern Arunachal Pradesh, India and southwest China, in the east of the Siang. Potential corridor Dr. Thakur, who is a DNA expert and also the principal investigator of the INSPIRE Faculty project on red panda funded by the Department of Science and Technology, and another scientist Lalit Sharma, head of the wildlife section of the ZSI, are also trying to map the potential corridor supporting the movement of the red panda across the eastern Himalayas. Another publication titled “Geological and Pleistocene glaciations” explains the demography and disjunct distribution of the red panda (A fulgens) in the eastern Himalayas which reveals the demographic history of the red panda in the entire eastern Himalayan region. According to Dr. Thakur, the species divergence time is about 0.30 million years ago (CI 0.23–0.39 MYA) corresponding to the middle-late Pleistocene transition. “The Himalayan red panda was affected more during the Pleistocene glaciation and experienced a severe reduction in the population size when compared to the Chinese red panda,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/india-home-to-both-species-of-red-panda-says-zsi-study/article33605162.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy has directed the officials to take a decision on reopening of schools for all classes and running classes on a daily basis from the first half of February after a thorough analysis of the situation created by COVID-19. He told them to focus on teaching in English for the Class VII students from the next academic year. At a review meeting on the functioning of schools on Monday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the welfare assistants in village/ward secretariats should enquire about the health of students in order to facilitate necessary remedial action. He said a special mobile application has been designed to monitor the attendance of students in schools. The attendance particulars would be uploaded in the app every day and teachers and parents could check it directly. The Chief Minister said messages should be sent to parents if their children didn’t attend school. He instructed the officials to finalise all the tenders related to Vidya Kanuka at the earliest and ensure that the kits were delivered on time.  Maintenance of toilets He wanted clean toilets in all schools from February 1. Many students were not going to schools due to the absence or poor maintenance of toilets. A standard operating procedure should be evolved for keeping the toilets clean on a priority basis, he said. The expertise of organisations like Sulabh could be used in this regard, he suggested. ‘Revolutionary changes’ The Chief Minister said revolutionary changes were brought in the educational institutions by implementing the Nadu - Nedu scheme, introducing English as a medium of instruction and by providing nutritious food through Goru Mudda scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cm-moots-reopening-of-schools-for-all-students-from-feb/article33604912.ece

19 January 2021||New Delhi,||Aware of Chinese construction on LAC: MEA||The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Monday said it was aware of infrastructure construction by China in the past several years “along the Line of Actual Control (LAC)” and that India had also stepped up its construction, after a report by NDTV showed satellite images of a new Chinese settlement in Arunachal Pradesh. This is the first time the government has acknowledged Chinese construction, although official sources say the land has been under the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) control since 1959. “The Chinese have been holding the area since 1959 and it is not a new development. Prior to that, there was an Assam Rifles post there which was overrun. They have been doing construction there on and off. There were some temporary constructions a few years back. They have now done permanent construction there,” an official source said.  This is the first time the government has acknowledged Chinese construction, although official sources say the land has been under the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s control since 1959.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/aware-of-chinese-construction-on-lac-mea/article33604927.ece
19 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||HC imposes Rs. 50,000 costs on PIL petitioner||Telangana High Court Chief Justice Hima Kohli on Monday sent a loud and clear message to persons filing PIL petitions and their respective counsels. Withholding information or misleading the HC would not be allowed when it comes to PIL pleas! Making this amply clear, the CJ dismissed a PIL petition and imposed Rs. 50,000 costs on the petitioner observing that the latter misled the court by withholding information that he was facing a criminal case connected to the PIL content. The costs should be deposited in the account of Telangana State Legal Services Authority account. Rejecting repeated apologies expressed by the petitioner’s counsel Kurapati Sujatha, the CJ said the petitioner should mention about the order in the present petition if he files any other PIL pleas in the future. Gattu Kumara Swamy, sarpanch of Laxmidevpet in Venkatapur mandal of Mulugu district filed the PIL plea seeking a direction to police officials to register a case against a person accusing him of harassing some people of the village in land matters. The petitioner also requested the court to set aside the FIRs issued by Venkatapur police Station House Officer against some villagers. Interestingly, an FIR was also issued against the petitioner Mr. Swamy. When the plea came up for hearing before the bench of CJ and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy, the CJ pointed out that the petitioner himself was facing a criminal case and that the crucial fact was not mentioned in the petition. Counsel Kurapati Sujatha tried to explain that copies of the FIRs were presented. But the CJ insisted on knowing whether the petitioner had disclosed the fact that an FIR was issued against him as well. The counsel replied that it was not mentioned. “Why you have not mentioned it….In the sworn affidavit the petitioner stated that he was not facing any civil or criminal cases….this amounts to perjury,” the CJ remarked. Stating that the petitioner cannot take the court for a ride, the CJ told the counsel that she too owed double responsibility in explicitly stating facts since she was representing the petitioner. The counsel repeatedly apologised for the goof-up. “It is a false affidavit. No apologies. In fact, a show-cause notice should be issued to the petitioner to explain why he must not be prosecuted for this,” the CJ observed taking strong exception to the petitioner’s attempt to keep the court in the dark about the facts of the case. The CJ remarked the petitioner had conveniently skipped key facts and gave a colour of public interest to the petition. The CJ rejected the counsel’s request for permission to withdraw the petition and imposed costs on the petitioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/hc-imposes-rs-50000-costs-on-pil-petitioner/article33605505.ece

The response for vaccination in Dakshina Kannada was far better to the one noticed on the first day of the first phase of vaccination on Saturday. “A good number of health workers contacted me to know my condition. Two doctors, who were among health workers who received vaccine on Saturday, and me are fine. We are not having any complications following the jab,” said urologist Sadananda Poojary from the Government Wenlock Hospital. Professor and Head of Department of Cardiology, Kasturba Medical College, Mangaluru, K. Padmanabha Kamath, who took covishield vaccine at the KMC Hospital in Mangaluru on Monday, said, “I believe we doctors who are the frontline in this battle should lead from the front in alleviating all the fear and allaying the doubts from the minds of our patients. I have fulfilled that today.” As many as 42 health workers each received COVID-19 vaccine jab in the two vaccination sites in the Wenlock Hospital.

Vaccination was not administered for some health workers because of their health condition,” said District Reproductive Child Health Officer B.V. Rajesh. Messages to receive vaccination jabs will be sent to health workers who have remained absent and those who have postponed vaccination, he added. In Udupi, 48 health workers received the vaccine at the Urban Primary Health Centre in Udupi on Monday. A total of 328 health workers have received the jab on Saturday and Sunday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/more-than-1000-health-workers-vaccinated-in-twin-districts/article33605595.ece
19 January 2021||Bengaluru,||State leaders attack Uddhav for his remarks||Political leaders from across the spectrum on Monday slammed Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray for terming Marathi-speaking areas as “Karnataka occupied”. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa slammed Mr. Thackeray for displaying regionalism and linguistic chauvinism. The former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said the Mahajan Commission report was final and termed the Maharashtra Chief Minister’s statement as “stupid”. Another former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy said the statement of the Maharashtra leader reflected the Chinese expansionist policy. Currently, Maharashtra is fighting a case in the Supreme Court on the issue even as Karnataka insists that the border issue is a settled matter after Mahajan Commission gave its report. Meanwhile, a coalition of Kannada organisations, which are already riled at the Karnataka government announcing a Maratha corporation for the welfare of that community, has convened a meeting on Wednesday to chalk out the future course of action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/state-leaders-attack-uddhav-for-his-remarks/article33605252.ece
19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farm unions, Ministers to meet only tomorrow||The Agriculture Ministry has postponed the next round of talks between Central Ministers and protesting farm unions from Tuesday to Wednesday. The delay is due to “unavoidable reasons”, it said in a communication to the unions. Speaking to presspersons in Gwalior, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar blamed the protesting unions for the stalemate. “The unions are not willing to discuss the specific provisions of the laws, so the deadlock persists,” he said. He urged the unions to give up their plans for a tractor rally on Republic Day. “Our country has got Independence after many sacrifices. It is the responsibility of the farmers also to ensure that the dignity of Republic Day is not affected,” he said. Farmers groups welcomed the Supreme Court’s comments on their Republic Day plans, and reiterated their intention to go ahead with their tractor rally. On Monday, the unions held preliminary discussions with the Delhi Police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/farmers-stay-with-plan-ministry-puts-off-meet/article33604925.ece
19 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||KSRTC-SWIFT fails to enthuse unions||The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation management’s efforts to win over the three recognised trade unions — Indian National Trade Union Congress, Centre of Indian Trade Unions, and Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh — in the undertaking to float KSRTC-SWIFT, a legally independent company for plying long-distance buses under the proposed Restructure 2.0., did not succeed. But, Chairman and Managing Director Biju Prabhakar got the nod of the Chief Minister to go ahead with the initiatives. The CMD, who was at the receiving end for the remarks against employees, was also asked by the Chief Minister to avoid controversial statements. At the talks Mr. Prabhakar had with the unions on Monday at Transport Bhavan, the INTUC-affiliated Transport Democratic Federation (TDF) and the BMS-affiliated Kerala State Transport Employees Sangh (KSTES) opposed the formation of the new company, with headquarters at the Anayara KSRTC depot here, to secure funds from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). The CITU-affiliated Kerala State Road Transport Employees Association neither supported or opposed the move. Its leaders pointed out that the KSRTC would be confined to paper once long-distance, CNG, LNG, electric, JnNURM, Scania, and Volvo buses were handed over to the new entity. The CMD told the union leaders that KIIFB would infuse funds only if KSRTC-SWIFT was formed. The proposal to lease out prime land such as the Vikas Bhavan depot to KIIFB was based on government policy. “The KSRTC land at Ernakulam and Kayamkulam will also be leased,” the CMD said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ksrtc-swift-fails-to-enthuse-unions/article33605112.ece
19 January 2021||Pune,||Maharashtra’s active cases dip to 50,000 mark||Maharashtra reported 3,854 recoveries on Monday, outweighing the surge of 1,924 fresh COVID-19 cases as the active infections declined to 50,680. The total case tally has now reached 19,92,683. As many as 35 fatalities saw the death toll climb to 50,473. The low case spike, however, must be seen in the context of a comparatively lower number of samples tested — 39,000 — in the last 24 hours. The cumulative recoveries stand at 18,86,469 while the State’s recovery rate is 94.76%. “Of a total 1,38,45,897 laboratory samples tested thus far, 19,92,683 (with the case positivity rate down to 14.39%) have returned positive with over 39,000 samples being tested in the last 24 hours,” State Surveillance Officer Dr. Pradeep Awate said, adding that the case fatality stood at 2.53%. Pune reported more than 300 new cases to take its total case tally to 3,82,460. Four deaths saw the toll rise to 7,869. As per the district administration figures, the active cases stand at 5,249 while the district’s recovery rate is 96.22%. Mumbai city recorded 395 new cases to take its total tally to 3,03,152 of whom just 6,678 are active. Seven fatalities saw the city’s toll touch 11,251.

19 January 2021||Kolkata,||Mamata to challenge Suvendu in Nandigram||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday said she would contest the 2021 Assembly election from Nandigram in Purba Medinipur district. She made the announcement at a public meeting in Nandigram, almost a month after Trinamool Congress heavyweight and former MLA from the constituency Suvendu Adhikari quit and joined the BJP. “What if I contest seat in Nandigram? How will that be? I will ask Subrata Bakshi [State TMC president] that I want to contest from here and my name should be included from Nandigram,” she said. The announcement assumes significance not only because Ms. Banerjee is all set to take on Mr. Adhikari in his fiefdom but also because Nandigram symbolises the party’s struggle against forcible land acquisition in the Left Front regime. She also announced a monthly pension to the families of those killed in the police firing on protesters on March 14, 2007 and those who went missing in the subsequent violence. The Chief Minister, who has been contesting from Bhawanipur in Kolkata, said she would not neglect her constituency as its people might feel bad. Party sources said she may contest from Bhawanipur too.   Addressing supporters, Mr. Adhikari said: “Whether I am nominated or someone else [from Nandigram], I want to assure that if I am unable to defeat her by a margin of 50,000 votes, I will quit politics.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/mamata-to-challenge-suvendu-in-nandigram/article33604926.ece

19 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Yediyurappa slams Uddhav for border remarks||A day after Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray spoke about integrating “Karnataka-occupied Marathi- speaking and cultural areas into Maharashtra”, Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Monday slammed the former for “displaying regionalism and linguistic chauvinism”, and reiterated that the Mahajan Commission report on the border issue is final. The tweets of Mr. Thackeray from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) handle and those of Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Sunday drew criticism from across political spectrum in Karnataka with several leaders calling it an equivalent of “Chinese expansionist attitude”. Taking serious exception, Mr. Yediyurappa hit back and said that Mr. Thackeray’s statement smacks of arrogance. “Display of regionalism and linguistic chauvinism will hurt the integrity of the nation. I condemn this. Maratha speakers have integrated well with Kannadigas in Karnataka and similarly Kannada-speaking people in the border districts of Maharashtra have integrated with Marathas,” Mr. Yediyurappa tweeted in response. In the tweet on Sunday, Mr. Thackeray said that his government was committed towards incorporating into the State the areas of Karnataka where Marathi speakers are majority, and that it would be a “true tribute” to the martyrs of the cause. “Bringing Karnataka-occupied Marathi speaking and cultural areas to Maharashtra will be the true tribute to those who accepted martyrdom in the boundary battle. We are united and committed towards it. Respects to the martyrs with this promise,” the CMO had tweeted. The tweet coincided with Martyrs’ Day observed on January 17 by the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti and other organisations as a mark of respect to those who laid their life to the cause. Mr. Pawar also tweeted: “Greetings to all the knights in the border struggle for a united Maharashtra on the occasion of Martyrs’ Day! Until the last Marathi village in Karnataka reaches Maharashtra, it will be a true tribute to the martyrs of the border war.” Accusing Mr. Thackeray of trying to break the harmony between Kannadigas and Marathas, Mr. Yediyurappa said: “It’s painful that such an effort is happening from the Maharashtra Chief Minister. As an Indian, Mr. Thackeray should show commitment to the federal structure of the country.” Incidentally, tension between the two States over the boundary issue has come up again at a time when Kannada Chaluvali leaders have bitterly opposed the formation of the Maratha corporation for the welfare of Marathas in the State. Leaders Vatal Nagaraj and others had pointed to the border row to urge the government to rescind on the decision to form the corporation, which is touted to be a political decision ahead of the bypolls in Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency, and Maski and Basavakalyan Assembly constituencies, where Marathas are sizeable electorates. This is second instance triggered by the Maha Vikas Aghadi headed by Mr. Thackeray after it came to power in November 2019. In the first week of December 2019, Mr. Thackeray appointed Ministers Chhagan Bhujbal and Eknath Shinde as coordinators to monitor the case in the Supreme Court related to the boundary issue with Karnataka, and had raised the issue on the floor of the Maharashtra Assembly. Tension prevailed in border areas on both sides, especially in Belagavi in Karnataka and Kolhapur in Maharashtra, with public transport between the two States being suspended. Skirmishes had also been reported.  Mr. Thackeray had said that his government was committed towards incorporating into the State the areas of Karnataka where Marathi speakers are majority, and that it would be a “true tribute” to the martyrs of the cause.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/yediyurappa-slams-uddhav-for-border-remarks/article33604840.ece
19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC-appointed panel to meet farmers’ groups from Jan. 21||The committee appointed by the Supreme Court will start meeting farmers’ groups from Thursday, according to one of its members. “The three of us will hold our first meeting tomorrow [on Tuesday] afternoon, probably at Pusa campus [of the National Agricultural Science Complex]. We will decide on our plans and the modalities for consultation with all stakeholders as directed by the Supreme Court. We will hold the first meeting with farmers’ groups on January 21,” Shetkari Sanghatan president Anil Ghanwat told The Hindu on Monday. Apart from Mr. Ghanwat, the other members of the committee are agricultural economist Ashok Gulati, who is a former chairman of the Committee for Agricultural Costs and Prices; and policy expert Pramod Joshi, who is a former South Asia director of the International Food Policy Research Institute. The fourth member, veteran farmer leader Bhupinder Singh Mann, who heads his own faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, has recused himself from the panel in solidarity with protesting farm unions demanding repeal of three farm reform laws. The unions protesting on the borders of Delhi for almost two months have refused to meet the committee, but Mr. Ghanwat who heads a pro-reforms union, is unfazed. ‘Will listen to all’ “There are hundreds and thousands of farmers and farmers groups who are in favour of the laws and who are willing to meet with us. We will listen to them first,” he said. “We will keep on urging all farmers groups to talk to us as the Supreme Court has directed it. We are here to listen to everyone,” he added. The committee would also meet with millers, food processors and other representatives of the agribusiness and food industry, said Mr. Ghanwat. However, there was currently no plan to meet government representatives or agricultural scientists for their point of view, he added. Even as the committee holds its first internal meeting at Pusa tomorrow, protesting farm unions will be meeting Central Ministers for direct negotiations at the same time in Vigyan Bhavan, continuing a parallel dialogue process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-appointed-panel-to-meet-farmers-groups-from-jan-21/article33604875.ece
19 January 2021||New Delhi,||‘Legal issue’ delaying Mallya’s extradition||The U.K. government has told the Indian side that businessman Vijay Mallya cannot be extradited until a confidential “legal issue” concerning him is resolved, the Centre informed the Supreme Court on Monday. An official letter from the Ministry of External Affairs, quoting excerpts from the U.K. government’s communication, was read out by Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta before a Special Bench led by Justice U.U. Lalit. The letter quoted the U.K. government saying there was a “further legal issue” to be resolved before Mr. Mallya could be extradited. The U.K. has refused to provide details of this “issue”, saying it was judicial in nature. It has also refused to disclose how long it would take to resolve the issue, though reassuring that it knew how important the Mallya case was to the Government of India. The Ministry letter quoted the U.K. assuring that it was “seeking to deal with the issue as quickly as possible”. Mr. Mehta said the government had been making frequent and repeated efforts to extradite Mr. Mallya. The letter itself related how the Foreign Secretary had raised the issue of Mr. Mallya’s extradition with the U.K. Home Secretary in November. The Foreign Minister had done so with the U.K. Foreign Secretary in December. This was followed by the Home Secretary raising it with the U.K. Permanent Under Secretary of Home in January 2021. The court listed the case for March 15. On October 5, the court had asked Mr. Mallya’s side to come clean about the nature of a “confidential” proceedings going on after the rejection of his appeal against extradition in the U.K. Supreme Court. The government had informed that Mr. Mallya’s case in the U.K. was over, but some “secret” proceedings were on. The court had wanted to know about the nature of these confidential proceedings. On August 30 2020, the Supreme Court had dismissed Mr. Mallya’s review petition against a May 9, 2017 verdict of contempt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/legal-issue-delaying-mallyas-extradition/article33604887.ece
19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Experts to be assigned to review State labour laws||The Union Labour and Employment Ministry is likely to appoint legal consultants this month to look at whether States’ labour laws are in consonance with the Centre’s four new labour codes, according to senior Ministry officials. The codes on wages, social security, industrial relations and occupational safety, health and working conditions could be implemented before the April 1 target. Labour and Employment Secretary Apurva Chandra told reporters on January 12 that the rules framed under the codes on social security, industrial relations and occupational safety would be finalised by the end of the month. The rules under the Code on Wages, 2019 have already been finalised. Along with the implementation of the codes, an official said the Ministry would appoint legal consultants soon to review the various State laws. The official added that the matter would be taken up with the States if the laws are found to be out of tune with the codes. The work would start with two or three States, the official said. The four codes have amalgamated 29 Central labour laws, including those covering matters of minimum wages, benefits for workers and strikes. For the first time, gig and platform workers have been covered under the ambit of social security schemes. Most Central trade unions, however, have protested against the codes, terming them anti-worker.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/experts-to-be-assigned-to-review-state-labour-laws/article33604878.ece
19 January 2021||New Delhi,||‘Land under PLA control since 1959’||The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Monday said it was aware of infrastructure construction by China in the past several years “along the Line of Actual Control (LAC)” and that India has also stepped up its construction. The statement came after a report by NDTV showed satellite images of a new Chinese settlement in Arunachal Pradesh. This is the first time the government has acknowledged Chinese construction, although official sources say the land has been under the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) control since 1959. “The Chinese have been holding the area since 1959 and it is not a new development. Prior to that, there was an Assam Rifles post there which was overrun. They have been doing construction there on and off. There were some temporary constructions few years back. They have now done permanent construction there,” an official source said. A second official source said, “They are doing it [the construction] on their side and we are doing it on our side.” Satellite images show the construction of a big village on the banks of Tsari Chu river in Upper Subansiri district between November 2019 and November 2020. Stating that the government remains committed to the objective of creating infrastructure along the border areas for the improvement of the livelihood of its citizens, including in Arunachal Pradesh, the MEA said in a statement, “Government keeps a constant watch on all developments having a bearing on India’s security and takes all the necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.” The MEA said that India, too, has stepped up border infrastructure, including the construction of roads and bridges among others, which it added has provided “much needed connectivity to the local population along the border.” Briefing the Parliament in 2019 on the ongoing stand-off in eastern Ladakh, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had said that China continues to be in illegal occupation of approximately 38,000 sq. km. in the Union Territory of Ladakh, and Aksai Chin, and also claims approximately 90,000 sq. km. of Indian territory in Arunachal Pradesh. In addition to infrastructure development on the border to improve military movement, China has in recent years established civilian settlements closer to the border.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/land-under-pla-control-since-1959/article33604879.ece
19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||New monsoon forecast models on the anvil||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) may introduce new monsoon models this year to better forecast changes in rainfall. At a day-long meet, via videoconference, involving several senior meteorologists across the IMD’s offices and those from affiliated climate research institutes, threadbare discussions took place on the accuracy of the existing models, emerging weather models and their strengths and weaknesses in capturing the vagaries of the monsoon and the extent to which they were effective, over varying time-scales, in forecasting heavy rain or an extended dry patch. The monsoon that concluded in 2020 was unique, in that with monsoon 2019, it was only the third time in a century that India saw back-to-back years of above normal rainfall. In both years — and monsoon 2019 was a 25-year high — the IMD failed to forecast the magnitude of the excess and only indicated that monsoon would be “above normal”. D.S. Pai, who heads the IMD’s Climate Research Services, Pune, said in his talk there were three different models that could be tested this year. Two of them were dynamical models and one a statistical model. Computer simulation In the former, the climate on any particular day is simulated on supercomputers and meteorologists observe the changing daily output. The other is the traditional statistical model that equates relationships of physical parameters, such as for instance sea surface temperatures, snowfall, the temperature of landmass etc with the actual observed rainfall in the past. The three models under consideration are: 12 global circulation models (dynamical) whose outputs would be combined into a single one; a model that gauges rainfall based on the sea surface temperature in the tropics (developed by Prof. Sumant Nigam, University of Maryland, U.S.) and the statistical model based on climate variables observed during the pre-monsoon. All of them are ‘ensembles’ meaning smaller models are combined to arrive at an average value. M. Mohapatra, Director General, IMD, told The Hindu that the traditional statistical model would continue to be used this year. “However, we will continue to have discussions and will decide later on what new approach can be added.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-monsoon-forecast-models-on-the-anvil/article33604881.ece
19 January 2021||Srinagar,||Slain men were militants: J&K police||Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Vijay Kumar on Monday said the Jammu and Kashmir Police have almost gathered “conclusive evidence” to prove that the three youth killed in a disputed encounter in Srinagar on December 30 were militants, and reiterated that “the bodies will not be handed over to the families”. “The data collected so far showed that all the three associates killed in the encounter were involved in providing logistics. Their involvement has been proved almost by 60%. We will place everything before their parents to convince them about the involvement of their children,” Mr. Kumar said at a function organised as part of the traffic awareness week. The slain youth, who were killed in a night-long encounter, were identified as Ajaz Maqbool Ganie, Ather Mushtaq from Pulwama and Zubair Lone from Shopian. Their families disputed the version of the security forces, and claimed that their kin were not militants and were killed in a staged encounter. They have appealed to the Lieutenant-Governor’s administration to return the bodies for a burial at their ancestral graveyards. “Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a protocol is followed. If we return the body of any militant or associate, people will turn up in thousands. The burial was carried out in the presence of families, including their parents. There is no logic of returning the bodies as burial does not take place twice,” the IGP said. On the Shopian “staged encounter” last year, he said “money was paid to the source in every encounter but not to officials”. “Sources are given money [for tipping off on militants’ presence] and not to the officer whether from the police, military or paramilitary,” he stated. Mr. Kumar confirmed that the sources, who apparently worked with the Army captain, were paid money “as promised”. “The source has himself recorded before the Magistrate under Section 164 of the IPC that money has been given,” he added. Three youth from Rajouri were killed in an ‘encounter’ in Shopian’s Amshipora on July 18, 2020 .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/slain-men-were-militants-jk-police/article33604890.ece
19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Where is evidence that you are spiritual guru: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday questioned a Kerala-based man seeking the release of a 21-year-old woman, who he claimed was his “spiritual live-in partner,” from the “illegal custody” of her parents and family. He said he was her “spiritual guru”. The man said she was being detained and subjected to physical violence for considering him as her “acharya” and expressing her intention to go with him. “What is the evidence on record to show that you are a spiritual guru, and her spiritual guru?” Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde, heading a three-judge Bench, asked the man’s lawyers, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan and advocate A. Karthik. The man had appealed to the Supreme Court against a Kerala High Court order of January 4 on his habeas corpus petition. Mr. Sankaranarayanan submitted that the woman had appeared before the High Court to clearly state that she wanted to join the man. Despite this, the High Court had given her into her parents’ custody. “The volition of two adults is being questioned here,” Mr. Sankaranarayanan submitted. He said the High Court had, while hearing the habeas corpus petition, took into consideration social and moral values. It had “simply dismissed” her fears of physical violence at the hands of her family if she returned to them. The senior lawyer referred to the Hadiya case judgment in which the apex court had noted that “social values and morals have their space but they are not above the constitutionally granted freedom ... Parental love or concern cannot be allowed to fluster the right of choice of an adult.” “But has she made a complaint to the police that she is being illegally detained?” the CJI asked. ‘Modesty questioned’ In her petition, the man alleged that the police had questioned her modesty. Her SIM card, ATM card and other personal belongings were taken from her, and she was not allowed to leave home independently. “Infuriated that the woman chose to practice the Vedantic principles of moksha, sanyasa and divine yoga with the petitioner, her parents and family resorted to harassing and torturing her. This is evident from the emails sent by her to the petitioner as well as to the Kerala State Human Rights and Women Commissions. The woman has been threatened with honour killing,” the man claimed. The man said he was a doctor who renounced worldly life at 42 and turned to spiritual practice on Vedanta Upanishad. He said he was married with two children who were in his care and shelter, though living separately. The Bench finally listed the case for next week while asking the High Court to go ahead and determine the petition pending before it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/where-is-evidence-that-you-are-spiritual-guru-sc/article33604853.ece
19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Imran attacks Modi govt. over Arnab Goswami’s chats||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan waded into the controversy over leaked conversations between a television channel head and the chief of television ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), saying that they proved that the Modi government had planned the Balakot air strikes in February 2019 in order to “win general elections”, and to “push our nuclearised region to the brink of a conflict it cannot afford”. Mr. Khan’s statement, which followed a similar statement by Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday, raised a response from the Editor-in-Chief of the “Republic media network”. He claimed that there was a “Pakistani hand” in the case against Republic and BARC’s former CEO Partho Dasgupta, currently in police custody. Mr. Khan said the communications revealed the “unholy nexus between the Modi govt & Indian media”, and accused the government that “dangerous military adventurism to win an election”. ‘Plot against Republic’ Mr. Goswami said the comments by Mr. Khan made it clear that Pakistan had a role in what he claimed was a “conspiracy against Republic”. “If the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Pakistan have come out in support of the malicious police action against the Republic, then nothing much is left to be said,” Mr. Goswami added. He also alleged that there was evidence of “calibration” between the Congress party and Indian media which, he said, were “anti-Republic” in order to “assist the Pakistani narrative”. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) did not comment on the exchange. “We dismiss the allegation with the contempt it deserves,” Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala told The Hindu when asked about the remarks, and accused Mr. Goswami of “hiding his misdeeds behind Imran Khan”. As The Hindu reported some days ago, transcripts of the conversations between Mr. Goswami and Mr. Dasgupta that have been released into the public domain are understood to be part of the Maharashtra police’s charge sheet in the case on fixing of TRPs (Television Rating Points) by BARC and Republic TV. Advanced knowledge According to the messages purportedly exchanged on WhatsApp, three days before Indian Air Force jets bombed a building believed to be Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist training camp in the Pakistani town of Balakot on February 23, 2019, Mr. Goswami told Mr. Dasgupta that India would carry out something “bigger than a normal strike” on Pakistan. Mr. Goswami allegedly celebrated his TV channel’s rating’s bump after the Pulwama terror attack on February 14 by the JeM, in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed, saying “this attack we have won like crazy”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/imran-attacks-modi-govt-over-arnab-goswamis-chats/article33604867.ece
19 January 2021||New Delhi,||NIA postpones examination of 2 members of Khalsa Aid||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has examined 12 persons so far in connection with a recent case registered against Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a foreign-based group banned by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in 2019 for advocating secessionist and pro-Khalistani activities in India. The NIA had on January 15 summoned around 40 persons to be examined by the agency as ‘witness’ in the SFJ case registered on December 15, 2020. All the persons who received NIA notices have either participated in the ongoing farmers’ agitation at the Delhi borders or have provided humanitarian aid at the protest site. The examination by the NIA of two key members of Khalsa Aid, an international NGO, has been postponed indefinitely. “There was meant to be a hearing of two key Indian team members today and tomorrow [Monday and Tuesday], they [the NIA] postponed it. They were informed on phone that the hearing is postponed till further notice,” Ravinder Singh, founder of Khalsa Aid, said. The NGO had set up food stalls and provided foot massage machines and geysers to farmers protesting at Delhi border since November. Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu, who campaigned for the BJP’s Sunny Deol during the 2019 general elections, did not appear before the NIA on Sunday. Mr. Sidhu, who has been camping at the Singhu border for the past two months, said, “I have not received a single penny in my account or my family’s account from overseas or anybody in India or any NGO,” he said. “Even though the notice asks us to appear as a witness, they have kept it open under Section 120 B IPC [criminal conspiracy]. Tomorrow they might use this case to chargesheet us. I am a lawyer and I can see the pressure tactics,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nia-postpones-examination-of-2-members-of-khalsa-aid/article33604870.ece
19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Centre’s affidavit pushes for wide roads||The Central government supported the majority view taken by the Supreme Court’s Char Dham High-Powered Committee (HPC) for the necessity of broadening the Himalayan feeder roads to India-China border in order to facilitate troop movement. The Ministry of Defence, in an affidavit, said it was unfortunate that three of the HPC members had given a minority view to reconsider a December 15, 2020 circular of the Ministry of Road and Transport and Highways (MoRTH), which fixed the carriageway width of the feeder roads at seven metre with a paved shoulder spanning 1.5 metre on either side. A Bench led by Justice Rohinton Nariman, on December 2, asked the HPC to meet and discuss a plea by the Ministry that narrowing the feeder roads along the India-China border in Uttarakhand would cause “serious repurcussions” to national security. The Bench scheduled the case for hearing in January last week. The minority view, however, said the circular needed a rethink considering its “long-term impacts on the fragile Himalayan terrain and sensitive ecosystem”. The Centre, in its affidavit, said it was “unfortunate” that the HPC members, who are in the minority, have given such an opinion “notwithstanding the security of the country and the need of the defence forces to resist possible external aggression”. The government urged the court to accept the majority view of 21 members on the HPC who support the circular, which had amended an earlier MoRTH one of March 2018 that called for narrower roads to protect the Himalayan ecosystem. The affidavit said, “The Forces have to take heavy vehicles, tanks, self-propelled artillery and troops to the Indo-China border... It is the specific need of the Armed Forces to defend the country against any possible external aggression at the northern border - this had required amendments in the March 2018 circular”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centres-affidavit-pushes-for-wide-roads/article33604884.ece
19 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Ballari resident died due to heart attack, says Health Dept.||The Department of Health and Family Welfare has stated that the death of a 42-year-old person on Monday was due to a massive heart attack. The person had been vaccinated for COVID-19 on January 16. Following this, the district-level Adverse Effects Following Immunisation (AEFI) met and had a detailed discussion and concluded that the death was due to “cardio respiratory arrest secondary to acute antereo septal wall MI”. The man, identified as Nagaraju, a resident of Ballari district was a permanent employee of the Health Department. A note by the department stated that there was no uneventful event in 24 hours after vaccination and he had reported for duty on Monday and complained of chest pain around 9.30 a.m. and collapsed. “He was treated immediately and was admitted to Jindal Sanjeeveni Hospital at 11.15 a.m,” the note stated and added that although the best treatment was given he could not be saved. It also added that none of the healthcare workers who took vaccine had any adverse events. Meanwhile, a total of 47 % of the target was achieved on Monday on the third day of the vaccination drive. A total of 81,219 beneficiaries were to be vaccinated but 38,242 were actually inoculated. As against the plan of holding 1,017 sessions, 1,000 sessions were held. The highest vaccination coverage was in Chickballapur and Belagavi districts where 73 % of the target was achieved. Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey said that no major AEFI was reported on Monday. A major AEFI case is when a patient gets admitted as inpatient in hospital following immunisation. Mild AEFI Meanwhile, some developed mild AEFI for a few minutes. At least six healthcare personnel who were vaccinated at the Bowring and Lady Curzon Medical College and Research Institute developed AEFI. A total of 612 people were vaccinated at this institute. This included three doctors and three staff nurses. The Department of Health and Family Welfare, however, did not provide a consolidated report on the total number of mild adverse effects following immunisation. Four of them recovered within a span of 15 minutes, while another person took half an hour to recover. “Only one patient was admitted as the person’s blood pressure dropped and was discharged in an hour,” said Manoj Kumar, Dean and Director. Meanwhile, two of the people who got vaccinated have been admitted in Chitradurga and are under observation. While one of them was admitted to district hospital in Chitradurga the other is in the General Hospital, Challakere, Chitradurga.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/death-of-ballari-resident-was-owing-to-heart-attack-says-health-dept/article33605066.ece
19 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||AICC taps Oommen Chandy to head Kerala electioneering||The All India Congress Committee (AICC) has reportedly tapped former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy to lead the party into the electoral fray in the coming Assembly elections in the State. The AICC had nominated a high-power committee to finalise candidate selection and formulate electioneering strategy. It has tipped Mr. Chandy to head the panel. The Congress has not named Mr. Chandy or any other leader as its Chief Minister candidate. However, Mr. Chandy’s track record as a powerful mobiliser in the provincial Congress party seemed to have powered his “ascendancy”. The AICC also hoped to draw on Mr. Chandy’s long innings in government and Opposition to bring the Congress closer to coalition partners, social organisations, and community leaders ahead of the election. Other members Mr. Chandy is among equals on the panel. A.K. Antony, Tariq Anwar, KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran, UDF convener M.M. Hassan, and Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala are among those on board. Congress office-bearers from Kerala were in New Delhi on Monday to hold consultations with the national leadership, including Rahul Gandhi.  Mr. Chandy has arrived at the helm of the Congress’ electioneering machinery at a challenging juncture. The party is facing the “daunting task” of defeating the Left Democratic Front (LDF). The ruling front had harnessed youth power and fielded winnable candidates to buck the anti-incumbency factor and emerge dominant in the local body polls. At a stroke, the LDF had raised the stakes in the impending battle for the Assembly. The AICC has reportedly trashed the traditional practice of “mindlessly” apportioning Assembly seats to opposing party factions. It has insisted that the Congress consider only candidates who could secure a win for the party. A party insider said more youngsters, women, opinion leaders, popular independents, and Congress workers from backward classes and Dalit communities would find themselves on the candidate list. Demographic and political shifts, which the Congress had “missed” in the local body polls, would also influence candidate selection. The panel would also help rebuild the Congress’ electioneering machinery from the rump by mustering canvassers from the ward level and upwards.

19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Task force on marriage age submits report to PMO||The task force set up to take a re-look at the age of marriage for women has submitted its report to the Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of Women and Child Development, it is reliably learnt. A government source said the report was submitted either “late December or very early in January”. Chairperson of the committee Jaya Jaitley refused to comment on the contents of the report submitted after a delay of five months. When the panel was formed in June last year, it was given until July 31, 2020, to finalise its report. A person close to the development said the report contains “concrete suggestions on all aspects”. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Independence Day speech last year spoke about a panel formed to decide on the “right age of marriage” for women. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech last year proposed a panel on the “age of a girl entering motherhood” to lower maternal mortality rates and improve nutrition levels. But when the decision to appoint a task force was announced, its terms of reference included examining “the correlation of age of marriage and motherhood” with health and nutritional status of mothers and infants. Women’s rights activists have opposed the suggestion of raising the age of marriage from 18 to 21 for women and have cited evidence to show that such a move may be used to incarcerate young adults marrying without parents’ consent.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/task-force-on-marriage-age-submits-report-to-pmo/article33604864.ece
19 January 2021||LUCKNOW,||Tandav crew and cast issue apology||The cast and crew of Tandav ,  a web series on Amazon Prime Video platform, have issued an apology. In a statement, shared on Twitter by Ali Abbas Zafar, director of the series, they “unconditionally apologised” taking cognisance of the concerns expressed by people “if it has unintentionally hurt anyone’s sentiments”.  Tandav is a “work of fiction and any resemblance to acts and persons and events is purely coincidental”, they said. “The cast and crew did not have any intention to offend the sentiments of any individual, caste, community, race, religion or religious beliefs or insult or outrage any institution, political party or person, living or dead.” An FIR has been lodged lodged at the Hazratganj police station in Lucknow against the makers of the web series on charges of hurting the religious sentiments of Hindus and promoting enmity on grounds of religion. The complainant, a sub-inspector of the Hazratganj police, says he was asked to watch the show by senior officers after he alerted them about angry posts on the series, which started streaming on January 15. The Information and Broadcasting Ministry on Sunday sought an explanation from Amazon Prime Video on the issue.  Threat to makers Shalabh Mani Tripathi, information adviser to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, issued a threat to the makers of the web series. Tagging the accused persons in a tweet, he said a team of U.P. Police had left for Mumbai in a car. The political drama series has Saif Ali Khan, Dimple Kapadia, Tigmanshu Dhulia and Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub in the cast. The FIR was filed under various Sections of the IPC and the IT Act.

19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Panel to probe member’s political outreach||The joint platform of protesting farmer unions, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), has disassociated itself from the political outreach of one of its key members, Haryana leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni. However, Mr. Chaduni will continue to be part of the delegation of unions negotiating with the Central government for now. Mr. Chaduni had written letters to political parties in relation to the ongoing protest against farm laws on Delhi’s borders, and allegedly met some politicians at Delhi’s Constitution Club on Sunday. The SKM had decided not to invite political parties to its stage or rallies, both to avoid government accusations that politics had hijacked the protest as well as in acknowledgement that there is a range of political opinions among the protesters themselves. “SKM is not associated with the ‘all-party meeting’ taken up by Mr. Chaduni with political parties. SKM, after taking note of Mr. Chaduni’s ongoing activities with political parties, after due discussion on the same in a general body meeting of SKM yesterday, has formed a Committee that will inquire into the matter and give its report in three days’ time. SKM will take further steps thereafter,” said a statement signed by six other leaders of the united front. Mr. Chaduni will still be among the leaders meeting Central Ministers for the 10th round of talks on Tuesday, as that list is determined by government invitation, not by the unions themselves.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/panel-to-probe-members-political-outreach/article33604873.ece
19 January 2021||Chennai,||CVC presses for expeditious disposal of vigilance cases||The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has directed all Ministries/Departments of the Union government to strictly adhere to the time limits for various stages of disciplinary proceedings in vigilance cases since unexplained delay was causing undue advantage or harassment to the charged officials. In a circular issued on December 30, 2020 to all Chief Vigilance Officers, the central agency expressed concern that despite clear guidelines issued by the CVC and the Department of Personnel & Training, investigators were not adhering to the prescribed time limit, resulting in investigations taking a much longer time. “Any delay in finalisation of such matters is neither in the interest of the organisation nor that of the employee concerned. Undue delay on one hand provided prolonged opportunities to a corrupt public servant to indulge in inappropriate activities. On the other hand, any unwarranted delay in the conclusion of vigilance related matters is detrimental for an honest public servant, who may have got involved in a vigilance case, due to various reasons,” Rajiv Verma, Officer on Special Duty, CVC, said in the circular. The official reminded the CVOs of the prescribed time-frame in issuing chargesheet and conducting departmental enquiry/submission of report by the Inquiry Officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cvc-presses-for-expeditious-disposal-of-vigilance-cases/article33604891.ece
19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||NBA seeks Republic TV’s ouster from IBF||The News Broadcasters Association (NBA) on Monday said the WhatsApp chats of Arnab Goswami were shocking. In a statement, the NBA said Republic TV be expelled from the Indian Broadcasting Foundation. The NBA Board called for Republic TV to be left out of the BARC rating system till the final court order in the matter. These WhatsApp messages not only reflect manipulation of ratings but is also about power play, it said. The messages exchanged go on to refer to the appointment of Secretaries, Cabinet reshuffle, access to the PMO (Prime Minister’s Office) and the workings of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. “This only confirms the many and continuous allegations made by NBA in the last four years that ratings were being manipulated by a non-NBA member broadcaster in connivance with BARC’s top management officials,” the statement said. ‘Lack of transparency’ “It is indeed with dismay that NBA notes the fact that in spite of having a damning verdict in its possession since July 2020, BARC sat on the forensic report for several months, which brought to light these manipulations. This is a glaring example of the systemic lack of transparency that has prevailed right since the inception of BARC,” it said. The NBA Board demanded that BARC make a statement about the veracity of its ratings for the period that is under audit, conduct an audit of Hindi news genre, expunge the data of Republic TV and re-state the rankings of all news channels.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nba-seeks-republic-tvs-ouster-from-ibf/article33605477.ece

19 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Kerala may roll out child-friendly exams||‘Child-friendly’ examinations are on the cards this year with the State government devising a new examination system in view of the COVID 19-induced changes in school academics, Minister for General Education C. Ravindranath said on Monday. Replying to questions in the Assembly, the Minister said students will have more options to choose from in the question papers. “The traditional way of testing students will not be followed this time. The emphasis will be on what the student knows rather than what the student does not know,” he said. According to the Minister, with a wider range of options in the question paper, the students can attempt questions that correspond to their aptitude and interests. “They can attempt as many questions as they can, but the maximum score will be as prescribed in the question paper,”' he said. The academic year will not be extended beyond March 31, he said. Digital classes The digital classes for Class X students have been completed, and that of Class XII will be over in two weeks. The focus areas for each chapter, on which the questions will be based, have been published. The government had announced in December that the SSLC and Plus Two higher secondary and vocational higher secondary examinations will be held from March 17 by observing COVID-19 protocols.  Academic year will not be extended beyond March 31||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kerala-may-roll-out-child-friendly-exams/article33605198.ece
19 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||School dropout rate falls to 0.11% in Kerala||While student admissions in State-run schools have shown an encouraging increase, the drop-out rate of students too has shrunk significantly compared to 2016-17, Minister for General Education C. Ravindranath informed the Legislative Assembly on Monday. The Minister, citing data presented in the Economic Review 2020, said the dropout rate has diminished to 0.11% in 2019-20 compared to 0.22% in 2016-17. According to the Economic Review, Kerala has achieved the distinction of having the lowest dropout rate of school students among the States. As per the MHRD report on Educational Statistics at a Glance, 2018, the all- India average dropout rate of primary students is 4.13 per cent while it is 4.03 per cent in upper primary and 17.06 per cent in the secondary levels, the Minister said quoting the Economic Review. In high school In Kerala, the dropout rate for the high school segment has declined from 0.33% in 2016-17 to 0.15% in 2019-2020. In the lower primary segment, it has dipped from 0.2% to 0.11% and in the upper primary classes, from 0.11% to 0.6%. In some districts, like Alappuzha, the dropout rate was as low as 0.02%, the Minister said. To a related question, the Minister reiterated that school admissions have witnessed a remarkable increase over the past five years. As many as 6.79 lakh students have been newly admitted in the public education system, he said. He credited this achievement to a policy that combined modernisation and a people-friendly approach.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/school-dropout-rate-falls-to-011-in-kerala/article33605197.ece
19 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Kannada organisations to chart out future action||Criticising Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray for his statements on Belagavi, Kannada organisations burnt his effigy at a protest in the city on Monday. A coalition of Kannada outfits will meet on Wednesday to chart out the next course of action. “We need to make this a people’s movement in Belagavi and our agitation will also begin from there,” Vatal Nagaraj, president, Kannada Okkoota, said. Shiv Sena’s role Condemning the Shiv Sena’s role in keeping the border dispute alive for “cheap politics”, Mr. Nagaraj said the dispute was settled long ago as per the Mahajan Committee report. “It was the Maharashtra government that insisted on the formation of the committee and said everyone must accept its report, which we have done. Maharashtra is unnecessarily raking up the issue,” he said. He also said that successive governments in Karnataka had failed to constructively develop Belagavi and create a groundswell of support for the State in the district. “While we built Suvarna Soudha, no departments have been moved to the district. More than that, the Karnataka government needs to get investment to Belagavi, start industries, and create jobs which will change the narrative in the district. But sadly, all parties have a keen eye on the Maratha vote and the incumbent BJP government has created a Maratha Development Corporation too,” Mr. Nagaraj lamented. History of region Meanwhile, T.A. Narayana Gowda, president, Karnataka Rakshana Vedike, said Mr. Thackeray would do better to know the history of the region. “Large parts of Maharashtra were Kannada speaking. Several Kannada inscriptions found in Maharashtra bore evidence to this,” he said, adding it was irresponsible of Mr. Thackeray to create tension among language communities. “Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala are progressive States, whose economies have been fuelling the country. However, they have been suffering from Hindi imposition and attack on federalism. While it is time when people and leaders from these States get united and fight for federalism, it is sad that Mr. Thackeray doesn’t have this sense,” Mr. Gowda said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kannada-organisations-to-chart-out-future-action/article33604838.ece
19 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||KIIFB borrowings bypass limits for State, says CAG||The off-Budget borrowings made by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) for critical infra projects have bypassed the limits set on government borrowings under Article 293 (1) of the Constitution and such borrowings do not have legislative approval, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India has opined. The off-Budget borrowings are “not in accordance with the Constitution.” The borrowings are not taken into the disclosure statements in the Budget documents or in the accounts, the CAG has noted in the State Finance Audit Report for the year ending March 2019 that was laid in the Legislative Assembly with Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac’s dissenting note on Monday. The KIIFB had borrowed and raised funds amounting to Rs. 3,106.57 crore from financial institutions till 2018-19 by issue of bonds which were to be repaid from the petroleum cess and motor vehicle tax.An amount of Rs. 2,150 crore raised through Masala Bonds in foreign countries is part of the Rs. 3,106.57 crore off-Budget borrowings. The KIIFB had incurred an expenditure of Rs. 1,5,11.67 crore for various infra projects till 2018-19. Liability of State “Since the KIIFB has no source of income, the borrowings by the KIIFB for which the State stood as guarantor, may ultimately turn out to be a direct liability of the State government,” the CAG has pointed out. Stating that such borrowings represent fiscal deficit of the State and should be treated as such, the CAG has said “Creating such liabilities, without disclosing them in the Budget raises questions both of transparency, and of inter-generational equity.” RBI nod questionable The approval given by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the KIIFB to issue Masala Bonds is also questionable as the nod has allowed the State to route its own borrowing through the KIIFB. If the mode was followed by other States, the CAG said, the external liabilities of the country would rise substantially without the Centre knowing of creating such liabilities. The CAG has said the State has to furnish to Centre all the financial statements showing the estimates of receipts and payments of all sources of borrowings, including Open Market borrowings, other liabilities arising out of Public Account transfers. Based on this, the 3% of the estimated GSDP has been fixed as the borrowing ceiling for Kerala. The maximum amount of borrowings is done from Masala bonds, which are external borrowings. Entry 37 of the List 1 of the Seventh schedule of the Constitution gives powers of raising foreign loans only to the Centre. The entire repayments of the KIIFB is being done through own revenue resources and hence State borrowings. “They appear to be in violation of the Constitution and encroachment on the powers of the Centre,” the CAG said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kiifb-borrowings-bypass-limits-for-state-says-cag/article33604847.ece

19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Covaxin not to be used in cases of allergy, fever||Bharat Biotech has now released a fact sheet detailing the possible adverse events. The clinical efficacy of COVAXIN was yet to be established and it was still being studied in phase 3 clinical trials. Hence, it was important to appreciate that receiving the vaccine did not mean that other precautions related to COVOD-19 need not be followed, it added. A Health Ministry order has said people currently can’t decide on which vaccine they will get. Getting vaccinated is voluntary. Health experts and the Indian Medical Association (IMA), advocating an aggressive awareness campaign, especially in the light of the 447 adverse events following immunisation that included three needing hospitalisation, said their “members have been told to reach out to population using public forums, media, social media etc to increase the awareness about the vaccine.” The IMA stated that all its members would now provide the right, scientific information to people across the country and promote the vaccine. “The IMA lost its 732 expert doctors during the past one year and now we have a vaccine. It stands with the government during this phase where healthcare and front line workers would be vaccinated,” said its hony. secretary general Dr. Jayesh Lele. More than COVID-19, rumours were proving harmful. “People are getting misled by these myths. Obviously, as the modern medicine professional body, it is our responsibility also to fight with the menace of the misinformation against COVID-19,” he added. The association, in a one-page statement, noted that vaccines were for building immunity in the human body. Senior Health Ministry officials said that providing vaccination was an organised drive that also included proper history taking and follow-up of those receiving the vaccination. “The hesitation if any will be addressed through the ongoing awareness campaign and correct information released by the Ministry,” said an official. As per information released by the Health Ministry, India’s daily COVID-19 fatalities dropped to 145 after nearly eight months, with 83% of the new deaths being reported from Maharashtra (50), Kerala (21), West Bengal (12) and Delhi (8) in the past 24 hours.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/covaxin-not-to-be-used-in-cases-of-allergy-fever/article33604855.ece
19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Only police should decide on tractor rally’||The government said the right to express dissent against the farm laws did not include a right to “malign the nation globally”. Mr. Venugopal said people were camping outside the city. There was a threat of illegal entry on January 26. The government was looking to the court to “strengthen its hands”. “Why do you want us to tell you how to use your powers. We are not the first authority in law and order issues. Authorities prohibit and then the court acts. It is not that the court prohibits and the authorities carry out,” the CJI said. He pointed to how the court had intervened in just “one matter” in the farmers’ protest case, and how it was misunderstood. The court, on January 12, stayed the implementation of the farm laws and formed an expert committee to negotiate between farmers and the government. Mr. Mehta said there was also an issue of constitutional dignity at stake in this case. “Where is the constitutional issue in this case,” the CJI enquired. The SG urged the court to list the case on Wednesday, to which the Bench agreed. Advocate A.P. Singh, appearing for a farmers’ union, said protesters should be given access to the Ramlila Maidan to continue with their peaceful demonstration. The union has also sought a change in the constitution of the expert committee after one of its four members, Bhupinder Singh Mann, recused himself from it. The government application had said, “It has come to the knowledge of the security agencies through various sources that a small group of protesting individuals/organisations have planned to carry out a tractor/trolley/vehicle march on Republic Day. The proposed march is slated to disturb and disrupt the august celebrations of the nation on Republic Day and would be bound to create a massive law and order situation”. On January 12, Mr. Venugopal stated that there was no question of a huge group of people entering the city on Republic Day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/only-police-should-decide-on-tractor-rally/article33604856.ece

This comes ahead of the tenth round of talks between the protesting unions and Central Ministers. “The three of us will hold our first meeting tomorrow [Tuesday] afternoon, probably at the Pusa campus [of the National Agricultural Science Complex]. We will hold the first meeting with farmers’ groups on January 21,” said Shetkari Sanghatan president Anil Ghanwat. The unions protesting on the borders of Delhi for almost two months have refused to meet with the committee, but Mr. Ghanwat who heads a pro-reforms union, is unfazed. “There are hundreds and thousands of farmers and farmers’ groups who are in favour of the laws and who are willing to meet with us. We will listen to them first,” he said. “We will keep on urging all farmers’ groups to talk to us as the Supreme Court has directed it. We are here to listen to everyone,” he added. In the parallel process of direct dialogue between the Centre and the unions, both sides have reiterated their positions. “The farm reforms will raise the standard of living for farmers...These laws were expected earlier but the earlier government could not proceed under pressure. Prime Minister Narendra Modi boldly took these steps,” said Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar, addressing a conference on the reforms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farmers-stay-with-plan-ministry-put-off-meet/article33604857.ece
19 January 2021||PATHANAMTHITTA,||Home delivery of offerings to continue||Buoyed by the response to home delivery of offerings at the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple through speed post, the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) has decided to continue with the scheme even after the conclusion of the annual pilgrimage season. According to V.S. Rajendraprasad, TDB Executive Officer at Sabarimala, the board will continue to receive orders when the temple opens for five days every month. It has so far delivered 43,902 packets under the scheme and received Rs. 1.97 crore and of this, Rs. 87.80 lakh will go to the Department of Posts. In view of the temple remaining out of bounds for lakhs of devotees due to the pandemic situation, the TDB entered into an agreement with the Department of Posts at the beginning of the ongoing pilgrimage season. The scheme envisages acceptance of bookings at any post office across the country and delivery of a kit containing ‘aravana’, ghee and other offerings for Rs. 450. The bookings received from different locations are processed at the post office in Pampa-Triveni, which, in turn, will be sending orders to the TDB office via e-mail. As per estimates, the Postal Department receives Rs. 200 as parcel and transportation charges for the delivery of each packet. Besides the delivery through post, the board has also delivered 2.26 lakh tins of ‘aravana’ worth Rs. 5.37 crore through its counters at Sabarimala during the season.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/home-delivery-of-offerings-to-continue/article33605196.ece
19 January 2021||Belagavi,||Resolve issues in the party locally: Shah||Before winding up his two-day State visit, BJP’s key strategist and Union Home Minister Amit Shah conveyed a message to the faction-ridden State unit of the party on Sunday: “Don’t bring all issues to Delhi”. “Issues within the party should be resolved locally. Village issues should be resolved at village levels, district issues at district level, and State issues at State level. There is no need to bring every issue to Delhi. You should develop a method of decentralised decision making,” Mr. Shah said at a meeting of party leaders held in Belagavi after his public rally. This was part of his response to concerns raised by Abhay Patil, MLA, and other leaders that dedicated workers who had worked for the party for decades were not getting their due. Mr. Shah dismissed this, saying such issues needed to be discussed at the State-level forums headed by party president Nalin Kumar Kateel or a the State-level core committee, party sources said. Govind Karjol, Deputy Chief Minister, confirmed that Mr. Shah had asked leaders to resolve local issues at that level. Farm laws Two MLAs said at the meeting that they needed help to understand the farm laws better, according to sources. “There is so much of talk in mainstream and social media about the alleged ill-effects of farm laws that we don’t know if they are in favour of farmers or against their interests,” the leaders said. They suggested that the party give them material or provide training to understand the implications of the laws. Mr. Shah maintained that the laws were very much in favour of the farmers and that the confusion was being created by vested interests. Some people are misleading farmers. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appealed to them not to be misled. But, the protesting farmers are not listening to us. They are putting their fingers in their ears,” Mr. Shah said. ‘Willing to listen’ Iranna Kadadi, Rajya Sabha member, who attended the meeting, said that Mr. Shah told the legislators that the party was willing to listen to the agitating farmers. If they have genuine concerns and if they can be addressed by changing some provisions, then the government is willing to amend them.

A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar issued notice on a petition filed by Parthsarthi Mahesh Saraf, represented by advocate V.K. Biju, who argued that AIBE was being conducted without following the law. Mr. Biju submitted that the All-India Bar Examination Rules of 2010 issued by BCI was compelling people to take the All-India Bar Examination even after enrolment as an advocate. The petition sought a stay on the conduct of the AIBE. Mr. Biju argued that by conducting the AIBE on January 24 and March 21, the BCI was “illegally and arbitrarily compelling” law graduates to undergo another exam to qualify to practise law, thus restricting their fundamental right to a profession, enshrined under the Constitution. The court also issued notice to the BCI on a separate application to stay the conduct of the AIBE.

A three-judge Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan adjourned the case to February 17. The State government had pressed for the dismissal of the petitions seeking CBI probe into the incident, calling it an attempt to derive “political capital”. An affidavit by the Maharashtra government had informed the court that a specialised unit of the State CID was probing the case since April 20, 2020. Maharashtra had said the case was transferred to the State CID unit considering the need for fairness, transparency in investigation and the large number of accused involved.  ‘Dereliction of duty’ In an earlier hearing, the State had informed the Supreme Court that 18 police officers were punished for negligence and dereliction of duty for their inability to prevent the lynching. A short affidavit filed by the police said a departmental inquiry prima facie found that they did not act in time to prevent the incident. The punishment of the 18 officers had ranged from dismissal to reverting to minimal pay for a specific number of years and even compulsory retirement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/palghar-probe-complete-says-maharashtra/article33604888.ece

19 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Voters with disabilities to get aid online ahead of elections||Chennai District Election Office will launch a system for facilitating electoral assistance through social media for persons with disabilities and senior citizens. As many as 7,200 electors with disabilities have been identified in the 16 constituencies within the Greater Chennai Corporation limits for receiving assistance. The number of persons with disabilities has increased by around 100% on the electoral rolls this year compared to the previous election. After the launch of the system this week, civic officials will offer assistance at the doorstep based on information received through social media for persons with disabilities on all aspects of electoral issues ahead of Assembly elections. For instance, the Corporation is planning to release a WhatsApp number this week for persons with disabilities to get all kinds of assistance ahead of elections. “Any person with disabilities will get assistance from civic officials without visiting the Corporation office. They are requested to just send a message on WhatsApp about the difficulty relating to electoral issues,” said an official. As senior citizens aged above 80 and all persons with disabilities were expected to get postal ballot facilities this Assembly election, Chennai District Election Office has planned to create awareness about the need for inclusion of all persons with disabilities on the rolls. Ethical voting The civic body has started a campaign in colleges to promote ethical voting and increase participation of first-time voters and their family members in elections. The Corporation will conduct online participation of electoral network in colleges, covering at least 10,000 students ahead of elections. Disabilities rights activist T.M.N. Deepak said the number of persons with disabilities is estimated at 50,000 in the 16 Assembly constituencies of Chennai. “There can be a large gap in accessing the facilities to be provided to persons with disabilities as the bracket of disability under RPWD Act is 21. Identity card has not been issued to much deserving people as they have not been certified yet. “The rule amended on conduct of election rules mandates that any special concession for voting would be given only to those electors which flags as PWD in the drawn list. Also, the disabled electors are not aware of whom to contact or where to contact for availing themselves of help.

19 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||T.N.’s tax revenue up 11.4% in Nov. 2020||Tamil Nadu’s Own Tax Revenue increased 11.4% to Rs. 9,526.38 crore in November 2020 from Rs. 8,549.43 crore in the same period of 2019, according to the provisional figures from the Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG). In a sign of recovery, the State has posted a double digit growth for the second straight month in its own tax revenue. In October 2020, the State’s Own Tax Revenue (SOTR) increased about 18.8% to Rs. 9,475.16 crore from Rs. 7,976.53 in the comparable period last year. 70% of the total The SOTR comes from stamp duty and registration, value-added tax on petrol and diesel, excise duty on liquor, motor vehicle tax and States Goods and Services Tax. The SOTR accounts for 70% of Tamil Nadu’s total revenue. Amid the intense lockdown to curb COVID-19, the SOTR declined 74.29% in April and 67% in May 2020, compared with last year. In June, the SOTR dropped 8.9% and recovered in July with a positive growth of 8%. In August again, the SOTR declined 21.44% and then posted a 7% growth in September. The growth in November 2020 was led by State excise duties (which reflect liquor revenues). They increased 31.3% to Rs. 750.78 crore, compared with Rs. 571.97 crore in November 2019. The taxes on sales and trade, another component of the SOTR, increased 16.3% to Rs. 4,334.69 crore in November 2020 from Rs. 3,728.48 crore in the same period last year. The growth in this component also reflects a rebound in petrol and diesel demand. The revenue from stamps and registration fees increased 10.7% to Rs. 1,091.32 crore in November 2020 from Rs. 986.21 crore in the same period of 2019. The State Goods and Services Tax grew 2.7% to Rs. 3,326.92 crore in November 2020 from Rs. 3,240.79 crore, while land revenue increased 3.1% to Rs. 22.67 crore from Rs. 21.98 crore. Real challenge While the SOTR is showing signs of recovery, the real challenge is from the increasing expenditure to tackle COVID-19. Until November in the fiscal year 2020-21, the total expenditure stood at Rs. 1,39,879.55 crore, while the total receipts stood at Rs. 1,02,630.52 crore. This results in a fiscal deficit (the difference between total revenue and expenditure, excluding borrowings) of about Rs. 37,249.04 crore. Revenue deficit stood at Rs. 28,767.35 crore as of November. Revenue deficit is the difference between the government’s revenue receipts and revenue expenditure and shows that the government’s earnings are not adequate to meet its daily expenses. Tamil Nadu has so far borrowed Rs. 67,000 crore from the market in 2020-21, up 30% from Rs. 51,390 crore in the same period last year.  The revenue increased to Rs. 9,526.38 crore in November 2020 from Rs. 8,549.43 crore in the same period of 2019||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadus-tax-revenue-up-114-in-november-2020/article33605040.ece
19 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Cholavaram lake bund set to be strengthened to prevent seepage||The Water Resources Department (WRD) has proposed improvements to the Cholavaram lake bund under the Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP). After many years, Cholavaram lake, one of the five sources of city’s drinking water supply for the city, was filled to 81.50% of its capacity of 1,081 million cubic feet as on Saturday. The lake was almost dry with a mere 72 mcft storage on the corresponding date last year. In a bid to arrest seepage, the department has submitted a proposal to take up renovation work. Built during the British rule prior to 1877, the lake gets inflow from its catchment areas and the Poondi reservoir. The department has proposed to strengthen a 150-metre portion of the lake’s main bund, which has weakened over the years. Details about soil tests have been submitted to the State government. As the project would be taken up under the DRIP, the details would be shared with the Central Water Commission for technical remedy, said the officials. Moreover, additional concrete walls have been proposed as part of the renovation of the dam which was built with laterite stones. This would stabilise the structure and prevent seepage. “We have deployed staff to monitor the lake round the clock. One of the inlet channels bringing water from catchment areas upstream will be improved. We expect the work to be completed by this year-end,” said an official. Comfortable storage Chennai is being supplied with 830.48 million litres of water a day (mld). Of this, nearly 652 mld is being provided through pipelines. According to Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB), about 550 mld of water is being drawn from the reservoirs in Tiruvallur district. Officials said the Poondi reservoir continues to get about 630 cusecs (cubic feet per second) of the Krishna water from Andhra Pradesh. “We are diverting water from Poondi to Red Hills reservoir. This would help maintain the same water storage at Red Hills lake,” the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cholavaram-lake-bund-set-to-be-strengthened-to-prevent-seepage/article33605435.ece
19 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Three drown in stone quarry||Three persons, who went for a swim, drowned in an abandoned stone quarry filled with rainwater near Pulipakkam of Chengalpattu district on Sunday noon. They were part of a group of six persons from Chennai which had visited a relative’s house at Kandhalur village near Pulipakkam to spend Pongal holidays. A senior police official said J. Tameem Ansari, who worked in an information technology company, his cousin Dilshad and Dilshad’s daughter Yasmin along with her two friends Sameetha and Angela from Washermenpet, had gone to their relative’s place at Kandhalur. The village had a number of abandoned stone quarries, which were filled with rainwater. On Sunday afternoon, Ansari, Sameetha and Angela, went for a swim in a stone quarry. When they did not return till evening, their relatives filed a complaint at the Chengalpattu taluk police station. Meanwhile, some villagers alerted the police on Monday morning about three bodies floating in the quarry. The police, who rushed to the spot, took out the bodies of Ansari, Sameetha and Angela and sent them to the Chengalpattu Government Hospital for post-mortem. The police official said Sameetha and Angela were studying in Class 12, along with Yasmin, in a private school in Royapettah.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/three-drown-in-stone-quarry/article33605437.ece
19 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Survey finds easy availability of tobacco products during lockdown||The effect of last year’s COVID-19 lockdown was felt in many ways, but it had little or no impact on the availability of tobacco products. A survey among tobacco users found that nearly 60% reported easy availability of tobacco products during the lockdown. But the researchers also found an encouraging trend: nearly two-thirds of tobacco users reported a reduction in tobacco use and an intention to quit. To assess tobacco use, accessibility of tobacco products and quitting behaviour during the lockdown, the Tobacco Cessation Clinic (TCC) of the Cancer Institute (WIA) took up a cross-sectional assessment among current tobacco users in Tamil Nadu. The researchers carried out a telephone survey using a structured questionnaire during April-May 2020 to understand the effect of the lockdown on tobacco use and quitting behaviour. The results of the study — Tobacco use and quitting behaviour during COVID-19 lockdown — were recently published in the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases . V. Surendran, associate professor and head of the Psycho-Oncology and Resource Centre for Tobacco Control, Cancer Institute, said the primary objective was to assess the access to tobacco and the change in behaviour among tobacco users during the complete lockdown in the State. The study population included those aged more than 15, enrolled with the TCC from January 2018 to December 2019. Of the 1,501 tobacco users who attended the TCC, 991 were cancer patients and excluded from the study. Of the remaining 510, 281 were contacted by phone and 251 consented to the interview. The remaining could not be contacted for reasons, including phone number not being recorded, no response and incorrect number. A total of 101 were current tobacco users. More than half of them — 56% — reported easy availability of tobacco products. Nearly two-thirds purchased tobacco products daily from shops during the lockdown. While 27% had stocks of tobacco, the remaining 6% obtained tobacco from peers, according to the study. Violation of lockdown This easy availability of tobacco products pointed to the gross violations of lockdown regulations in the face of a strict ban on the sale of tobacco products in the city, the researchers said. A total of 65 tobacco users reported a reduction in tobacco use and the use remained the same in 20 and increased in 16. Nearly two-thirds of the tobacco users reported an intention to quit during the lockdown. Of them, 6% sought help/consultations and 38% made an attempt to quit. Only 15% had the urge to increase tobacco use. COVID-19 risk Talking about the reduction in tobacco use and the intention to quit, the researchers cited a recent study that showed a third of the smokers were motivated to quit because of the higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and greater social support to quit. They also addressed the issue of tobacco users making an unsuccessful attempt to quit as very few of them could get help or consultations, probably owing to the lack of cessation services during the lockdown. While the findings are leading the TCC team members to develop an exclusive tobacco cessation application, they also call for efforts from the government to promote and strengthen support services for tobacco cessation and implementation of vendor-licensing for tobacco sale. “The mobile application is to assist persons in quitting tobacco. It will have features to measure the addiction level, provide guidance to quit, automatic reminders for interventional measures. If the person falls back and needs to consult, the app will assist in connecting them to us,” Dr. Surendran said. The State government, while focussing on tobacco control, should encourage cessation services because such services were not available now, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/survey-finds-easy-availability-of-tobacco-products-during-lockdown/article33605673.ece
19 January 2021||Chennai,TAMIL NADU||‘People’s anger against the AIADMK government is palpable’||DMK president M.K. Stalin , who is leading his party in an Assembly election for the first time, is confident of a sweep and forming the next government in Tamil Nadu this summer. In an interview,  he accuses the AIADMK government of doing little during the COVID-19 pandemic, while he takes credit for the positive developments in Tamil Nadu. Edited excerpts:  You have asserted that the DMK alliance would win in 200 seats, and the AIADMK would not qualify to become the Opposition party. What is the basis for your confidence? First I said we would win 200 seats. Now the prospects have increased for us in all the 234 constituencies. I am able to predict it from the active and voluntary participation of men and women at the makkal gram sabhas organised by DMK front-line leaders and the manifestation of anger and hatred against the AIADMK government. Tamil Nadu is lagging behind in development on all fronts. The State could not attract any new investment after Edappadi K. Palaniswami became the Chief Minister. No new jobs have been created. Fiscal management has encountered an unprecedented setback, and the State is wobbling under the weight of the Rs. 5-lakh-crore debt. The administration is rampant with the corruption of Ministers. They have continuously borrowed and swindled the amount. Even the Chief Minister was subjected to a CBI inquiry. He is continuing in the post because of the Supreme Court’s stay [on the inquiry] and not on moral grounds. It is a government that has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) only on paper. It has not done anything to attract investment to boost the State’s financial health. In the last 10 years, it has not been able to launch a power project and it is going to demit office without increasing electricity production by a single unit. Since survival is a day-to-day battle for the government, the Chief Minister is not able to guide the administration. He is not able to protect the rights of the State and challenge the threat to Tamil culture. Economic development has become a mirage. Farmers, workers, government employees, traders, students and all sections have been affected because the Chief Minister lacks administrative capabilities. People are ready to give a send-off to the AIADMK government and I could see it at the makkal gram sabhas. The DMK, which is steeped in democratic values, does not want an Assembly without opposition. But the people’s anger convinced me to say that the AIADMK cannot secure the status of Opposition party. People have realised that Tamil Nadu is in the hands of a man who does not deserve the position. The anger will rout not only the government but also the AIADMK. People see the AIADMK as a ship without a captain and the Ministers as pirates. This election is considered very important for the DMK since it is out of power for 10 years. What is your strategy? Whether in power or not, the DMK has always treated people as the leader, and the party is an integral part of people’s lives. It has secured a place in people’s hearts by highlighting their problems, offering solutions and speaking up for the State’s rights. As the Leader of the Opposition, I have fought in the Assembly and public forums. The DMK’s continuous actions have resulted in the creation of the Cauvery Management Board, the Cauvery Draft Scheme and 7.5% horizontal reservation in medical admission for NEET-qualified government school students. It has fought against the Salem-Chennai Expressway and hydrocarbon projects and denial of the Tamil option in the Postal Department examinations. The fight against COVID-19 succeeded in the State because of the DMK’s Ontrinaivom Vaa programme, which reached crores of people. People think if Tamil Nadu’s rights are safeguarded to an extent, it is because of the DMK. People’s support is the principal strategy. You will see other strategies once elections are announced. What have been the expectations of the people attending the Makkal Gram Sabhas? The problems raised by the people are the proof that the AIADMK government is non-functional in the last 10 years. People say with anger that the government has failed to fulfil its promises and solve even basic problems. The Chief Minister and the Ministers have not used the government to serve the people. They are self-serving, promoting the development of ‘benamis’ and relatives and have turned the clock back by 50 years in the State. The Makkal Gram Sabhas echo the people’s hope that only the DMK can offer a non-corrupt, transparent and democratic government. The Chief Minister has not resolved the problems of his constituency and fulfilled his promises. The Ministers, too, have kept their constituencies in a similar manner. If it happens to these constituencies, one can understand the condition of the other constituencies. In 2011, the AIADMK was voted to power because of its electoral performance in the western region. The Chief Minister is from the region. Would the DMK make inroads in the west? The western districts have borne the brunt of the AIADMK rule. Thousands of medium and small industries have been severely affected. Coimbatore, the Manchester of Tamil Nadu, is lagging in all fields. While the Chief Minister and the Ministers from the region have benefited, people have been left in the lurch. Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani has swindled the Coimbatore Municipal Corporation. The Ministers have not brought in any constructive scheme. There is no specific plan to develop the economy. People have not forgotten the sexual assault on young women in Pollachi and the government’s attempt to save the culprits since they belonged to the ruling party. The argument that the AIADMK is strong in the west was disproved in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. It lost every seat by lakhs of votes. People in the region will vote taking into consideration the welfare of Tamil Nadu. When the DMK was in power it had worked for the development of Tamil Nadu and paved the way for the growth of big, medium and small industries in the western region. That was why the people there handed the DMK a landslide victory in the Lok Sabha election. The trend will continue in the Assembly election too. You laid down conditions for a debate on corruption with the Chief Minister. But he says you are finding excuses to avoid it... We have submitted to the Governor a memorandum of corruption charges, with evidence, against the Chief Minister and other Ministers. The Ministers have not denied it. The Chief Minister and the Ministers, who file defamation suits against me over every issue, have not done that this time. World Bank rules have been violated in the tenders awarded to the in-laws of the Chief Minister’s [son]. The High Court ordered a CBI inquiry into it. The Chief Minister, who obtained a stay on the order, alone can withdraw it. He alone can grant sanction for cases against Ministers and recommend action to the Governor. That is why I said I would be ready for a debate if the Chief Minister does that and recommends to the Governor for action in the disproportionate wealth case against him. But he does not have the courage to get the stay vacated. He is afraid that the debate would expose his corrupt practices. That is why he is finding excuses. I am ready to debate. There is an opinion that the AIADMK government does not face any strong anti-establishment wave even if there is no surge in its favour. It has succeeded in containing the COVID-19 spread. Your view? This is a false narrative constructed by reactionary and anti-DMK forces that cannot stomach the growing support for us. The State is gripped by a tsunami-like wave against the AIADMK, ten-fold higher than what swept the State in 1991-96. That is why I say the AIADMK cannot even qualify for the status of being an Opposition party. This is echoed by the cry, “When will the government come to an end.” Who is saying Mr. Palaniswami has controlled COVID-19? He said in the Assembly that even one person would not be allowed to die because of the virus. But so far 13,000 people have died and eight lakh have been infected. In the first three months, he had no understanding of the virus. He appropriated money citing the cases. People know all those shameful activities. The irregularities in the purchase of equipment for testing became a laughing stock at the Delhi High Court. [It had capped the price of a testing kit at Rs. 400.] There was a delay in announcing the lockdown. When the DMK MLAs demanded it, they were ridiculed. The scam in the purchase of life-saving medicines also became a laughing matter. No Chief Minister in the country committed errors like him when it came to the closure of the Koyambedu [wholesale vegetable] market and TASMAC liquor shops and schools, and the award of marks for students who had arrears. The DMK launched a campaign to feed one crore people and offer medical facilities. COVID-19 exposed Mr. Palaniswami as a hopeless Chief Minister, who has no concern for the people. The election results will reflect this. ( Concluding part of the interview on the DMK’s alliance strategy will be published on Wednesday. )  The State could not attract any new investment after Edappadi K. Palaniswami became the Chief Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/peoples-anger-against-the-aiadmk-government-is-palpable/article33604990.ece
19 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||No abrupt fiscal correction should be attempted: OPS||The Finance Ministry should not attempt any abrupt fiscal correction during 2021-22 and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman must consider the issue of continuation of compensation mechanism of GST and devolving further taxation powers of States, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam said on Monday. At a pre-Union Budget videoconference meeting with Ms. Sitharaman, Mr. Panneerselvam, who holds the Finance portfolio, said while early signs of economic revival are apparent following the COVID-19 disruption, the finances of the State governments will take more time to recover. Hence, no abrupt fiscal correction should be attempted in the coming year. “The transition back to fiscal targets should be a gradual glide path over two to three years. Borrowing of up to 5% of GDP should be permitted to all State governments in 2021-22 as well to enable States to sustain expenditure on capital works and on COVID-19 prevention measures,” he said in his speech, a copy of which was circulated to the media. States joined the GST reform on the assurance that the reforms would be revenue-neutral in the long run. They gave up their autonomy on their main source of revenue based on this understanding. Tepid revenue growth “The expectations of revenue growth with the implementation of GST have been belied. The reasons for this tepid revenue growth have to be analysed in detail. The State governments will need to have their revenues protected, particularly in these difficult times,” Mr. Panneerselvam said. The GST Council must discuss the continuation of the compensation mechanism and devolving of further taxation powers on States. The Finance Minister must address this issue with urgency and ensure that the interests of States are not affected. Cess and surcharges He added that the levy of various cess and surcharges by the Centre deprive the States of their legitimate share of Centre’s tax revenue. Collections by way of such cess and surcharges have increased substantially in recent years. “All such cess and surcharges should be merged into the basic rate of tax so that the States also receive their due share from the additional revenue”, Mr. Panneerselvam said. He requested Ms. Sitharaman to set right the anomaly in the manner in which the local body grants are being provided as envisaged in the first report of the 15th Finance Commission and ensure that no further conditions are imposed by the Centre for release of the grants. Tamil Nadu was yet to receive the grants of Rs. 2,577. 98 crore recommended by the 14th Finance Commission. Plea for projects He sought the implementation of several critical projects including the Peninsular River link project to transfer water from the Godavari and Mahanadhi to the Cauvery, Central funding for the Cauvery-Gundar project and approval for the Nadanthai Vazhi Cauvery project, among others. Mr. Panneerselvam also requested her to extend the period under the Tax Loss Carry Forward (TLCV) scheme by at least five years from the current 8 years as it would enhance India’s competitiveness in attracting and retaining foreign investments. He also raised other demands with regard to industry, infrastructure, and agriculture.  Borrowing of up to 5% of GDP should be permitted to all State governments in 2021-22 as well to enable States to sustain expenditure on capital works and on COVID-19 prevention measures||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-abrupt-fiscal-correction-should-be-attempted-during-2021-22-ops/article33605001.ece
19 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Don’t give criminal colour to pleas by domestic violence victims: HC||Making it clear that the nature of rights protected under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act of 2005 were purely civil in nature, the Madras High Court on Monday ordered that a criminal colour should not be given to those proceedings just because the applications were dealt with by judicial magistrates. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh directed the magistrates to ensure that applications filed by victims or others, under Section 12 of the Act, seeking protection order, residence order, monetary relief, custody order or compensation order must not be treated akin to complaints lodged under the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr. PC). He ordered that the respondents mentioned in the applications should not be treated like accused and issued with summons requiring their personal appearance. Instead, only notices should be issued and personal appearance should not be insisted upon ordinarily if the respondents were effectively represented through a counsel. Personal appearance “In all cases, the personal appearance of relatives and other third parties to a domestic relationship shall be insisted only upon compelling reasons being shown,” the judge said. He gave liberty to the magistrates to determine the applications ex-parte if the respondents did not appear either in person or through a counsel in answer to the court notices. Justice Venkatesh clarified that it was not mandatory for the magistrates to issue notices to every other respondent mentioned in an application. There should be some application of mind on the part of the magistrates in deciding the respondents to whom notices should be issued after setting out reasons that impelled them to issue such notices. “To a large extent, this would curtail the pernicious practice of roping in all and sundry into the proceedings before the magistrate,” the judge said. He added that magistrates could alter, modify or revoke their orders at the instance of the respondents if the latter were able to convince the judicial officers that such modifications were necessary in the interest of justice. Tracing the history of the 2005 law, the judge pointed out that the object behind it was to bridge the gaps between the then existing procedures in civil and criminal law by providing a civil remedy for a victim of domestic violence to obtain relief such as protection or residence orders without disrupting the harmony in the family. Only a breach of a protection order would make the act a criminal offence. However, since magistrates had begun to follow criminal procedures right at the stage of applications made under Section 12, such applications did not get disposed of within the statutory time limit of 60 days because the respondents approach High Court and obtain stay, the judge lamented.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dont-give-criminal-colour-to-pleas-by-domestic-violence-victims-hc/article33605447.ece
19 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Palaniswami calls on Amit Shah in Delhi||Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami called on Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on Monday to invite him for the inauguration of a couple of key infrastructure projects, including extension of Metro Rail Phase-I (Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar). On Tuesday morning, the Chief Minister will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr. Palaniswami, who was accompanied by Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar, requested Mr. Shah to inaugurate the 9-km stretch between the two important places of north Chennai, constructed at a cost of Rs. 3,770 crore, and the IOC’s Thoothukudi gas pipeline project (Rs. 800 crore). Foundation laying The Chief Minister said there were a few more projects, which were ready for laying of foundation stones. Among them were the Cauvery-Gundar rivers link, costing Rs. 14,400 crore; Grand Anicut extension, renovation and modernisation, at a cost of Rs. 2,640 crore, and modernisation of lower Bhavani project system at a cost of Rs. 934 crore. The total cost of the five projects was Rs. 22,544 crore, according to sources in the government. The meeting between Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Shah lasted around 45 minutes. The Chief Minister and the Home Minister were closeted for nearly half an hour. This is the first meeting between the two after Mr. Shah’s visit to Chennai last November.  Alliance At an official event then, Mr. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam had confirmed that the AIADMK’s alliance with the BJP would continue for the 2021 Assembly election. On January 9, the AIADMK, at its general council, had again ratified Mr. Paneerselvam’s declaration of Mr. Palaniswami as its Chief Ministerial candidate. The BJP, which had earlier given the impression of being the deciding authority in announcing the Chief Ministerial candidate for the alliance, relaxed its stand last week, when its national general secretary and prabhari (in-charge) for Tamil Nadu, C.T. Ravi, said the AIADMK, being the dominant constituent of the coalition, would choose the candidate. Sources added that the Chief Minster and the Deputy Chief Minister were expected to declare open the renovated mausoleum for former Chief Minster Jayalalithaa, on the Marina, on January 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/palaniswami-calls-on-amit-shah-in-delhi/article33605455.ece
19 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Unease in T.N. Congress unit||DMK leader S. Jagathrakshakan’s announcement that the DMK would lead an alliance in Puducherry, where the Congress is in power, has caused unease among the party’s Tamil Nadu unit. Congress leaders hoped its ties with the Congress in Tamil Nadu would remain intact, and that party leader Rahul Gandhi’s scheduled visits would only help strengthen the alliance. Many Congress leaders The Hindu spoke to on Monday remained hopeful that the DMK would not ruffle the feathers in the Secular Progressive Alliance in Tamil Nadu. They said the Puducherry issue was different and acknowledged there were problems in the alliance in the Union Territory. “It is a different issue, there are local issues going on. There is no issue in Tamil Nadu. We will discuss this with our leadership and the DMK leaders and see what to do,” said Dinesh Gundu Rao, AICC in-charge for Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. Except Mr. Rao, none of the other leaders were willing to go on record. TNCC president K.S. Alagiri refused to comment on the issue. ‘DMK benefits’ “If you look at it, there is no big benefit for us in this election. The benefits are going to go to the DMK, if the alliance is intact. All parties in the alliance are bringing their strengths to see that the DMK gets to power,” a senior TNCC leader said. When asked if the Congress had a ‘plan B’, in case the DMK decided to sever its ties with the national party, an AICC leader said they had not been thinking in those terms, and it was unlikely that such a situation would even arise. Most leaders expressed hope that Mr. Gandhi’s visits would enable the alliance to move out of any probable trouble that might arise out of the DMK trying to assert its supremacy in the neighbouring Union Territory. Mr. Gandhi is scheduled to visit the western belt on January 23, 24 and 25, and there are three more visits planned to Tamil Nadu, ahead of the election. One visit is likely to be made before the election is announced. “We have already shared some plans of Mr. Gandhi’s visit with DMK president M.K. Stalin. They are likely to campaign together at some point. So this development in Puducherry will not affect the Tamil Nadu alliance,” another leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/unease-in-tn-congress-unit/article33604991.ece
19 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||22 districts record under 10 cases each||Tamil Nadu recorded 551 more cases of COVID-19 on Monday, even as 22 of the 37 districts clocked in cases only in single digits. Perambalur, for the third day in a row, saw no new infection. The fresh cases — including among three returnees from West Bengal (2) and Andhra Pradesh (1) — took the State’s tally to 8,31,323. Eight more persons, including a 103-year-old man from Coimbatore, succumbed to the infection. The centenarian, who tested positive for COVID-19 on January 5, was admitted to the Coimbatore Medical College and ESI Hospital on January 6. He died on January 16 due to COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and renal failure. Till date, a total of 12,272 persons have died in the State. The number of active cases stood at 5,725, the most being in Chennai (1,939), followed by Coimbatore (595) and Chengalpattu (351). As many as 758 persons were discharged, including 180 in Chennai, 81 in Coimbatore and 50 in Chengalpattu, taking the total figure to 8,13,326.

19 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||On Day 3, T.N. vaccinates 10,256 persons||On the third day of the COVID-19 immunisation programme on Monday, 10,256 persons were administered the vaccines, across Tamil Nadu. Till date, the vaccines have been administered to 16,462 healthcare workers. The day’s coverage was more than thrice the number of persons vaccinated on the first and second day. On the first day of the vaccine rollout, 3,126 persons (3,027 received Covishield doses and 99 Covaxin) were covered, while a total of 3,080 (2,897 received Covishield doses and 183 Covaxin) were covered on the second. Of the day’s capacity to vaccinate 17,100 persons with doses of Covishield, 10,051 were covered, while 205 of the planned 600 received Covaxin. With this, Covishield has been administered to 15,975 persons and Covaxin to 487. A total of 177 sessions have been held in the State. District-wise coverage Some districts vaccinated a higher number of persons than the day’s capacity, according to data released by the Health Department. A total of 460 persons were immunised in The Nilgiris, as against its capacity of 300, while 436 were covered over the day’s capacity of 400 in Tiruppur. Similarly, in Namakkal, 350 persons were administered the vaccine, while the day’s capacity was 300. Vaccines were administered to 481 persons in Coimbatore.

In Chennai, 801 persons of the planned 1,300 were vaccinated — 745 received Covishield and 56 Covaxin. The coverage was low in districts such as Thoothukudi, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam. “It was anticipated that vaccination will pick up once Pongal holidays are over. Tamil Nadu has a strong public health cadre and dedicated health professionals across directorates. The Health Department, from the beginning, has maintained that it is not a target-oriented programme but a demand-driven one, even among the prioritised group,” Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said. He added that the sites can also be increased or decreased, and even moved, depending on the numbers and demand, in consultation with the Government of India. “A calibrated, cautious and steady approach, with a focus on ensuring no or minimal adverse events is more important. The picking up of numbers is very encouraging,” he said. A number of vaccine sites in government hospitals have started receiving inquiries from doctors in private hospitals. At the Government Royapettah Hospital, 13 doctors from private hospitals were vaccinated on Monday. “We have had a few staff of the 108 ambulance network and some of our housekeeping staff getting vaccinated,” said Anand Prathap, resident medical officer, who was administered the vaccine on Monday. At the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, 100 persons received Covishield on the third day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/on-day-3-tn-vaccinates-10256-persons/article33604999.ece

(CMRL) has used building information modelling (BIM) to develop 3D images of the project before commencing the construction work. According to CMRL officials, Rudrabhishek Enterprises Ltd. has been given the BIM contract. A first for CMRL “The contractor will build a 3D model of all stations, tunnels and viaducts. This will help us avoid any design issue. From the location of a cable to signage inside the stations, these images will display everything. This is the first time we are using three-dimensional modelling and want to prevent all issues that came up in the phase I and phase I extension project,” an official said. Mayapada Kapri, senior manager with Rudrabhishek Enterprises Ltd., said the idea behind the modelling was to know if an underground or elevated station could be built on a site. CMRL officials said issues like inadequate signage, infringement of structures and leaks during monsoon cropped up in the phase I project. They hope to avoid these in the new project. The foundation stone has been laid for the phase II project estimated to cost Rs. 61,843 crore which will be built along three corridors — Madhavaram to SIPCOT, Light House to Poonamallee and Madhavaram to Shollinganallur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cmrl-opts-for-3d-modelling-before-taking-up-phase-ii-work/article33605441.ece

The Osaka-headquartered company has picked up a 30-acre space (1,21,406 sqm) and a deal regarding this was inked on January 15, 2021. This will be Daicel Corporation’s first airbag inflator manufacturing plant in India and is scheduled to start operations by December 2023. Once operational, this plant will meet the growing demand for automobile airbag inflators in the country. “Until now, we have been supplying products to the Indian market from our production site in Thailand and other countries,” said Takase Yoshifumi, Managing Director, India Operations, Daicel Corporation. “However, due to the growth potential of the Indian automobile market, and the need to strengthen automobile manufacturer and airbag module manufacturer supply chains in India, we have decided to establish a local production site at OneHub Chennai,” he added. “We will further strengthen our presence in the Indian market through stable production and supply of products, contributing to the development of the Indian economy through both inflator production and parts’ procurement in the country,” he said. Earlier, during October 2018, in response to growth in the Indian automobile market and the tightening of safety regulations, Daicel established a sales base - Daicel Safety Systems India Pvt. Ltd. at Gurugram, Haryana. The company’s consolidated revenues for fiscal 2020 (ended March 31, 2020) totalled 412.8 billion yen ($3.8 billion). “OneHub Chennai offers plug-and-play infrastructure for the company’s manufacturing plant,” said Vinamra Srivastava, CEO, Business Parks, CapitaLand India. He added, “We look forward to supporting their growth in India.” OneHub Chennai is developed by CapitaLand in a joint venture with IREO and Japanese consortium comprising Mizuho Bank and JGC Corporation.

19 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Palaniswami calls on Amit Shah in Delhi||Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami called on Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on Monday to invite him for the inauguration of a couple of key infrastructure projects, including the extension of Metro Rail Phase-I (Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar). On Tuesday morning, the Chief Minister will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr. Palaniswami, who was accompanied by Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar, requested the Home Minister to inaugurate the 9-km stretch in north Chennai, constructed at a cost of Rs. 3,770 crore, and the Indian Oil Corporation’s Thoothukudi gas pipeline project, worth Rs. 800 crore. The Chief Minister pointed out that there were a few more projects, which were ready for laying of foundation stones. Among them were the Cauvery-Gundar rivers link, costing Rs. 14,400 crore; the Grand Anicut extension, renovation and modernisation, at a cost of Rs. 2,640 crore, and the modernisation of the lower Bhavani project system at a cost of Rs. 934 crore. The total cost of the five projects was put at Rs. 22,544 crore, according to sources in the government. The meeting between Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Shah lasted around 45 minutes. This is the first meeting between the two after Mr. Shah’s visit to Chennai last November. At an official event then, Mr. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam had confirmed that the AIADMK’s alliance with the BJP would continue for the 2021 Assembly election. On January 9, the AIADMK, at its general council, had again ratified Mr. Paneerselvam’s declaration of Mr. Palaniswami as its Chief Ministerial candidate. The BJP, which had earlier given the impression of being the deciding authority in announcing the Chief Ministerial candidate for the alliance, relaxed its stand last week, when its national general secretary and prabhari (in-charge) for Tamil Nadu, C.T. Ravi, said the AIADMK, being the dominant constituent of the coalition, would choose the candidate. Sources added that the Chief Minster and the Deputy Chief Minister were expected to declare open the renovated mausoleum for former Chief Minster Jayalalithaa, on the Marina, on January 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/palaniswami-calls-on-amit-shah-in-delhi/article33605721.ece

19 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||A-G gives consent for action against Bharathi||Advocate-General Vijay Narayan on Monday granted his consent to initiate contempt of court proceedings against DMK MP R.S. Bharathi before the Madras High Court for his reported remark that Scheduled Caste people were able to become judges because of the alms extended by the Dravidian party. The A-G agreed with petitioner A. Antony Raj’s counsel Naveen Kumar Murthi that the speech delivered by Mr. Bharathi on February 14, 2020, prima facie scandalises or tends to scandalise the court and it must be placed before a Division Bench for consideration. Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, requires the A-G’s consent before initiating criminal contempt proceedings against any individual in order to avoid frivolous, vexatious or motivated complaints. Though Mr. Bharathi accused Mr. Raj of being an AIADMK member, the A-G said it could not be a reason to turn down his request. Citing Supreme Court’s observations, in its verdict on contempt of court proceedings against advocate Prashant Bhushan last year, that attacks made against the judiciary must be dealt with firmly, the A-G said the petition filed by Mr. Raj was not motivated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/a-g-grants-consent-for-contempt-proceedings-against-dmk-mp-bharathi/article33605451.ece

19 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Project to promote hygiene in schools||The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to focus the shortcomings in disease prevention strategies in the city and the lack of amenities needed to check the contagion. The most affected by the pandemic were the poor residents of several areas in north Chennai, where it is tough to keep physical distance and water is not readily available. Officials of the Greater Chennai Corporation found it difficult to check the pandemic, constrained as they were by the poor amenities. The lockdown helped the civic body ramp up infrastructure by opening mini-clinics, upgrading the testing facilities at primary health centres and strengthening the vector control with the purchase of modern fogging machines. As schools are to open for students of Classes 10-12, Corporation officials are facing the daunting task of shielding the students from the pandemic, what with inadequate water supply and toilets. The grant provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which has funded the integrated storm drain network in the Kosasthalaiyar basin, could not have come at a better time for improving the facilities at Corporation schools in north Chennai, the officials say. The civic body has readied a detailed project report to improve facilities to ensure the personal hygiene among Corporation school students. Under the integrated pandemic and disaster risk management project, urban primary health centres and Corporation schools in the Kosasthalaiyar basin will be provided with hand-wash and drinking water dispensers and other facilities. Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash says the ADB-funded project is aimed at the systematic maintenance of personal hygiene at Corporation schools in the extended areas of north Chennai, where students of the poor families are found to lack in personal hygiene. Installation of drinking water and hand-wash dispensers, implementation of a waste management system through napkin dispensers and construction of additional toilets for girls have been planned. L. Nandakumar, Chief Engineer (General), Chennai Corporation, says the project will benefit 60 Corporation schools with nearly 12,000 students and 17 urban PHCs registering more than 3,000 footfall a day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/project-to-promote-hygiene-in-schools/article33605674.ece

19 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Stalin’s dream to become CM won’t be reality’||DMK president M.K. Stalin’s dream of becoming the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister will remain just a dream and will not become a reality, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said on Sunday. Speaking at a public meeting on MGR’s birth anniversary at Ashok Nagar here, Mr. Palaniswami asked how Mr. Stalin could claim the AIADMK would not even be in the Opposition after the Assembly election. “You [Stalin] are saying you will win in all 234 seats. You can win only in your dreams. Not in reality. Keep dreaming. You kept saying my government will not last even 10 days, three months, six months, one year…. now we are going to complete four years. I never expected to be Chief Minister, but I am here because of my hard work. You are dreaming about becoming the Chief Minister. It will only be a dream,” he said. The Chief Minister said Mr. Stalin was a product of nepotism, unlike those in the AIADMK who worked hard to reach top positions. Mr. Palaniswami said he had fought elections nine times and climbed the ladder through hard work. He said Mr. Stalin had benefited only because of his father [late Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi]. Responding to Mr. Stalin’s charge that he did not become the Chief Minister by meeting the people, Mr. Palaniswami said everyone knew that was not true. He asked whether Mr. Stalin’s father, Karunanidhi, became the Chief Minister by meeting the people. “Your father became the Chief Minister through conspiracy after Anna’s death,” he said. In an apparent reference to actor-politician Kamal Haasan, he said those who were starting new parties were forced to take MGR’s name. Earlier, Mr. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam led MGR’s birth anniversary celebrations organised by the party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalins-dream-to-become-cm-wont-be-reality/article33605032.ece

19 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Contempt proceedings sought against Gurumurthy||Multiple petitions were filed in the Madras High Court on Monday for initiating criminal contempt of court proceedings against Tamil magazine Thuglak’s Editor S. Gurumurthy for his comments about the judiciary during the magazine’s annual meet with its readers on January 14. Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam leader S. Doraisamy and advocate P. Pugalenthi have filed the petitions accusing the Editor of having scandalised the judiciary by claiming that judgeship is obtained by beseeching politicians and hence there was no prompt action against corruption. While Mr. Doraisamy’s counsel V. Elangovan had approached Advocate General Vijay Narayan for his consent to initiate the contempt proceedings, Mr. Pugalenthi’s counsel M. Radhakrishnan urged the court to initiate the proceedings suo motu without insisting upon A-G’s consent. Answering a query from one of the magazine’s readers on judicial delay in deciding corruption cases, Mr. Gurumurthy had said even Supreme Court judges get appointed by politicians and that they get appointed only by beseeching one person or the other and by holding on to their feet. However, the next day, he expressed regret for the remark and clarified that his intent “was to say how some candidates for judges for even the highest court go and beseech politicians for support. But in the spur and heat of the moment, I mentioned judges instead of candidates.” Further, clarifying that the remarks were completely unintended, he had said: “I may add that the statement was in the course of my extempore reply to a provocative question and not in any deliberate article or writing which would show my intent.” Nevertheless, the contempt petitioner Mr. Pugalenthi, in his affidavit, contended that a bare look at the contents of the remark would clearly reveal that Mr. Gurumurthy’s intention was to lower the esteem of the judiciary in the minds of the public. Yet another lawyer Charles Alexander too made a mention before a Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and P.D. Audikesavalu regarding the remarks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/plea-in-hc-to-initiate-contempt-proceedings-against-gurumurthy/article33605060.ece
19 January 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Vendors return to flower market||Nearly 200 flower vendors have returned to the flower market on Mettupalayam Road after vacating the Devanga Higher Secondary School ground over the weekend. Sources in the Corporation and within the vendor community said the vendors returned because the school would reopen for Class X and Plus Two students on Tuesday. The 197 vendors, who returned, included the 144 traders who had rented platform shops and 28 traders who had rented ‘stall shops’. The rest were makeshift sellers who paid toll to the contractor who had taken on market maintenance. Prior to their return, the Corporation had demolished those structures that the vendors had erected till the edge of the Road, obstructing access to those who set up stalls inside, the sources said and added that if the Corporation did not evict those shops, the purpose behind the recent eviction drive would have no meaning. For, the occupation of the road would continue to hinder vehicle movement and facilitate unauthorised parking of vehicles. The traders also said they had requested the Corporation to completely waive off the rent for the period the civic body had shut down the market. Though the State government had announced a two-month waiver, in their case, it would not be sufficient as they had returned to the market only now, after a gap of over four months. As for the reopening of the new stalls constructed at the new flower market on the eastern side of the Mettupalayam Road, the traders said they were given to understand that the Corporation had withheld the allotment of shops through auction because of a legal dispute. As and when the Corporation went with allotting shops, it should prioritise the allotment to those who could not return to the old market, the vendors demanded. The sources said they had asked the traders to observe physical distancing norms and other COVID-19 safety protocol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vendors-return-to-flower-market/article33605044.ece

19 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Rains deflate harvest-season spirit of farmers||This is the time of the year when paddy harvest happens in full swing across the district - but not this time. “Most farmers start harvesting their paddy crop after Pongal festival and reap rewards for their hard work. However, this year has turned out to be disastrous for farmers as the recent rains have damaged the crop ready for harvest,” says N. Chandra, a 70-year-old farmer from Kottaimedu near Alanganallur. The heavy and unseasonal rain this month has caused lodging of crops. At many pockets, the crops have started sprouting after being submerged in water. Joint Director of Agriculture T. Vivekanandan says a field-level enumeration by officials revealed that paddy crop had been damaged in around 3,000 hectares in Vadipatti, Chellampatti, Madurai East, Madurai West and Alanganallur blocks. “The enumeration process is under way and we are expecting more areas of damaged paddy fields,” he says. An official from the district administration says the north-east monsoon had extended till the mid of January this year, which is very unusual. “Madurai has not witnessed such rains in January in the past several decades,” he says. The district witnessed excess rainfall both in the south-west as well as the north-east monsoon this year. As a result, most of the tanks in the district are filled up to the brim, he adds. High rent for harvester M. Tirupathi, a farmer from Kulamangalam, says the rains have caused lodging of the paddy crop, which made it difficult to harvest them. “The rent for harvesters for one hour is Rs. 3,000. Usually, it takes around one-and-a-half hours to harvest an acre of paddy field. But, with the lodging of crop, it will take around three hours to harvest one acre. This will increase the rent we pay for the harvesters,” he says. In addition, the labour cost for drying the paddy will add to additional expenses, he adds. But water needs to drain out completely from the fields to enable harvesting, points out Ms. Chandra. The yield will also be lower this year owing to the damage caused by the rains, says R. Arulprakasam, a farmer. “The farmers are also unable to get paddy straw due to the damage caused by the rains,” he adds. N. Prabhakaran, a farmer from Madakulam, says the government must provide compensation to all farmers, including those who have not insured their crop.

19 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Pandemic has taught us to be humble: Chief Justice||The COVID-19 pandemic has changed everything and taught us to be humble. Work culture has changed and enabled us to conduct meetings and hearings on the virtual platform, said Madras High Court Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee on Monday during the reception given to him at the High Court Bench. Thanking the High Court Judges and the advocates for the warm welcome, he said, “As the Chief Justice of Madras High Court we will be one team. We will have one voice. I will be sharing thoughts on how to go about after the pandemic effect is eased, with the vaccination coming in and the number of cases (COVID-19) going down.” He said that he will consult judges and others before the court is opened up a bit. There was a good advantage in delivering judgements in open courts. If they were delivered to the face of the advocates who have argued the case, they could stand up and correct the court on facts and key points will not be missed. The Chief Justice said that the public office is a position of trust. It is a place where you give, not take. Jurisdiction and authority are obligations and not privileges. Unfortunately some of the recent occupants in the public offices have probably not shown the character expected of them and this must be changed, he said. The Chief Justice said that as a public servant, he was proud to be a part of the State. Additional Advocate General K. Chellapandian and officer-bearers of Bar Associations welcomed him. He inaugurated a building for mediation and conciliation, lok adalat and arbitration on the court premises. Sitting in the High Court Bench for the first time, the Chief Justice heard public interest litigation petitions and other matters along with Justice M.M. Sundresh.

19 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Crime prevention measures have fetched results: CoP||Effective crime preventive measures taken by the Madurai City Police have brought down crime rate in the city in 2020. “Though the lockdown helped in reduction in number of burglary, chain snatching and accident cases, our sustained efforts to keep tabs on criminals and visible policing fetched good results,” Commissioner of Police Prem Anand Sinha said. Since people remained indoors, crimes and accidents came down in March, April and May, he added. Mr. Sinha said that initiation of preventive detention under Section 109 Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) against 719 anti-social and rowdy elements and under Section 110 of CrPC against as many as 1,329 persons by bonding them over for good conduct, lesser number of grave crime cases has been reported. Further, the policemen kept a close surveillance of anti-social elements and history-sheeted persons. Quick action on petitions received from members of public at police station level helped in minimising crime offences significantly. The police also organised petition melas in all ranges to redress grievances, he added. A sustained drive against movement of narcotic drugs resulted in seizure of 1,116 kg of ganja in 345 cases in 2020. “The number of cases and quantum of seizures is huge when compared to 138 cases and seizure of 273 kg of narcotics substances last year,” the Commissioner said. Erection of road dividers, zig zag barricades in accident-prone areas with the help of Highways Department and Corporation had helped in reduction of road accidents. A total of 81 persons lost their lives in 75 fatal accidents in 2020 as against 193 lives in 185 accidents in 2019. Stricter enforcement of traffic rules also contributed for the reduction in number of accidents, he added. The number of cases against traffic rules violators increased to 5,53,725 in 2020 as against 2,29,053 cases in 2019. Similarly, 801 persons were injured in 682 non-fatal accidents reported in 2019 Only 487 persons were injured in 455 reported non-fatal cases in 2020 as against 801 persons getting injured in 682 accidents in the previous year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/crime-prevention-measures-have-fetched-results-cop/article33605590.ece
19 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Violation of road rules causes more accidents’||More number of two-wheelers on roads and lack of a culture to follow road rules were causing more road accidents in India, said Commissioner of Police Prem Anand Sinha. Speaking at the inaugural function of 32nd National Road Safety Month here on Monday, Mr. Sinha said that Tokyo had more pedestrians than two-wheelers and Australia had the culture of giving first right to the pedestrians crossing a road. Stating that such a culture of strictly following road rules would bring down number of road accidents, he said enforcement alone would not help in making roads safer. He advised the police personnel to set an example to the common man by scrupulously following helmet and seat belt rules. Collector T. Anbalagan, who joined the Commissioner in flagging of a motorbike rally on the occasion, said people often realise the importance of road rules after an accident. “Violating road rules not only endangers the life of the wrong-doers, but also other innocent road users,” he said. People tend to justify their actions, like wrong overtaking, jumping signals. But they should think about how precious are life and limbs.“They should remember that their family members will be waiting for them at home,” he added. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) K. Sugumaran said that every effort was being made to make the city roads accident-free. Considering the importance of road users’ safety, the Centre had made Road Safety Week into Road Safety Month, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/violation-of-road-rules-causes-more-accidents/article33605585.ece

19 January 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Puducherry Assembly passes resolution seeking Statehood||Participating in a discussion before the Legislative Assembly passed a resolution seeking Statehood for the Union Territory, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Monday held Prime Minister Narendra Modi responsible for not including the Union Territory under the ambit of the recommendations of the Finance Commission. Addressing the House, the Chief Minister said former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and then Home Minister Rajnath Singh (currently Defence Minister) had given a favourable response to the Union Territory’s demand for inclusion in the Finance Commission. “But when the file reached the Prime Minister’s Office, the proposal of MHA and Finance Ministry was rejected. I am stating this in the Assembly because it is going to be election time and the Prime Minister may even come and promise Statehood,” he said. On the criticism against him for not doing anything to obtain Statehood while he was a Central Minister, the Chief Minister said the demand was raised for obtaining Special Category Status. The status was normally accorded to sensitive States in Northeast, he said claiming in those times, the situation was entirely different with the Union Territory getting around 70% as Central assistance. Now, the grant from Centre stood at around 20%, he said. While the Centre was not according the Union Territory its due share, the Lt. Governor was creating obstacles to the elected government, he alleged. He accused the L-G of not following rules and court directions. The Madras High Court in its order had advised the Lt. Governor to function according to the aid and advice of the Cabinet and also stated that there was no independent power vested with the Lt. Governor. The court wanted the Lt. Governor to refer only subjects of discord with the Cabinet to the Centre. “But none of these were being followed. So far 34 subjects were referred to the Centre. Even MHA has acknowledged that some of the subjects referred are within the powers of the elected government. Her aim is to delay implementation of schemes,” he alleged. Social Welfare Minister M. Kandasamy, who took a break from the agitation against the Lt. Governor on the portico of the Assembly, informed the House that he would wait for a formal invitation from Ms. Kiran Bedi to discuss issues pertaining to the Ministry up to10. 55a.m on Tuesday. “Otherwise I will walk down to meet her. Some Dalit organisations have already called for a bandh on Wednesday in support of the agitation. The Lt. Governor will have to face the consequences if the demands are not met,” he said participating in the discussion on Statehood. Mr. Kandasamy said he failed to understand why the Lt. Governor was denying him permission to have an audience with her. It was the duty of the Lt. Governor to listen to the grievances, he added. The House also passed a resolution urging the Centre to withdraw all farm laws. Those who participated in the discussions included, Minister for Revenue M. O. H. F Shahjahan, Minister for Power R. Kamalakannan and Government whip R. K R Ananantharaman. Immediately after the house met, Speaker V. P. Sivakolandhu made obituary references to departed leaders, including former President Pranab Mukherjee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/puducherry-assembly-passes-resolution-seeking-statehood/article33605680.ece

DMK leader and Arakkonam MP S. Jagathrakshakan, deputed by the party to address its executive committee meeting in Puducherry, said the DMK was prepared to enter the fray in 30 Assembly constituencies. He declared that an alliance under the leadership of DMK would be formed in the Union Territory. “Our leader Thalapathy [party president M.K. Stalin] will decide on forming such an alliance,” he said. Urging party workers to ensure victory of all the 30 candidates, he made it clear that he would accept nothing short of it. Without naming the ruling Congress, the former Minister said an opportunity to develop the Union Territory had been wasted for long. The mills have been shut and no steps have been taken to revive the port and the airport, he said. The DMK contested the last Assembly polls under an alliance formed by the Congress. The party won two of the nine seats it contested in. In the subsequent by-poll held along with the Lok Sabha election, the party won another seat. ‘Not toppling govt.’ DMK leader in the Assembly R. Siva, in his address, said the party did not want to topple the Narayansamy-led government because of its principled stand on federalism. “The ruling Congress has failed to implement several of its programmes. So the DMK will lead an alliance. We request our party leadership to project Mr. Jagathrakshakan as the Chief Ministerial candidate for the election,” he said. DMK convenor (north) and former Minister S.P. Sivakumar also echoed the views of Mr. Siva on projecting Mr. Jagathrakshakan for the Chief Minister’s post.

Inaugurating the "Road Safety Month" being observed in the district till February 17, organised by the Transport Department, he said that last year 219 motorists had died and 1113 people were injured. "If we are to prevent such fatalities and injuries, self-discipline was essential," he added.

By wearing helmets and seatbelts, two-wheeler riders and four-wheeler drivers can lessen the impact of accidents. By adhering to road safety rules, the district can also focus on very many other issues contributing towards growth and development, the Collector said. Keeping this in mind, the State government gave away a number of sops and subsidies to the needy. Free helmets to the motorists was just a reminder or a wake up call for the motorists in the district to obey the road rules. The Superintendent of Police E Karthik presided over the inauguration and said that by avoiding over-speed, rash driving and drunken driving, the safety can be achieved to a great extent. He urged the motorists to get driving licence only after attaining the age mandated by the government. Driving vehicles without licence was an offence and appealed to the people to cooperate with the police in ensuring safe driving. The Collector gave away free helmets to the motorists and also pasted black stickers on the headlights of vehicles which would prevent blinding of vision of road users due to high beam of lights.

19 January 2021||Salem/Dharmapuri,TAMIL NADU||CM will face trouble after Sasikala’s release: Stalin||DMK president M.K.Stalin on Monday claimed that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who is also AIADMK co-coordinator, would face trouble from January 27. He was referring to the scheduled release of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s aide and ex-AIADMK interim general secretary V K Sasikala from the Bengaluru prison. Addressing a Makkal Gram Sabha meeting conducted by the DMK at Kurumbapatti in Edappadi, Salem district, Mr. Stalin alleged that Mr. Palaniswami had betrayed Sasikala, “who made him Chief Minister” and he claims that she had no role in his appointment. The DMK leader said that the Chief Minister would face trouble even before Assembly elections as Sasikala would be released on January 27. Listening to public grievances on the need for various basic amenities in the area, Mr. Stalin said that these are responsibilities of Local Administration Minister S.P. Velumani but he was “Minister for ‘Department of Corruption’.” Mr. Stalin charged that while the Chief Minister claimed that he has attracted several lakh-crore of rupees as investment into the State and would provide jobs to lakhs of youth, there were over 9,000 educated unemployed youth in Mr. Palaniswami’s Edappadi constituency alone. At a Makkal Gram Sabha meeting in Dharmapuri, he charged that Higher Education Minister K.P. Anbalagan failed to protect Anna University and tried to hand it over to Centre. Those efforts were dropped only after the DMK protested. According to him, the Hogenakkal combined water supply scheme, which was implemented during the erstwhile DMK regime, was put in back-burner by AIADMK government. Mr. Stalin assured that more areas would be included in the combined water supply scheme in Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri districts within five months of the DMK being elected to power [if it wins the Assembly polls]. He charged that Mr. Anbalagan during election campaign promised that steps would be taken to bring water from Then Pennai River at Alayalam to Thulchetti lake here but no measures were taken. The Chief Minister too had reiterated it during the MGR centenary celebrations but no measures were taken to implement the project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-will-face-trouble-after-sasikalas-release-stalin/article33605042.ece
19 January 2021||THENI,TAMIL NADU||After 12 years, Vaigai dam touches maximum storage level||After 12 years, the Vaigai dam has touched its maximum level of 71 feet following which the PWD engineers decided to release 2139 cusecs of water considering the safety of the dam on Monday. In 2008, the dam had touched its maximum storage level and since then, the water level had not crossed the 60-feet mark on many occasions. Due to poor monsoon, the water storage had either revolved around 60 feet or remained less than that level, officials said. This season, the water storage level has been steady since the north east monsoon. Subsequently, the water level increased during the rainfall in December and on a single day, the inflow was high and two feet increased within about 24 hours. As the level reached 66 feet, the first flood warning was issued. With copious rain in the region, when the level reached 68.50 ft and 69 ft respectively, the second and third warnings were given. On Monday, the engineers said that they have released 1200 cusecs in the river and another 750 cusecs in the canals. Normally, the PWD engineers released the water when the storage level reached 69 ft. However, this time, since many of the tanks had good storage of water, it was decided to hold the water in the reservoir till it touched the maximum level. On Monday morning, the water level recorded 70.39 ft with an inflow of 2,352 cusecs and discharge of 2,139 cusecs. Built during the late Kamaraj regime, the Vaigai dam had so far touched the maximum storage level on five occasions. In the last time in 2008, when it touched 71 ft, the water was released into the Vaigai, PWD officials recalled. Expressing satisfaction, the farmers in the region said that they would have no issues for irrigation and the officials also hoped the good storage should ensure no problem for drinking water for Madurai city during this summer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/after-12-years-vaigai-dam-touches-maximum-storage-level/article33605012.ece
19 January 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Rain destroyed crop on 1.50 lakh acres in Thoothukudi: farmers||Seeking compensation for the rain-fed crops destroyed by the recent downpour in the northern parts of the district, over 500 affected farmers came to the Collectorate with the rotten crops to submit petition during the weekly grievances redressal meet held on Monday. Collector K. Senthil Raj assured the aggrieved agriculturists that a due survey was being taken to give adequate compensation to the affected farmers. After the northern parts of the district were hit hard by the rain induced by Cyclone Burevi, the recent unseasonal rains triggered rot in the standing crops that include green gram, black gram, corn, maize, pearl millet, chilli, onion and cotton cultivated on over 1.50 lakh acres in Kovilpatti, Kayathar, Ottapidaaram, Ettaiyapuram, Pudur and Vilaathikulam taluks. As water stagnation in the fields prevented the farmers from harvesting the crops on time, the matured crops have now started germinating and rotting after the recent rains. Carrying the rotten crops in their hands, a few hundred farmers, led by O.A. Narayanasamy, tried to enter the Collectorate forcing the police to close down the main entrance. After Additional Collector (Revenue) Vishnu Chandran held talks with the farmers, their representatives were allowed to submit the petition with the Collector. Mr. Narayanasamy told Dr. Senthil Raj that the recent rains had damaged crops on 1.57 lakh acres in Kovilpatti, Kayathar, Ottapidaaram, Ettaiyapuram, Pudur and Vilaathikulam taluks even as the farmers had spent over Rs. 30,000 per acre for raising the crops. “When the rain started during the onset of the northeast monsoon, we believed that we would get Rs. 20,000 per acre as profit this year. However, the latest rains have dashed all our hopes, leaving the farmers in tears. Besides waiving the crop loans, the farmers should be given the compensation of Rs. 30,000 per acre. Else the farmers will be left at the mercy of moneylenders,” Mr. Narayanasamy said. Dr. Senthil Raj said the survey on crop damage was going on and hence the proposal to the government seeking due compensation would be submitted shortly. Accepting the promise, the protesting farmers left the spot. The Collector, while speaking to reporters, said black gram on 60,000 acres, green gram on 20,000 acres and corn on 40,000 acres had been cultivated in the northern parts of the district while horticultural crops such as maize, chilli and cotton had been raised on over 30,000 acres. “Even as the crops were ready for harvest, the unseasonal rains played the spoilsport to cause extensive damage to the crops. Survey on crop damage has been under way so as to get due compensation from the government to bail out the affected farmers. We’ll cover all affected farmers,” Dr. Senthil Raj assured. The Collector also informed that the paddy growers who had suffered crop loss in the recent Tamirabharani flood would also get adequate compensation as the survey was on to assess the crop damage. Tirunelveli Seeking the compensation of Rs. 30,000 per acre for the rain-fed crops that suffered extensive damage in the recent rains even as the crops were ready for harvest, a group of farmers from Manur union submitted petition during the weekly grievances redressal meet held at the Collectorate on Monday. The farmers, led by Abraham of Kanarpatti near Manur, submitted the petition carrying the geminated crops in their hands. The petitioner farmers said the recent rains that led to water stagnation in the black gram, green gram and Chinese potato (‘siru kizhangu’) fields, the agriculturists who had cultivated these crops on over 1,000 acres in Manur union, had suffered extensive loss as the recent rains. Even as the crops were ready for harvest before ‘Pongal’, the stagnant water prevented the growers from harvesting it. Consequently, the crops germinated. Collector V. Vishnu at a function held earlier said the survey on crop damage by the agriculture and public work departments in all affected areas would be completed within next 10 days. The district had suffered extensive damage though there was no fatality due to this second worst flood the district faced after the infamous 1992 floods.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rain-destroyed-crop-on-150-lakh-acres-in-thoothukudi-farmers/article33605724.ece
19 January 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Rajinikanth unlikely to appear before panel today||Actor Rajinikanth, who has been summoned to appear before the Justice Aruna Jegadeesan Commission on January 19 for deposition in connection with the police firing in anti-Sterlite protest, is unlikely to comply with the summon. Rajini Makkal Mantram sources here said the actor, citing his health issues, would only submit an affidavit again through his advocate and would not appear in person. The Justice Aruna Jegadeesan Commission, probing police firing in the anti-Sterlite protests in which 13 persons were killed, has completed 23rd phases of its investigation in which 586 persons including families of the deceased, the injured, protestors, journalists, government officials, fire and rescue services personnel etc. have deposed so far. 11 summoned As the 24th phase of the probe commenced here on Monday, some of the 11 persons summoned for the day appeared before the Commission. Since actor Rajinikanth, after visiting the injured in the Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital on May 22, 2018 had averred that the anti-socials infiltrated the protesters had unleashed violence and it led to police firing, he was asked to appear before the commission to submit the evidences he had to prove his allegation. Despite sharp criticism from various quarters, including political parties, the actor refused to change his stance that the unruly anti-socials mixed-up with the protesters had unleashed the violence that led to police firing. When he was summoned by the Justice Aruna Jegadeesan Commission to appear for it on February 25 last, Mr. Rajinikanth failed to appear before the commission. His counsel then represented him informed the commission through an affidavit that his client could not honour the commission’s summon as his personal appearance would cause inconvenience to the public. However, the commission on December 21 last summoned him to appear on January 19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rajinikanth-unlikely-to-appear-before-panel-today/article33605450.ece
19 January 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||‘Less portions, but is there time to complete them?’||While bracing up for resumption of classroom sessions from Tuesday, teachers of government schools here are apparently not convinced over the 40% reduction in portions for classes X and XII that the government has promised. A common thought prevailing among the teachers, particularly, those handling science subjects and Mathematics, is that the level of content reduction was well below 30 %. Their grouse, in fact, has not anything to do with retention of most portions but their worry is about completion of the assigned content in a matter of few months, as they need to start from scratch. “We are already into the third week of January, and even if the exams are to be held during June-July, there will be less than 100 working days for completion of 70% of portions. The portions are planned for a year taking into consideration 200 working days. But, with the available time, it will be practically possible to complete only 50 % of the portions. Teachers ought to have been consulted well before finalising the content. Matters will only turn worse if the government school teachers are drafted for election duty during the conduct of elections to the State Assembly,” Uduman Ali, Secretary of the Tiruchi district unit of Tamil Nadu Asiriyar Munnetra Sangam said. During June last year, the School Education Department announced reduction in content of textbooks for classes I to X by at least 30 %, to compensate for the working days lost in the lockdown. A committee of teachers, authors and faculty from District Institute of Education and Training that was set up has recommended the chapters and topics to be omitted. However, the rather prolonged closure of schools due to the lockdown was not anticipated. At this stage, the government must fix a schedule for completion of the portions, and announce the date of examination, so that there could be some scope for planning, teachers emphasise. “The Kalvi Television channel was not effective enough for completion of portions in the absence of real-time monitoring of students. We now have to start the lessons right from the first chapter for students in government schools that are pre-dominantly in rural parts. The priority of students in villages during the lockdown was to assist their parents in tending to cattle and farm activities. They cannot be faulted for not following the schedules of the Kalvi television channel”, a teacher handling English in a government-aided school in the city said. Safety measures Meanwhile, headmasters have put in place measures to make sure that the safety protocol advocated by the government was complied with, with particular emphasis on physical distancing, sanitisation of classrooms, and wearing of face masks. In many schools, teachers made personal contributions to engage workers for cleaning up the classrooms.

19 January 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||DMK to hold State conference in Tiruchi||The 11th State conference of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) will be held in Tiruchi next month. Coming as it does ahead of the Assembly elections, the meet is expected to be a morale booster for the cadre and set them off on a campaign blitz. Although the date for the conference is yet to be formally announced, the party principal secretary K. N. Nehru on Monday inaugurated the preliminary site clearance works at a sprawling site at Siruganur, the venue identified for the event, on the outskirts of the city. Mr. Nehru told The Hindu that the conference would be held on a nearly 400-acre site, off the Tiruchi-Chennai National Highway. “The countdown for the conference has begun and we have started the preliminary works,” he said. Tiruchi, given its central location, has been a favoured venue for the party with five of its previous 10 State conferences being held here. Tiruchi was the venue for the party’s second State conference in May 1956; the sixth conference in February 1990, eighth conference in January 1996; ninth conference in March 2006; and the 10th conference in February 2014. With his proven organisational capabilities, Mr. Nehru will be in-charge of the arrangements of yet another party conference here. However, it will be the first time that he will be organising the event after his elevation as principal secretary in the party. This will also be the first State conference to be held under the direct leadership of party president, M. K.Stalin, who is likely to inspect the conference venue on Tuesday, party sources indicated.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-to-hold-state-conference-in-tiruchi/article33604973.ece
19 January 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Amma Mini Clinics, a boon for rural populace||Residents of interior villages in rural Perambalur say Amma Mini Clinics have helped to provide immediate medical attention for the sick and elderly. The increasing awareness on the availability of the facility would be beneficial to the public, health officials say. Karpagammal, an 80-year-old woman who lives alone at her house in Ogalur, nearly 40 km from Perambalur town, experienced severe pain in her lower back on Friday morning. When she consulted her neighbours, they referred her to the newly-inaugurated Amma Mini Clinic nearby. She slowly made her way to the clinic, where she was met by Village Health Nurse Saleth Sushmitha who checked her vitals before providing medicine for her pain. “I did not know that I would be treated for free. Such services need to be made available for people like me who cannot travel far on their own,” Ms. Karpagammal said. The nearest Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC) is in Labbaikudikadu, seven kilometres away. A doctor is available at the clinic from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., and from 2 p.m. till 8 p.m. when regular outpatient treatment is provided. “Due to COVID-19, the PHCs have their hands full. These mini clinics would take some load off them, while also providing treatment for small ailments,” Sushmitha said. The clinic is also stocked with medications for fever, dysentery etc., she added. In case the ailment is serious, the patient would be referred immediatly to the Perambalur District Headquarters Hospital, or to the nearby PHC. Like Karpagammal, the people in the village say that the availability of a doctor in the evening is a boon. “My mother had fever in the evening and we brought her here for treatment. If not for the clinic, we would have had to take her to a private clinic and shell out at least Rs. 200 for consultation and some more for medicine,” a man in Ogalur said. Speaking to The Hindu , R. Geetha Rani, Deputy Director of Health Services, Perambalur, said that the service was only a few weeks old and already, at least 40 people were visit these clinics every day. So far, six clinics have been opened while three mobile clinics are functional, she said. "It is through word-of-mouth that the people know of the availability of these clinics. Many more such clinics have been planned for Perambalur district,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/amma-mini-clinics-a-boon-for-rural-populace/article33604979.ece
19 January 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Another smart toilet complex opens in city||An existing toilet complex on West Boulevard Road has been converted into a Smart Toilet and has been opened for public use. The toilet complex, located near the Main Guard Gate records sizeable footfall daily. The toilet complex, set up in a 600 square feet area, features three sections- one for men, one for women and one child-friendly toilet. A shower facility is also available. Both the men and women's toilets have three restrooms each while the women's restrooms have also been fitted with a sanitary napkin vending machine, where a napkin would be disposed for Rs. 1. An incinerator for used napkins too, has been set up. The child-friendly toilet features a child-sized western toilet. Shoppers who alight from buses at WB Road and head to NSB Road and the bazaar area for shopping use the facility the most, an in-charge at the complex said. During the recent Pongal holidays, the footfall had gone up to at least 100 users a day, the in-charge said. However, many are hesitant to access the facilities due to the usage fee, the in-charge said as Rs. 5 is charged for both men and women. “We think it is justified as we clean the restrooms at least five times a day. During the pandemic people are hesitant to use public restrooms because of hygiene concerns. The public must understand the importance of such services,” he said. Meanwhile, parents do not allow their children to access the children's toilet as they must pay extra for it, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/another-smart-toilet-complex-opens-in-city/article33605719.ece

19 January 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Rain brings good inflow to Kavinadu tank||The Kavinadu Kanmoi, one of the biggest irrigation tanks in neighbouring Pudukottai district, has got substantial inflow following the recent spell of rain this month. According to Public Works Department sources, the Kavinadu tank has reached about 50%of its capacity of 166 million cubic feet (mcft) and requires a few more spells of rain to fill up. However, even the sight of a half-filled Kavinadu Kanmoi has gladdened the hearts of the farmers in the region. The kanmoi has an ayacut of 715.88 hectares and its bunds run for a total length of 4,625 metres. The tank gets inflow from the Senthamangalam Vari that gets water from its own catchment areas. The surplus waters flows into the Gundar. Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar, who inspected the tank along with Collector P. Uma Maheswari and other officials a few days back, said the tank was getting good inflows following the recent rain. The district had received more rain than the average rainfall of the past five years. The renovation works carried out under the kudimaramathu and special desilting scheme last year had helped harvest the rainwater, he said. The Kavinadu Kanmoi’s inlet and surplus channels were cleared of silt accumulation. The bunds were also strengthened, besides repairs were done to the shutter and other irrigation structures in the tank. The project was executed at a cost of Rs. 61 lakh. According to Public Works Department sources, of the 1,131 tanks under the control of PWD, about 600 tanks have reached their full capacity. Several other tanks have storage up to 70-80% of their capacities. There is almost no tank with less than 25% storage, a PWD official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rain-brings-good-inflow-to-kavinadu-tank/article33604983.ece

The 40-year-old tusker, which was being treated by the forest department since December of last year due to an injury in its back, was recently spotted with a gash to its earlobe. Activists had voiced concerns that the animal had sustained the injury after being attacked by local residents. K.K. Kaushal, Field Director of MTR, dismissed the claims, and said that it seemed most likely that the injury was by natural causes. However, he added that the forest department are now “seriously considering” capturing the elephant and treating it at the Theppakadu Elephant Camp. “The elephant is not only straying closer to human habitations but is also blocking traffic. As we fear that there may arise some negative interactions in the area between humans and the elephant, we are in discussions to conduct an operation to capture it in the coming days,” said Mr. Kaushal. Deputy Director of MTR (Buffer Zone), L.C.S.Srikanth, in a statement to the press, said that the elephant was being closely monitored by the forest department for more than a month. “After the treatment was given to the elephant using kumkis last month, the wound had started to heal. However, it wasn’t moving away from habitations,” said Mr. Srikanth. He added that after a gash was noticed on its left ear, oral treatment was given using medication kept inside fruits. He said that the bleeding had stopped and that the situation was being monitored.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/forest-department-considers-capturing-injured-wild-elephant/article33605038.ece

Mr. Sasi Mohan also said that the Scene of Crime (SOC), has not yet been established. “We are still investigating whether the girl was killed near the well and her body disposed of inside, or whether she was killed in a separate location and then the body disposed at the location where it was finally found,” said the SP. The police have also drawn up a list of suspects whom they believe could have been involved in the murder. They have also not ruled out the possibility of the involvement of a 30-year-old tea estate worker, residing in the area, who died by suicide on January 7, after murdering his family of three. “There are a couple of suspects in the case and we are trying to pinpoint their location when the crime occurred, and also to see whether they were near to the area where the body of the girl was found,” said a top police official.

19 January 2021||Virudhunagar,TAMIL NADU||Special camps for survey of crop damage start in Virudhunagar||Virudhunagar district administration has started three-day special camps for enumeration of rain-damaged crops across the district on Monday. In a statement, Collector R. Kannan said that the State Government had ordered the officials to expeditiously take up enumeration. Officials from Department of Agriculture and village administrative officers were involved in the enumeration. In order to speed up the process without any room for complaints, special camps are being held at village level on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

A School Education Department official said on Monday that all government, aided and private schools carried out disinfection of the school premises, particularly the classrooms. The desks in the classrooms were rearranged to accommodate only 25 students per room to maintain personal distancing norms.

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice M.M. Sundresh ordered notice in the public interest litigation petition filed by K. Pushpavanam of Madurai. The petitioner complained that the ghost nets were responsible for trapping and killing millions of marine animals every year. Relying on a news report, he said that at least six lakh to eight lakh tonnes of fishing nets were lost or thrown into the sea every year and these fishing nets alone accounted for 10% of the globe’s plastic pollution. He pointed out that if this continued, by 2050 the world’s ocean would have more plastic than fish. As a result of plastic pollution, the Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve was at the brink of extinction and destructive fishing practices were contributing to this. Only if plastic and ghost nets were removed from the Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve, marine flora and fauna could be saved, he said. The Government of Kerala had adopted an initiative called ‘Suchitwa Sagaram,’ a clean sea mission. A similar initiative could be introduced in Tamil Nadu to make the sea and the coast plastic free. Programmes must be conducted to create an awareness among the fishermen on the ill effects of the ghost nets, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/remove-ghost-nets-from-gulf-of-mannar-biosphere-reserve/article33605005.ece

Despite incurring losses, R. Perumal alias Surulirajan is determined to grow fruits and vegetables with organic farming techniques. While 2019 was a good year for cultivation of grapes, the rain this year have ruined at least two acres of shallots and reduced yield of grapes by at least one-fourth, Mr. Perumal told The Hindu . He has incurred at least two lakhs worth of losses this year alone, he says. While his first stint with grape cultivation was in 1999, he took up organic farming only in 2019. A major quantity of the grapes is sold to visitors at the vineyard located on Perambalur-Athur road. Contrary to a possible notion that grapes cannot grow in a dry area like Perambalur, Mr. Perumal says it is the least water-hungry of all orchard crops. Despite a financial blow this year, he has begun work on cultivation of grapes in his farm. All of Mr. Perumal’s cultivable land is fertilised with goat dung, home-made compost, husks of peanuts, beetle nuts. “We do not use any chemicals. My family only consumes what is cultivated on our field,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/despite-losses-grape-grower-to-persist-with-organic-farming/article33605717.ece

19 January 2021||BELAGAVI,KARNATAKA||Vehicles left stranded as agitators close bypass road||Members of some civic organisations and Congress workers closed the Hubballi-Dharwad bypass road on Monday, during a protest demanding that work be taken up immediately to widen it. The 30-km-long two-lane road remained closed for over one-and-a-half kilometres and several vehicles were stranded on both sides of Gabbur Cross. Commuters suffered as they had to wait for nearly two hours, before the police cleared the road after the protest. The protesters walked from Hubballi and Dharwad and urged the government to widen the highway immediately. They claimed that over 2,200 persons had died in road accidents since the road was built 20 years ago. They argued that the death of 12 doctors from Davangere was also due to the unscientific construction of the road and the refusal of the builder to widen it. Deepak Chinchore, AICC member, said that the road was of low quality and not built as per standards. He demanded that the government cancel the agreement with the builder Nandi Infrastructure Corridor Enterprises (NICE) and take it over. He also demanded action against Ashok Kheny, former MLA and NICE MD. Nagraj Chabbi, former MLC, Anil Kumar Patil, Congress Rural district president, P.H. Niralakeri. advocate and human rights activist, and others were present. Later in the day, Deputy Commissioner Nitesh Patil held a meeting of police, transport and Public Works Department officers and instructed them to take steps to reduce accidents on the road. He said that a proposal to widen the road had been sent to the State government and work would start once permission was received. He asked officials to identify and mark accident-prone places, curves and road humps. He asked officers to create visible signs of such places using fibre and rubber. He set a deadline of 72 hours to complete this task. He asked officials to evict shop owners and vendors who were occupying the footpath and other spaces along the bypass road. Additional Director-General of Police Karthik Reddy said that the police and transport department officers had to create awareness about safe driving among commuters. He asked officers to strictly implement the speed limit for the road and conduct frequent checks. He urged officers of various departments to work in coordination to ensure that there were fewer accidents on the stretch.  The 30-km-long two-lane road remained closed for over one-and-a-half kilometres Protesters walk from Hubballi and Dharwad to the venue and urge government to widen the highway immediately  Also, the recent road accident in which 12 doctors from Davangere were killed was ‘due to the unscientific construction of the road’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/vehicles-left-stranded-as-agitators-close-bypass-road/article33605077.ece

19 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC upholds KIC decision on BTC, three other entities||The High Court of Karnataka has upheld the Karnataka Information Commission’s (KIC) decision of declaring Bangalore Turf Club Ltd., Mysore Race Club Ltd., the Ladies Club and the Institution of Engineers (India), Bengaluru, as ‘public authorities’ and that they were required to provide information to the public under the Right to Information Act, 2005. Justice P.B. Bajanthri passed the order while dismissing the petitions filed by BTC, MRC, Ladies Club and IE(I), who had challenged 2014 decisions of the KIC. Pointing out that Section 2(h)(d)(ii) of the RTI Act makes it applicable to non-government organisations substantially financed, directly or indirectly by funds provided by the government, the HC said that all the four petitioners are NGOs benefited from the State in the form of availing government lands on lease at concessional rates. “Since substantial financing can be both direct or indirect. To give an example, if a land in a city is given for free or on heavy discount to hospitals, educational institutions or a body like a sports club, this in itself could be substantial financing,” the court observed while pointing out that if an organisation is established on the largesse of the the State in getting land at a cheap price then it would mean that it is substantially financed. Further, the value of the land will have to be evaluated not only on the date of allotment but even on the date when the question arises as to whether the said body or NGO is substantially financed, the court said. “Documents produced before the KIC reveal that the respective petitioners have been provided with land on lease at throwaway prices as is evident from the aforesaid amount in crores, the court said while holding the KIC’s decisions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-upholds-kic-decision-on-btc-three-other-entities/article33605089.ece
19 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC takes a dim view of order by Sudhakar||The High Court of Karnataka, which is monitoring the progress of process to procure hi-tech ambulance services, on Monday took serious exception to an order passed by the Health and Medical Education Minister cancelling the tender process in the absence of any document in the official file in support of his decision. As Minister K. Sudhakar had cited discussion in various “public forum” and “expert opinion” as the reason for cancelling the tender but there was no document in the official file on such views, the court directed the government to file an affidavit explaining in which public forum the tender issue to procure hi-tech ambulance service was discussed and who is the expert who has given opinion. A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum, issued the direction during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by Bharat Punarothana Trust, Bengaluru. It was pointed out to the court that the government wanted to purchase more ambulances for less number of population than one planned in the tender besides introducing better technology. The government last November floated a tender at an estimated cost of Rs. 1,800 crore to procure one ambulance for every 92,000 persons in the State with hi-tech facilities and the court had decided to monitor the procurement process to ensure that there is no delay in procument of ambulances to ensure that people get quick assistance during medical emergencies. The government had implemented a simple solution of establishing telephonic coordination between the police control room and the ambulance operator for quick movement of ambulances in cities like Bengaluru as suggested by the High Court in September last year and had told the court that the proposed hi-tech ambulance service would address all the issues including movement of ambulances in heavy traffic. The court in September 2020 declined to grant five months to the government to complete procurement of new hi-tech ambulance services while emphasising urgency at larger public interest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-takes-a-dim-view-of-order-by-sudhakar/article33605108.ece
19 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Poultry farmers in State demand increase in minimum price||After a disruption in chicken trade over a dispute over increasing minimum price for poultry farmers, supply in the State is stabilising even as chicken price is expected to go up marginally in the coming days. The poultry farmers, who have a contract with poultry companies as “integrated poultry farmers” had refused to lift new hatchings and had disallowed the companies to lift birds for supply to the market, are demanding an increase in minimum price from around Rs. 4 to Rs. 12 a kg. However, after a mediation by the Animal Husbandry Department officials where an interim rise of Rs. 7.5 per kg was accepted, the supply is being normalised. A committee comprising breeders, farmers, and officials will now look into enhancement of minimum price. The dispute over the minimum price, which is a sort of compensation for poultry farmers when the food conversion ratio (the weight gained by the chicken against the feed consumed) decreases, arose after a few thousand farmers demanded a stable minimum price. “The minimum price ranges from zero to Rs. 4 per kg depending on the company, and we have been asking for revision of price, which was fixed more than five years ago. Expenses have gone up for farmers but the price has remained the same,” Bengaluru District Poultry Farmers’ Association president N. Nagaraj said. In the contract, which is called “integration system”, the company provides chicks, medicines, veterinary services, feed, and buys back the grown bird at an agreed rate while the farmers’ expenses come on the poultry shed, its maintenance, including power and water connections, labour, and heating facility for the chicks among others. While the Karnataka Poultry Farmers’ and Breeders’ Association (KPFBA) maintains that the problem arises when good poultry management practises are not implemented and feed is diverted, farmers argue that climate variation and diseases among others bring down the food conversion ratio (FCR). “If the FCR is removed for the purpose of paying farmers, then there could be quality issues. The price of chicken is fixed considering the production cost and all other variables. It also works on the basis of price in neighbouring markets. We have to match the rate and it has to be balanced. The price is dynamic in nature in a saturated market,” said Inayath Ulla Khan, Chief Executive Officer of KPFBA. He said practically it is impossible to pay Rs. 12 per kg as minimum price to farmers. Manjesh Kumar Jadav, chairman of Broiler Coordination Committee in KPFBA, said the industry works on a very thin margin and makes about Rs. 1 to Rs. 1.5 per kg on an yearly average. He further said: “We have not accepted Rs. 7.5 per kg as minimum price as a permanent feature. It was done to allow lifting of birds. It may come down when the committee sits to decide on the minimum price.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/poultry-farmers-in-state-demand-increase-in-minimum-price/article33605421.ece

19 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Uddhav’s comments stupid’||Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah on Monday condemned the “stupid comments” made by Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on the border issue. The former Chief Minister said the “Mahajan report is final with respect to Belagavi border issue”. “Mr. Uddhav Thackeray, don’t try to politicise the issue which is already decided. You are not just a Shiv Sena activist. Don’t forget that you are also a responsible Chief Minister,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said. The Congress is a part of the coalition government in Maharashtra. Mr. Thackeray on Sunday said that his government was committed to incorporating those areas in Karnataka where Marathi-speaking people were in a majority, into Maharashtra. In three tweets, Mr. Siddaramaiah said: “we will never compromise on matters related to the land-water-language of Karnataka. Protecting our State is our responsibility. @CMOKarnataka should officially give a befitting response to the stupid comments made by Uddhav Thackeray”. “I strongly condemn the statement made by @CMOMaharashtra Uddhav Thackeray about our Belagavi. Belagavi is an integral part of Karnataka. Don’t try to instigate us bringing up the issue which is already resolved”, Mr. Siddaramaiah tweeted. Meanwhile, former Chief Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy said that Mr. Thackeray’s statements reflected the Chinese expansionist language and hurt the federal structure that was based on linguistic organisation of States. “Several Kannada-speaking kings have ruled over large parts of Maharashtra. If Uddhav Thackeray goes through history, one will understand who has occupied whose land and who has to concede the land to whom,” he tweeted on Monday. Stating that Mr. Thackeray would not have spoken in such a language if MES was kept in check, he said: “Mahajan Commission report is final when it comes to border issue. Disrupting the harmony among people in Belagavi should be considered anti-national. Belagavi is an integral part of Karnataka and Suvarna Soudha was built to answer claims of Maharashtra. The purpose of building Suvarna Soudha will be met with its appropriate utilisation,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/uddhavs-comments-stupid/article33605106.ece
19 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Old BMTC buses to be re-purposed into mobile schools||The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in a drop in the number of admissions in schools while young children, who should be in school, are found selling miscellaneous items or begging on the streets. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) will soon be taking up a survey to identify such children and plans to conduct bridge courses to bring them into mainstream schools. The civic body has sought 10 buses from the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC). These old buses will be re-purposed into mobile schools. A prototype of one such bus was inspected by BBMP Special Commissioners J. Manjunath and S.G. Raveendra on Monday. The bright yellow bus will have a white board, cupboards for books and ample space for children to sit for their lessons. Each bus is likely to cost the civic body Rs. 4 lakh. Mr. Manjunath said that the buses would be sent to areas where the number of out-of-school children is high. Teachers from the BBMP’s schools will be deputed to teach these children. “We are yet to finalise on the bus prototype,” he said. Door-to-door survey A door-to-door survey will be taken up across the city to identify out-of-school children, said Nagendra Naik, Assistant Commissioner (Welfare), BBMP. He said that while the survey would focus on slums and areas with migrant workers’ settlements, it would be taken up even in other residential areas. “Thus far, we have on board 48 non-governmental organisations for the survey, and more are likely to join in. During the survey, all details of children aged between six and 14 years will be collected, including those who have not been to any school and children who have dropped out of school,” he said. The survey is being taken up following directions from the Karnataka High Court to the State government to come out with a scheme to identify such children to ensure that benefits of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 could be extended to them. The survey will follow a one-day workshop on ‘Prevention of child beggary and child hawking’ organised by the civic body, in association with the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority, Police Department, Department of Social Welfare, Department of Women and Child Welfare on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/old-bmtc-buses-to-be-re-purposed-into-mobile-schools/article33605414.ece

19 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Cartoonist compiles first dictionary of Kundapra Kannada||Panju Gangolli, noted cartoonist living in Mumbai, has toiled for nearly two decades to come up with the first ever dictionary of his native tongue Kundapra Kannada - a unique dialect of Kannada spoken in and around Kundapura taluk of Udupi district. The dictionary with over ten thousand words and 1,500 idioms in use in Kundapra Kannada, published with support from Tallur Family Trust, will hit the stands later this month. Kundapra Kannada is mainly a spoken dialect, but faces threats to usage from factors such as mainstream Kannada, English medium education and a fast vanishing way of life. But the dialect has also seen a resurgence in recent years with the community celebrating a Kundapra Kannada day, stand-up comedy, Yakshagana and other art forms being performed in the dialect. “I saw my language and several words vanish everyday, prompting me to take up compiling a dictionary, so that these words were at least recorded somewhere,” said Mr. Gangolli. The dictionary has three criteria for the inclusion of a word - it must be exclusively in use in Kundapra Kannada and not in mainstream Kannada; it must be words from Kannada that have taken on a different meaning in the dialect; or words that may have originated from the same source but sound very different in the dialect. Coming from an agricultural large joint family of over 35 people, work for the dictionary began at home. “Since there have been no dictionaries in the past, I had to source words from the field directly. Every few months, I would return to my village and go hunting for words in the villages, armed with a tape recorder and a book,” he said. Soon, a few other friends joined the efforts. He went about systematically recording words under various categories like animals, foods, those connected to various rituals, linked to various professions, swear words and the rich heritage of songs. “We have also collected nearly 1,500 songs, which will be released in a second volume in the next two years,” he said. The exercise made Mr. Gangolli a word detective of sorts. “I am now trained to always keep my ears open and be ever conscious of the words being used. Now the dictionary has gone for print, but I continue to find new words. Words are like kites, you have to catch them when you hear them. If you don’t do it immediately, they may be lost forever,” he said. For instance, the word - hajaanharad, used as an affectionate scolding for naughty children, sent him searching for its meaning for over three years. “People in my own family used it, but nobody knew how this word came about. After searching for people who knew about it all over the region, a person in my village gave me a clue. The word haja means a wooden plank tied to an ox’s neck to control its movement. Hajaanharad means someone who has even broken free from a haja tied around its neck, indicating they are uncontrollable. I was so elated to finally find the meaning of this word, an excitement that I can feel even today,” he said. Mr. Gangolli says Kundapra Kannada was only a regional variant of Halegannada that has miraculously remained largely untouched by further variations in mainstream Kannada. “For instance, we call mother abbe, a word even Raghavanka uses. The widespread use of bindu - for instance, what is oota in Kannada is oonta in the dialect, is also seen in Halegannada. When we were young, my father used to write oonta, aanta while we learnt it as oota and aata in school.

A.N. Venugopala Gowda, a retired judge of the High Court, will be the chairperson of the Committee.

A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum, passed the order on an application filed in a PIL petition, initiated suo motu by the High Court in 2011 on the issue of malnourished children based on a letter by one B.L Patil of an NGO. It was pointed out in the application, quoting reports in newspaper, that the number of malnourished children are on the rise in Karnataka in view of closure of anganwadis since March 2020 owing to COVID-19, through which nutritional foods were being supplied to the children, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls as per various schemes of the government. The HC in 2012 set up a committee, headed by then judge of the HC Justice N.K. Patil, which made several recommendations to address the issue of malnutrition among children and others.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/malnourished-children-court-sets-up-panel/article33605109.ece

19 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Kannada outfits to meet tomorrow to chart next course of action||Criticising Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray for his statements on Belagavi, Kannada organisations burnt his effigy at a protest in the city on Monday. A coalition of Kannada outfits will meet on Wednesday to chart out the next course of action. “We need to make this a people’s movement in Belagavi and our agitation will also begin from there,” Vatal Nagaraj, president, Kannada Okkoota, said. Shiv Sena’s role Condemning the Shiv Sena’s role in keeping the border dispute alive for “cheap politics”, Mr. Nagaraj said the dispute was settled long ago as per the Mahajan Committee report. “It was the Maharashtra government that insisted on the formation of the committee and said everyone must accept its report, which we have done. Maharashtra is unnecessarily raking up the issue,” he said. He also said that successive governments in Karnataka had failed to constructively develop Belagavi and create a groundswell of support for the State in the district. “While we built Suvarna Soudha, no departments have been moved to the district. More than that, the Karnataka government needs to get investment to Belagavi, start industries, and create jobs which will change the narrative in the district. But sadly, all parties have a keen eye on the Maratha vote and the incumbent BJP government has created a Maratha Development Corporation too,” Mr. Nagaraj lamented. History of region Meanwhile, T.A. Narayana Gowda, president, Karnataka Rakshana Vedike, said Mr. Thackeray would do better to know the history of the region. “Large parts of Maharashtra were Kannada speaking. Several Kannada inscriptions found in Maharashtra bore evidence to this,” he said, adding it was irresponsible of Mr. Thackeray to create tension among language communities. “Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala are progressive States, whose economies have been fuelling the country. However, they have been suffering from Hindi imposition and attack on federalism. While it is time when people and leaders from these States get united and fight for federalism, it is sad that Mr. Thackeray doesn’t have this sense,” Mr. Gowda said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/kannada-outfits-to-meet-tomorrow-to-chart-next-course-of-action/article33605426.ece
19 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||High Court notice to govt. on appointments||The High Court of Karnataka on Monday ordered issue of notice to the State government on a PIL petition questioning the legality of appointing eight individuals as advisers/political secretaries to the Chief Minister. A Division Bench passed the order on the petition filed by Samaj Parivarthana Samudaya, a Dharwad-based NGO. The petitioner questioned the appointments of Mahadev Prakash, Mohan A. Limbekai, Sunil G.S., Shankargouda I. Patila, M.P. Renukacharya, Beluru Sudarshan, M.B. Maramkal, and Lakshminarayana as either advisers to the CM or political secretaries. A couple of them resigned from the posts recently. It was alleged in the petition that the ruling party, which could not accommodate its followers who helped form the government as Ministers in view of Constitutional limit on number of Ministers in a State, had devised this ingenious methodology of appointing such persons as advisers/political secretaries by providing them with the status of Cabinet Minister or Minister of State rank. Pointing out there there was no legal provision under which advisers/political secretaries to the CM could be created and offered a status of a Minister, the petitioner contended that appointment orders issued to these persons neither prescribe their duties nor the responsibilities, and the appointments had caused a dent to the exchequer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/high-court-notice-to-govt-on-appointments/article33605102.ece

Eshwarappa has said that the State government would not let Maharashtra take “even an inch” of land from Karnataka. He was reacting to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s statement on border towns on Monday. He said both Kannadigas and Marathis have been living together as members of one family, but some leaders in Maharashtra had the “habit of raking up the boundary issue” time and again. “There are many places in Maharashtra where Kannadigas live in large numbers. However, we are not demanding that all those places be merged with Karnataka. Similarly, politicians of Maharashtra should stop raising the issue,” he said. The Minister reviewed the implementation of the Nirantara Jyoti scheme at the Deputy Commissioner’s office. Taking note of allegations of irregularities in its implementation, he instructed officials to stop payments to contractors until they fulfil all the conditions. MESCOM officials said that improvement of 68 feeders has been taken up in the district under the scheme, at an expense of Rs. 226 crore. So far, Rs. 148 crore has been spent.

The accused include the victim’s brother-in-law. Superintendent of Police R. Srinivasa Gowda, at a press conference in Hassan on Monday, said the accused shot Santhosh, junior assistant with the KPTCL, after inviting him to a party near Huvinahalli Kaval last Friday. The accused are Anukul, 41, of Madikeri, Sudin Kumar, 30, of Alur taluk, Suresh, 36, and Sathish H.B. of Madikeri. Kumar is the brother-in-law of Santhosh and is allegedly the one who hatched the conspiracy for the murder. Santhosh, who had got a job with the KPTCL on compensatory grounds after his father died while he was in service, married Jayashree about 13 years ago. In recent years, Santhosh was addicted to alcohol and he had been on unauthorised leave from work. He used to get drunk and mistreat his wife at home often. Jayashree’s family members were upset with his behaviour. Fed up with his conduct, Kumar is believed to have consulted his friends to murder him, the SP said. Anukul, who possessed a revolver, fired eight rounds at Santhosh, killing him on the spot. The police traced the accused in Madikeri on Sunday and recovered one revolver, 29 live bullets, and a four-wheeler from them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/four-held-for-killing-kptcl-worker/article33605259.ece

19 January 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||‘State govt. is least bothered about developing Kalyana Karnataka’||Pointing to the meagre amount of funds released to Kalyana Karnataka Region Development Board (KKRDB), Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar has said that the BJP government in the State was least bothered about the development of the backward region. “A budgetary allocation of Rs. 1,500 crore was made to KKRDB for 2020-21. The government later approved of Rs. 1,134 crore. However, it has thus far released only Rs. 250 crore. When the Congress was in power in the State, we had made all efforts to fill the vacancies in the region. Now, the BJP government has stopped recruitment. It is not concerned about the development of the region,” Mr. Shivakumar said. He was addressing a media conference on the sidelines of Sankalpa Samavesha organised by his party in Kalaburagi on Monday. Raising the issue of inadequate funds released by the Union government for taking up relief and rehabilitation work in flood-hit areas in the State, the KPCC chief said that both the Union and State governments led by the BJP had failed to respond to the people’s woes. “BJP leaders have often claimed that a double-engine government — having the same party in power both at the Centre and the State — would accelerate the development process. Now, they have a double-engine government, yet miserably failed on the development front. As per a survey report, the State suffered a loss of Rs. 35,000 crore in the recent floods. But, the Union government released only Rs. 1,860 crore,” Mr. Shivakumar said. Dismissing the statement of BJP leaders that they have won a majority of the gram panchayat seats in the recent elections, Mr. Shivakumar said that his party has won 54 % of the seats.  KPCC Working President Eshwar Khandre, the former Ministers Priyank Kharge and Sharan Prakash Patil, Jewargi MLA Ajay Singh and District Congress Committee president Jagadev Guttedar were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/state-govt-is-least-bothered-about-developing-kalyana-karnataka/article33605080.ece

19 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||CM announces funds for dining facility at Karamballi Venkataramana Temple||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said on Monday that the State government will release Rs. 4 crore for building an anna chatra (dining facility) at Sri Venkataramana Temple in Karamballi in Udupi. The chatra will be named after late V.S. Acharya, former Minister and a senior BJP leader. Speaking at a function on the penultimate day of the nine-day Brahmakalashotsava rituals at the temple in Karamballi, he said that the funds will be released in a week. Mr. Yediyurappa praised the temple authorities for serving food to about 95,000 persons, mainly labour, during the lockdown last year. Udupi MLA K. Raghupati earlier requested the Chief Minister for grants to build the dining facility at the temple in the memory of late V.S. Acharya. Earlier, addressing a gathering at the Rajangana in Udupi Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple after dedicating Vishwapatha, which is the new pathway for free darshan of Lord Krishna in the temple/mutt, the Chief Minister said that the ashta mutts (eight mutts) in Udupi have emerged as the centres of spirituality for people of all communities. He said that Sri Vadiraja Swamy who introduced the biennial Paryaya system, which has entered its 500th year now, at Sri Krishna Mutt, had built the fragmented Hindu society. He was instrumental in protecting the Hindu religion from damage caused by invaders. The Paryaya event has now emerged as a Nada Habba. The ashta mutts have contributed immensely for the development of society, he said. Udupi Pejawar Mutt seer Vishwa Prasanna Tirtha becoming the trustee of Sri Ram Janma Bhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, constituted for building the Ram Mandir, denotes the importance given to the ashta mutts in Udupi, Mr. Yediyurappa said. He also hailed the contributions of Admar Mutt in promoting education in the country. Legislative Assembly Speaker Vishveshwara Hegde Kageri and the Paryaya seer Eshapriya Tirtha of Admar Mutt also spoke. The new pathway starts from the mutt’s north entrance near Rajangana. Devotees will cross the “Kattige Ratha” and the golden roof atop the sanctum sanctorum before coming down the steps to have their darshan at Navagraha Kindi. Devotees then have to climb a flight of steps to go to the dining hall and then, exit from the temple. Dedication of this new pathway is among the several programmes lined up as part of the 500th year of the biennial Paryaya system.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cm-announces-funds-for-dining-facility-at-karamballi-venkataramana-temple/article33605603.ece
19 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Four held for honeytrapping Kerala transport operator||The police have arrested four persons, including two women, on the charge of honeytrapping a Kerala-based transport operator and demanding a ransom from him. The police are on the lookout for five more persons said to be associates of the accused. The accused are said to be involved in six more such cases. Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar on Monday gave the names of the accused as Reshma alias Neema (32), Iqbal Mohammed alias Iqbal (35), Zeenat alias Zeenat Mubeen (28) and Nasif alias Abdul Khader Nasif (25). All the accused hailed from Kerala and lived in Surathkal. Mr. Kumar told reporters here that the incident came to light after investigation of a video that was circulated on the social media about a Kerala-based man being assaulted in a room in Kumbla for a ransom of Rs. 5 lakh. He said that Reshma, who earned a living by rolling beedis, and Zeenat, an insurance agent, had created fake Facebook and WhatsApp accounts and projected themselves as lonely women. They were chatting with people through these social media accounts and inviting them over to their houses where the other accused would join to extort the victims after taking photographs and videos of the latter in compromising positions. Investigation has revealed that there were seven such victims, including the transport operator. The transport operator, the police said, got in touch with Reshma on January 14 through Facebook where the two exchanged their mobile phone numbers. He was invited to Surathkal where Reshma picked him up and took him to her house in Krishnapura Katipalla where the three other accused were present. The transport operator was forced to undress and his photos and videos were taken. The accused assaulted him and demanded a ransom of Rs. 5 lakh. They also threatened him that they would file a sexual assault case against him. Having paid Rs. 30,000 to the accused, the victim filed a complaint with the Surathkal Police on January 16. A team led by Surathkal Police Inspector Chandrappa K. arrested the accused. A sports utility vehicle that belonged to Reshma, four ATM and credit cards and four mobile phones were seized from the accused. Going through the chats on WhatsApp and Facebook, the police found the involvement of the accused in six more honey-trapping incidents. Mr. Kumar asked such victims to approach the police and report their case. The accused, Mr. Kumar said, lived a luxurious life. Evidence gathered so far revealed the involvement of the accused in honey-trapping for the last eight months. “They have deleted conversations they had had with those who have already paid and retained only those chats from whom they are yet to get money,” Mr. Kumar said. The police is investigating the alleged links of the accused with gangs associated with past incidents of honey-trapping, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/four-held-for-honeytrapping-kerala-transport-operator/article33605605.ece

There is no clarity about how it would conduct such classes in the absence of guidelines from the State government,” said an anxious parent of a first PU student. When the State government started regular physical classes for II PU and Class 10 students on January 1, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar had said that classes for I PU students will start on January 15. Mr. Kumar recently chaired a meeting of officials and PU college principals wherein it was decided to start physical classes for first PU students subject to the opinion of the expert committee of the State government on COVID-19 management. “The standard operating procedure for I PU is likely to be released in about three days,” said Deputy Director of PU Education Mohammed Imtiyaz. Though a few parents and activists have reported that some PU colleges have started physical classes for I PU, none have filed a formal complaint with the department. Difficulty The primary problem in starting physical classes for I PU is the difficulty in getting rooms in PU colleges, especially in those where over 200 students each are in I PU and II PU courses, respectively. “At present, we have divided students in batches of 20 and are conducting regular classes by using I PU classrooms. If I PU classes start, we have no other option but to hold II PU classes every alternate day,” said a lecturer of a government PU college in Bantwal which has 200 students each in first and second PU courses. Father Clifford Sequeira, principal of St. Aloysius PU College, said that there will be an increase in the workload of the lecturers if physical classes start for I PU. “We are getting ready for it. We are working out ways to have both online and offline classes for I PU in the same way as it is being done for II PU,” he said. St. Aloysius College has over 2,000 students each for I and II PU classes. Basics A good number of II PU students are attending regular classes since January 1 wherein students are getting an overview of the portions covered during the online teaching sessions and through video lectures made available by the Dakshina Kannada Pre University Principals Association. “We are now touching upon basic concepts of science, commerce and arts subjects that we have already covered during the online sessions and video lectures. Bright students have been able to catch up; and, we are working on the slow learners,” said Umesh Karkera, principal of Narayana Guru PU College, Katipalla.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/concern-over-colleges-holding-physical-classes-for-i-pu/article33605600.ece
19 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Patil: Conduct research on ‘Kaarla Kaje’ rice||Minister for Agriculture B.C. Patil on Monday instructed the University of Agricultural and Horticultural Sciences (UAHS), Shivamogga, to conduct research on ‘Kaarla Kaje’ brand of boiled rice to enable it to get government certification. Addressing a gathering after releasing the particular variety marketed by Parampara Multipurpose Cooperative Society Ltd. at Karkala, he asked Vice-Chancellor, UAHS, M.K. Naik, to carry out research. If the variety gets certification, it can be included in the list of crops eligible for receiving minimum support price. In addition, the Agriculture Department can distribute its seeds at subsidised rates, he said. Appreciating the effort to brand a local variety of rice, the Minister said that branding enhances value. There should be effective marketing of the produce for good returns. He asked farmers to opt for organic farming by slowly reducing application of chemicals in farming. Two farmers in Haveri have proved that organic farming too is profitable as farming done using chemical fertilizers and chemical applications. Earlier, Karkala MLA V. Sunil Kumar requested the Minister to research the rice to build the brand further.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/patil-conduct-research-on-kaarla-kaje-rice/article33605608.ece

Mr. Kumar said that when the accused did not get money from their victims, they earned through transportation of cattle. “They had altered their sports utility vehicle to transport cattle,” Mr. Kumar said and added that the police are investigating whether there was illegal cattle transportation.

19 January 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||MCC to auction nearly 1,200 outlets||Nearly 1,200 tenants occupying commercial complexes and outlets belonging to Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) have been issued eviction notice as a precursor to the conduct of a fresh auction. This is the fallout of the imperatives of raising additional resources for the cash-strapped MCC, which receives a pittance by way of rent from these commercial establishments. MCC Commissioner Gurudutt Hegde told The Hindu that most of the commercial buildings and outlets were rented out more than 20 years ago and the corporation does not receive rent commensurate with the prevailing market rates. “They are paying tenfold below the prevailing market rates for commercial buildings, and the rents, depending on floor area, vary from Rs. 100 to Rs. 200 or Rs. 500 to Rs. 1,000, and in some cases even less,” he said. This is against the rentals that could range from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 10,000. “As per the law, we have to go for fresh auctioning after 12 years. So we have issued eviction notice and have to go through the process as per the government norms,” the Commissioner said. Many of the original tenants are no longer occupying the shops, but they have sub-leased the buildings and are earning a higher rent, which is illegal while paying a nominal rent to the MCC. Hence, a fresh auction has been called to streamline the occupancy as well as bring the rents on a par with the prevailing market rates. Market spared However, the tenants of Devaraja Market have been spared as the issue pertaining to the demolition of the structure is before the court and there is a stay on it. There are nearly 1,900 MCC-owned outlets, including commercial complexes, but 1,200 will be affected by the move as the remaining are in the Devaraja Market complex. Apart from shops at Devaraja Market, the MCC has outlets in Mandi Market, Visveswaraiah Building, Dhanawantri Road, Chamaraja Double Road etc. This is not the first time the MCC has tried to evict the tenants. There was resistance earlier as the tenants argued heir businesses were established and relocation would amount to disruption.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mcc-to-auction-nearly-1200-outlets/article33605263.ece
19 January 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||MCC’s quest for cleanest city tag gains traction||Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) is banking on a slew of new initiatives, including waste water recycling, in its bid to reclaim the cleanest city tag from Indore in the forthcoming Swachh Survekshan 2021. MCC Health Officer D.G. Nagaraj told presspersons on Monday that the city was already recycling 30% of its water and utilising it for secondary purposes such as gardening and fountain maintenance, and this is expected to shore up the city’s cleanliness quotient. The other initiatives include the launch of a local app that is expected to increase the citizen feedback score. Swachh Survekshan has been further tweaked by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs this year. Apart from categorising cities and ranking them on the basis of their population, the cities will also be evaluated on the basis of various indicators such as percentage of waste segregation, quantum of waste processed, recycling of waste (both wet and dry), processing of construction and demolition debris, percentage of waste going into the landfills (the less the better), and sanitation status. The lack of a C and D waste recycling plant was a major drawback for Mysuru all these years, but the government has already approved a project for this and Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) will expedite the transfer of land to establish the plant to take care of construction debris, said Gurudutt Hegde, Commissioner, MCC. He said that the MCC would launch a drive from February 1 to clean the “black spots” in the city and take up a thorough cleaning and garbage clearance exercise. “Though the MCC clears garbage every day, covering all 65 wards of the city, the onus is also on citizens to ensure that they do not litter public places,” he said. Mr. Hegde also said the MCC was already penalising people for littering, but it was not into policing of public behaviour. “It is more by way of appeals and creating awareness to ensure cleanliness,” he said. Getting feedback Dr. Nagaraj said Mysuru was not far behind Indore in terms of cleanliness and on certain parameters, including direct evaluation by third parties, Mysuru had scored higher. It was losing out only on the citizen feedback front, he said, adding that to improve this the MCC would take social media recourse and interact with NGOs and other stakeholders. The low score when it comes to feedback from citizens was attributed to the lack of a local app for the MCC, which is now being addressed, according to the authorities, who also pointed out that the lack of Kananda in the Swachhata app for posting complaints and seeking resolution was a negative factor. Unlike in the past, feedback from citizens will be collected till March 31 this year, while on-field validation will be held from March 1 to 28.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mccs-quest-for-cleanest-city-tag-gains-traction/article33605096.ece

The accused are Raghu, Manjunath, Maqbul Sharief, and Sayyid Ghouse. The Metagalli police said the accused had sneaked inside the compound of Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Pvt. Ltd., a high-security zone, and felled a sandalwood tree. Raghu and Manjunath first felled a tree on January 8, but were caught red-handed when they ventured to do it again on January 14. The police subjected Raghu and Manjunath, who confessed to have sold sandalwood to one Maqbul Sharief in Mysuru. The latter was picked up by the police on January 15 and his premises raided, which yielded nearly 40 kg of sandalwood. Based on information provided by Sharief, the police zeroed in on Sayyid Ghouse, who used to buy sandalwood from Sharief. A raid on his premises led to the recovery of 190 kg of sandalwood. According to the police, Ghouse was involved in a similar case at Virajpet, where a case was registered against him in 2019. He had spent 84 days in Madikeri prison.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/four-nabbed-230-kg-of-sandalwood-seized/article33605264.ece

19 January 2021||Staff Reporter,KARNATAKA||Resident doctors want to choose vaccine||The Karnataka Association of Resident Doctors (KARD) has written to the Minister for Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education demanding that they should be given a choice to choose a vaccine. In a letter to the Minister, the officebearers of the association have demanded that house surgeons, postgraduates and super speciality residents of government medical and dental colleges should be provided vaccines that have shown results with respect to safety and efficacy. They have also stated that the vaccines which have got results of phase III should be given. This comes as doctors in six districts will be given Covaxin, where as other centres in Karnataka have been receiving Covishield. “Before receiving Covaxin, we have been made to take an undertaking stating that the clinical efficacy of Covaxin is yet to be established. The undertaking and the discrepancies in the distribution of the vaccine sounds very suspicious and the resident doctors are very grounded in getting vaccinated,” the letter states. The resident doctors have stated that they feel discriminated against and it was a matter of concern that the government has decided to inject vaccine whose phase III results are yet to be declared. Covaxin is being administered in vaccine sites set up in district hospitals of Chikkamagaluru, Hassan, Ballari, Shivamogga, Chamarajanagar and Davangere. The doctors have pointed out that the consent form states that as the third phase of clinical efficacy is yet to be established, receiving the vaccine does not mean that other precautions related to COVID 19 need to be followed. What is a matter of concern, doctors point out, is that it has been stated that in case of adverse events, you will be provided medically recognised standard of care in government designated and authorised centres/hospitals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/resident-doctors-want-to-choose-vaccine/article33605093.ece

19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||PRR estimate rises to Rs. 21,000 crore||The revised estimate for the Peripheral Ring Road (PRR) project has touched Rs. 21,091 crore, making the cash-strapped Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) look for a private public partnership (PPP) to take up the work of linking Tumakuru Road with Hosur Road. When the project was mooted in 2007, it was estimated to cost Rs. 3,000 crore. In 2016, the BDA came up with a revised estimate of Rs. 11,950 crore. Due to inordinate delay in executing the project, the cost has increased further. Cost of land acquisition  To build a 65-km road network, the BDA needs Rs. 15,000 crore for acquisition of land alone. During a review meeting on Monday, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa directed officials to implement the project in a time-bound manner. H.R. Mahadev, Commissioner, BDA told The Hindu that the authority has asked companies for expression of interest, and several companies, including international agencies, have shown interest. “To make the project financially feasible, we are going for a private public partnership. A major component of the project is land acquisition. We are looking for a private agency, which is also ready to bear the land cost.” He said that a company from Israel has shown interest in the project. On the status of land acquisition, he said, “The project needs an additional 530 acres at various points to build junctions that connect NICE Road, for toll collection booths, shifting of pipelines and other work. We have already approached the State government for primary notification of land. Environmental impact assessment needs to be done for the additional land required for the project. Total land required is around 2,300 acres. Barring 530 acres, we are ready for the final award.” The latest development has done little to convince citizens and farmers. Raghu, a farmer in Huskur in Anekal taluk, said, “It has been close to 15 years, but there is not much progress in terms of land acquisition. Major contention has been awarding compensation. If the BDA is ready to give compensation as per market value, farmers will give their land. Recently, the officials did a survey of land identified for acquisition and farmers had raised concerns. We are hoping that they will provide compensation as per the demand made by farmers.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/prr-estimate-rises-to-rs-21000-crore/article33605419.ece
19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||BSY hits back at Uddhav for remarks on inclusion of some areas into Maharashtra||A day after Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray spoke about integrating “Karnataka-occupied Marathi- speaking and cultural areas into Maharashtra”, Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Monday slammed the former for “displaying regionalism and linguistic chauvinism”, and reiterated that the Mahajan Commission report on the border issue is final. The tweets of Mr. Thackeray from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) handle and those of Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Sunday drew criticism from across political spectrum in Karnataka with several leaders calling it an equivalent of “Chinese expansionist attitude”. Taking serious exception, Mr. Yediyurappa hit back and said that Mr. Thackeray’s statement smacks of arrogance. “Display of regionalism and linguistic chauvinism will hurt the integrity of the nation. I condemn this. Maratha speakers have integrated well with Kannadigas in Karnataka and similarly Kannada-speaking people in the border districts of Maharashtra have integrated with Marathas,” Mr. Yediyurappa tweeted in response. In the tweet on Sunday, Mr. Thackeray said that his government was committed towards incorporating into the State the areas of Karnataka where Marathi speakers are majority, and that it would be a “true tribute” to the martyrs of the cause. “Bringing Karnataka-occupied Marathi speaking and cultural areas to Maharashtra will be the true tribute to those who accepted martyrdom in the boundary battle. We are united and committed towards it. Respects to the martyrs with this promise,” the CMO had tweeted. The tweet coincided with Martyrs’ Day observed on January 17 by the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti and other organisations as a mark of respect to those who laid their life to the cause. Mr. Pawar also tweeted: “Greetings to all the knights in the border struggle for a united Maharashtra on the occasion of Martyrs’ Day! Until the last Marathi village in Karnataka reaches Maharashtra, it will be a true tribute to the martyrs of the border war.” Accusing Mr. Thackeray of trying to break the harmony between Kannadigas and Marathas, Mr. Yediyurappa said: “It’s painful that such an effort is happening from the Maharashtra Chief Minister. As an Indian, Mr. Thackeray should show commitment to the federal structure of the country.” Incidentally, tension between the two States over the boundary issue has come up again at a time when Kannada Chaluvali leaders have bitterly opposed the formation of the Maratha corporation for the welfare of Marathas in the State. Leaders Vatal Nagaraj and others had pointed to the border row to urge the government to rescind on the decision to form the corporation, which is touted to be a political decision ahead of the bypolls in Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency, and Maski and Basavakalyan Assembly constituencies, where Marathas are sizeable electorates. This is second instance triggered by the Maha Vikas Aghadi headed by Mr. Thackeray after it came to power in November 2019. In the first week of December 2019, Mr. Thackeray appointed Ministers Chhagan Bhujbal and Eknath Shinde as coordinators to monitor the case in the Supreme Court related to the boundary issue with Karnataka, and had raised the issue on the floor of the Maharashtra Assembly. Tension prevailed in border areas on both sides, especially in Belagavi in Karnataka and Kolhapur in Maharashtra, with public transport between the two States being suspended. Skirmishes had also been reported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bsy-hits-back-at-uddhav-for-remarks-on-inclusion-of-some-areas-into-maharashtra/article33605425.ece
19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||Theatres lift the curtains||The new year has brought good news for Bengaluru’s theatre community, which was mostly dormant in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The city’s prominent theatre spaces, including Ranga Shankara and Jagriti, have resumed, albeit with caution. Alliance Française de Bangalore (AFB) reopened on January 2 with Theatre For Change’s stage production of renowned playwright Safdar Hashmi’s works. The cultural centre has announced a discount in the rent for its auditorium for cultural events, including theatrical productions. Jagriti staged Not just a half , a collection of anecdotes and monologues about the experience of being a woman. Ranga Shankara’s first show of 2021 included Kannada plays Shraddha and Stainless Steel Paathregalu . According to its founder Arundhati Nag, all shows were sold out. The managements of the venues are, however, cautious. For instance, only 50% occupancy is allowed , a section of the usual theatre audience is still likely to be wary of live shows, and the performers have to rehearse with physical distancing. “We sanitise all the seats, we provide hand sanitisers at the entrance, and we don’t let anyone in without a mask,” Ms. Nag lists the precautions being followed at Ranga Shankara. “In our case, we are filling less than half of the seating capacity. The front row is empty because it’s too close to the performers.” Despite the inconveniences and uncertainties, the theatre community is glad about shows returning to the stage. “None of our actors had second thoughts about returning to the stage,” says Ankita Jain, co-founder of the theatre group Kahe Vidushak. Their productions Jinhe naaz hai and Do kaudi ka khel are slated to be staged at Ranga Shankara on January 19 and 20, respectively. They are returning to the stage after 10 months. “Though we were active in the digital medium, it wasn’t the same as being on stage. Being in front of people and hearing their applause is a different feeling. So, even if it’s just going to be few people coming for the show, we are excited,” she adds. WeMove Theatre’s founder Abhishek Iyengar says, “It's good news; an important news for the theatre community. But we are back to square one. We were out of touch with the audience. So, we need to make efforts to bring them back.” WeMove is set to stage its first production of the year in February. But they are promoting shows by other groups on their Facebook page. “It’s important that the theatre community sticks together in these times,” he adds. Ms. Nag reckons the return to normalcy is still far. “A few countries are going back to lockdown. It will take a while before everyone is vaccinated. Until then, we have to count on patrons and philanthropists to keep us afloat.” Some plays to be staged at Ranga Shankara:  Jinhe naaz hai : Abhishek Majumdar’s short plays Baana (translated from ‘The Arrow’ in Kannada), Namak (translated from ‘Salt’ in Hindi by Srinivas Beesetty) and Raashan about existence and survival in extremities.

But uncertainty continues over its inauguration as the State government awaits the date of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to open the road to traffic. According to officials, the road is ‘ready for inauguration.’ In November 2020, the State government received a message from the Centre informing the Prime Minister’s desire to inaugurate it. In its reply, the State government said that it would be happy if the Prime Minister could inaugurate the bypass project. No response Although missives were sent to the Union government asking for the Prime Minister’s date, the State is yet to get a response. Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran said that the State government could not wait any longer for the Prime Minister. “We have again sent a letter to Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari and are awaiting a reply,” Mr. Sudhakaran said here on Sunday. The Minister said that the bypass road should be inaugurated before the model code of conduct for the upcoming Assembly polls come into force. Mr. Sudhakaran said that he suspected deliberate attempts were being made to delay the inauguration. If the Centre continues to delay responding to the letter, a decision on opening the road will be taken after discussing with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, the Minister said. Sixty per cent of the project cost was borne by the State government. Four decades ago The Alappuzha bypass project was first mooted four decades ago. However, it had remained on paper until the work got under way on April 10, 2015. The project, which was set to be completed in September 2017 got delayed on account of various reasons, including getting permission from Railways to place girders over the railway track as part of the construction of two ROBs at Malikamukku and Kuthirapanthy. The 6.8-km two-lane bypass road, passing through the western side of NH 66, will link Kommady in the north to Kalarcode in the south. One of the major features of the bypass is a 3.2-km stretch of elevated highway that passes by the Alappuzha beach.  We have again sent a letter to Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari and are awaiting a reply.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/alappuzha-bypass-awaits-pms-date/article33605205.ece
19 January 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Labour museum to showcase workers’ struggle||The Labour Movement museum, showcasing the history of the workers’ struggle from across the world, is getting ready in Alappuzha. The museum is being set up by converting the New Model Cooperative Society Limited, previously run by the Bombay Company. A first of its kind in the country, it will portray, through pictures, documents and other exhibits, the class struggle and the history of Kerala’s labour movement, a statement issued by the Tourism Department said. A huge repository of documents and exhibits that shaped the labour movements across the continents and impacted Alappuzha, the cradle of the labour movement in the country, will be on display at the museum. The Labour Movement museum is located alongside the Port and Coir museums, which forms part of the Alappuzha Heritage Tourism Project. The museums together will present the region’s social and cultural history. “Besides its unsurpassed natural beauty, Alappuzha has a rich commercial and maritime heritage dating back to ancient times and connected to distant lands. The Alappuzha Heritage Tourism project is conceived to bring this legacy before tourists, in which these museums are important components. They will also serve scholars specialising in the commercial and labour- related topics,” said Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran. Officials said that the renovation of two coir museums—the Yarn museum and the Living Coir museum—had entered the final phase. “Together with the initiation of the Travancore, the Thalassery and the Muziris Heritage Projects, Kerala is well on its way to showcasing its rich heritage and glorious history to the visitors of this beautiful land, making it a complete experience,” Rani George, principal secretary, Tourism, said. Past glory Alappuzha is getting its past glory restored through the renovation of centuries-old buildings situated west of the Circular Canal and the Commercial Canal, Tourism Director P. Balakiran said. The heritage project is being executed by Muziris Project Limited. The museums will open as soon as the restoration of heritage structures is complete. Nurturing of a Miyawaki forest, renovation of the 150-year-old Alappuzha sea bridge, Leo XIII School, Saukar Masjid, Gujarati Heritage Centre, Makham Masjid, a new naval signal museum, Gandhi museum are progressing as part of the heritage project.  Aim is to have a huge repository of documents and exhibits that shaped the labour movements across the world.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/labour-movement-museum-to-showcase-workers-struggle/article33605127.ece

Along with the company properties, a Gothic-style, British-built church at Puthukkada too was abandoned. It was destined to pass on quietly to history. Then, Lucifer happened. Some scenes of the hit Malayalam movie were shot on the pristine premises of St. Andrews Church, Puthukkada. Local people say the church was renovated with contributions from the makers of the film. A new coat of paint later, its fortunes seem to have revived. Movie buffs now regularly troop in for a glimpse of ‘Lucifer Church’ and to soak up the ambience. St. Andrews is one of the three remaining Gothic style churches built by the British in Idukki’s tea plantations. The other two are at Munnar in Devikulam and Pallikunnu in Peerumade. Just ruins remain of the British-built Union Church at Kottamala, near Upputhara. Sunitha Sreenivasan, daughter of a former manager of the company, now settled in Bengaluru, said she had vivid memories of the church which was active three decades ago. “I still remember Fr. Kuriakose Plathottam who was the priest then,” she said. Ms. Sreenivasan’s family lived in a bungalow close to the church. They left when she was 12. Many such bungalows which housed senior plantation officials in the estate have collapsed. In 1952 According to Sekhar, a former estate worker, the plantation was managed by the British parental company even after Independence. As per a plaque on the wall of the church, its foundation stone was laid by J.M. Wilkie in 1952. Unlike the other two British-made churches, there is no British cemetery attached to St. Andrews, bringing down its ‘heritage value’ by a notch. Still, what is lacking on the heritage front is compensated abundantly by the beauty and quietude all around. “This church is on a small hill, with the prettiest environs. A dried-up tree nearby adds to the charm,” says C.P. Roy, who came to see the church.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/lucifer-pulls-back-a-church-from-oblivion/article33605219.ece

The park has been set up on a five acres of land on the banks of the Kabani river near Mananthavady town. “The DTPC spent a sum of Rs. 2 crore for the renovation works and a boating on the Kabani river will be the major attraction of the park,” said A. Anand, secretary, DTPC Wayanad. Ten boats, including two rafts, would be available and a permanent boat jetty had also set up on the banks of the Kabani, Mr. Anand said. An amusement park for children, water fountains, interlocked pavements, five kiosks selling souvenirs and snacks, and an artificial waterfall had also been set up in the park, he said. An open stage for performing cultural programmes, landscaped areas on the river banks and small gardens would also attract the public, he said. “We have also set up the first electric vehicle charging station in the district near the park,” he said. Earlier, the land was under the possession of the Social Forestry Department and it had set up a plant nursery on the land. Later, the land was handed over to the DTPC in 1994 and it set up the first public park in the district. The renovation works are in the final stage and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will open the park by the end of January, Mr. Anand said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/renovated-pazhassi-park-to-open-by-month-end/article33605143.ece

The charging station is coming up at the Mamala unit of the public sector company near Kochi. The facilities being built by the company will include a 60-kW rapid DC charger, 7.5-kW AC charger and AC charger type 2, 22-kW chargers, according to a Facebook post by Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan. KEL also has plans to build charging stations for private and public enterprises and is considering the possibility of building custom-made charging stations in collaboration with car producers in the country. The total cost of setting up a charging station is estimated to be around Rs. 65 lakh. The cost includes that of accompanying facilities such as cafeteria and restroom at the station. Rapid DC chargers The Minister’s post stated that the rapid DC chargers being established would help charge a motor vehicle up to 80% within half-an-hour. The cost of the establishment of the DC charger will be Rs. 22 lakh and type two AC charger will be Rs. 8 lakh. KEL Managing Director Shaji M. Varghese said the need for electrical charging stations would increase rapidly as electrical vehicles became the common mode of transport. Kerala would require a charging station every 10 km and KEL’s idea was to make use of the new opportunity, he added. KEL is among the first public sector undertakings in the country to venture into the field of electrical charging stations. Mr. Varghese said the Minister’s Facebook post had resulted in several enquiries from private entrepreneurs. The development was a pleasant surprise as more people had become aware of the new opportunity, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kels-first-ev-charging-station-in-february/article33605128.ece

Sarma, MLA, that the proposal to privatise BPCL would affect the proposed petrochemicals complex being planned by the State government. The Union government has been reminded of the status of the BPCL as a Maharatna company, he said and recalled that the State Legislature had passed a resolution against the privatisation of the oil company. The State government had also written to the Union government twice requesting that the privatisation move should be abandoned. Even as the Union government was trying to sell off its stakes in public sector companies, the State government had tried to take over some of the units and retain them in the public sector. The State government had come out against the privatisation of Hindustan Newsprint. But the Union government went ahead with the process. The Chief Minister expressed hope that once the National Company Law Tribunal accepted the recommendation of the Committee of Creditors, it would be possible for the state to take over Hindustan Newsprint. The State had also submitted a draft agreement for takeover of Instrumentation Limited in Palakkad. However, there had been no positive response so far, he added. The Union government had also not given its final approval to allow the State to buy 51% stakes in Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., which is a joint venture between the Union and State governments, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/drop-move-to-privatise-bpcl-cm-tells-centre/article33605239.ece
19 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||PCB asks Kochi Corporation to pay Rs. 14.92 crore in two weeks||The State Pollution Control Board has asked the Kochi Corporation to pay Rs. 14.92 crore as environment compensation for the civic body’s failure to comply with the Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules, 2016. The environment compensation has been assessed for a period of 771 days starting from November 22, 2018 to December 31, 2020. The board found that the Corporation was generating about 315.96 tonnes of waste per day, while the waste being disposed off as per rules was only 31.60 tonnes per day. The gap in the waste management capacity was 284.36 tonnes per day. The board has asked the Corporation Secretary to remit the environment compensation before 15 days of receipt of the direction. A report on the environment compensation slapped on the Corporation has been filed before the Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which is scheduled to take up the case on January 21. The board has assessed the environment compensation as per the ‘polluter pays principle’. The Bench had pulled up the government and the board on September 16 last year for their failure to take coercive action under the SWM Rules, 2016 against those responsible for the unscientific dumping of waste at Brahmapuram. It had pointed out that the progress of rectifying the waste management situation appeared to be very slow and in disregard to the statutory and constitutional obligation of providing a clean environment. The tribunal had warned that the Chairman and Member Secretary of the board would be held liable for failure to initiate prosecution and recover compensation from the erring local bodies. The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on solid waste management appointed by the NGT had also filed a report before the Principal Bench saying that the Corporation had failed to comply with the norms prescribed under the SWM Rules, 2016. The board found that the facilities provided for the treatment and disposal of solid waste provided at Brahmapuram were not maintained properly. The windrow composting shed remained in a dilapidated condition and mixed solid waste, including plastic waste, was dumped in the yard in open condition. The manure produced failed to meet the fertiliser standards as per the SWM Rules, and it contained heavy metals.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pcb-asks-kochi-corporation-to-pay-rs-1492-crore-in-two-weeks/article33605576.ece
19 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Santhom residents pine for roof over their heads||Housing projects, even those that were inaugurated, have yet to come to the rescue of residents living in ramshackle houses at Santhom Colony, Mundamveli. In February 2014, an inauguration was held to kick-start work on a housing project for 104 residents of the colony that lies along the filthy Rameswaram canal in West Kochi. The housing scheme was to be included in the Basic Services to the Urban Poor (BSUP) project, launched by then Union government and implemented in collaboration with the State government and the local body. Left in the lurch The project never materialised, leaving residents of the area to fend for themselves or continue to live in crumbling houses. V4 Kochi, in its campaign for the local body polls, had raised the issue at Mundamveli. Having had enough of broken promises from the Kochi Corporation, residents like Preethy Vasudevan, a corporation sanitation worker, borrowed money to fund the construction of a more habitable house for themselves. “Other housing projects like the one for P&T Colony residents or another for those who were evicted from near the Perandoor canal, have all popped up as our neighbours at Mundamveli, while we had to sit by and watch,” Ms. Preethy says. Beena Martin, a resident, was left in the lurch when her house collapsed in 2019 in rough weather. A private group has been chipping in with Rs. 2 lakh to rebuild some shacks in the colony. “But that amount is barely sufficient. We had to borrow a lot more to rebuild the house. Since this is a low-lying land next to the canal, a strong foundation is crucial to prevent the structures from collapsing,” she says. Others like Sheeba Johnson say the structures they live in are weather-beaten and could collapse easily. Of the 104 beneficiaries of the project, around 96 remain, and others have moved out, she says. Only a section of the pathway leading to the houses has been laid out with concrete. The rest is a narrow dirt track overgrown with weeds. “We have given up on the housing project. All we want now is title deeds,” says Mary Santhosh, who works as a domestic help. Parts of her house have been destroyed and rebuilt twice, once after a fire in 2005 that charred 27 houses in the colony. While a few residents have now been included in the LIFE Mission housing scheme, Ms. Mary said her name did not figure in it. Title deeds K.P. Santhosh, Ms. Mary’s husband, was the convenor of a protest group that demanded better housing facilities in 2017. “We were not able to sustain the protest when most of us got caught up with our daily lives,” says Mr. Santhosh, who does tiling work. Their house doubles up as a shop selling groceries. They will resume their campaign again, he says, but this time for title deeds to the land they have been living on for years. The BSUP project never took off since then State government never sanctioned the use of gypsum boards for construction, says K.J. Prakasan, who represented Mundamveli in the previous council. Gypsum was meant to be a light-weight and low-cost alternative to conventional construction material. Since the land was low-lying and marshy in some places, gypsum would have made construction easier, avoiding deep piling work, Mr. Prakasan says. The stand-off over the use of gypsum meant that the period for implementation of the project and the funds that could have been allotted under it lapsed. Attempts were made to purchase land from the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) in the area and launch another housing project with either CSR funds or funds under the slum eradication programme of Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML), says former Mayor Soumini Jain. But these also never materialised. While some residents live on puramboke land, a survey of the land would be necessary to determine ownership in other cases and provide title deeds, she adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/santhom-residents-pine-for-roof-over-their-heads/article33605564.ece

Small snags on the CoWIN app, which had prevented messages from being sent out to vaccine recipients on Saturday informing them of the time and place of vaccination, had been resolved and the system worked faster on the second day, Dr. Sivadas M.G., nodal officer for vaccination, said. Some people, who received the vaccine on Saturday and reported myalgia or body pain, had recovered, and no serious adverse reactions were reported. Around 69% of the targeted health workers for the day were vaccinated on Monday, similar to the figure on Saturday, when 711 of 1,022 people took the shot. From Tuesday, some of the larger vaccination centres will have two booths, allowing around 200 people to be inoculated at these centres on one day, he said. Three new vaccination centres, one each at Amrita Hospital, Adlux, and the Angamaly taluk hospital will begin functioning on Tuesday. From Thursday, vaccination centres will begin functioning from the Muvattupuzha General Hospital, Karuvelipady government hospital and Paravur taluk hospital.

Making matters worse, the pandemic threw a spanner in the operation of a dozen e-autos, which were mostly stationed in metro stations along MG Road. Sources in the society said that many of them had fallen into disuse during the past few months since the pandemic affected their patronage and they remained berthed at metro stations, following which their batteries had run out of power. Trials held “On a positive note, members of the society did extensive trial runs of e-autos of different makes, following which the MVD has been entrusted with the task of zeroing in on the ones which are best suited for Kochi. The parameters include quality, cost and operation and maintenance expenses. A major issue is inadequate number of recharging stations. Despite differences of opinion with KMRL, the society expressed its willingness to provide drivers from its 4,000-member strong database to operate e-auto feeder services from the metro corridor,” they said. e-autos have advantages like being non-polluting and having little vibration, unlike diesel and petrol-run autos. “We will approach Kochi Metropolitan Transport Authority with our demands in case KMRL is hesitant. Already, our ride app. named Ausa is undergoing trials and will be rolled out shortly,” the sources said. In the meantime, metro sources said that KMRL had written to the manufacturer to resume operation of e-autos. “They are hopeful of doing so in a month.

The two fronts have equal numbers in the finance committee, and of the three fronts, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has the most number of seats in the tax appeals committee. Tax appeals committee BJP councillor Sudha Dileep Kumar lost the election to the vacancies in the tax appeals committee on Monday, leaving the BJP with four seats in the nine-member committee, the LDF with two and the UDF with three. In the election to the chairperson of the committee, the BJP will still have the upper hand, despite Ms. Kumar’s loss. The BJP had four out of five councillors nominated to the tax appeals standing committee last week. Ms. Kumar had been elected to the education and sports standing committee last week, but resigned immediately to contest for the tax appeals committee, hoping to give the BJP a majority. The LDF had secured a majority in the health, development, welfare and town planning standing committees, while the UDF managed to get a majority in the works standing committee last week. On Monday, LDF councillor Ashwathy Valsan was elected to the vacancy in the finance standing committee, leaving the LDF and the UDF with five seats each in the crucial committee, the only one with ten members. Considering both sides have an equal number, most decisions would require the casting vote of the chairperson of the committee. The Deputy Mayor functions as the chairperson of the finance committee. In the education and sports committee, the LDF has a strength of five members and the UDF three while Ms. Kumar will be the sole representative of the BJP in the committee. Chairpersons’ election The election to the posts of chairpersons of the committees will be held on January 23. The posts of chairpersons of the tax appeals, welfare and works committees are reserved for women, besides the chairperson of the finance committee, which will be taken by the Deputy Mayor. The LDF is learnt to have promised the chairperson posts of the health and town planning committees to the two Independents who had supported them, while the UDF is yet to zero in on a chairperson candidate for the works committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-gets-majority-in-5-standing-panels/article33605577.ece

This is apart from penalty imposed on cars and vans by personnel of other RTO and sub-RTO offices in suburban towns, MVD sources said. A total of 218 motorists were charged with the offence on Sunday, when the drive named Operation Screen was launched. MVD officials said that this followed orders issued by the High Court and the Supreme Court in the wake of the Nirbhaya case that shook the nation. “Most cars and other vehicles come with up to 30% tinted glasses that were factory fitted and this is permissible under the law. The MVD drive is against sticking tinted sheets which further affect the visibility of occupants. Moreover, the glass windows and windscreen must crumple into granules in case of an accident. Sticking tinted sheet over them will hamper this, posing a risk to life. All vehicles, including ambulances, ought to adhere to the rule, since ambulances illegally ferrying people and cargo have been nabbed in the past,” they said. The special drive will continue for another fortnight.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/140-charged-in-operation-screen-drive/article33605571.ece

The Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal had recommended prosecution and environment compensation for the civic body’s failure to comply with the norms. Even though the State Pollution Control Board had fixed the environment compensation, the prosecution proceedings have not yet started despite clear directives from the tribunal. Senior officials at the head office of the board in Thiruvananthapuram said that the notice under Section 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 would be issued to the Secretary of the civic body only after collecting evidence showing violation of the various Acts. The assessment of the quantity of old waste at the site had to be ascertained before issuing the notice, they said. The officials responsible will face legal action under the relevant sections of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The violations are punishable with imprisonment up to one year and six months in the first instance, and it may extend up to six years with fine as per relevant sections of the Water Act. The Corporation has been operating the solid waste disposal site at Brahmapuram without valid authorisation of the board since May 2010. Besides waste from areas under the Corporation’s jurisdiction, biodegradable waste from Aluva, Angamaly, Thrikkakara, Thripunitura and Kalamassery municipalities and Cherannalloor, Kumbalanghi and Vadavucode-Puthencruz grama panchayats are dumped at the yard. The inspections revealed that the plastic waste was disposed without any reprocessing. Only a small amount of plastic waste is being transferred to outside agencies, resulting in the accumulation of waste at the site. The mixed waste is being stored in huge quantities at approximately five metres from the Kadambrayar, a polluted river stretch identified by the Central Pollution Control Board, according to the board.

Analysing trends “The IIM-K team will analyse trends like the general perception about the project among islanders and others, the paying capacity of commuters and their recommendations on the fare structure. We will take this up with the State government, following which the fares will be finalised,” said Alkesh Kumar Sharma, managing director, KMRL. Care will be taken so that decisions are taken in a commuter-friendly manner. The construction of the first ferry is in the final stage, and a few components for external work are awaited from Andhra Pradesh and also from the Philippines. Similarly, efforts are on to make terminals ready at Vyttila and Kakkanad by February 15. Crew members for the first batch of ferries and other staff have been recruited. The shipyard will operate and maintain the vessels for the first two years, he added. Talks with auto drivers Aimed at ensuring last-mile connectivity from terminals at Vyttila and Kakkanad, KMRL recently held discussions with representatives of autorickshaw driver unions. A terminal at Eroor is expected to be readied later this year, it is learnt. KMRL must ensure that ticket fares are reasonably priced, since a majority of islanders, who will be the main beneficiaries of the project, are daily wage earners, said Francis Dianish, vice chairman of Pizhala Karamuttikal Samara Samiti, an NGO. “Private ferries which operated from mainland Ernakulam to Pizhala used to take an hour to cover the 12-km distance to Pizhala. Water Metro ferries will be much faster,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/iim-k-survey-for-water-metro-fare-structure/article33605565.ece

The demands raised by the employees included withdrawal of the privatisation move as well as revision of salaries of the employees to bring them on par with that of employees of other oil companies, said a communication from the trade union here. “Divestment motive” The statement claimed that “anti-employee” conditions had been imposed on the workers through the wages revision contract at the behest of the Union Petroleum Ministry. The clauses in the wages revision contract were meant to help the process of privatisation, the communication alleged. Refinery sources said that the protest did not obstruct the visit of the Union government official as the employees just staged their protest at the gates of the refinery. There was no blocking of the path of the official or any black flag demonstration on the occasion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/employees-stage-protest-during-officials-visit/article33605243.ece

Help would be sought from the police, and educational and religious institutions to maintain the roads that the corporation would repair and beautify. e-governance project On the e-governance project, the Mayor said that the cooperation of Tata Consultancy Services, which had developed some modules for the scheme, would be necessary to take the project forward. Efforts are being made to set up a meeting with representatives of TCS and Information Kerala Mission (IKM) to resolve the matter. A few issues with the existing plan for the new Corporation office meant that only 50 people could be seated in the council hall, which should be able to seat at least 125 people, he said. The site would be inspected soon, he said at a ‘Meet the Press’ event organised by the Ernakulam Press Club recently. The Corporation did not have a register recording its assets, said the Mayor. Such a register will be put together soon. Besides, delay in producing records before various courts had resulted in the Corporation losing some cases, he said. A liaison officer would be appointed with the council’s approval to deal with the issue, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-to-encourage-decentralised-waste-management-anilkumar/article33605578.ece

The arrest of V4Kerala activists at midnight from their homes, not adhering to procedures, and the abhorrent language used by police personnel reeked of fascism and were contrary to democratic principles, he said. On the inordinate delay in opening the Alappuzha bypass, he said the government must open it as soon as possible.

The district panchayat has been trying to cope with the impact of the pandemic and two years of consecutive floods. The pandemic and the floods had resulted in the loss of livelihood for thousands of people in the district, he said. The district panchayat was allotted Rs. 124.54 crore during 2018-19. During 2019-20, the amount allotted in the budget was Rs. 137.74 crore, and it went up to Rs. 137.82 crore during the current financial year. However, the allocation has sharply fallen to Rs. 53.31 crore for the 2021-22 year. Road work “We are not aware of the reasons for the sharp drop in allocation,” said Mr. Thomas, as he pointed out that the fall in allocation would affect the work on infrastructure such as roads.

Port officials said a high-level team from the Cochin port is slated to visit the ICD on January 22 as part of granting the regulatory permission for coastal operations. During the visit, the team will also finalize a Standard Operating Protocol for barge operations, besides stacking and documentation. Alternative The service is intended to provide an alternative to the truck traffic that has sporadically choked the roads, slowing the movement of goods and raising questions about the port’s ability to handle the growing volume of cargo. Prior to commencing the regular service, the 10 TEU barge under possession of the ICD has been dry-docked in Kochi. A second barge with a capacity to carry 28 TEU cargo is expected to join the fleet in the next six months. “To begin with, we will be operating the barge three days a week and this will be expanded as soon as the second vessel joins the fleet. A switch to the water route will bring down the round-trip cost of a container from Kochi by at least 30 percent,” said Abraham Varghese, Managing Director, Kottayam Port, Meanwhile, the port officials have also kick-started consultations with a few shipping lines operating in Kochi , seeking the possibility of opening their empty container yards here. Presently, only two shipping lines have recognized the port as their stacking points. “The plan is to bring empty containers of these shipping lines on board the barge from Kochi on a rotational basis and develop the port as an export-oriented unit,” said another official. Visiting the port a couple of days ago, Kottayam MP, Thomas Chazhikadan had said that the Inland Water Authority of India would be asked to remove the obstacles in the Pazhukkanila backwaters in Kottayam to facilitate cargo movement from the ICD 20% growth As per estimates, the port here handles between 200 to 250 TEU of export and imports cargo on a monthly basis . Over the past one year, the volume of export cargo per month recorded a 20 percent growth to become 75 TEU. Rubber, spices and machinery constitute a bulk of the export cargo from here.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kottayam-port-to-move-cargo/article33605200.ece

The two projects which are part of the decentralised sewerage system under the Amrut scheme need clearance from the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA) before commencement of work. Hence, proposals were invited from agencies accredited by the Ministry of Environment and Forest to prepare the CRZ status report. The corporation council approved the quotation from the Institute of Remote Sensing of Anna University, Chennai. It has quoted a minimum amount of Rs. 3.54 lakh for the plants. Similarly, proposals were invited from agencies accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Education and Training to prepare the EIA report, which also needs to be submitted for KCZMA clearance. Ultra Tech Environmental Consultancy that quoted Rs. 2.5 lakh, besides GST, was approved by the Amrut core committee as well as the council recently. Earlier, tenders for the two plants, one of 7 MLD and the other of 6 MLD, were won by Seemak Hi-tech Productions from Maharashtra for Rs. 20.50 crore and Rs. 17.11 crore respectively. Similarly, Ahmedabad-based Nasith Infrastructure won the tender for the collection network (drains through which sewage will be taken to the plants) for the plants at Rs. 51.86 crore and Rs. 52.97 crore respectively.

Since the launch of the drive, 133 vehicles have been tracked. At present, penalty for using hard cooling films is Rs. 1,250. For minor violations like use of light cooling films, the fine is Rs. 250. According to MVD officials, enforcement involves an awareness campaign as well. Four squads An MVD official said 58 vehicles were traced on the first day of the drive on Sunday. “On Monday, 75 vehicles were traced. Checking was conducted by four squads in two shifts. Besides, there are two separate night squads,” he added. Though there were complaints of violations by government officials and people’s representatives, MVD officials said they had not come across such incidents. However, they made it clear that no exemption would be given to official vehicles found violating norms. Meanwhile, a special squad member said several people had been voluntarily removing cooling films and stickers from their vehicles. “Similar is the case with other unpermitted extra fittings and alterations. They will also be taken seriously,” he added. Vehicle owners booked for use of banned accessories will have to remove them and produce the vehicles for inspection again in three days. Instant clearance There is also an option to instantly remove films and get clearance. Fine can be remitted online or using swipe card.

19 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Migrants return to work||With declining COVID-19 scare and opportunities in the construction sector picking up, the return of migrant labourers to Kerala is seemingly on a steady rise. Contractors said they were happy with the trend, as it would help the early completion of various pending projects. Local labour camps in north Kerala are almost full now. With hotels reopening, several migrants are back at work. Interestingly, new labourers are also joining work sites. S.N. Abhijith, a road contractor, said a majority of pending projects had resumed with the return of labourers from States like Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal. “When native labourers demand wage hike citing shortage of hands and safety issues, migrant workers are happy with the current wages,” he added. Considering the COVID-19 protocol and improved vigil, several work contractors are making their own arrangements to facilitate safe travel by migrant labourers. They have been hiring luxury buses for the purpose owing to unavailability of train services. Harbours At the same time, those who returned to harbours for work are a seemingly disgruntled lot owing to declining catch and steep fall in revenue. Boat owners said many labourers were now returning to their native States thanks to the looming crisis in the sector. “Following the COVID-19 outbreak, fishermen are in dire straits. Poor catch has forced several boat owners to cut short trips as well as the number of labourers,” said Karichal Preman, vice president, All Kerala Fishing Boat Owners Association. A majority of such workers are from Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, and they do not have the skills for other vocations,” he added. For the record, large-scale exodus of migrant workers due to the pandemic had virtually stalled the construction sector and the fishing industry. According to the Labour Department, around three lakh migrant workers had returned home following the lockdown. Nearly 50% of them came back, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/as-pandemic-scare-wanes-migrants-return-to-work/article33605135.ece
19 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Cong. introspects DCC chief’s replacement||The Congress leadership is examining the recent replacement of the Kozhikode District Congress Committee (DCC) after the elevation of T. Siddique from the post to the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) State vice president Senior leaders believe that the decision to shift Mr. Siddique from the post and appoint U. Rajeevan as DCC president had failed to achieve the desired results in the local body polls. Significantly, Congress leader and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, who supported Mr. Siddique’s elevation, was determined that he join the State leadership. This was despite KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran expressing doubts about the adverse impact of it on the party in the long-run. Initially, it was thought that the appointment of Mr. Rajeevan, who has been able to get along with the organisational set-up of the party and electoral politics, would steer the party to victory at least in the civic body polls. Poor show The Congress performed poorly in the election to the Kozhikode Corporation and Vadakara and Koyilandy municipal councils. Incidentally, Mr. Rajeevan was the leader of the Opposition in the Koyilandy Municipality. The party leadership said removing Mr. Siddique from the post undermined the organisational structure which he himself had tried to rebuild during his three-year tenure. Besides, district leaders, especially those belonging to the ‘A’ faction, had raised a banner of revolt when many were sidelined during organisational revamp. A senior functionary said Mr. Rajeevan, who was previously a member of the KPCC executive committee, was not unfit for the post. But it was the replacement of Mr. Siddique that led to a situation where the party faced serious trouble ahead of the Assembly polls. To a certain extent, Mr. Siddique helped quell factional wars when he was DCC president. At the same time, Mr. Rajeevan was not tactful in dealing with leaders of ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups. Candidate selection The State leadership believed that the State vice president and the DCC chief would coordinate the local body poll campaign. But the selection of candidates in most wards and divisions was not only inappropriate but also poorly managed. Besides, the Assembly polls will be a tough electoral challenge for the Congress which has had no legislator from the district for the last three terms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cong-introspects-dcc-chiefs-replacement/article33605122.ece

Pradeep Kumar, MLA. The pending amount for the project when the LDF government came to power was Rs. 284.5 crore, of which Rs. 150 crore was sanctioned in three instalments, the MLA said in a statement issued here on Monday. The road was part of the first phase of the city road improvement project initiated by the previous LDF government in 2008. The estimated expense of the project was Rs. 52 crore then. But the estimate had to be revised, as land acquisition for the project did not happen in time. The UDF government later sanctioned Rs. 60 crore. The current government sanctioned another Rs. 50 crore in 2016. Based on a renewed estimate, an additional Rs. 234.5 crore is needed. The LDF government had promised to pay it in three instalments. The first instalment of Rs. 50 crore was paid in August 2020, second earlier this month, and the third on Monday. Thus the government has kept its promise, the MLA said in the statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/final-instalment-for-road-development-sanctioned/article33605125.ece

19 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Special educators unhappy at proposal||The State Budget proposal to appoint counsellors in schools to teach mild and moderate differently-abled students has not gone down well with special educators who have been doing the job for long. Special educators are teachers with a Bachelor of Education degree in special education, while school counsellors are graduates in social work. There are 2,320 special educators across the State. They address the academic needs of students from the pre-primary level to the higher secondary section. They are appointed on contract basis and have been part of projects such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, and Inclusive Education for the Disabled. They also handle ‘White Board’, the online education scheme for disabled students, home-based education, and medical camps under block resource centres, among others. “School counsellors address the emotional needs of differently-abled students. They need not know teaching techniques,” some special educators from the Malabar region told The Hindu on Monday. They are registered under the Rehabilitation Council of India and are supposed to renew their registration every five years. Job security Special educators also claimed that they had no job security, as they were part of projects which could be wound up any time. The State government is also not willing to implement a Kerala High Court order issued on June 30, 2016, which sought regularisation of services of those who have put in 10 years in the profession, they pointed out. Though some special educators were earlier under the District Institutes of Education and Training, which come under the Education Department, they were made part of the Samagra Shiksha Keralam (SSK) soon after the High Court order. This was followed by a cut in salaries for some. Salary cuts The salary of special educators in higher secondary schools was slashed from Rs. 28,815 to Rs. 25,000 in 2018. Those in primary schools are getting Rs. 20,000 a month. “Officials say since we are part of a Central project, our salary can be given only from the funds being released from time to time.

Policymakers, academics, professionals, and domain experts from across the globe attending the event will also brainstorm the crucial linkages between entrepreneurship, economic growth, and poverty alleviation, which are in tune with the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). ICGE is a signature event of the Gender Park. The three-day conference will also discuss ways to make entrepreneurship and social businesses more gender-inclusive, to facilitate the active participation of women and transgenders. The focal theme of the event is ‘Gender in Sustainable Entrepreneurship and Social Business: The Mediating Role of Empowerment’. Though women entrepreneurship in the State has made rapid growth, it has not been properly recorded. In the case of transgenders, even accurate statistics regarding their entrepreneurship are not available, since the issue has never been a topic of serious debate. The Gender Park views the theme of ICGE to be relevant for India and more so for Kerala, with high levels of educated unemployment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/meet-to-focus-on-economic-potential-of-women-tgs/article33605123.ece

19 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,KERALA||Do not lower guard yet, warn health experts||Kerala’s COVID-19 curve might be on an extended plateau but the State’s active case pool has been rising slowly in three weeks. The test positivity has stayed between 9-11% in the past three months. Though the new relaxations in public life and the arrival of vaccines seem to have given rise to a feeling that the pandemic is on its way out, the situation in many hospitals tells a different story. “The COVID patient numbers might have stabilised in our ICUs but we now see patients who are a lot sicker and their hospital stays are prolonged. Yet people are refusing to test,” says A. Rajalekshmi, senior consultant, Infectious Diseases, KIMS hospital. “Earlier, we advised home care and isolation only for Category A patients. Now, even COVID patients with co-morbidities are remaining home, turning up at hospitals when their symptoms worsen. The number of people brought dead to hospitals and who turn out to be COVID positive has gone up,” says Suma T.K., Professor, Internal Medicine, Alappuzha Govt Medical College. Doctors and health workers say people no longer fear COVID and have been taking the protocols lightly. Almost an year into the pandemic, field-level activities linked to COVID management, including the vigorous contact tracing and testing and consistent follow-up of COVID patients on home isolation has slackened. If COVID patients now come into hospitals sicker, it points to the failure of the health system to follow up those on home isolation and ensure that they reach hospitals on time. Focus shifts to polls The public perception that the pandemic is nearly over is fuelled by the fact that the political attention has diverted from COVID to upcoming Assembly elections. The lack of political interest and support has impacted field-level activities, health workers say. The biggest challenge faced by Health officials is the stiff resistance shown by people to testing. “We test about 1,500 persons daily but our efforts to double the figure are thwarted by lack of public cooperation. People fear stigma and disruption of their normal life,” says a health official from Kasaragod. The best bet still “ICU occupancy is a reliable indicator of the extent of the pandemic and our COVID-19 ICUs are slowly filling up. Kerala’s TPR indicates that the pandemic is very much around. But indoor and outdoor events are happening everywhere and schools are opening up. Vaccines cannot reduce the spread of the pandemic anytime soon because it cannot prevent asymptomatic infections or spread. Our best bet would still be masking and physical distancing,” says Rajeev Jayadevan, a clinician.  ICU occupancy is a reliable indicator of the extent of the pandemic and our COVID-19 ICUs are slowly filling up.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/do-not-lower-guard-yet-warn-health-experts/article33605231.ece

19 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||New challenge awaits local body members||Having emerged triumphant at the hustings, yet another challenge awaits the newly-elected local body members in the State. The representatives of local bodies will soon undergo a full-fledged academic programme that will involve classroom sessions, online learning, examinations and dissertation. Marking a unique collaboration seldom witnessed in the State, Sree Narayana Guru Open University has joined hands with the Kerala University of Digital Science, Innovation and Technology (Digital University) and Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA) to conduct a six-month certificate course under distance education mode on decentralisation and local governance starting March first week. Unlike the regular training programmes conducted by KILA to groom local body members, the course will provide an opportunity for people’s representatives to undergo an in-depth study. Joy Elamon, director-general, KILA, said it would focus on the peculiarities in the State, even while imparting lessons on decentralised governance. The course content will be delivered at three levels – virtual learning, contact sessions that will be held in each district at least once a month and through distribution of study materials. While at least half of the nearly 21,000 local body members could enrol for the course, a minimum of 5,000 participants is expected to complete the course successfully, Dr. Elamon said. Sree Narayana Guru Open University Vice Chancellor P.M. Mubarak Pasha said the ‘students’ would have to earn 16 academic credits by clearing examinations and other activities to obtain the course certificate that would be issued by the university. The participants will also be required to chalk out five-year perspective plans for their respective wards during the course of the programme. The digital university will conduct a module on technology in governance that will delve upon e-governance. The possibility of employing data intelligence analytics in governance, geospatial planning for resource management, and e-commerce to market local produce were some futuristic avenues that could prove relevant in the times to come, Kerala University of Digital Sciences, Innovation and Technology Vice Chancellor Saji Gopinath said. Multimedia The university will also play a role in integrating multimedia tools such as augmented reality in the content prepared by the other associating establishments. The online content will be delivered in both synchronous and asynchronous manner to enable the participants to view instructional materials offline at a convenient time.  A six-month certificate course under distance education mode to begin from March first week.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/new-challenge-awaits-local-body-members/article33605121.ece
19 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||CAG’s comments can hurt State’s interests, says Isaac||Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac has said the comments by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) in the State Finance Audit Report have “incalculable potential to hurt the interests of the State gravely and cause detriment to the development vision that the government had drawn for the people.” In his observations while tabling the CAG report for the year ending March 2019 in the Assembly on Monday, Dr. Isaac said the manner in which it had been prepared was ‘ultra vires’ of the Regulations of the CAG itself. “This may have to be addressed separately in a manner the government deems fit,” he said. Grave violation The Minister said there was a grave violation on the part of the CAG in the manner of preparation and submission of the audit report sent by the Accountant General, Kerala, to the government for submission to the Governor and thereafter placing it in the Assembly under Article 151 of the Constitution. Dr. Isaac pointed out that both the Regulations on Audit and Accounts, 2007, and the Regulations on Audit and Accounts (Amendments) 2020 emphasise the “sacrosanct nature of how comments, observations and explanations” in any audit report by the CAG have to be treated. He said the State had to be given an opportunity to offer its comments or explanation. The draft audit report can be modified based on the reply from government or the reply of the government can be rejected. “But, nothing permits inclusion of any new comment that has not been communicated to the government,” he said, adding the Minutes of the Exit meeting held on June 22, 2019 had not reached the government. The significant variation in the contents of the draft and the final report pertain to the borrowings of the KIIFB. The draft report and the report sent for submission to the Governor are “materially different,” he said. Controversy The CAG report had become controversial after Dr. Isaac revealed the contents at a press conference before tabling it in the House alleging that the CAG had violated procedures in the preparation and submission of the report. The Privileges and Ethics Committee of the Assembly is examining the breach of privilege notice moved by MLA V.D. Satheesan against Dr. Isaac.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cags-comments-can-hurt-states-interests-says-isaac/article33605221.ece

The KWA has finalised a decision to set up the treatment plant on five acres of land owned by the Irrigation Department in Kallikadu village in Kattakada taluk. The State-run water utility has decided to seek clearance from the State government for constructing the water treatment facilities on this site. Incidentally, the KWA’s initial choice was another site, a six-acre plot it had received in a nearby location over which an ownership dispute had subsequently developed. This delayed the Rs. 56.2-crore project. The present decision to change the location would not cause any major disruption in the scope of work or incur additional financial commitment, a KWA official said. One of the biggest water supply projects in the KWA kitty at the moment, the Neyyar project envisages a supply of 100 million litres a day (mld) to Thiruvananthapuram city, while 20 mld will be supplied to the Vilappil, Vilavoorkal, Maranalloor and Malayinkeezhu panchayats. Although the project was initially scheduled for commissioning by March 2021, disputes regarding the six acres transferred by the Irrigation Department to the KWA in 2018 delayed the project. The KWA had awarded the contract for constructing the treatment plant at Neyyar to the Thiruvananthapuram-based Chicago Constructions International Pvt Ltd in 2019. The government had issued orders transferring the six acres held by the Irrigation Department to the KWA in February 2020. Floating intake The 120-mld project involves the deployment of a floating intake system in the Neyyar reservoir, allied infrastructure, and the construction of the treatment plant. The construction of a transmission main to the capital city is being taken up as a separate project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kwa-s-water-supply-project-to-move-to-alternative-plot/article33605202.ece

He was speaking at an interaction organised by the Kerala Startup Mission with the founders of various start-up companies based in Kerala here on Monday to collect their opinions and suggestions on the steps that the government needed to take in the sector. He said that the government would take steps to promote the products and services from start-ups. The delay in providing funds from the various departments to start-ups for services rendered would be addressed. Marketing facilities for start-up products would be ensured. A national-level launchpad to get more aid for start-ups would become a reality this year. Mr. Vijayan said a system to ensure adequate consideration for start-ups in government projects would be considered. Mobile applications The departments would have permission to purchase mobile applications or software applications costing up to Rs. 20 lakh from start-ups, he said. Permission had also been accorded to departments, PSUs, local self government bodies, and boards to purchase products or services up to Rs. 1 crore from start-ups registered with the Startup Mission through limited tender. As of now, the rents for four months had been waived for start-ups, while the rent was waived partially for the three months after that. More than 50 start-ups had gained from the project for introducing start-ups to big corporates to find markets and financial support, he said. “Several persons from the IT field have helped the government in various ways over the past few years. The development that we have witnessed in the IT sector and in the start-up ecosystem in the State itself is the result of such contributions and inputs from within the sector. The opinions and suggestions that have come to the government through discussions at various levels went a long way in achieving this,” he said. Founders of around 50 start-up organisations were physically present at the interactive session, while 100 others joined through an online conference. The start-up representatives shared with the CM their suggestions for the improvement of the IT sector in the State. IT Secretary Mohammed Y.

For three years, the officials handling the project have been on the look out for land for the third phase of the project, in which landless families will be accommodated in flat complexes. Though the officials had identified land in some wards in the outskirts of the city, the price of land has often come as a roadblock. The civic body has been unable to match the price demanded by the land owners, most of whom wanted amounts close to the market rate. The Corporation officials had requested the State government for more flexibility in the fixing of the rates, but a favourable response has not been received yet. The Fisheries Department had issued such an order for some of its housing projects two years back, enabling the acquisition of land at rates close to the market rates. "Some of the plots that we had identified are still under consideration. A decision regarding these has to be taken by the newly-elected council. As of now, a flat project under the LIFE project has begun at Poonkulam. This land was acquired earlier for a housing project under the Basic Services for the Urban Poor (BSUP) project," said an official. 14,000 applications In the latest call for applications for the LIFE project in October, more than 14,000 applications were received in the city Corporation. Out of this, 3800 applicants own land of their own and need only money for construction of an individual housing unit. The remaining applications are for accommodation in the flat complexes which are part of the project. In the second phase of call for applications, as many as 18,008 applications were received, out of which 9000 applicants were short-listed following the scrutiny process and adalat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/corpn-searches-for-land-for-life-project/article33605704.ece

When the commission sought reports from the PCB and the District Collector, the PCB gave a clean chit to the company carrying out the quarrying operations saying that it was operating in accordance with the PCB guidelines. On the other hand, the District Collector reported that the petitioner’s house had sustained damage and that the people in the neighbourhood faced hardships due to the dust from the quarrying operation. Given this situation, commission chairman Antony Dominic ordered the District Environmental Engineer of the PCB to submit a fresh report after visiting the quarry and interacting with the local people. The district officer of the Department of Mining and Geology has been directed to examine whether the quarry operations had caused the damage to Mr. Sreejith’s house.

Addressing a gathering at Upparapalli in Anantapur district after distribution of house site pattas as part of the ‘Jagananna Pedalandariki Illu’ scheme on Monday, the Minister said the YSRCP government had never used religion for political gain and doling out the benefits of all welfare schemes to the beneficiaries irrespective of their political affiliations. Referring to the incidents of idols stolen in Guntur on Sunday and a similar incident in Anantapur, Mr. Satyanarayana said never had the YSRCP played with the religious sentiments of people. “People voted in favour of the YSRCP in 2019 elections and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is keeping the promises he had made during his padayatra. Had the TDP government done something good for the people, they would not have voted for us,” said Mr. Satyanarayana.

19 January 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Crop loss: ryots assured of help||Agriculture Advisor to Government Ambati Krishna Reddy has assured farmers of Anantapur district of justice when they represented to him on the crop loss and damages due to excess rain during the monsoon. Mr. Krishna Reddy visited a couple of Bengalgram fields in Yadiki mandal, Rythu Bharosa Kendra at Patha Kotcheruvu in Gooty mandal, groundnut fields of two farmers, and agriculture market yard at Gooty, which is one of the two purchase centres for cotton in the district. He interacted with Joint Director of Agriculture Y. Ramakrishna on the representations given by farmers. Input subsidy The farmers said that those in 30 mandals did not get input subsidy or weather-based insurance though in practice their yields had fallen drastically. The Joint Director of Agriculture explained that due to the ‘randomisation’ of plots in the CCE, many mandals had shown more than average yield for the groundnut, but practically most of the farmers lost the crop. For many farmers validation of e-crop booking and insurance of the crop at MeeSeva and banks led to duplication in the same survey numbers with 9.5 lakh insurance policies detected against six lakh farmers. “The validation process of weather-based insurance and e-cropping was in progress and the final figure will emerge soon,” Mr. Ramakrishna added. Mr. Krishna Reddy later told mediapersons that he would prepare a report soon based on the representations, data given by the officials, and his personal experience during the visit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/crop-loss-ryots-assured-of-help/article33604933.ece

19 January 2021||B. Madhu Gopal,ANDHRA PRADESH||NGO helps tribal farmers get irrigation water||The tribal farmers of Logili village of Dumbriguda mandal in the Agency area of the district will no longer have to look skywards for rain. Thanks to the initiative of Vikasa, an NGO, the path has been cleared for the supply of water through gravity to their fields. HDPE pipes have been laid for a length of 2 km from the water stream to divert it to the fields. The project has reached the pilot testing stage and water is now reaching the fields. A cluster of 31 acres, belonging to 50 tribal families are benefited by the project. “During an interaction, the tribal farmers told us about their difficulties as they had to solely depend on rainwater for irrigation and sought our help. We decided to involve the farmers in the project as our idea is to develop a sense of ownership and responsibility among the beneficiaries, once the project is completed,” S. Kiran, executive director of Vikasa, told this correspondent. “The planning for the project began one-and-a-half years ago, but it was delayed by about eight months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A donor, who promised to contribute, had also backed out. We raised funds locally with the farmers themselves meeting 26% of the project cost through ‘shram daan’ and 9% in cash,” he said. “We raised funds from various organisations and the major contributors include Lotus Wireless Technologies, of Visakhapatnam city, which contributed Rs. 1.8 lakh as part of its CSR activity, and BIRDS organisation of Kurnool, which gave Rs. 1 lakh,” Mr. Kiran said. “Once the project was finalised, a check-dam was constructed with ‘shram daan’, trenches were dug from the source to the fields, after completion of the scientific studies on the elevation. The pipes were laid and plumbing work was done. Pipes were also laid from the plot to the mainline and testing was done to check the water flow. The design was given by Water and Livelihood Foundation of Hyderabad,” he said. “The project was completed at a total cost of Rs. 18 lakh with 45% of the cost going towards the purchase of HDPE pipes. The diameter of the mainline is 110 mm, while it is 50 mm at the end point. The diameter has to be reduced to maintain the pressure of water,” says Mr. Kiran. “A decade ago, we provided drinking water through gravity in the same village (Logili) ,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ngo-helps-tribal-farmers-get-irrigation-water/article33605739.ece
19 January 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Inter-State meet planned to tackle jumbo menace in Chittoor district||Forest officials of Chittoor district have planned to convene an inter-State meeting involving their counterparts from Hosur and Vellore districts (Tamil Nadu) and Kolar district of Karnataka to chalk out an action plan to address the man-animal conflict at the tri-State junction. The movement of wild elephants, which had been limited to the Koundinya wildlife sanctuary and the neighbouring forests of T.N. and Karnataka, has now gone as far as 150 km away from the habitat, making efforts to drive them back into the thickets futile many times. The original number of about 45 resident jumbos in the sanctuary belt has seen a rise with addition of migratory herds. This phenomenon has worried officials and general public equally. whatwith the instances of human casualties in the district, apart from electrocution of three elephants since June 2020. Only a couple of days ago, a wild elephant was killed after being hit by a container near Hosur in Tamil Nadu, a few kilometers away from Kuppam in Chittoor district. Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor) S. Ravi Shankar told The Hindu that during the preliminary study of the elephant corridor across three States, it was observed that there was a tremendous growth in population of elephants, which in turn has led to an increase in their uncontrolled movement from T.N. and Karnataka towards Chittoor district. ‘We must act fast’ “We cannot let the disturbing scenario at the tri-State junction continue for long. We want our counterparts of TN and Karnataka to understand what is actually going on in our district. We also want to know the exact causes which are forcing the elephants from neighbouring States to frequently cross into Chittoor district and stay put for longer periods,” the DFO said. Focussing on solutions The agenda would delve into prime aspects of the terrain of the pachyderms across three States and the problems such as habitat disturbances and jumbo population, erection of trenches and fencing to avoid crop raids, Mr. Ravi Shankar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/three-state-meeting-mooted-to-address-jumbo-movement/article33604842.ece

Mr. Narasimha Rao told reporters that the State government was ‘indirectly supporting’ the attacks on temples by not taking stringent action against the accused. “The police have booked Praveen Chakravarthy, but did not charge him under serious offences. Moreover, they have not investigated his role in converting Hindus with the help of foreign funds. The police, instead of arresting the culprits, are now charging BJP supporters who have posted their views on social media. The BJP demands that the State government come out with the number of pastors, and how much the State government is paying them from the taxes collected from the people. I have written to a letter to Home Minister Amit Shah on this issue,’’ said Mr. Rao. Yatra from Kapilateertham He further said that the BJP would take out a yatra from Kapilatheertham to Ramatheertham in Vizianagaram district and anyone who dares to stop the yatra, would face severe consequences. He also demanded that the State government bail out farmers who were facing losses due to poor quality of seeds. The State government should come to the aid of farmers from the Disaster Management Funds provided by the Centre, he said. “The State government is diverting all the funds to the Navaratnalu and even funds allocated to the corporations have been diverted,” he said.

Ravindranath Reddy alias B.Tech Ravi has accused the State government of trying to terrorise the opposition party leaders by framing them in false cases. Speaking to the media at the Kadapa central prison upon his release on bail on Monday, the MLC said he was ready to face any number of such ‘false’ cases as he strongly believed that they would all blow away. He accused the ‘educated and well-mannered’ police officials of making false statements during his arrest. “First they said they were arresting me under Prevention of SC/ST Atrocities Act and later changed it to the riots case. Hitting out at the government for slapping cases under Prevention of SC/ST Atrocities Act on most of the TDP leaders, the MLC wondered in a derisive tone if it was ‘Raja Reddy constitution’ in vogue in the State. In the same vein, he advised Chief Minister and his arch rival Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to focus his time and attention on nabbing the culprit behind the murder of the latter’s paternal uncle Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy. Three cases It may be recalled that Mr. Ravi was picked up by the district police at Chennai airport on January 3 pertaining to a 2018 riots case in Pulivendula town, in which a Sub-Inspector was injured in the melee. Two more cases were booked against him when he was in remand. The Pulivendula Magistrate granted him bail in the three cases. TDP Kadapa parliamentary constituency in-charge Swetha Reddy, State organising secretary B. Hariprasad, district official spokesperson Peeraiah and Mr. Ravi’s family members thronged the prison.

Taking part in a roundtable here on Monday, Communist Party of India(CPI) State secretary K. Ramakrishna said members of the AIKS, the farmers’ wing of the CPI, would intensify the agitation in the State in support of the farmers who have been organising a peaceful protest for about two months in over 20,000 centres in 22 States in the country, drawing global attention. Even after nine rounds of talks, the Centre remained stubborn and refused to repeal the laws, passed in the most “undemocratic” manner without taking on board the opinion of States, though agriculture was a ‘state subject’, he lamented. The party-led AIKS would also step up stir against amendments to the Electricity Act, the CPI leader added. ‘It is a hangman’s noose’ The ruling YSR Congress Party in the State was forcing the farmers to accept metering of farm pump sets, which would prove to be a hangman’s noose for the farmers in the long run, said AIKS national vice-president Ravula Venkaiah.

19 January 2021||NELLORE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Spell out your stand on port project: Cong. to BJP||Activists of the Congress party staged a demonstration in front of the Sub-Collector’s office in Gudur town in SPSR Nellore district urging the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA Government to take up Dugarajaptanam port project without any further delay. It was unfortunate the Centre had ‘shelved’ the most important development project promised to the State at the time of bifurcation to curry favours to a private port player in the district, they alleged. They accused the BJP of playing the Hindutva card ahead of the Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election with a view to divert people’s attention from the raw deal meted to the State after bifurcation. The protesters led by Congress Sarvepalli Assembly segment in-charge P.Chandrasekar and Venkatagiri Assembly segment in-charge P.Srinivasulu Reddy said the BJP was raking up the issue of attacks on temples for electoral gains in the Tirupati Lok Sabha bypoll. “It is not temples but grounding of development projects that is the need of the hour,” said the leaders. The country’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had paid attention to grounding major infrastructure projects and described these projects, including Nagarjunasagar, the lifeline of the State, as “temples of modern India”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/spell-out-your-stand-on-port-project-cong-to-bjp/article33604938.ece

Bitragunta village in Prakasam district on Monday. “An idol of Lord Krishna and another of a queen praying to Lord Satyanarayana Swamy were found desecrated on Monday.

The arrests came close on the heels of the police nabbing eight persons, including six scribes on the charge of 'spreading falsehood’ on the social media and through electronic media, ‘hurting’ the sentiments of devotees based on rumours spread by a local person that the idols of Narasimha Swammy and the mother goddess in the welcome arch were vandalised by unidentified persons on January 5. Detailed probe “'Law will take its own course,” said Prakasam Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal while giving the details of the two cases registered against the arrested persons. “A detailed probe is on.

19 January 2021||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||Vaccination: no major adverse effect reported in district||The vaccination programme for COVID-19 in the district started on January 16 at 32 session sites or vaccination centres and in the last two days over 2,000 health workers had taken the jab. According to the Health Department, there was only one case of adverse effect following inoculation. The officials indicated that the affected health worker has been suffering from chronic hypertension for quite some time and faced some anxiety issues after vaccination, but she is now out of danger. District COVID-19 Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar said that the turnout was around 65% at the session sites. “Among the frontline health workers who turned out for the vaccination drive, about 65% of them were given the jab, around 15% were rejected for being either pregnant women or lactating mothers or having some allergic issues and around 20% did not turn out, probably due to some apprehensions,” he said. “But our turnout rate is far better than that of USA, where it is around 35%,” said Dr. Sudhakar. The AMC Principal, who was one among the first people to receive the jab, said he didn’t face any side effects in the last 48 hours. The health officials say that there are some issues with the Co-WIN app, which is maintained and monitored by the Union government. The prime issue in Visakhapatnam district in the last two days, has been repetition of names. A person who was given the vaccine on the first day found his name on the second or third day also. And these were not just stray cases, they are frequent and numbering close to 25 to 30%. What is happening is that genuine persons among the health workers are being left out due to the repetition and people who have already taken the vaccine will not take it again. “This is reducing the effective turnout,” said Dr. Sudhakar. The Health Department suggests that the enrolment part in the app should be decentralised. They feel that the State should be given a login and it should be further decentralised to the district-level. “This can reduce the repetition factor and will also give the opportunity to reschedule those who have missed out,” said a senior doctor from the District Medical and Health Department. “We do not know if this problem is there in other places, but in our district we have been facing this issue. It could be due to wrong feeding of data or wrong use of the app also,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vaccination-no-major-adverse-effect-reported-in-vizag-district/article33605636.ece
19 January 2021||TIRUMALA,ANDHRA PRADESH||TTD awaits govt. nod to increase toll fee||The TTD is seriously contemplating the proposal to enhance the toll fee being collected at its Alipiri security checking plaza in Tirupati, the gateway to the sacred hill abode of Lord Venkateswara. It has addressed a letter to the government seeking its approval. The TTD operates two ghat roads between Tirumala and Tirupati and collects fee as per the rates approved by the State government. According to estimates about 4,000 to 4,500 four-wheelers ply on the ghat roads daily in addition to about 1,000 motorcycles fetching TTD a whopping revenue of around Rs. 4 crore annually. Though the TTD proposed to enhance the toll fee in December 2000 (after a gap of four years since the last increase in September 1996) through a resolution No. 656, it somehow could not implement the revised rates. After a gap of nearly 20 years, the TTD again proposed to enhance the toll through a resolution No.300 in February 2020 and addressed a letter to the government seeking approval of the new rates according to which the two-wheelers will be exempted form paying any toll and a uniform fee to be collected from for all types of Light Commercial Vehicle (LCV)s and Light Motor Vehicles (LMV). The Special Chief Secretary to government, Revenue (Endowments III), after going thorough the proposals in August 2020, hinted at further enhancement of the tariff for four-wheelers so as to reduce congestion and pollution atop the town. Imposing of higher tariff for private cars will not only discourage their use but also encourage greater use of public transport which in turn contributes to serene environs atop the town, he opined and sent back the proposals to the TTD for reconsideration. The board, which discussed the subject for the second time, however, felt its resolution adopted in February good and saw no reason for further enhancement of tariff on four wheelers and conveyed the same to the government. Poposed rates Should the proposal get approved in its original form all LCV/LMVs including taxis will be charged a uniform toll of Rs. 50 each, mini buses, lorries and goods vehicles Rs. 100 from their existing rates of Rs. 60 and Rs. 50, lorries and JCBs Rs. 200 from the present Rs. 100 and all two wheelers exempted from payment of toll.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ttd-awaits-govt-nod-to-increase-toll-fee/article33605628.ece

It was the ruling party MLA from Nagari and APIIC Chairperson R.K. Roja who flagged such a complaint in the privileges committee meeting here on Monday. The meeting was chaired by committee’s chief Kakani Govardhan Reddy. Ms. Roja alleged that she was being sidelined frequently by the district officials in violation of the protocols.

Gupta for action. While patting Chittoor district for a clean record in adherence to the protocols and in maintaining the decorum of elected representatives, he called the matter closed since the Collector had assured to sort out the issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/roja-alleges-protocol-violation-by-officials/article33605650.ece
19 January 2021||UPPADA (EAST GODAVARI),ANDHRA PRADESH||Fisherman who made it big in the world of weaving||Born to a fisherfolk family in Uppada village in East Godavari district, Ummidi Govind Appayamma has come to be associated with Uppada Jamdani saree. While a saree is usually known by its design, a Uppada Jamdani saree derives its distinctness from the technique used in weaving it. Here, a weaver first makes a sketch of a motif, also called graphic design, on the saree before it is stitched upon. Also, a motif appears the same way on the front and reverse side of the saree in Uppada Jamdani. The graph design, a guide for a weaver in this technique, is the base for the pre-weaving stages of a saree and Mr. Govind is famous for having contributed above 3,000 graph designs of motifs for over two decades. But taking up work in the field of weaving was accidental, Mr. Govind recalls. “As a kid, when I used to visit a house of a weaver, Daivam Srinu, in my street to watch television, the motifs drawn on paper greatly attracted me. Later, Mr. Srinu, who was impressed with my drawing skill, encouraged me to draw more in later days.” “At 15, I was able to handle the graph design on my own. In my school life, I earned the fame of being the Jamdani graph designer after learning the technical aspects of graph design. I remember that the weavers used to offer me sweets in return of my work,” said Mr. Govind who is still working for Mr. Ganesh as a mark of respect. Today, he charges Rs. 3,000 per design. “The graph design of a motif is permanent. The owner preserves it as long as s/he wants it. Of over 3,000 designs which I have drawn, at least 600 designs are my own, inspired from birds, flowers and nature,” explained Mr. Govind. The 36-year-old’s tryst with weaving has made him so famous that every weaver in Uppada preserves his work. “Fishing is my family occupation but I share a special bond with the art of weaving. I became a man of two occupations - weaving and fishing. The occupational diversity of my village gave me such opportunity to explore the both occupations,” he said. Daivam Srinu who introduced Mr. Govind to the art and Daivam Ganesh, the leading master weaver of Uppada sarees told The Hindu: “Mr. Govind is an unsung hero of our art. We are all dependent on him for getting our work done.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/fisherman-who-made-it-big-in-the-world-of-weaving/article33604929.ece

Praveen Kumar heard arguments in the writ appeal made by the State Election Commission (SEC) against the stay imposed on the proposed conduct of Gram Panchayat elections in February, and posted the matter for further hearing to Tuesday (January 19). Advocate-General S.

He reiterated that the government was not in a position to go ahead with the polls as administering the vaccine is more important for it at the moment given the fears of resurgence of the pandemic and a new variant of the virus striking vulnerable people. Senior counsel B. Adinarayana Rao appeared for the SEC while another senior advocate, D.V.

Rama Rao on the occasion of his 25th death anniversary on Monday. TDP national president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu paid floral tributes to Rama Rao at the NTR Ghat in Hyderabad. Later in the day, he participated in a programme organised at the TDP central office at Mangalagiri. Speaking the occasion, Mr. Naidu said that Rama Rao had sown the seeds of welfare schemes.

He had put efforts to promote women education and set up a Mahila University. NTR had ushered in several people-friendly initiatives such as mandal and single window systems for administrative convenience,” recalled Mr. Naidu. Reiterating that the TDP had written many letters to the Union government seeking conferment of Bharat Ratna on NTR, he said the Centre has to consider the outstanding services rendered by NTR at the national level. “It was NTR who brought all non-Congress parties including the BJP and the Left parties to a single platform. His role in providing an alternative to the Congress was memorable,” said Mr. Naidu. Responding to statements that NTR Ghat would be demolished, Mr. Naidu likened it to ‘destroying the very culture of Telugu people’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ntr-ushered-in-era-of-welfare-driven-politics/article33604850.ece

The Minister inaugurated the 32nd Road Safety Awareness Month at the Collectorate here on Monday.

19 January 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Muttamsetti criticises Somu for announcing ‘rath yatra’||Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao came down heavily on BJP’s State president Somu Veerraju for proposing to launch a ‘rath yatra’ from January 20. Addressing the media here on Monday, the Minister said that BJP leaders like Somu Veerraju should focus on the aspects where the State would stand to benefit. Mr. Srinivasa Rao said that BJP leaders should speak to the Union government to speed up various projects such as the railway zone and to get new projects for the State instead of trying to create problems. He alleged that the BJP has two divisions in the State – one that is original and believes in core ideology of the party and RSS and the other that follows the instructions given by TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu. “I believe Mr. Veerraju is a dedicated worker of the party and belongs to the first division and he should not fall into the trap of Mr. Naidu,” he said. He questioned the intention of the ‘Rath Yatra’ and said that it would disturb peace in the State. “Mr. Advani took up a ‘rath yatra’ when the BJP was in the opposition. Now BJP is the ruling party at the Centre and the State party leaders should follow Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who involved all parties and religious faith during the foundation stone laying ceremony of the Ram Mandir at Ayodhya. Mr. Modi demonstrated the secular power of India, but in the State, the party leaders are focussing on driving the wedge,” he said. He also questioned why BJP had kept quiet when Mr. Naidu had demolished over 40 temples during the pushkaram and not appreciate Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, for ordering the reconstruction of seven temples. Mr. Srinivasa Rao said that Lord Rama belongs to all and he is not the sole property of the BJP. “Even in YSR Congress Party there are Hindus, who compromise over 90%, and even they offer prayers to Rama,” said Mr. Srinivasa Rao.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/muttamsetti-criticises-somu-for-announcing-rath-yatra/article33605646.ece

Loss of livelihood “More than 60% of women working in the agriculture sector are labourers and they have no ownership rights on the land. Only 12% of these women are being identified as farmers. The new farm laws mean total loss of their livelihood,” the Vedika leaders alleged, adding that these laws would not only harm the farmers but also pose a threat to the food security of the nation. Progressive Organisation of Women (POW) State president M. Lakshmi, A.P. Mahila Samakhya executive president A. Vimala, AIDWA State president B. Prabhavathi, Chaitanya Mahila Sangham district secretary D. Lalitha and representatives of various women’s organisations were among those who participated in the rally. N. Nirmala, a retired professor, flagged off the rally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/women-activists-rally-against-new-farm-laws/article33605747.ece

Nagarjuna Reddy said that due to the decisions taken in the financial year 2019-20, the State government has saved Rs. 200 crore on power purchase. He was delivering the inaugural address for the three-day public hearing on Aggregate Revenue Requirement and tariff filing for Financial Year 2021-22 at the APEPDCL office here on Monday. Due to the the prevailing COVID-19 situation, the hearing was held online for all the three Discoms APEPDCL, APCPDCL and APSPDCL. He said that the APERC will take a balanced decision keeping in view the financial position of the Discoms and interests of consumers. Justice Nagarjuna Reddy also pointed out that due to COVID -19, the last date for payment of power consumption charges for the months of March and April 2020, was extended up to June, 2020. Thus consumers have got exemption on ‘Delayed Payment Surcharge (DPS)’ on charges. He said that in Power Purchase Plan for the financial year 2020-21, power plants, without PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements) were excluded. He said that power tariffs for financial years 2014-15, 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 submitted by the Discoms were approved ensuring that there was less burden on consumers than the actual power purchase expenditure. APERC Member Thakur Ram Singh received views, objections and suggestions about Discoms from people through video conference. Chairman and Managing Directors three Discoms — Nagalakshmi Selvarajan (APEPDCL), H. Haranatha Rao (APSPDCL) and J. Padma Janardhan Reddy (APCPDCL) — read out their tariff proposals. A total of 53 persons had registered to express their objections, suggestions and views. APERC Secretary C. Ramakrishna, Deputy Secretary Energy B.A.V.P.

The party activists staged a demonstration at the corporate office of the Eastern Power Distribution Company of Andhra Pradesh Limited (AP EPDCL) on Monday even as the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) launched a three-day programme to elicit public opinions on the proposed power sector reforms. The CPI (M) leaders said that the government was trying to install meters for agricultural pumpsets, promote cash benefit transfers and withdraw the concessions being extended to the SCs, STs and BCs. “The government is planning to handover the RECS in rural areas to Discoms and the move will render hundreds of persons jobless. The Centre and State governments are planning to tax farmers and general public in the name of power reforms,” they alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cpi-m-opposes-move-to-hike-power-tariff/article33605745.ece

The Sub-Inspector, who was in civil dress, was returning from in-laws’ house at Sivannapeta, tried to caution them to ride the motorbike properly which led to a clash. The incident turned into a major controversy as family members of the youths alleged that the Sub-Inspector used foul language and beat them up severely.

19 January 2021||VIZIANAGARAM/SRIKAKULAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Construction workers rue hike in steel, cement prices||Over 26,000 construction workers have lost their livelihood in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts as the real estate sector came to a grinding halt with cement and steel prices touching an all-time high. Steel, which was available at Rs. 45,000 per tonne, is now selling for over Rs. 60,000. A cement bag which cost Rs. 260 six months ago is now costing Rs. 350. Non-availability of sand and a hike in transport charges for carrying construction material have also turned into a bane for the construction industry in the north Andhra region. Workers rued that they are unable to get jobs in irrigation projects and road works in the last one-and-a-half years. “The government’s direct cash benefits are not enough for us as the amount is sufficient only for one week. We used to earn around Rs. 350 per day. But we have been without any work for the last two months,” said M. Appalaraju, a worker from Ayyannapeta in Vizianagaram mandal. CITU State general secretary D. Govinda Rao said that the construction industry was the lone source of income for many workers in Srikakulam district. “With no work in cities like Hyderabad, Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam, many workers have returned to their native places in Srikakulam district. They are also ineligible for welfare measures of the government as they have ID proofs and ration cards at other places. The situation will take a turn for the worse if more workers return to Srikakulam where getting work is an uphill task,” he added. A.P. State general secretary of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India K. Subhash Chandra Bose said that the situation would have a cascading effect on electricians, plumbers and supervisers. “There is no upward revision in material costs for cement and steel companies. But they have hiked the prices steeply in the absence of a controlling mechanism. A committee should be appointed to look into the issue as there will be a huge burden on the government which is also taking up ambitious housing programmes for downtrodden sections,” he said. Cement and iron dealers are also unhappy with the steep hike in prices which led to a drop in sales. “Around 55,000 tonnes of cement was sold per month till August 2020. But sales have now come down to 30,000 tonnes in the last month. All-time high steel prices have also impacted the sale of cement,” said Baratam Kameswara Rao, president of Srikakulam Cement, Iron and Hardware Dealers Association.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/construction-workers-rue-hike-in-steel-cement-prices/article33605630.ece

They said that the founder, N.T. Rama Rao, had a special place in the hearts of people in the State as he had strived hard for the development of the region. On the occasion of N.T. Rama Rao’s death anniversary, the party leaders offered floral tributes at his statues in Vizianagaram, Rajam, Srikakulam, Palasa and other places.

Former Minister for Medical and Health and Rajam party In-charge Kondru Muralimohan said: “Rama Rao created a history by ensuring victory for 30 Parliament seats out of 42 in United AP in 1984 elections despite there being a sentiment in public for the Congress party that had just then lost its stalwart leader and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He has become an icon of Telugu pride,” said Mr.Kondru Muralimohan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/leaders-vow-to-revive-past-glory-of-tdp/article33605633.ece

19 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||VC appointments only after CM meets Governor||The exercise of appointing the Vice-Chancellors of Telangana universities will be taken up only after Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao meets Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, sources say. Though the government has made a beginning in this regard, the exercise will gain momentum only after the meeting where the CM wishes to personally discuss a few issues. The government is considering a possible situation of the Governor returning the appointments file with objections and doesn’t want to land in such a predicament. Search committee The thinking stems from the fact that the Governor has, so far, not approved the file related to the second term of Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences Vice-Chancellor Karunakar Reddy. She apparently withheld the file on the grounds that no search committee was constituted for the appointment while the government maintains that such a panel was mandatory for only fresh appointments and not for extension of term. As per the accepted practice, the search committee, along with nominees from the university, government and the University Grants Commission (UGC), suggests three names with CM’s choice at the top of the list. The Governor in the normal course accepts and gives the nod. Rarely is the file sent back. Therefore, the government wishes to share its views over the appointments with the Governor first, explaining the social balancing strategy and rules followed before taking up the process. Without a VC Meanwhile, a majority of universities have been functioning without a head for the past 18 months, although in the last one year, there was no possibility of taking up the exercise due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That reduced some amount of pressure on the government. Apart from demands from teachers and students, the delay has also acquired a political hue with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) questioning the motive over the delay. The party members also took up the issue with the Governor recently. Presently, most universities are headed by IAS officers following completion of tenure of respective VCs in July 2019. Osmania University and Mahatma Gandhi University are headed by Principal Secretary of Municipal Administration Arvind Kumar, Satavahana University by T. Chiranjeevulu and Kakatiya University by Agriculture Commissioner B. Janardhan Reddy. Palamuru University and Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies are managed by Rahul Bojja, Secretary and Commissioner of Scheduled Caste Development. Other IAS officers functioning as in-charge VCs include Neetu Kumari Prasad (Telangana University and Potti Sriramulu Telugu University); Vikas Raj (Dr B.R. Ambedkar Open University); Jayesh Ranjan (Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad) and Chitra Ramchandran (Jawaharlal Nehru Architecture and Fine Arts University). These officers are already burdened with their positions in the government and rarely get time to concentrate on the varsity administration. However, after a long gap, two VCs were recently appointed, filling up the vacancies at Konda Laxman Bapuji Horticulture University and P.V. Narasimha Rao Veterinary Science University. What CM wants Government officials say they are ready to carry out the process for other varsities and all that they are waiting for is a go-ahead from the Chief Minister, who is yet to work out the combinations and permutations of social justice and quality men. “The CM is serious about reviving Osmania University and Kakatiya University, both of which he considers have been highly politicised with academics taking a back seat. He wants some tough men with academic and administrative credentials to set the system back on track and to stem further deterioration,” a source in the government revealed.

Chandrasekhar Rao, of getting new quarters constructed. According to the company officials, the construction of double-bedroom quarters with all basic amenities was under way and all the quarters were expected to be completed by the year-end. Many quarters were already in the advanced stage of construction/completion. The company has taken up construction of 994 quarters at Bhupalapalli, 352 at Sathupalli and 132 at Jaipur near Singareni Thermal Power Project with an estimated cost of Rs. 333 crore. Of the total quarters under construction, 352 houses would be completed by June-end and the construction of the remaining quarters and their allotment would be completed by the year-end. In the past, the residential quarters had only one bedroom, a small hall and small kitchen and the employees who were allotted the quarters were finding it difficult to adjust in the congested quarters. “Now, in line with the State government policies, Singareni employees will be provided double bedroom quarters with spacious hall and kitchen and common area measuring 963 sft per quarter,” Chairman and Managing Director of the company N. Sridhar said. Wide internal roads with dividers, underground drainage system and plantation on either side of the roads were also being developed in the new colonies. Besides, the colonies would also have parks and play areas for children. Stating that only 60-70% of workers were allotted company quarters so far, forcing other employees to live in their own or rented houses, the company officials said construction of quarters was taken up with an objective to provide quarters to all employees of the company.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/singareni-to-build-1478-residential-quarters/article33605553.ece
19 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Waqf ruling stalls key heritage project||Work on the Interpretation Centre of the Quli Qutb Heritage Park has come to a grinding halt following a ruling by the Telangana State Waqf Tribunal. The tribunal gave a temporary injunction on January 8, restraining officials from ‘excavation, transportation of the soil, making/raising/developing any construction in the name of interpretation centre or any other structures in Deccan Park and Aqua Park’. ASI gazette invoked The petitioners invoked Archaeological Survey of India’s Central Gazette Notification of 1992 which prohibits construction within 100 metres from the outer wall of ancient monuments. The petitioners said the interpretation centre would be 60 metres from the outer wall. However, the Qutb Shahi Tombs complex is under the custody of Department of Archaeology and Museums. It is protected under Telangana Heritage (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Maintenance) Act, 2017, which doesn’t specify any area from the monument as protected zone. The importance of the project can be gauged from the fact that the foundation stone for the interpretation centre was laid by Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister K.T. Rama Rao in July 2020. The interpretation centre was being built in the disused Deccan Park from monies granted under Swadesh Darshan grant by the the Central Government to boost tourism. Tourism setback Recently, Telangana government introduced TS-iPass for similar tourism projects to give automatic approval within 30 days. But this stoppage of work will be a setback for the Telangana State Tourism Development Corporation which is carrying out the project. Despite being one of the biggest tourist draws in the city, the medieval site doesn’t have any information centre. The incomplete dome before the entrance is wrongly attributed to the last Qutb Shahi ruler Abul Hasan. It actually has the grave of Mirza Nizamuddin who died in 1674. The interpretation centre was expected to fix this information lacunae. “The interpretation centre is a major facility planned for this incredible site – it is well designed – and is being built with a Central government grant. We, at the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, are providing all technical support and project management for the building,” said an official of AKTC. Heritage activists are livid at the stoppage of work. “This was one project that is being executed by professionals. Every bit of work on the site is peer-reviewed with the best conservation practices. If work is stopped on this site, it will be a real shame,” said historian Sajjad Shahid.

19 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Fewer applications for Haj this year||Lack of clarity about haj season 2021, the COVID–19 pandemic, steady increase in air fare, and cost of accommodation has led to the a massive drop in applications from those in Telangana who wish to make the pilgrimage. According to sources in the Telangana State Haj Committee (TSHC), an agency of the Minorities Welfare Department, which oversees travel, accommodation and guides pilgrims on rituals connected to haj, we have received just about 3,900 applications, a massive drop compared to the over 10,000 applications received last year. The last date of submitting applications was January 10. “So far, we have not received the quota for Telangana from Haj Committee of India, which decides the matter. Apart from this, according to new guidelines, those above 65 years of age will not be allowed to travel. A lot of our pilgrims were senior citizens. But the most important factor is that we do not know if haj season 2021 will happen or not,” a source in the TSHC said. The cost of the pilgrimage has been increasing for the past several years, and with the Centre scrapping the haj subsidy on the directions of the Supreme Court, the cost has escalated further. According to those in the know at the TSHC, the cost in the previous year was around Rs. 2.80 lakh. This cost has increased to approximately Rs. 3.50 lakh this year. While the country saw around 2,100 women opting to make the pilgrimage without a mehram (male relative such as father, brother and husband), Telangana saw no women applying in this category. “The case was the same last year, we did not see any woman applying to go to the pilgrimage under this category,” another official said. The month of Zul Hijjah, when the pilgrimage is made, is expected to correspond to July 11 this year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/fewer-applications-for-haj-this-year/article33605519.ece
19 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Free Telangana Talli from TRS clutches’||Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Monday exhorted different sections of the society to join hands with his party to save and release ‘Telangana Talli’ from the clutches of the short-sighted TRS regime which is only interested in perpetuating the family rule. Addressing a public meeting after admitting former minister A. Chandrshekar into the party, the BJP leader breathed fire against Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and said his ‘dictatorial’ rule has to be put to an end in the next Assembly elections. “Every section of the society has been cheated during the last six years. We need to have another people’s struggle for a true democratic Telangana by politically burying the TRS,” he said. In fact, people of Nagarjunasagar are ready to teach a lesson to the TRS and Mr. K. Chandrasekhar Rao -- just like people of Karimnagar had shown him during the last parliamentary polls, he said. “He tried to ridicule the majority community during the last polls, made disparaging remarks, and paid the price. His actions are only meant for extending the family rule, and not for public good,” he said. The government has been trying to browbeat the party cadre with police but such actions will not work and Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao will be held responsible for every harassed party worker. “The Chief Minister has forgotten every promise he has made to Vikarabad. What happened to the industrial zone or the Palamuru-Ranga Reddy irrigation project?,” he questioned. The Karimnagar MP said Mr. Chandrsekhar Rao has become a ‘laughing stock’ with his ‘U-turns’ and undermining the coronavirus pandemic in the beginning. The promised loan waivers, free supply of urea, doles to the unemployed youth, land to the weaker sections, etc., has been kept aside while the Centre’s funds are being liberally used for welfare schemes without giving any credit, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/free-telangana-talli-from-trs-clutches/article33605542.ece
19 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||‘TRS stalling central welfare schemes’||BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh on Monday charged the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government of “deliberately and calculatedly defeating” central government schemes launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the benefit of the poor. In fact, “the KCR government is creating hurdles in the implementation of a number of schemes meant for people in villages,” he claimed, while addressing party workers. Mr. Chugh, also the party observer for Telangana, called upon the party workers to expose the “inefficient and corrupt practices” of KCR government. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has only promoted “nepotism” in the State by projecting his family members as leaders of the party and has “broken all records of corruption,” he said. Mr. Chugh urged the cadre to take Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s message of development and progress to every house in the State and how it has been providing “good governance” along with “honest administration” in the last seven years. The BJP leader said people of Telangana are “agitated and disappointed” with the current regime in the State. “People are looking for a new hope and a new era to set in and it is the duty of the BJP workers to fulfil their aspirations,” he said. He said historic decisions such as abrogation of Article 370 and 35A and initiating the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya were taken by the Modi government and the party must intensify its campaign to highlight the “achievements.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-stalling-central-welfare-schemes/article33605550.ece
19 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Take call on degree backlog results within 48 hours: HC||Telangana High Court on Monday directed the State government to take a call on the announcement of results of degree backlog examinations within 48 hours. Otherwise, the court would not hesitate to pass adverse orders and impose costs on the government departments concerned, the HC said. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy was hearing a PIL petition filed by Telangana Republican Party stating that the government was planning to conduct admissions to MBA and MCA programmes even as results of degree backlog exams were not yet announced. The petitioner said this action of the government would deprive students of seats in those courses since the government was soon conducting TSICET-2020 spot admissions while degree backlog exam results were scheduled for last week of the month. When the Telangana State Council of Higher Education counsel said a letter was written to the government to conduct special counselling for admission to these courses, the CJ sought to know when was it sent. As the counsel replied that it was sent 10 days ago, the CJ asked what the government departments concerned were doing when the letter was in circulation for that long. It was a matter of students’ future. Any decisions on such crucial issues cannot be taken lightly, the CJ made it clear to the government counsels appearing in the matter. Initially, the CJ gave three days to the government to take a decision on the matter. As the counsel pressed for more time, the CJ said the decision had to be taken within two days. Any failure to do so would compel the court to pass adverse orders and impose costs on the respondents, the CJ cautioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/take-call-on-degree-backlog-results-within-48-hours-hc/article33605512.ece

Strong principles of corporate governance must be the driving force of any company. Transparency, integrity and honesty must be upheld at all times and must be reflected in every business activity,” he advised the company secretaries at their convocation address of the Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI) in Hyderabad on Monday. The V-P said the onus was on the young company secretaries to ensure “ethics and accountability” in corporate governance through their guidance considering that Indian business got a bad name due to the “actions of a few”. But, “you should never swerve from the path of righteousness”, he said and described company secretaries as “conscience- keepers” of the corporate world, and hence, it was imperative to be upright and not succumb to any pressure from the management. Professional bodies such as ICSI must ensure that corporate entities were not only professionally competent but law-abiding too, he said and lauded ICSI’s model codes of governance of gram panchayat and charity governance which have been translated into 12 regional languages. It was a testament to the institute’s commitment towards strengthening governance frameworks at the village or gram level. Mr. Naidu said India had “reasonably fared” better than many countries during these troubled COVID-19 times in taking steps for economic revival. He was hopeful of the economy rebounding in the coming months and urged India Inc to take the lead in making it robust. There was no dearth of talent in the country and need of the hour is to identify and promote the talent, he added and urged the younger generation to be aware of the country’s rich history and great civilisational values. Telangana Home Minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali, ICSI president Ashish Garg and secretary Asish Mohan were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/venkaiah-bats-for-whistle-blowing-in-corporates/article33605523.ece

19 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TRS leaders rebut BJP criticism||Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has alleged that BJP had held its State executive committee meeting on Sunday only for criticising the TRS and its leaders, instead of discussing its own affairs. “The BJP leaders who have failed to get funds or projects to the State from the Centre and have failed in other States are indulging in criticism of the State government and TRS leadership,” TRS legislators Gadari Kishore, S. Saidi Reddy and Shambhipur Raju said here on Monday. Hitting back at BJP for terming TRS leaders as mafia, they said 172 BJP MPs and 26 Union Ministers have serious allegations and cases registered against them. Accusing the BJP of playing with the sentiments of people in the country, they sought to know why Union Home Minister Amit Shah has taken shelter in Delhi when criminal cases are pending against him in Gujarat. The TRS leaders said instead of bringing back black money stashed in foreign banks, the BJP government at the Centre helped those who looted public money. On Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy, they said he had failed to get any funds and schemes from the Centre but is making tall claims on development and welfare measures of the Centre. They alleged that Mr. Kishan Reddy did not quit even his MLA post during the Telangana movement and the TRS had got its legislator Endala Laxminarayana re-elected with thumping majority after he had resigned during the statehood movement. After piggy-riding to power on the issue of Pakistan, the BJP is now trying to exploit the issue of China and Ram Mandir construction, they said and sought to know why the Statue of Unity was fabricated in China when they are pushing for ‘Make in India.’  Why was the Statue of Unity fabricated in China when the Centre is all for Make in India?

R Balu, a daily wager, was upset with the boy for his delay in getting beedies from a nearby shop and also for not performing well in studies, police said. According to KPHB Colony police inspector S Laxmi Narayana, the victim, a student of sixth class, suffered more than 60 % burns and was rushed to Gandhi Hospital, Secunderabad for medical assistance.

In a memorandum submitted to the Governor, Forum secretary M. Padmanabha Reddy said few officials of the Commercial Taxes department hatched a criminal conspiracy along with contractors and duped the government to the tune of Rs. 500 crore. Taking advantage of a judgement of a court case unrelated to the matter, the officials returned Rs. 500 crore VAT collected during the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Reacting to the adverse reports on the return of the money, the then government had ordered An inquiry by the Vigilance and Enforcement Director-General. The inquiry confirmed that the amount was returned to the contractors with a malafide intention and the DG specifically mentioned few officials and requested for immediate action into the issue. The government should have placed the identified officials under suspension and initiated criminal prosecution against them on receipt of information. But there was no concrete action except for routine correspondence for two years. The Revenue department in the Secretariat, delayed in taking action. The accused officials approached the Tribunal and then the High Court after the article of charges was served and the case was pending since last four years. “It is pointed out that the loss of Rs. 500 crore is not a notional loss. The amount was drawn from the bank and returned to the contractors,” the memorandum said. “The Revenue department is intentionally not pursuing the case,” he alleged requesting the Governor to intervene.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/no-action-against-officials-who-duped-government/article33605528.ece

19 January 2021||V. Geetanath,TELANGANA||Bowenpally vegetable market generates own green power||During the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown and subsequent unlock, the Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Vegetable Market Yard in Bowenpally has been a hive of activity. It was not just about arrival of a variety of vegetables from near and far; a new waste-to-power plant was being tried out. The CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) has designed and patented the high rate biomethanation technology based Anaerobic Gas lift Reactor (AGR), for generation of methane-rich biogas and nutrient-rich biomanure. The reactor was undergoing trials and is now ready for launch. Construction of the Rs. 3-crore 10-tonne capacity reactor was completed last year and the trial run in the last six months saw fruit and vegetable waste loads being gradually increased to full capacity to generate power. Up to 800-1,000 units of power can be generated daily by converting 10 tonnes of organic waste. The market committee hopes to generate the power it needs for lighting and other purposes through the plant courtesy off-grid supply. “We have already begun to notice the benefits with the power bill coming down to Rs. 1 lakh from Rs. 3.5 lakh a month earlier,” says market secretary L. Srinivas. Since the vegetable market is able to generate 3-4 tonnes a day, the remaining waste is being sourced from other bazaars and supermarkets to make up for the load to ensure the plant runs to its full capacity. The majority of the project was funded by the Centre’s Department of Biotechnology (Rs. 2 crore) and Government’s Agriculture Marketing Department (Rs. 1 crore). “There are about 20 plants working in various parts of the country and 10 more are under construction, including in Delhi and other places, with capacities ranging from 250kg to 10 tonnes a day of food waste, organic fraction of municipal solid waste market and vegetable waste etc.,” explains CSIR-IICT chief scientist A. Gangagni Rao. Within the city, such plants are under construction in vegetable markets of Alwal, Erragadda and Saroornagar — each of 500kg capacity while 5-tonne capacity plants are being built for Gaddiannaram and Gudimalkapur markets. Biogas emanating from the plants is also being used to replace LPG cylinders in canteens. The project was initiated as a tripartite agreement between DBT, Telangana Agriculture Department with CSIR-IICT providing technology support. Biomanure generated through the plant can be sold as organic fertilizer too. IICT’s first commercial foray into this technology, inspired by a few modern versions in Europe, was a pilot using 200kg poultry litter to generate 89kWh power and then for Akshay Patra Foundation in Bellary (Karnataka) and Ahmedabad in 2015 of 1.5 tonnes capacities. In the past five years, Dr. Rao and his team has worked on improving the efficiency of the compactor and right sizing the machinery to ensure less space is used. “Waste is a misplaced resource and an unrecognised wealth. Through this technology, we can save dumpyards in cities from piling up, provide green power and generate employment, besides preventing pollution,” he adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bowenpally-vegetable-market-generates-own-green-power/article33605534.ece

One among various reforms planned for GHMC, along with TSbPASS, digitisation of properties, establishment of special task force and such, the information cell will collate data pertaining to all the circles and zones and keep them as ready reckoner for officials as well as public. As of now, the data remains diffused across circles, with no centralised system for information collection and dissemination. There are six zones and 30 circles in GHMC purview, which makes it an onerous task to collect data from each circle whenever a new project is to be taken up. The proposed Urban Information Centre will have crucial circle wise information pertaining to play grounds, parks, sports complexes, municipal markets and other markets, grave yards, lakes, water bodies, open plots, dilapidated buildings, heritage structures, roads and other infrastructure. This will not only provide access to a treasure trove of information to public, NGOs and others, but also aid officials by providing ready information for any future project, or for maintenance of the existing structures. Besides, it will also house details pertaining to properties in the city along with their geo-coordinates and the digital door numbering information, once the GIS survey is done as planned. After the initiation of TSbPASS for issuing building permissions, the work burden on the field staff has come down, and their services may be utilised for collection of data for the information centre, an official from GHMC informed. “All government departments have officials deputed from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics to head information centres as part of the Plannning wing. GHMC too could emulate the same, so that data is available at centralised location,” the official said, adding that the centre may be set up under either Planning or Information Technology wing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ghmc-to-set-up-urban-information-centre/article33605529.ece
19 January 2021||CHENNAI,||Tamil Nadu CM calls on Home Minister Amit Shah||Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami called on Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on Monday to invite him for the inauguration of a couple of key infrastructure projects, including the extension of Metro Rail Phase-I (Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar). On Tuesday morning, the Chief Minister will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr. Palaniswami, who was accompanied by Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar, requested the Home Minister to inaugurate the 9-km stretch between the two important places of north Chennai, constructed at a cost of Rs. 3,770 crore, and the Indian Oil Corporation’s Thoothukudi gas pipeline project (Rs. 800 crore). Cauvery-Gundar project The Chief Minister pointed out that there were a few more projects, which were ready for laying of foundation stones. Among them were the Cauvery-Gundar rivers link, costing Rs. 14,400 crore; the Grand Anicut extension, renovation and modernisation, at a cost of Rs. 2,640 crore, and the modernisation of the lower Bhavani project system at a cost of Rs. 934 crore. The total cost of the five projects was put at Rs. 22,544 crore, according to sources in the government. The meeting between Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Shah lasted around 45 minutes. The Chief Minister and the Home Minister were closeted for nearly half an hour. This is the first meeting between the two after Mr. Shah’s visit to Chennai last November. At an official event then, Mr. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam had confirmed that the AIADMK’s alliance with the BJP would continue for the 2021 Assembly election. On January 9, the AIADMK, at its general council, had again ratified Mr. Paneerselvam’s declaration of Mr. Palaniswami as its Chief Ministerial candidate. The BJP, which had earlier given the impression of being the deciding authority in announcing the Chief Ministerial candidate for the alliance, relaxed its stand last week, when its national general secretary and prabhari (in-charge) for Tamil Nadu, C.T. Ravi, said the AIADMK, being the dominant constituent of the coalition, would choose the candidate. Sources added that the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister were expected to declare open the renovated mausoleum for former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, on the Marina, on January 27.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/tamil-nadu-cm-calls-on-home-minister-amit-shah/article33605491.ece

The ‘rail roko’ agitation of KMSC entered 117th day. Meanwhile, a group of 22 ex-servicemen from the Army, Navy, Air Force and BSF, in a signed statement, urged the agitating farmers not to disrupt the Republic Day events.

19 January 2021||CHANDIGARH,||‘Don’t deny farmers’ right to march on Republic Day’||The Shiromani Akali Dal on Monday asked the Central government not to deny farmers the constitutional right of a peaceful march on Republic Day. Sukhbir Badal’s principal advisor Harcharan Singh Bains said during its core committee meeting held here, SAD viewed the Centre’s stance as “grossly violative of the very Constitution which the Republic Day symbolises”. He said the government could not have chosen a worse and more inappropriate day and occasion than January 26 to deny the citizens of the country their fundamental democratic right to free expression as well as the right to organise democratic activity. He said the core committee also hit out at the Central government, accusing it of abusing the powers of the National Investigation Agency against farmers. “It is reprehensible that the government is resorting to such draconian measures against the country’s annadata, who have not made any violation of peace or law and order.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/dont-deny-farmers-right-to-march-on-republic-day/article33605494.ece

On Monday, officials said he died of a cardiopulmonary disease. A report was released based on the autopsy. Mahipal Singh was given the first dose of Covishield at 1 p.m. on January 16, Chief Medical Officer, Moradabad, M.C Garg, said.

On January 16, 91 persons were given Covishield in the district men’s hospital Moradabad and all of them were fully healthy, he added. Mahipal Singh’s son Vishal told reporters that he believed his father died due to the side effects of the vaccine. After the vaccination, he took his father home around 1.30 p.m. “He already had a bit of pneumonia, cough and cold, but after returning home [following the shot], he started feeling worse. We gave him some warm water and tea and made him lie on the bed,” Mr. Vishal said. ‘Night duty’ The CMO said late on Saturday that the death “doesn’t appear to be a reaction” of the vaccine.

19 January 2021||Mumbai,||Cong., NCP demand JPC probe into chats between Arnab, ex-BARC CEO||The Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have demanded that the joint parliamentary committee on defence take cognisance of the chats between Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and former BARC CEO Partho Dasgupta, and probe their origin. “The Mumbai Police have exposed the chats between Mr. Goswami and Mr. Dasgupta. It is extremely shocking and disturbing to know how issues related to national security have been used to gain TRP. The question also arises how Mr. Goswami was privy to such sensitive information. The Ministry of Home Affairs has to identify the source and immediately take action,” NCP chief spokesperson Mahesh Tapase said. Mr. Tapase said the Narendra Modi government and the BJP seemed to have gone totally silent on Mr. Goswami. “Union Home Minister Amit Shah should come forward and laud the investigation by the Mumbai Police and at the same time, the BJP should clarify its position on Mr. Goswami,” he said. Senior Congress leader and former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan said the voluminous transcript of Mr. Goswami’s chats released by the Mumbai Police was deeply disturbing. “Who gave access to such sensitive information from national security to constitutional amendments and political appointments? The government of India must begin a thorough probe. Also the parliamentary standing committee on defence must take this matter with utmost priority,” Mr. Chavan said. Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Monday said the chats between Mr. Goswami and Mr. Dasgupta were now no longer limited to the TRP scam, but raised serious questions about national security. “We are going to take a thorough look into these chats. Some highly sensitive topics such as Balakot airstrike and Pulwama attack are mentioned in these chats. We are looking at how Mr. Goswami got access to such sensitive information,” said Mr. Deshmukh, adding that a meeting of senior officials had been called on Tuesday to decide on the future course of action. A delegation of Maharashtra Congress leaders will be meeting Mr. Deshmukh on Tuesday demanding a probe into the chats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cong-ncp-demand-jpc-probe-into-chats-between-arnab-ex-barc-ceo/article33605189.ece
19 January 2021||Mumbai,||MVA, BJP claim big gains in gram panchayat polls||The ruling tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has claimed to have won in more than 80% of the 12,711 gram panchayats where elections were held on January 15. Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) too has said that it emerged victorious in more than 6,000 gram panchayats. The polls were not contested on the party symbol, but instead local panels fought them. At many places, local political equations forced alliances of workers across party line. “We (the MVA) have won 80% of the seats in gram panchayats across Maharashtra. With these results, it is clear that the people have shown their faith in the work done by our government in the last one year. The BJP has suffered a crushing defeat and its leaders should accept the defeat with open heart instead of misleading people by giving false figures,” State Congress president and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat said. Mr. Thorat claimed that his party had emerged winner in Kolhapur, Nandurbar, Latur, Nanded, Amravati, Yavatmal, Nagpur, Wardha, Chandrapur, Osmanabad, Washim and Buldhana districts. “In the Vidarbha region, the Congress has achieved great success and has won in more than 50% of the gram panchayats,” he said. State BJP president Chandrakant Patil countered the Congress, saying the BJP had won in more than 6,000 gram panchayats. “The people of Maharashtra have shown utter distrust in the functioning of the State government. They are disillusioned by the tripartite government and want change. Gram panchayat election results are an indication of that,” he said. Shiv Sena leader and Environment and Tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray said the results were the indication of the people’s trust in the MVA government. Housing Minister and NCP leader Jitendra Awhad said, “The manner in which the MVA government won the recently held Council polls, it has scored big in gram panchayat polls as well. Just because someone says that he is number one, he cannot be number one. We have won in over two-third gram panchayats in Maharashtra.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/mva-bjp-claim-big-gains-in-gram-panchayat-polls/article33605184.ece
19 January 2021||Mumbai,||Maharashtra among 3 States with highest deaths in road accidents||With 11,452 deaths in 2020, Maharashtra figured among the top three States that had reported the highest number of deaths in road accidents in the country, State Transport Minister Anil Parab said on Monday. Expressing concern, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said these figures were serious, as he launched the 32nd Road Safety Week 2021. “In 2020, Maharashtra witnessed 25,456 road accidents and 11,452 road fatalities. Maharashtra is one of the three States that have reported the highest number of deaths in road accidents,” Mr. Parab said at the function. Mr. Thackeray said ideally, Maharashtra should not figure in the list of the States which had reported deaths in road accidents. “These figures are serious. Rather than being in top ranks, Maharashtra should not ideally figure in the list of States with road accident fatalities,” he said. The Chief Minister said a road safety drive should not be limited to a period of a week, fortnight, month or a year, but it should be conducted on a regular basis. “Booster doses of road safety rules should be given at regular intervals,” he said. Mr. Thackeray further appealed to motorists to follow the “Niyam” (rules) and maintain “Sanyam” (restraint) to keep “Yam” (god of death) away. “I have heard about a new technology which alerts drivers if they fall asleep while driving due to fatigue. I would like to examine such vehicle, if available,” the CM said. Mr. Thackeray said it was important to provide facilities to the public instead of only creating awareness. Mr. Parab said 50 high quality driver training centres would be opened in Maharashtra through the schemes funded by the Union government. Mr. Parab said getting a driving licence would not be easy once these centres became operational. “Every driver will undergo a test at an automatic centre. Human interference will be less and a driver will get their licence only after going through quality training,” Mr. Parab said, adding that a meeting was scheduled in Delhi about setting up such training centres. The Transport Minister said the road safety drive should be held annually and not on a weekly or a monthly basis. “Every citizen should be part of this drive,” he added. Mr. Parab said his department had sought new interceptor vehicles fitted with advanced gadgets like speed guns. Mumbai Guardian Minister Aslam Shaikh said lane-cutting was one of the major causes of road accidents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/maharashtra-among-3-states-with-highest-deaths-in-road-accidents/article33605185.ece
19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Flowers, smiles greet students as schools reopen in Capital||Smiles were hidden behind masks as Class 10 and 12 students returned to school after nearly 10 months on Monday. Colourful posters, floral welcomes and seeing teachers in person brightened up a cold, grey winter morning for students at government schools across the city. However, most private schools decided to take a little more time to open their doors to students again. The students were eager to hi-five and hug their friends but were reminded constantly by temperature checks, sanitisers that things were still not back to normal. Abhishek Patel, a Class 12 student said: “We have gotten used to online class and have managed to finish the syllabus, but there are many parts for which we still need clarification and it is necessary for us to attend school so that we get good marks in the board examinations.” Parents’ consent The government has allowed students of Classes 10 and 12 to attend school after getting written consent from their parents so that they may finish their practical course and clear doubts by interacting with their teachers in person. The CBSE Board exams are scheduled in May. Outside schools, efforts were made to ensure that students enter from different gates to prevent overcrowding. At labs and classrooms, efforts were made to leave one-desk space between students, and children were not allowed to visit the canteen or play during break time. Sneha Lata, a parent who had come to drop off her daughter at a government school in Lajpat Nagar, said that she was happy that schools had reopened as attending classes was important for her daughter as she had not taken to online classes easily and was having difficulty. “There is still time before the boards, she will be able to learn properly in school and have a proper schedule. After so many years of studying, she must get good marks in the board examination. COVID-19 pandemic cannot be used as an excuse,” she said. Deputy Chief Minister and Education Minister Manish Sisodia visited two schools — SKV Chirag Enclave and DPS Mathura Road — to assess schools’ readiness. “It is only after careful consideration that we’ve reopened the schools for Class 10 and 12 students. Since the CBSE has announced the dates for board exams in May, it would’ve been unfair for the students to directly sit for the examinations without any counselling or pre-board classes,” Mr. Sisodia said. He added that the Delhi government has reopened schools so that children can be better prepared to take their exams, especially after such a long disruption in their schooling. “Though this will not make up for the loss of almost a year, we wanted to do everything from our end,” the Minister said. Registered for exams Over three lakh students have registered from Delhi to take the CBSE Class 10 board examination while 2.5 lakh students will be taking the Class 12 exam. “Even the students were happy. They told me that they were bored at home and were looking forward to getting back to their schools,” Mr. Sisodia said after interacting with students. Addressing the concerns of parents about reopening schools before children had been vaccinated, he said that though the parents have offered mixed reactions, and are a little nervous, it was only natural for the parents to feel so. “Their confidence will build over time which will lead to more students coming to schools”, he added. The government did not share any figures of what attendance was at its schools.  It is only after careful consideration that we’ve reopened the schools for Class 10 and 12 students. ...it would’ve been unfair for the students to directly sit for the examinations without any counselling or pre-board classes  Manish Sisodia Deputy Chief Minister and Education Minister||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/flowers-smiles-greet-students-as-schools-reopen-in-capital/article33605170.ece

19 January 2021||New Delhi,||AAP cites HC, doubles down on graft in civic bodies||The AAP on Monday claimed that the Delhi High Court has “approved” an allegation made by the party that the BJP-ruled municipal corporations had collected Rs. 221 crore from retired employees for cashless insurance in private hospitals, but did not pay a “single penny” to the hospitals. “This shameful act by the BJP has created a havoc among the 34,000 retired employees of the North civic body and they are not getting any medical assistance,” said AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj. “In one hand they take and waste money of the Kejriwal government and on the other hand they are indulging in corruption with the money of their own employees. The situation is so bad that the BJP’s own Central government also does not believe the civic body,” he added. Mr. Bhardwaj said that as per the insurance scheme, retirement employees will pay some money to the corporation and the municipal body will ensure free treatment for them at any hospital in Delhi. “Under this scheme, the BJP-ruled civic body took money from every employee. During their retirement, under this scheme, Group A employees gave Rs. 1.2 lakh per person, Group B employees gave Rs. 78,000 per person, Group C employees Rs. 54,000 per person and Group D employees gave Rs. 30,000 per person. The Delhi High Court Bench came down heavily on the BJP-ruled civic bodies regarding this matter. There are around 34,000 pensioners under the BJP-ruled North Corporation and these people are suffering massively due to the misgovernance and corruption by the BJP,” the AAP leader said. Mr. Bhardwaj claimed that the Delhi High Court observed that this was “cheating” and a “criminal breach of trust by the civic bodies”. He said that it was very clear that the BJP-ruled municipal corporations are only “interested” in corruption.

Execution of the plan will be primarily under the Chief Secretary who is also the chairman of the Ridge Management Board.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ngt-directs-govt-on-ridge-demarcation/article33605168.ece
19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Teachers not to be assigned administrative, field duties||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia asked the Chief Secretary to ensure that all Delhi government schoolteachers are not summoned for any administrative/field duties other than COVID-19-related duties as classes commenced on Monday. “It has been brought to my notice that about 20,000-25,000 teachers are currently posted with district authorities for COVID-19-related duties. Considering the importance of education and the present status of the virus situation in Delhi, district authorities are to substantially scale down the present level of deployment and direct the teachers to report back to schools for their regular duties,” he said. Services rendered Teachers have been at the forefront of virus-related duties ever since the first lockdown in March last year. They have rendered their services whenever the district administration asked them to do so such as door-to-door survey, enforcement of COVID-19 protocol, screening at airport, and many of them have also been engaged in activities related to vaccination trials. For non-COVID-19-related duties, Mr. Sisodia said that prior permission of the Education Minister will be mandatory before assigning any teacher.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/teachers-not-to-be-assigned-administrative-field-duties/article33605171.ece
19 January 2021||New Delhi,||Give vaccine to homeless after front-line workers: CHD||The Centre for Holistic Development (CHD), which works for the rights of the homeless, on Monday appealed to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan to include the homeless among the priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination after healthcare and front-line workers. CHD executive director Sunil Aledia stated that the homeless were among the worst-hit and most vulnerable during the ongoing pandemic and the vaccine could be delivered to the homeless via government-owned and government-approved shelter homes and welfare institutions in Delhi. “I witness how poor nutrition and co-morbidities associated with living on the streets affect the ability of these homeless men, women, elderly, and children to access medical facilities,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/give-vaccine-to-homeless-after-front-line-workers-chd/article33605174.ece
19 January 2021||Pune,||Protest against new farm laws: Centre has insulted farmers, says Ajit Pawar||With the impasse between the Centre and farmers protesting the new farm laws dragging on, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Monday said that the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party government had “insulted farmers” by not yielding an inch despite nine rounds of parleys with the agitators. “The Centre’s apathy towards resolving farmers’ issues is evident in its attitude towards the protests against the new farm laws…why is that even after a frustrating eight or nine rounds of talks, the stalemate is not being broken. Clearly, the Central government is not interested in understanding farmers’ problems,” said the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, ahead of the 10th round of talks between the Centre and the protesters on January 19. He further said that each of the three parties of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government — the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress — wholeheartedly supported the protesting farmers. “We [the NCP], too, will be joining in the ongoing farmers’ protests soon. Our chief Sharad Pawar has made it clear that the NCP stood firm with the agitating farmers,” Mr. Pawar said. He was speaking on the occasion of the ‘agriculture technology week’ that commenced on Monday at Baramati’s Krishi Vigyan Kendra in the presence of NCP chief Mr. Sharad Pawar. About the results of gram panchayat elections in the State, the Deputy Chief Minister said that they were in favour of the MVA government. “The overall political picture in Maharashtra appears to be undergoing a big change after the results of the Legislative Council elections held last year. The gram panchayat results, too, seem to be a step in that direction,” he said, adding that in most of the places, the Congress, the NCP and the Sena had retained seats in their respective strongholds. Of the six Legislative Council seats for which elections were held in December last year, the BJP won only one while the rest constituencies were bagged by candidates of the ruling MVA. When questioned about the Sena’s demand for renaming Aurangabad city as ‘Sambhajinagar’ and the fierce opposition by the Congress, Mr. Pawar said that any difference of opinions among the three constituents would be ironed out by their leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/protest-against-new-farm-laws-centre-has-insulted-farmers-says-ajit-pawar/article33605187.ece
19 January 2021||Moscow,||Navalny remanded in custody for 30 days||A judge on Monday ordered Alexei Navalny to be remanded in custody for 30 days, the Russian opposition leader's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said on Twitter. The ruling concluded an hours-long court hearing set up at a police precinct where the politician was held since his arrest at a Moscow airport on Sunday. Mr. Navalny flew to Russia from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from nerve agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. He was detained at passport control at Sheremetyevo airport after flying in Sunday evening from Berlin, where he was treated following the poisoning in August. Mr. Navalny’s arrest prompted a wave of criticism from U.S. and European officials, adding to existing tension between Russia and West. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas noted that Mr. Navalny had returned of his own volition and said “it is completely incomprehensible that he was detained by Russian authorities immediately after his arrival”. “Russia is bound by its own Constitution and by international commitments to the principle of the rule of law and the protection of civil rights,” Mr. Maas added. “These principles must of course also be applied to Alexei Navalny. He should be released immediately.” The politician’s allies said on Monday he was being held at a police precinct outside Moscow and has been refused access to his lawyer. The court hearing into whether Mr. Navalny should remain in custody was hastily set up at the precinct itself, and the politician's lawyers said they were notified minutes before. “It is impossible what is happening over here,” Mr. Navalny said in video from the improvised court room, posted on his page in the messaging app Telegram. “It is lawlessness of the highest degree.” Calls for Mr. Navalny's immediate release have come from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and top officials of other EU nations.  ‘Outrageous attack’ U.S. President-elect Joe Biden’s pick for national security adviser called on Russian authorities to free Mr. Navalny. “Mr. Navalny should be immediately released, and the perpetrators of the outrageous attack on his life must be held accountable,” Jake Sullivan tweeted. The outgoing U.S. secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said the U.S. “strongly condemns” the decision to arrest Mr. Navalny. Nevertheless, the judge ordered that Mr. Navalny be remanded in custody until February 15, Ms. Yarmysh said on Twitter. Mr. Navalny’s lawyer Vadim Kobzev told the Interfax news agency that the defence plans to appeal the ruling. Mr. Navalny's detention was widely expected because Russia’s prisons service said he had violated probation terms from a suspended sentence on a 2014 money-laundering conviction. The service said it would seek to have Mr. Navalny serve his three-and-a-half-year sentence behind bars. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday that the stream of Western reactions to Mr. Navalny’s arrest reflects an attempt “to divert attention from the crisis of the Western model of development”. “Navalny’s case has received a foreign policy dimension artificially and without any foundation,” Mr. Lavrov said, arguing that his detention was a prerogative of Russian law enforcement agencies that explained their action. “It’s a matter of observing the law,” he added. Mr. Navalny, 44, President Vladimir Putin’s most prominent and determined foe, brushed off concerns about arrest as he boarded his flight in Berlin on Sunday. “It’s impossible. I’m an innocent man,” he said. Mr. Navalny fell into a coma while aboard a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow on August 20. He was transferred from a hospital in Siberia to a Berlin hospital two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities insisted that the doctors who treated Mr. Navalny in Siberia before he was airlifted to Germany found no traces of poison. Russia refused to open a full-fledged criminal inquiry, citing a lack of evidence that Navalny was poisoned, and officials have challenged Germany to provide proof of the poisoning.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/navalny-remanded-in-custody-for-30-days/article33604827.ece
19 January 2021||WASHINGTON,||FBI vets troops ahead of inauguration||U.S. defence officials say they are worried about an insider attack or other threat from service members involved in securing President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, prompting the FBI to vet all of the 25,000 National Guard troops coming into Washington for the event. The massive undertaking reflects the extraordinary security concerns that have gripped Washington following the deadly January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by pro-Trump rioters. And it underscores fears that some of the very people assigned to protect the city over the next several days could present a threat to the incoming President and other VIPs in attendance. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told The Associated Press on Sunday that officials are conscious of the potential threat, and he warned commanders to be on the lookout for any problems within their ranks as the inauguration approaches. So far, however, he and other leaders say they have seen no evidence of any threats, and officials said the vetting hadn't flagged any issues that they were aware of. Closer look “We’re continually going through the process, and taking second, third looks at every one of the individuals assigned to this operation,” Mr. McCarthy said in an interview after he and other military leaders went through an exhaustive, three-hour security drill in preparation for Wednesday’s inauguration. He said Guard members are also getting training on how to identify potential insider threats. About 25,000 members of the National Guard are streaming into Washington from across the country — at least two and a half times the number for previous inaugurals. And while the military routinely reviews service members for extremist connections, the FBI screening is in addition to any previous monitoring. Officials said the process began as the first Guard troops began deploying to D.C. more than a week ago. And they said it is slated to be complete by Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/fbi-vets-troops-ahead-of-inauguration/article33604819.ece
19 January 2021||WASHINGTON,||Harris prepares for White House role||Kamala Harris will make history on Wednesday when she becomes the nation’s first female Vice-President — and the first Black woman and the first woman of South Asian descent to hold that office. But that’s only where her boundary-breaking role begins. With the confluence of crises confronting Joe Biden’s administration — and an evenly divided Senate in which she would deliver the tie-breaking vote — Ms. Harris is shaping up to be a central player in addressing everything from the coronavirus pandemic to criminal justice reform. Symone Sanders, Ms. Harris’ chief spokeswoman, said that while the Vice President-elect’s portfolio hasn’t been fully defined yet, she has a hand in all aspects of Mr. Biden’s agenda. “There are pieces that Biden may specifically ask her to champion, but outside of that she is at the table for everything, involved in everything, and giving input and feedback and being a supportive partner to him on all pieces,” she said. People working closely with Ms. Harris on the transition resist the idea of siloing her into any specific issue early on, because the sheer number of challenges the Biden administration faces means it will be “all hands on deck” during their early months. They say she’ll be involved in all four of the major priorities they’ve set out: turning around the economy, tackling COVID-19, and addressing climate change and racial justice. ‘All hands on deck’ “She has a voice in all of those. She has an opinion in all those areas. And it will probably get to a point where she is concentrating on some of the areas more specifically,” Ms. Sanders said. “But right now, I think what we’re faced with in this country is so big, it’s all hands on deck.” Ms. Harris has been closely involved with all of Mr. Biden’s biggest decisions since winning the election in November, joining him for every one of his key meetings focused on Cabinet picks, the COVID-19 relief Bill, security issues and more. The two talk over the phone nearly every day, and she travels to Delaware sometimes multiple times a week for transition events and meetings. Those involved in the transition say both have taken seriously Mr. Biden’s insistence that he wants Ms. Harris to be the “last voice in the room” on key decisions. Mr. Biden is known to turn to Ms. Harris first during meetings to ask for her perspective on the matter at hand. Personal connect Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris knew each other prior to the 2020 presidential campaign in part through Ms. Harris’ friendship with Biden’s deceased son, Beau. But they never worked closely together. Since joining the ticket, and particularly since the election, Ms. Harris has made efforts to deepen their relationship and is in frequent contact with the president-elect, people close to Ms. Harris say. That personal relationship, according to presidential historian Joel Goldstein, will be key to their success as working partners. “The relationship of the Vice-President to the President is the most important relationship. Establishing mutual understanding and trust is really a key to a successful vice presidency,” Mr. Goldstein said. Mr. Goldstein pointed to Mr. Biden and President Barack Obama’s relationship as a potential model for the incoming team. Mr. Biden and Mr. Obama were from similarly different backgrounds and generations. But their relationship and mutual understanding grew throughout the presidency, and Mr. Obama trusted Mr. Biden with some of his administration’s biggest endeavours, like the implementation of the 2009 Recovery Act and the troop withdrawal from Iraq.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/harris-prepares-for-white-house-role/article33604823.ece
19 January 2021||COLOMBO,||Imran Khan to visit Sri Lanka||Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan is scheduled to visit Sri Lanka in February, according to official sources. He will be the first head of government to visit Sri Lanka since the pandemic struck last year. “The visit is likely towards the end of February,” an official source in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told The Hindu on Monday. UN resolution Mr. Khan’s visit, scheduled a month after Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar’s three-day visit to Colombo, will likely coincide with the early days of the 46th UN Human Rights Council session in Geneva, where a new resolution on Sri Lanka may be adopted by members. Pakistan is currently a member of the Council. In December 2020, Islamabad and Colombo held Foreign Secretary level ‘Bilateral Political Consultations’ virtually. A statement from the Pakistani High Commission — issued on December 17, 2020 — said Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood shared Pakistan’s perspective on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, “progress of the CPEC, and Pakistan’s positive contribution to the Afghan peace process”. “He also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to SAARC and expressed the hope that the process of regional cooperation would be allowed to move forward,” he said. Sri Lanka, which has close ties with Pakistan and India, has seldom commented on Indo-Pak. tensions. Following the Pulwama attack in February 2019, Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was “deeply concerned” about the developments following “the brutal terrorist attack on a Central Reserve Police Force convoy in Pulwama,” while “requesting” India and Pakistan to act “in a manner that ensures the security, peace and stability of the entire region.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/imran-khan-to-visit-sri-lanka/article33604825.ece
19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,||U.S., China spar over the origins of novel coronavirus||The U.S. and China on Monday sparred over the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, the latest in a growing list of tensions that have left relations strained as President Donald Trump leaves office. In recent weeks, Washington and Beijing have clashed over trade issues, the sanctioning of Chinese companies, Taiwan and Hong Kong. In a reflection of the state of relations, China’s official Xinhua news agency issued a commentary, headlined “Good riddance, Trump administration and its final madness”, hitting out over the sanctioning of six Chinese officials related to Hong Kong. The latest spat followed the U.S. State Department on Friday releasing a “fact-sheet” linking the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) to the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, which brought another sharp response from Beijing. The fact-sheet said while the U.S. “does not know exactly where, when, or how the COVID-19 virus — known as SARS-CoV-2 — was transmitted initially to humans”, it had “not determined whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, China.” “The CCP’s [Chinese Communist Party’s] deadly obsession with secrecy and control comes at the expense of public health in China and around the world,” it said, adding that it was making public “previously undisclosed information”, saying “the U.S. government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses.” The fact-sheet also noted WIV researchers had “conducted experiments involving RaTG13, the bat coronavirus identified by the WIV in January 2020 as its closest sample to SARS-CoV-2 (96.2% similar)”. China’s Foreign Ministry reacted sharply to the claim, with spokesperson Hua Chunying on Monday calling Mr. Pompeo “Mr. Liar” and accusing the U.S. of deflecting blame away from the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic. ‘Final madness’ “The statement and the list are full of conspiracies and lies, which are consistent with certain U.S. officials who have dealt with the pandemic in a passive way and constantly shifted the blame to others,” Ms. Hua said, adding it “showed that some U.S. politicians ignored public safety and lives, go against science and are obsessed with making propaganda about conspiracies and spreading 'the political virus’,” the Party-run Global Times quoted her as saying. “This is also the final madness staged by Pompeo, this Mr. Liar,” Ms. Hua said. A team of scientists from the WHO arrived in Wuhan last week to research the origins of the outbreak. The agency said on Friday the world may never find “patient zero” as it continues its study into tracing the origins in China.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-china-spar-over-the-origins-of-novel-coronavirus/article33604832.ece
19 January 2021||KAMPALA,||Uganda police surround Bobi Wine’s party offices||The Opposition party of Ugandan presidential challenger Bobi Wine said on Monday that police have prevented top officials from going to their headquarters in the capital, Kampala, as they prepare to launch a legal challenge to free Mr. Wine from house arrest. Police swooped in at dawn at the offices of Wine’s National Unity Platform, diverted traffic, and stopped people from entering, party spokesman Joel Ssenyonyi told The Associated Press. Mr. Wine, whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, was the main opposition challenger in presidential elections last week that electoral authorities say long-time leader Yoweri Museveni won with 58% of the vote. Mr. Wine, who took 34% of the vote, has rejected the official outcome as fraudulent and insists he will use all legal means to protest the allegedly “cooked-up” results. Mr. Wine’s party has said it has video evidence of the military stuffing ballot boxes, casting ballots for people and chasing voters away from polling stations. Opposition lawmaker Medard Sseggona, an attorney for Mr. Wine, said he feared police would seize any vital information related to the elections that was kept at the party's headquarters. Mr. Museveni has dismissed the claims of vote-rigging. But the election was marred by violence ahead of polling day as well as an Internet shutdown that remained in force until Monday morning, when access was restored for most Ugandans, although social media sites remained restricted. Mr. Wine has been effectively under house arrest since he cast his vote and now is allegedly unable to receive visitors. Police thwarted opposition officials who were trying to meet with Mr. Wine at his home outside Kampala in order to discuss the way forward, Mr. Ssenyonyi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/uganda-police-surround-bobi-wines-party-offices/article33604834.ece
19 January 2021||Paris,||France, U.K. boost vaccine campaigns||France and Britain on Monday joined a growing list of nations starting mass vaccinations for all elderly citizens as the U.K. began demanding all arrivals quarantine to try and halt the spread of a new COVID-19 variant. The French drive aims to cover all people over 75 and comes after Brazil and India administered their first jabs over the weekend. Health Minister Olivier Veran said more than one million vaccinations are being targeted by January and between 2.4 and 4 million by February. France had earlier offered vaccinations to residents of retirement homes and health workers on the frontline. Britain on Monday extended its own vaccination campaign to people over the age of 70, after first attending to over-80s, and frontline health workers and care givers. More than 3.8 million people have received a first dose of vaccine in the U.K. Russia is also due to start immunisation on Monday using its homegrown Sputnik V vaccine while Britain imposed a 10-day isolation and negative COVID-19 tests on all travellers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/france-uk-boost-vaccine-campaigns/article33604820.ece
19 January 2021||Riyadh,||Saudi reports sharp drop in executions||Saudi Arabia on Monday reported a sharp drop in executions in 2020, as the kingdom seeks to blunt international criticism of its human rights record. The Gulf state has long faced criticism for one of the world’s highest rates of executions and what human rights activists call an opaque judicial system. The Saudi government’s Human Rights Commission (HRC) said it documented 27 executions in 2020, a decrease of 85% over the previous year due in part to a moratorium on the death penalty for drug-related offences. “The Commission welcomes this news as a sign that the kingdom and its justice system are focusing more on rehabilitation and prevention than solely on punishment,” HRC president Awwad Alawwad said in a statement. “The moratorium on drug-related offences means the kingdom is giving more non-violent criminals a second chance.” Saudi Arabia put 184 people to death in 2019, according to Amnesty International, which said it was the highest number ever recorded in a single year in the kingdom.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/saudi-reports-sharp-drop-in-executions/article33604828.ece
19 January 2021||Tunis,||Tunisia arrests 600 over riots, deploys troops||Tunisian authorities said on Monday they had arrested more than 600 people and deployed troops after a third consecutive night of riots, mostly by young people in working class districts of several cities. The unrest came despite a nationwide pandemic lockdown declared last Thursday — the day that also marked 10 years since demonstrators forced dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali’s fall from power. Interior Ministry spokesman Khaled Hayouni said 632 people had been arrested, notably “groups of people between the ages of 15, 20 and 25 who burned tyres and bins to block the movement of security forces”. The social unrest comes at a time of economic crisis, worsened by the pandemic, that has sparked rapid inflation and high youth unemployment. Some of those arrested had lobbed stones at police and clashed with security forces, leaving two policemen wounded, said Mr. Hayouni. “This has nothing to do with protest movements that are guaranteed by the law and the constitution,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/tunisia-arrests-600-over-riots-deploys-troops/article33605396.ece

Aditya Singh, a resident of a suburb in Los Angeles, California, was arrested on Saturday for living in a secure area at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport since October 19, the Chicago Tribune reported on Sunday. Mr. Singh was arrested after two United Airlines staff asked him to produce his identification. He showed them a badge, but it reportedly belonged to an operations manager who reported it missing in October. The airline employees called 911. Police later took him into custody. Mr. Singh managed to live on handouts from other passengers, Assistant State Attorney Kathleen Hagerty told Cook County Judge Susana Ortiz. The judge ruled that the Mr. Singh could be released if he paid a bail amount of $1,000, but said that he cannot set foot again in the airport.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/man-lives-in-us-airport-for-3-months/article33605397.ece

19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Being tethered to bars during a pandemic||A distance of two yards — do ghazh ki duri — we are enjoined to maintain between oneself and anyone else. The ‘pandemic’ message is relayed on recorded caller messages in all our official languages. But there is a category of persons by which the injunction cannot be observed — prisoners. By the very nature of their situation, the physical limits of their confinement, they are obliged to stay in poorly ventilated and over-crowded cells. Being holed up in that condition almost seems to form part of the punishment. A jail and a dungeon are almost interchangeable terms. Data from the U.S., the U.K. Criminal justice has ‘activists’ in the United States observing with a sharp eye, prison conditions. We do not. At least not in the same numbers or with the same capacity to influence policy. Writing in Diplomatic Courier on December 29, 2020 (https://bit.ly/2M4IHiT), Carolyn Nash reported that in March 27, last year, a letter signed by over 40 public health experts called federal prisons and immigration detention centers “breeding grounds for uncontrolled transmission” of the virus. By September, 44 of 50 COVID-19 clusters were found to be located in prisons. In Texas, the virus had, by then, killed more than 230 people in jails and prisons, 80% of whom had not been convicted of a crime. By November, the number of cases in Michigan prisons more than doubled in two weeks. A Minnesota organiser called his state’s soaring rate of prison infections “a human rights disaster”, she says. England and Wales have 121 prisons housing about 79,000 prisoners. As the novel coronavirus grew alarmingly in Britain, a mass testing programme commenced for all prisoners in 28 of these prisons in July, starting with symptomatic prisoners. The United Kingdom Ministry of Justice figures ( The Guardian , November, 2020; https://bit.ly/39Itmg5) showed that prisoners testing positive in September stood at 883 (By October the number rose to 1,529, with five deaths. This rise was doubtless computed on account of increased testing. The Indian situation Do we have such statistics for India? They do exist, surely but not in handy, ready form in the public domain. But the tragedy in human terms is that such statistics are not being demanded of our criminal justice system. In the United States and in the U.K., pandemic control in prisons is being driven by enlightened public opinion. Not so in India. When we hail an ‘unlocking’, we are not thinking of our lock-ups. This is not surprising in a society such as ours which seems to have concluded, prematurely, that the novel coronavirus is behind us, which is not the case. But more pertinently, this is not surprising in a society that has a poor tradition of human rights activism. It takes a prominent prisoner such as the writer, Varavara Rao, or the Khudai Khidmatgar Faisal Khan going down with the virus for the enormity of the disease combining with imprisonment to dawn on us. That our 1,400 or so prisons, ‘housing’ over 4.5 lakh prisoners are breeding grounds for the virus does not occupy our thoughts, even our virus-related thoughts. But how about the Indian state ? The Prisons Act of 1894 (https://bit.ly/39G9473) makes prisons the exclusive responsibility of State governments. Over the years the condition of prison life has moved up on the human civility and dignity scale, with the venues now being called correctional homes and over 60 ‘minimum security’ open prisons having been set up. Of the 4.5 lakh prisoners that our correctional homes hold, according to the National Crime Records Bureau’s report for 2019 (https://bit.ly/3qIbl8T), about 3.3 lakh are ‘under-trial prisoners’ , against whom investigation or trial is supposed to be ‘in progress’. These 3.3 lakh ‘under-trial prisoners’ have been detained under Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) which provides for “Procedure when investigation cannot be completed in 24 hours”. The original CrPC of 1898 specified the period of detention as 15 days. This has, by amendments, been extended to periods that can go up to 90 days and, in some exceptional situations, even indefinitely. Violation of rights Surendra Nath, a former Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Justice, Government of India and member of the Constitutional Conduct Group, has pointed out : “…(O)ut of 3.3 lakh, about 2.2 lakh are either not likely to be even charge-sheeted, or they are likely to be acquitted.” B.D. Sharma, a former Head of Correctional Services in West Bengal, who has done amazing work in giving that nomenclature true meaning, describes their condition thus: “This huge violation of the basic human rights of UTPs in such large numbers is made further unbearable by overcrowding, poor living conditions, inadequate healthcare facilities and torture by other rowdy prisoners (which often occurs with the connivance of jail staff) in our prisons.” And he highlights the huge injustice caused to the families of the ‘under-trial prisoners’ “languishing in prisons for long years particularly their children who are denied a normal childhood, proper education, and are exploited by cruel sections of the society in various way especially the girl children and many of whom are forced to take to the path of crime”. Double punishment So, while the plight — to use a cliché — of all prisoners is by definition bad, in terms of exposure to disease, it is 10 times worse for ‘under-trial prisoners’, for the majority of them are and are likely to be found to be innocent. Theirs is a case of innocence in jail and in jeopardy — the jeopardy of a potentially fatal infection contracted while in detention. Is this acceptable in a country which boasts of a Constitution, in the Preamble to which we give unto ourselves, before anything else — Justice? The virus gives cause for an immediate review of all prisoners’ vulnerability to the epidemic, starting with that of ‘under-trial prisoners’ who are suffering two privations — one, being immobilised, most probably unjustly, and two, being tethered to the risk of infection. This review has to comprise 100% and repeated testing procedures in all prisons, especially sub-jails, which form the biggest category among them and the least ‘equipped’ and an arrangement for the isolating and hospitalisation of those testing positive. No prisoner who has tested positive can be allowed to remain within the crowded confines of that venue without transmitting the disease to a progressively rising concentric circle of inmates. But above all, the population of prisons has to be vigorously bought down. A case for prison reform Through a salutary amendment, the Code Of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2005, a much-needed Section 436-A has been introduced in the CrPC. Excluding offences for which capital punishment is envisaged, it provides for an under-trial to be released on a personal bond, with or without sureties if the period spent in detention by the under-trial has been for more than half the maximum period of imprisonment prescribed for that offence. (The public prosecutor can move the court to deviate from this.) The 2005 amendment had two aims : one, de-congestion and two, fairness. Today, in our COVID-19 times, if congestion is per se held to be dangerous, de-congestion in prisons through a prescribed legal procedure becomes not just a desirability but a duty. And I urge the immediate and massive activation of Section 436-A without sureties so as to benefit all under-trials eligible for it. It is not just desirable but axiomatic that the 2005 amendment to the CrPC be activated on a nation-wide and urgent basis as a penological imperative, a state duty and a human right. And while their release is being actuated, it also follows that even as anyone in a state hospital may rightly expect to be vaccinated on a priority against the virus, so should inmates of the ‘Hospitals of Correction’. While ‘Prisons’ is in the ‘State List’, as is ‘Public Health’, the Constitutional responsibility of handling infectious and contagious diseases figures in the Concurrent List. It is the Centre that must show the States its concern in this and lead from the front.

19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,||How co-morbidities make COVID severe||Medical students are taught to classify diseases as either congenital or acquired. Acquired diseases are infectious or inflammatory, nutritional or metabolic, vascular or neoplastic (tumours, benign or malignant). COVID-19 is acquired, infectious/inflammatory. The microbe is SARS-CoV-2. What are co-morbidities and why do they make COVID-19 severe and life-threatening? Chronic nutritional/metabolic diseases start as diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome or obesity. They in turn lead to chronic heart, brain and kidney diseases because of damage to the lining cells of the blood vessels, the ‘endothelium’. For someone with an acute disease, a pre-existing chronic disease is now a co-morbidity. The immune system is highly conserved even in undernourished people; the impact of co-morbidities on the immune system is mild. Exceptions occur: TB is more common in undernourished adults and uncontrolled diabetes; metabolic syndrome, however, is associated with over-nutrition. If someone with a co-morbidity gets COVID-19, the disease severity is increased out of proportion to any subtle or mild effect of the co-morbidity on the immune system. Opening the lock to gain entry There are four ubiquitous coronaviruses, highly adapted to human hosts, causing only common cold. Three coronaviruses — SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 — have recently jumped the host species, presumably bats or dromedary camels, and caused severe disease in humans, primarily pneumonia. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 latch on to a human cell surface protein called ‘angiotensin converting enzyme 2’ (ACE2), mediated through the viral surface spike protein, a key that opens the lock to gain entry. Once inside, the virus hijacks cell functions for its own multiplication. There is no precedent of viruses using ACE2 as cell receptors. ACE1 and ACE2 are widely distributed on the lining ‘endothelial’ cells of all arterial, venous and capillary blood vessels and on smooth muscles that surround them. They also abound on the lining epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, kidneys and gut. Blood carries oxygen and nutrition to all organs; anything that affects the blood vessels affects the organs as well. Contrast this with influenza virus receptors that are present only on epithelial cells of the respiratory tract – the virus cannot invade and infect inner organs and tissues. COVID-19 may invade and infect any tissue or organ from the head to the toes and cause damage through reduced blood supply. Physiologically ACE1 and ACE2 play critical roles in regulating blood pressure, and blood flow to organs. They act on angiotensin-1 and convert it to active peptides. ACE1 converts angiotensin-1 to angiotensin-2, a potent constrictor of blood vessels. ACE2, on the other hand, converts angiotensin-1 and angiotensin-2 to peptides that dilate blood vessels. Through their balanced and contrasting effects on blood vessels, these peptides regulate regional blood flow in organs and tissues. In chronic diseases there is widespread dysfunction of these activities. By occupying ACE2, COVID-19 interferes with angiotensin conversion to vaso-dilatory peptides; the balance tilts in favour of vaso-constriction resulting in decreased oxygen and nutrient supply to organs. If the person’s blood sugar level is very high, the blood becomes viscous. Damaged endothelial cells hasten blood clotting and further reduce blood supply. If someone has, say, diabetes, SARS-CoV-2 can further severely reduce oxygen supply to tissues. This synergy could be fatal. Well-controlled diabetes carries less risk as damage to the endothelial cells is minimal. COVID-19 is an infectious disease and especially affects the lungs. The immune system responds as best as it can. Within 2-3 weeks of infection, when immunity is at its peak, the immune system may clear the virus from the organs, but the damages to the organs take time to repair. In the absence of co-morbidities, the body physiology can bounce back to normalcy quickly, but in those with co-morbidities, the ailing organs may not recover in time to avert death due to damage to the lungs, heart, kidney or brain. The borders between infectious pathology and metabolic/vascular pathology are blurred or breached. The vaccine solution The poor response to convalescent plasma that rapidly reduces virus load in the body surprised experts. Once the vascular and clotting cascade sets in, even if you remove the virus, the downhill course continues. If you want prevention of disease progression in those at high risk of death, either the coronaviruses must be neutralised very early, even before or early after onset of symptoms, or you must be vaccinated. This illustrates the need for vaccine emergency use authorisation for the elderly and those with co-morbidities. Vaccination will confer some protection to those at high risk of death through the sinister synergy of COVID-19 and co-morbidities. The elderly are vulnerable due to senile degeneration, decline of immune functions and elements of co-morbidities. There is another sinister association: the insulin-secreting Beta cells in the pancreas are studded with ACE2 and are easy targets for COVID-19. In COVID-19, insulin secretion is decreased. Non-diabetics sometimes develop diabetes for the first time after COVID-19 and those with diabetes may develop very high blood sugar levels. Those who recover from COVID-19 are prone to develop chronic diseases. Those with obesity, diabetes and hypertension who recover from COVID-19 are at increased risk of heart attack and stroke because of severe blood vessel narrowing during COVID-19. Some people develop chronic sequelae, called chronic or ‘long’ COVID-19 — some of them due to damage to blood vessels in the lungs, kidneys, heart and brain. COVID-19 also seems to trigger auto-immunity, that is, one’s immune system turns against one’s own tissues/organs. These conditions may lead to severe muscle or joint pain, severe fatigue, memory loss and mental depression. The damage to the lungs in COVID-19 starts as infection, but quickly becomes massive inflammation with outpouring of plasma into the air sacs, sludging of blood flow in capillaries and clotting. The reason for these is what is called a ‘cytokine storm’: a reaction of blood vessels to substances called cytokines that are excessively secreted by immune cells. This cascade leads to further decreased oxygen in blood. The widespread narrowing of blood vessels and hypoxia serve as twin triggers to damage vital body organs. Physicians are confronted with a complex problem that involves multiple organ systems. For the elderly and those with co-morbidities, prevention is better than cure. COVID-19 vaccines should induce protective immunity in youngsters, adults and the elderly, except in those with diseases or treatments that directly suppress the immune system (such as those with cancers and organ transplants). As the immune system is only modestly affected by co-morbidities, we expect vaccine-induced immunity sufficient to avert severe disease. Yet, there may be disappointing surprises. Therefore, people with obesity, diabetes and hypertension should ensure that they are diligent in the practices of mask wearing, physical distancing, hand hygiene and avoiding crowds. Until we know more details, vaccination, good control of co-morbidity parameters and good infection control practices together will save lives. T.

19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Mining in India equals selling the family gold||The principle that the economy must be “sustainable” — we cannot compromise the ability of future generations to meet their needs — is beyond question. Climate change and high levels of consumption already threaten to rob future generations of a planet that is liveable. The principle of Intergenerational Equity would make it imperative for us to ensure future generations inherit at least as much as we did. If we are successful in abiding by intergenerational equity, our children will be at least as well off as we are. If we leave a bequest as well, they will be better off than us. To consume what we have inherited without a thought for generations to come will leave the whole world poorer; like an addict selling the family gold. How it is unsustainable India’s National Mineral Policy 2019 states: “natural resources, including minerals, are a shared inheritance where the state is the trustee on behalf of the people to ensure that future generations receive the benefit of inheritance.” (https://bit.ly/2Xy5wyd). The primary objective of a trustee/manager is to maintain the corpus of the trust, the shared inheritance of natural resources. The extraction of oil, gas and minerals is effectively the sale of this inheritance, with royalties and other proceeds being the consideration paid in exchange for the mineral wealth extracted. Unfortunately, governments everywhere treat the mineral sale proceeds as revenue or income, a crucial error which hides the real transaction — a sale of inherited wealth. This results in governments selling minerals at prices significantly lower than what they are worth, driven by lobbying, political donations and corruption. For example, it is estimated from the annual reports of Vedanta that over eight years (2004-2012), the State of Goa lost more than 95% of the value of its minerals (https://bit.ly/39tFKQZ) — after extraction costs and a reasonable profit for the extractor. Any loss is effectively a hidden per-head tax which makes a few extractors and their cronies super rich. Inequality grows sharply. This is the economics of loot. Worse still, the trifles received by the government are treated as “revenue” and happily spent, leaving neither the minerals nor their value for future generations to inherit. This is just not sustainable. Losses, error in accounting There is growing empirical evidence of large losses in mining from around the world (https://bit.ly/2LjmDRV). There is also growing evidence from the International Monetary Fund that many governments of resource-rich nations, including the United Kingdom and Norway, face declining public sector net worth, i.e., their governments are becoming poorer (https://bit.ly/3i81c21). Both indicate unsustainable mining. Losses in mineral value drive many of the other problems with mining. In effect, the people and future generations of Goa have sold mineral wealth worth Rs. 100 for Rs. 5, a loss of Rs. 95. Naturally the extractors are keen to extract as quickly as possible and move on. Trees, tigers and tribals are labelled as anti-development or anti-national. If Rs. 5 is received for allowing mining, doubling mining would result in Rs. 10. Politicians and voters perceive more mining equals more government revenue equals good. Further, since extraction is not recognised as the sale of inherited wealth, the true loss of Rs. 95 is hidden. More mining would make a bad situation significantly worse. It is important to understand that as long as the Government Accounting Standards Advisory Board does not correct this error in the standards for public sector accounting and reporting for mineral wealth, politicians and voters will advocate increasing extraction. This will lead to every bit of mineral being extracted if there are no moral or legal safeguards against such wanton loot. It is essential that as a nation we change our paradigm (https://bit.ly/2LIEJNd) to understand minerals as a “shared inheritance”, not a source of “windfall revenue”.  How to manage it Since minerals are a shared inheritance held in trust for the people and future generations, our foremost duty is to maintain the value of our children’s inheritance by avoiding theft, loss, waste or consumption. Leaving the minerals undisturbed fulfils our duty. Therefore, if we extract and sell our mineral wealth, the explicit objective must be to achieve zero loss in value; the state as trustee must capture the full economic rent (sale price minus cost of extraction, cost including reasonable profit for extractor). Any loss is a loss to all of us and our future generations, and makes some rich; that is patently unfair. India’s National Mineral Policy 2019 says: “State Governments will endeavour to ensure that the full value of the extracted minerals is received by the State.” Like Norway, the entire mineral sale proceeds must be saved in a Future Generations Fund. The Future Generations Fund could be passively invested through the National Pension Scheme framework. Setting a global judicial precedent, in 2014 the Supreme Court ordered the creation of a Goa Iron Ore Permanent Fund, which already has a corpus of around Rs. 500 crore — Goa Foundation vs UOI & Ors. , WP (civil) 435 of 2012, judgment on April 21, 2014 (https://bit.ly/2Kts4gA). The real income of a fund of this nature may be distributed only as a citizens’ dividend, equally to all as owners. Future generations would benefit from the dividend in their turn. On fair mining For the Indian economy this is sustainable — capital has been maintained; the savings rate would rise, making available more long-term domestic capital; it diversifies risk while likely improving returns — it is nearly impossible to outperform the market rate of return; the dividend is in effect a Universal Basic Income; lower inequality leads to higher economic performance, and as budgets no longer have easy mining money, public investment, and tax administration will become more effective and efficient. This is a six-fold economic boost. These principles of fair mining are fully constitutional, promoting justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity. They are moral, ethical, fair, right and sustainable. The reduction in losses would limit corruption, crony capitalism and growing inequality. They fulfil our duties to our future generations. Let us be the generation that changes the course of history for the better, not the one that consumed the planet.

19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Don’t doubt Indian vaccines||Several people have questioned the emergency approval given to the indigenously developed COVID-19 vaccine. They have demanded efficacy data and cast aspersions on the regulatory machinery. Such views will only increase vaccine hesitancy. It is not the case that the vaccine developed indigenously is being pushed by vested interests, while the international vaccines are great. Questions have been raised about the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines too, which have reported more than 90% efficacy. As Peter Doshi wrote in The BMJ , questions have been raised about the exclusion of individuals from the efficacy analysis for ‘important protocol deviations’; the higher rate of medication in the vaccine arm to prevent side-effects due to reactogenicity; the processes of the primary event adjudication committees, comprising the companies’ own employees; vaccine efficacy in those who already had COVID-19; the non-availability of raw trial data; and so on. Efficacy assessment Efficacy would actually mean testing, say, 10,000 individuals who have been given the vaccine versus an equivalent number not given the vaccine in terms of the number who get the infection. Can these vaccines prevent transmission? We may have to wait at least six months to get meaningful results. Efficacy would reflect in the rate of hospitalisation, ICU cases and deaths. With a declining level of infection, perhaps the virus is weakening in India on its own, as is the case with most pathogens. This makes efficacy assessment of a vaccine very difficult. The question of antibody-dependent enhancement, a phenomenon in which virus-specific antibodies enhance the severity of the virus, and in some cases the replication of the virus, has been put on the backburner with experts suggesting it may not be a major issue. It depends on vaccine design and it is not known whether all the candidate vaccines have been tested for this phenomenon. In the case of the rabies vaccine, efficacy assessment is based on the virus neutralisation capacity of the serum from the vaccinated individual, assessed in terms of international units. It is a surrogate marker for efficacy, since the candidate vaccine cannot be tested in an experimental population that is administered the virus or bitten by rabid dogs, for validation. At this stage, no one can predict whether the COVID-19 vaccine candidates can protect against the circulating mutants. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is both intellectually and medically challenging. But there has been no prevention strategy in history other than vaccination to save lives. Therefore, vaccination of the population is very important for protection against fresh infections and a second wave, although the duration of protection is not known for any vaccine candidate. It is well known that some people take the flu vaccine every year. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been extraordinary, both in terms of positive and negative developments. The cooperation among the scientific community, industry and regulatory agencies has been truly remarkable in making vaccine development and deployment possible in less than two years, a process that would otherwise take 10-15 years. The future timelines for research and development, product development and expectations will be very different. On the negative side, we have tall claims by political leaders in the West on vaccines, major scientific journals coming under pressure to publish data with poor peer review, vaccine nationalism, etc. Moving ahead Given the context of the pandemic, it would be prudent for India to go by safety studies (Phase I and II) and assessment of virus neutralisation assays with the serum. It is also not appropriate to doubt the integrity of the expert committee advising the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). The DCGI is not just an individual to be pressured; it follows due process for making an informed decision regarding emergency use, or, as is called in India, approval for restricted use. It is understandable that limited approval has been given in clinical trial mode, where individuals vaccinated will be monitored regularly. Though no particular vaccine candidate should be favoured, candidates with proven safety studies and efficacy, as assessed based on the virus neutralisation potency of the sera, should be allowed to go ahead. One or two more months into the trial could have given partial data to satisfy interim efficacy assessment, but we will get real data on efficacy only after vaccinating the masses. Eventually, affordability could become an issue. Selective criticism of indigenous efforts will only jeopardise such efforts. India has a huge population to be vaccinated and we need to move ahead.

19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,||The limits of Biden||On January 20, Joe Biden will be sworn in as the 46th President of the U.S., heading an administration brimming with Obama era appointees. However, unlike Barack Obama, and contrary to his aspiration to renew American leadership internationally, Mr. Biden’s political energies will be consumed by challenges at home. The Democrats’ razor-thin majority in Congress is just the tip of the iceberg. Mr. Biden enjoyed a massive seven million popular vote margin of victory over President Donald Trump, but Mr. Trump would still be sitting in the Oval Office today had a mere 42,918 votes of the seven million popular votes changed hands in the battleground States of Wisconsin, Arizona, and Georgia. This would also have been the case had an equally small 2,57,025 ballots (of the 15.5 million cast) across the Rust Belt States of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin gone in favour of Mr. Trump. Blue-collar votes The skewed vote count is an artifact of the rural and Republican Party-leaning bias of the American electoral college system. Indeed, no Republican candidate has secured a majority or plurality of the presidential vote over the past three decades with the exception of George W. Bush in 2004, yet Republicans have held the White House for almost as long as the Democrats have over this period. Regardless, as Mr. Biden gets down to business, the upshot of his razor-thin margin and the Democrats’ electoral college disadvantage is that the blue-collar vote will again be on the ballot in 2024. Like Mr. Trump who eked out a narrow 77,736 combined vote edge in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in 2016, Mr. Biden’s path to the White House will have to run through these Rust Belt States. The ferment in blue-collar America can be traced to the nation’s sputtering economic engine and rank inequality in its midst. During the last six decades of the 20th century, the U.S. averaged GDP growth of 3.9% a year; in each of the first two decades this century, the economy has failed to break through the 2% mark – even as the federal government’s debt-to-GDP ratio has tripled in just 15 years and breached the problematic 100% threshold. As globalisation and digitalisation have accentuated social divisions, roughly one in seven prime-age men – mostly white, working-class, and lacking a college degree – have exited the labour market altogether. If anything, these trends will only worsen as the one-off structural forces that propelled America’s late 20th century ‘golden economic age’ – favourable ‘baby boomer’ demographics; rise in women’s labour market participation; expansion of tertiary education; huge increase in household debt – move into reversal over the next quarter century. Ramifications So from an international perspective, what does this all amount to? First, on international trade, Mr. Biden’s margin for manoeuvre will be narrow and his approach will more resemble Mr. Trump’s populism and protectionism (minus the premeditated rule-breaking) than Mr. Obama’s liberalising tendencies. This comes at an inopportune moment too. China is currently stitching-up trade and investment agreements with European and Asian counterparts, and it is only a matter of time before it accedes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement championed ironically by then-Vice President Biden to contain China’s influence in setting tomorrow’s trade rules for Asia. Second, Mr. Biden will lack the purpose, and deep pockets, to marshal a coalition and mount a sustained challenge to Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Expect a mishmash of American equipment deals and sweetheart financing that presses on the BRI’s neuralgic points in select countries to discomfit China but without achieving any permanent gains. The most consequential ramification, however, concerns not Mr. Biden but the Republican Party. Should it continue its reversion to the economically populist, socially conservative, and geopolitically isolationist party of yore on the back of illiberal white nativist grievance, the implications for the international system could be profound.

19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Whatever it takes||Faith in entities is often an act of personal commitment not amenable to falsification, but trust in a scientific process can be established with confidence-building measures and full disclosure of all relevant data. Any mass campaign that involves voluntary effort on the part of the public can succeed only when transparency and open communication channels are the tools of choice. If the poor rate of uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in most of the States in the country is any indication, the government has not taken the people of the country along, in what is a purely voluntary exercise, but one vested with great power to retard the pace of the epidemic. For instance, Tamil Nadu, a State perceived to be largely health literate, and relatively well-equipped with health infrastructure, achieved only over 16% of its targeted coverage on the launch day. On the second day of vaccination, the compliance further dropped; in some States, vaccination was suspended. A marked favouring of the Covishield vaccine over Covaxin was also noticed in multiple States. But none of this is a surprise. The signs, verily, were out there for everyone to see, for a long time indeed. Studies measured high levels of vaccine hesitancy among the general population, and among health-care workers, the first in the line list of people to receive free vaccination. Clearly, vaccine hesitancy was not addressed sufficiently, or not taken seriously enough. With the sequence of events that followed the clearance of Emergency Use Authorisation (in Covaxin, it is emergency use authorisation in ‘clinical trial mode’) — a high-handed announcement with little attempt to put out compelling evidence in the public domain, or answer multiple queries in press conferences — vaccine hesitancy merely dug its heels in deeper. The inability of the government and agencies involved to amicably resolve controversies surrounding the clearance for Covaxin, even before it was able to produce interim data on efficacy from phase-3 trials, has had a direct consequence, as witnessed by poor numbers in its uptake so far. A vaccine, unequivocally, is public good, but the lack of transparency surrounding the roll-out of the COVID vaccines has done little to enhance trust in this experiential principle. This uncommon haste in trying to lunge towards the tape while still some distance from the finish line might have been justified if the state had taken the people along. Vaccinating the nation, however, is less a race than a slow and steady process. Building confidence in the process is crucial to achieving the task at hand. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s oft-repeated mantra, ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’, is very relevant here. And the Health Ministry must do whatever it takes to make a success of the vaccination drive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/whatever-it-takes/article33604801.ece
19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Poison and prison||Russian authorities have repeatedly tried to play down the political importance of Alexei Navalny, the opposition politician who was poisoned in Siberia five months ago, saying he is unpopular. President Vladimir Putin, while answering questions from reporters in December on the poison attack, said, ‘who needs him anyway’. But the arrest of the 44-year-old Kremlin critic upon his return to Moscow on Sunday — he left the country in a coma from the near-fatal chemical attack — only belies such claims. The authorities diverted his plane to a different airport on the outskirts and detained him before he could get past the passport control, while riot police were deployed to stop his supporters from entering the arrival zone of another airport. Russian authorities had warned that he would be arrested if he returned from Germany, where he was recovering from the poison attack, as he had been wanted since late December for violations of his suspended sentence from an embezzlement case. But Mr. Navalny, who has accused Mr. Putin of ordering the poison attack, still chose to travel to Russia, in an open defiance of Mr. Putin’s power, and courted arrest. On Monday, a judge remanded him in custody for 30 days. In Mr. Navalny, Mr. Putin has found his strongest political opponent in his two-decade-long rule. Once known for his extreme nationalist and anti-immigrant views, Mr. Navalny has turned himself into the embodiment of the anti-Kremlin politics in Russia, which remains tightly controlled by Mr. Putin. And it is no secret that the Kremlin has tried its best to suppress his political movement. He has been detained several times and criminal cases launched against him. He was barred from contesting the 2018 Presidential election. And in August, he collapsed while on a domestic flight from Siberia. German doctors who treated him later confirmed that he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. Western media investigations had implicated Russian agents, an allegation the government has denied. Even if Russian agents were not involved, Mr. Putin cannot escape questions about his most prominent political opponent being poisoned within Russia. His government has the responsibility to investigate what happened in Siberia and bring the perpetrators to justice. That is what any government that believes in the rule of law should be doing. But instead of finding and punishing those who attacked him, Mr. Putin’s government, like any dictatorial regime, is going after the victim. It is ironic that Mr. Putin, who recently got the Constitution amended so that he could stay in power beyond two consecutive terms, is still perturbed by the presence of a leader who he says nobody wants. If the long years of attempts to suppress Mr. Navalny’s political activism have achieved anything, it is that he is now a stronger opposition figure with international standing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/poison-and-prison/article33604802.ece

This is not surprising, especially in agricultural countries where the higher standard of life in the cities pulls in more people from the villages than the jobs available to them. In this sort of situation, political parties demanding priority for the sons of the soil are likely to nourish and the Shiv Sena in Bombay had grown powerful on this basis. But the Shiv Sena is by no means unique: with the growth of linguistic States, regionalism and parochialism have flourished all over the country especially in a period of food shortage and unemployment. Even the communist parties, despite their ideological claims, have developed in West Bengal and Kerala on the basis of local sub-nationalism and won success at the polls by raising the cry of discrimination by the Central Government which stands for the equal treatment of all regional groups.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/shiv-senas-new-look-from-an-editorial/article33604808.ece

China will, however, likely be the only major economy to have avoided a contraction in a pandemic-hit year, underlining its strong recovery after weeks of lockdown at the start of the year brought economic activity in the Asian giant to a near-standstill. Post-lockdown rebound China’s economy contracted 6.8% in the first quarter. The stringent lockdown did, however, allow the country to broadly curb the spread of COVID-19 at home by the summer. The economy recovered to grow 3.2% in the second quarter, 4.9% in the third and 6.5% in the last quarter of 2020. While China is currently dealing with the return of clusters of local outbreaks, the fact that the spread was limited and controlled meant the impact on the economy would be “controllable”, the head of China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in Beijing, Ning Jizhe, told reporters. 100-trillion yuan mark The NBS noted that the economy had also crossed the landmark of 100 trillion yuan ($15.4 trillion) for the first time in 2020. If the last quarter’s strong growth brought some cheer to China, Monday’s data showed that it had come at a cost. The government’s long-term plan to rebalance growth and rely more on domestic consumption rather than state-led investment, ended up taking a step backward, as did its efforts to trim the ballooning national debt. A range of stimulus measures, largely led by spending on infrastructure projects, was the main driver of growth in 2020 along with a rebound in exports, which grew 10.9% in December and 4% last year. Retail sales shrink Value-added industrial output was up 2.8%, as the last quarter saw growth of 7.1%. Fixed asset investment grew 2.9%. Retail sales, however, contracted by 3.9% last year, after expanding 8% in 2019. The other bright spot for the economy was on the jobs front. The post-pandemic government support measures helped create 11.86 million new urban jobs, beating the 9 million target and marking a turnaround after the first quarter’s massive job losses. One report had estimated that as many as 80 million people had lost work as of March in the wake of the lockdown measures.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/chinas-economy-grows-23-slowest-pace-in-44-years/article33604784.ece
19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘India, China may take lead in Asia’s Covid vaccination plans’||India and China are expected to take the lead in driving Asia’s vaccination plans efforts, even as third waves of infections and stringent measures to curb fresh COVID-19 cases in Japan, South Korea and some South-East Asian Nations remain a dampener for Asia’s uneven economic recovery, Moody’s Analytics said in a note. Terming India’s beginning of the vaccination programme a ‘crucial development’ for Asia, the firm said that the country’s advances on this front would soften the severity of the pandemic in Asia, especially as India is the second most-impacted country after the U.S. “As the largest producer of vaccines in the world, with 60% of the global share, India is well-positioned to use its existing manufacturing capabilities to contribute to mass vaccine production and distribution needs for other countries in addition to meeting its domestic requirements,” the note said. “With exports of the COVID-19 vaccines expected to begin soon, India [along with China] look set to take the lead in driving the region’s distribution efforts in the months ahead,” the note added. Indonesia’s approval of China’s COVID-19 vaccine Sinovac for emergency use, the first country outside China to do so, could open the door for other Asian economies to follow suit. However, mixed reports on the vaccine’s effectiveness have set back vaccination plans in countries considering its use, the firm said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/india-china-may-take-lead-in-asias-covid-vaccination-plans/article33604790.ece
19 January 2021||MUMBAI,||Avian flu outbreak to hit Jan. poultry sales: Crisil||The bird flu outbreak in India could impact poultry sales by a third this month, but the industry will likely bounce back in quick time, with profitability intact for the full fiscal. This has been indicated by Crisil’s analysis of 87 poultry companies, which account for 30% of the industry’s revenue. The flu has led to reduction of about 30% of broiler chicken volumes, bringing down the daily chicken demand in India from 100 lakh kg in December 2020 to an estimated 70 lakh kg in January 2021, Crisil said. Additionally, wholesale prices of broiler chicken have crashed 20-30% from Rs. 105-110 per kg in December to Rs. 80 per kg. Given this, overall revenue could decline 30-40% in January 2021 due to a fall in realisations and volume, Crisil said. Since wholesale prices usually correct sharply following such outbreaks, the fall in prices would be temporary, it added. “The impact of the outbreak on the industry will depend on its intensity and duration,” Dinesh Jain, Director, Crisil Ratings, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/avian-flu-outbreak-to-hit-jan-poultry-sales-crisil/article33604788.ece
19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Sugar output rises 31% to 142.7 lakh tonnes: ISMA||The country’s sugar output rose by 31% to 142.7 lakh tonnes in the first three-and-a-half months of the 2020-21 marketing year that started in October, industry association ISMA said on Monday. Production in India, the world’s second-largest sugar-producing country, had been recorded at 108.9 lakh tonnes till January 15 of the 2019-20 marketing year (October-September). The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) has projected sugar output to rise 13% to 310 lakh tonnes in the 2020-21 marketing year on likely higher availability of sugarcane, as against 274.2 lakh tonnes last year. Releasing the latest production update, ISMA said the country’s sugar output is higher by 33.76 lakh tonne so far this year as compared to last year’s production for the corresponding period. It said 487 sugar mills were in operation in the said period as against 440. Sugar production in U.P., the country’s leading sugar- producing State, remained slightly lower at 42.99 lakh tonnes till January 15, as against 43.78 lakh tonne in the year-earlier period.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/sugar-output-rises-31-to-1427-lakh-tonnes-isma/article33604796.ece

19 January 2021||BENGALURU,||Shreyas Gopal does it for Karnataka||Karnataka defeated Uttar Pradesh by five wickets in its last Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy league stage match to finish with 16 points from five games (four wins), but its progress further in the tournament will depend on Tuesday’s results. Punjab, with five wins out of five, qualified for the quarterfinals as the Elite Group A winner, leaving Karnataka to jostle for one of two places reserved for the second-best teams. Himachal, which came second in Elite Group C behind Baroda, with 16 points and four wins, already has a net run rate above Karnataka’s (+0.940 to +0.292), further narrowing the defending champion’s chances. Karnataka didn’t help its cause on Monday, taking 19.3 overs to chase down Uttar Pradesh’s 132-run total. Padikkal comes good Devdutt Padikkal came good again, scoring a 19-ball 34 (4x4, 2x6) but like in the previous games, found little support. Opening partner Rohan Kadam fell for five while K.L. Shrijith was out for his second golden duck in as many matches. Skipper Karun Nair lumbered along for a 21-ball 21 while Anirudha Joshi took 32 balls to score 21, slowing things down drastically. From overs six to 16.1, Karnataka scored just 59 runs, leaving the lower order with much to do. Shreyas Gopal responded to the call with a quickfire 47 (28b, 5x4, 1x6) that carried his side home, and will now be hoping for the effort to be more than just academic. Leather hunt Earlier, after being put into bat, the Uttar Pradesh openers sent the Karnataka bowlers on a leather hunt. Only J. Suchith’s intervention helped break the 69-run stand between Abhishek Goswami (47, 32b, 5x4, 2x6) and Karan Sharma (41, 29b, 2x4, 3x6), with the former stumped by Shrijith. Karan continued to prosper before Suchith and leggie Pravin Dubey removed him and Suresh Raina in the space of three balls. The spin duo then accounted for the Uttar Pradesh middle-order too, dismissing captain Priyam Garg, Hardeep Singh and Nalin Mishra. Suchith finished with figures of 3/21 from four overs and Dubey 3/15, while Shreyas was economical (1/22 from four overs). The fine bowling performance — in the absence of K. Gowtham who is out of the tournament after a split webbing in his left hand — saw no Uttar Pradesh batsman, apart from the openers, get into double digits. The effort, unfortunately, was not fully complemented by the batsmen.  The scores: Elite A (Bengaluru): Railways 133/9 in 20 overs (Mrunal Devdhar 57, Pratham Singh 42, Umran Malik 3/24) lost to Jammu & Kashmir 135/3 in 15.5 overs (Suryansh Raina 48, Abdul Samad 39).   Punjab 183/3 in 20 overs (Mandeep Singh 99 n.o., Gurkeerat Mann 63) bt Tripura 161/4 in 20 overs (Udiyan Bose 50, Milind Kumar 64 n.o., Rajat Dey 38 n.o.). Punjab qualified.   Uttar Pradesh 132/8 in 20 overs (Abhishek Goswami 47, Karan Sharma 41, J. Suchith 3/21, Pravin Dubey 3/15) lost to Karnataka 136/5 in 19.3 overs (Devdutt Padikkal 34, Shreyas Gopal 47 n.o.).   Final standings: Punjab 5-5-0-20 (+2.483); Karnataka 5-4-1-16 (+0.292); J & K 5-3-2-12 (+0.243); Railways 5-2-3-8 (-1.357); Uttar Pradesh 5-1-4-4 (-0.291); Tripura 5-0-5-0 (-1.427).

19 January 2021||KOLKATA,||Jharkhand edges past Hyderabad||Jharkhand defeated Hyderabad via Super Over in an Elite Group B match of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 tournament at the Eden Gardens here on Monday. Hyderabad scored 139 for eight, while Jharkhand ended at 139 for nine. In the Super Over, Jharkhand made 23 for no loss and restricted Hyderabad to 14 for one to finish with three wins. Hyderabad managed just one victory. Early inroads Opting to field, Jharkhand made early inroads. Vivek Tiwari claimed Pragnay Reddy leg before and had Thakur Tilak Varma caught at third man in the second over. B. Sandeep (37, 34b, 4x4) and Tanmay Agarwal (13) added 30 before the latter was removed by Bal Krishna. Sandeep played some attractive shots, primarily on the off-side, as he forged a 28-run association with Himalay Agarwal (26, 28b, 1x4, 1x6). Sandeep fell playing a reverse sweep off Utkarsh Singh. Himalay and B. Rahul (26, 20b, 1x4, 1x6) gathered 41. Left-arm seamer Vikash Singh returned to dismiss both in the 18th over when Hyderabad looked to score quickly. T. Ravi Teja (12, 7b, 1x6) and C.V. Milind (16, 5b, 2x4, 1x6) flexed their muscles as Hyderabad collected 30 off the last 10 deliveries. Good start In reply, openers Ishan Kishan (27, 19b, 3x4, 1x6) and Utkarsh (29, 26b, 4x4) provided Jharkhand a good start. Ishan chose the leg side, while Utkash played it straight. Ravi Teja broke the 43-run partnership by dismissing Ishan in the sixth over. Ajay Dev Goud claimed Utkarsh and Virat Singh in the 11th over and Kumar Suraj in 13th to put Jharkhand under pressure. Rakshan Reddy got rid of Saurabh Tiwary (nine) while Ravi sent back Kaushal Singh (24, 19b, 2x4, 1x6) to make the chase tougher. Anukul Roy’s unbeaten 28 (13b, 3x6) helped Jharkhand tie the scores.

19 January 2021||Brisbane,||Rain adds a twist in the tale of an engrossing Gabba Test||India will need to score 328 runs for victory or bat all day for a draw after bowling Australia out for 294 midway through the final session on day four of the decisive fourth Test at the Gabba on Monday. Mohammed Siraj had Josh Hazlewood caught on the boundary to end the Australian innings as rain clouds formed over the ground. Early close Indian openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill then faced just 11 balls, reaching four without loss, before light rain began to fall and play was called off for the day. Siraj and fellow quick Shardul Thakur were exceptional throughout Monday as they kept the Australian scoring rate largely under control while taking wickets at regular intervals. Although most of the Australian batsmen got starts, only Steve Smith converted and even he fell for 55 when surprised by a Siraj short ball. Australia needs to win to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy but, with more rain forecast for Tuesday, India will fancy its chances of surviving for the draw it needs to keep the silverware. The highest successful run chase at the Gabba is the 236 that Australia scored to beat the West Indies in 1951. But, India has always been in the contest since its disastrous capitulation in the first Test in Adelaide when it was bowled out for 36. India came back and won the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne then batted for more than a day to draw the Sydney Test. Pulling things back India claimed four wickets in the morning session to peg back a flying start by David Warner and Marcus Harris. The two added 68 runs in 19 overs before Harris fell for 38 trying to duck a Shardul short ball only for it to graze his glove on the way to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant. It prompted a mini-collapse as two runs later Washington Sundar trapped Warner lbw for 48, the Australian opener's highest score since his return from a groin strain in the third Test in Sydney. First innings century-maker Marnus Labuschagne came to the crease and continued to attack, blasting five boundaries on his way to a quickfire 25 before he was straightened up by a Siraj delivery and edged a simple catch to Rohit at second slip. Siraj, who was expensive in his early overs, then had Matthew Wade caught behind down the leg-side for a duck three balls later to leave Australia 123 for four. Smith and Cameron Green then began to take the game away from the visitors, though both had let-offs. Smith was dropped at long-off by Siraj on 38 while Green survived a caught and bowled chance on 14. But Siraj, who returned five for 73, made amends when he got one to leap into Smith's glove with the former captain on 55. Shardul went on to finish with four for 61 as he accounted for Green, Tim Paine and Nathan Lyon.  I think a drawn series will be worse than the loss a couple of years ago, considering how hard India has found it going through 20 players in a series Ricky Ponting||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rain-adds-a-twist-in-the-tale-of-an-engrossing-gabba-test/article33604902.ece
19 January 2021||KOLKATA,||Jagadeesan and Karthik take TN home||N. Jagadeesan hammered his fourth successive half-century to steer Tamil Nadu to an eight-wicket win over Bengal in an Elite Group B match of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 tournament at the Eden Gardens here on Monday. Chasing Bengal’s 163 for eight. Dinesh Karthik’s men reached the target in 18 overs to secure their fifth consecutive victory and cruised into the quarterfinals as group topper. Bengal, asked to bat first, lost wickets at regular intervals. Off-spinner B. Aparajith, opening the bowling, bowled his quicker deliveries to telling effect as he castled the openers Vivek Singh (7) and Shreevats Goswami (21, 17b, 2x4, 1x6). Suvankar Bal (14) perished trying to dominate left-arm spinner R. Sai Kishore. And when Shahbaz Ahmed was run out, and Manoj Tiwary stumped by a lightning effort by Karthik, Bengal was 87 for five. Kaif, Majumdar shine Kaif Ahmed (63 n.o., 47b, 5x4, 2x6) revived the innings, adding 56 in the company of captain Anustup Majumdar (34, 22b, 4x4). Kaif counter-attacked, playing some explosive shots on way to his maiden fifty. Majumdar, on the other hand, placed the ball deftly for boundaries. Slinger G. Periyasamy separated the pair, cleaning up Majumdar. Kaif, however, continued to score briskly and ended the innings in style by pulling pacer M. Mohammed for a mighty six. Despite the dew factor, the Bengal bowlers kept it tight as Tamil Nadu could only make 38 for one in the PowerPlay. It lost left-hander C. Hari Nishaanth (14), who was adjudged lbw off Arnab Nandi. The No. 3 batsman K.B. Arun Karthick (30, 20b, 3x4, 1x6) then forged a 40-run stand with Jagadeesan before being caught behind off Mukesh Kumar. Jagadeesan (71 n.o., 45b, 6x4, 4x6), who began quietly and even enjoyed a ‘life’ on 15, and Karthik (47 n.o., 31b, 7x4) batted sensibly. The two rotated the strike well before switching gears in the 12th over when Jagadeesan pulled Nandi for two sixes. Karthik, who hit most of his fours on the leg-side, soon joined the run feast. The duo’s 110-run association for the third wicket took the team home with two overs to spare.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/jagadeesan-and-karthik-take-tn-home/article33604957.ece
19 January 2021||MUMBAI,||Team for England series to be picked tomorrow||Chetan Sharma will chair his first national selection committee meeting on Wednesday, with the re-jigged panel set to pick the squad for the first two Tests against England, starting February 5. The big question on the minds of an all-bowlers’ selection committee will be the availability of key bowlers for the crucial home series. Since the bowling department has several injury concerns, it is understood that the panel will announce the squad only for the first two Tests, to be played in Chennai. Should the injured players be certified fit in time for the third Test, they can clear the COVID-19-related protocols and join the biosecure bubble in Ahmedabad ahead of the third Test. The only reason to smile for the selectors is the availability of Ishant Sharma, the veteran pacer on the cusp of the 100-Test mark. Ishant has proven his match-fitness during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and is a certainty. The selectors will be given the lowdown on the availability of other key bowlers — Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Umesh Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja and R. Ashwin — all of whom suffered injuries during the Border-Gavaskar series in Australia. Washington Sundar, who came good in Brisbane, and Kuldeep Yadav are set to be retained. It will be interesting to see whether the selectors hand a maiden Test call-up to leggie Yuzvendra Chahal. As for the batting department, it remains to be seen whether Prithvi Shaw retains his position as a reserve opener, with Shubman Gill having emerged as a reliable batsman at the top along with Rohit Sharma and Mayank Agarwal. Hazare on the cards Meanwhile, the BCCI is set to conduct the Vijay Hazare Trophy, the inter-State domestic one-day tournament, from February 15, leaving the fate of the Ranji Trophy in limbo in the pandemic-hit season. The apex council meeting on Sunday night was undecided on whether to conduct the Ranji or Hazare Trophy. But considering that the bio-secure hubs will have to be maintained for a longer duration for the Ranji, the BCCI is set to stick to the one-day tournament. The Hazare Trophy is likely to be conducted in the same format as the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, with the same groups and venues for the league stage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/team-for-england-series-to-be-picked-tomorrow/article33604896.ece

19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Drew strength from mom’s words: Siraj||It has been a roller-coaster ride for pacer Mohammed Siraj, who has gone from making his debut in the second Test to leading the attack in the fourth Test. On the fourth day, after a maiden five-wicket haul, the youngster said he was ready to take on the responsibility of shouldering the pace attack. Siraj, who was seen helping other pacers on the ground, said, “I don't consider myself a senior bowler, but having played a lot of domestic and India-A games helped. I missed Jassi bhai (Jasprit Bumrah). So I had to take more responsibility, build pressure and not try too many things.” It was an emotional moment for Siraj, who lost his father before the series began. His being in Australia at the time meant he could not fly home for the funeral due to COVID-19 protocols. “I wish he was there to see this day. It is because of his blessings that I got a five-wicket haul. It was a tough situation but I got strength after talking to mom, and my focus was to realise dad’s dream,” said the 26-year-old. The pacer from Hyderabad added that the cracks on the wicket are something the Indian batsmen would have to watch out for on the final day. “When they bowl, obviously there will be some confusion, it will play on the minds of the batsmen that there are cracks on the pitch. But our batsmen are prepared for this,” he said. Keeping it simple Steve Smith, likewise, reckoned the bowlers would have to keep it simple and not overdo things as Australia presses for victory. “I think the more you go searching on these kinds of tracks, then you probably don’t get the reward. So it is just about hitting good areas consistently and letting the natural variation of the wicket take its course,” said Smith. “I think the game is in a nice place for us. The wicket started to play a few tricks today. We saw a few balls shoot up, a couple kept low and a couple went off cracks, which always plays on the batter’s mind. So it is about hitting good areas and being patient,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/drew-strength-from-moms-words-siraj/article33604905.ece
19 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Triumphing over adversity||Mohammed Siraj’s success story is, to put it simply, one of triumph over adversity! The son of an autorickshaw driver, the pacer has risen from struggling in the narrow by-lanes of Toli Chowki here to spearheading India’s attack in Brisbane. The family is still in the three-month mourning period following the passing away of Siraj’s father, Mohammed Ghouse. But the 26-year-old paid what could be the biggest tribute to his late father on Monday, registering his maiden five-wicket haul in Test cricket. Not surprisingly, the joy of Siraj’s mother, Shabana Begum, knew no bounds. “ Yeh sab Allah ka dua hai (These are Allah’s blessings),” she told The Hindu , minutes after her son spoke to her from Brisbane. Focus on the game The proud mother, who remembers always encouraging Siraj to play cricket despite the difficulties they faced in the early days of his career, recalled that she told her son to focus on the game despite the tragedy. “There is nothing you can do by coming to India. Stay back, play for India. Fulfil your father's wish: desh ka naam roshan kar (bring fame to the country),” was her advice. When Siraj looked up at the sky after his fifth wicket, it was an emotional reminder of how much he would have loved his father to have been able to share what his family members, including elder brother Mohammed Ismail, believe to be a ‘golden moment’. ‘Spotted’ by former Andhra pacer Jyothi Prasad, Siraj has never let down those who have had faith in him, his hard work and commitment shining through. Current India bowling coach Bharat Arun made a huge impact on the young seamer when he took over as Hyderabad coach in 2016-17 and the national selection panel headed by M.S.K. Prasad was quick to recognise his potential.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/triumphing-over-adversity/article33604907.ece

19 January 2021||Melbourne,||Players finding ways to deal with quarantine||With no way out, tennis players in lockdown are figuring out ways to keep themselves fit within the confines of their Melbourne hotel rooms as they prepare for the Australian Open. Angelique Kerber spent her birthday in quarantine on Monday. Kerber is among the 72 players doing hard quarantine for 14 days after five positive coronavirus tests were returned from charter flights that brought here almost 1,200 players, coaches, officials and media. That means those players won't be allowed to leave their hotel rooms or practice for 14 days, creating a two-speed preparation period for the tournament. Others in less rigorous quarantine will be allowed to practice for five hours daily. Those outdoor sessions started on Monday in Melbourne. A smaller group of players who landed in Adelaide, including Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, are also allowed outside to practice under bio-secure protocols. Responding to unconfirmed reports that Djokovic, an eight-time Australian Open champion, had proposed a list of ideas to change the quarantine conditions for players, Victoria State premier Daniel Andrews said: “People are free to provide lists of demands, but the answer is no.” Warning Players have been warned that breaching the rules could result in fines or being moved to a more secure quarantine complex with police stationed at their doors. Victoria state COVID-19 quarantine commissioner Emma Cassar said over the weekend there would be “zero tolerance" for people trying to breach the rules. Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley remains adamant the tournament will start February 8, saying organisers would have to “manage an environment over the next 14 days for those who won't be able to practice”. “It’s a tough situation,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/players-finding-ways-to-deal-with-quarantine/article33605194.ece

19 January 2021||ROME,||Inter trumps Juventus, in joint-lead||Inter Milan’s Nicolo Barella scored one goal and set up another to help secure a 2-0 ‘Derby of Italy’ victory over champion Juventus and send his side joint-top of Serie A while putting a major dent in the Turin side’s title hopes. Former Juve midfielder Arturo Vidal scored his first league goal for Inter when he headed in an inviting Barella cross after 12 minutes. Antonio Conte’s side grabbed a deserved second after the break when Barella raced onto a long Alessandro Bastoni pass and finished clinically into the top corner, after which the victory was never in doubt as Juve failed to threaten a comeback. It was Conte’s first Serie A win on his fourth attempt against the club he previously represented as a player and coach., Juventus has a game in hand over Inter but is fifth with 33 points, leaving Andrea Pirlo’s side with a lot of ground to make up in its quest for a 10th consecutive Serie A title. In the Premier League, Manchester City steamed into second place with defender John Stones scoring an unlikely double in a 4-0 demolition of visiting Crystal Palace on Sunday. Ilkay Gundogan and Raheem Sterling were the other marksmen. City has 35 points from 17 games and is ahead of Leicester City on goal difference with Liverpool fourth on 34.

19 January 2021||Galle,||England seals seven-wkt. win||England won the first Test against Sri Lanka by seven wickets on Monday with Jonny Bairstow and Dan Lawrence negotiating a tricky finish. After losing three quick wickets before the overnight close, Bairstow and Lawrence scored the required 36 runs in less than 10 overs on the final day. The crumbling pitch gave Sri Lanka's spinners hopes of claiming more wickets but Bairstow (35) and Lawrence (21) took England to 76 for three after resuming at 38 for three. Sri Lanka called a review on one Dilruwan Perera ball to Lawrence, who missed his reverse sweep. But the TV replay found the faintest edge before it hit his pads. England captain Root said the lack of preparation before the match had been a handicap. He said the performance of spinners Dom Bess and Jack Leach, who each took five wickets in an innings, was a “brilliant achievement”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/england-seals-seven-wkt-win/article33604899.ece

19 January 2021||BAMBOLIM,||10-man EB proves equal to CFC||A 10-man SC East Bengal (SCEB) frustrated Chennaiyin FC (CFC), holding it to a goalless draw at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on Monday. Despite enjoying a numerical advantage for close to an hour, Chennaiyin failed to get the winner and blew up another opportunity to move into the top four in the Indian Super League (ISL). This was Chennaiyin's fifth goalless draw this season — the most by a side. Csaba Laszlo’s CFC was poor when in possession. And whenever it created chances, SCEB goalkeeper Debjit Majumder thwarted its attempts.  The best opportunity of the opening period fell to Enes Sipovic off a free kick in the 23rd minute. Eli Sabia hooked in a cross to the far post for his centre-back partner Sipovic. The latter, however, failed to get his header on target from close range. Just before the water break, East Bengal was down to 10. On-loan midfielder Ajay Chhetri, making his first start of the season, received his second yellow card for a lunging tackle on Rahim Ali. Laszlo brought on forward Jakub Sylvestr for Anirudh Thapa (who suffered a hamstring injury) at the beginning of the second period to add creativity to the attack. Brilliant save Ten minutes into the the half, Debjit dived brilliantly to push away Esmael Goncalves’ curler after he was set up by Sylvestr. East Bengal nearly delivered the killer blow in the 62nd minute, when Anthony Pilkington beat the offside trap, brought down a long ball and had a shot at goal, but was denied by Vishal Kaith. Chennaiyin piled on attackers in search of the winner, with Lallianzuala Chhangte, Rahim, Sylvestr and Fatkhulo Fatkhulloev all having a shot at goal, but Debjit stood in the way.  The result:   Chennaiyin FC 0 drew with SC East Bengal 0.   Tuesday’s match: Hyderabad FC vs Odisha FC, 7.30 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/10-man-eb-proves-equal-to-cfc/article33604943.ece

19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Path of dharma||The story of Naabaga is related by Suka to Parikshit in the Bhagavata Purana. In a discourse, Sri B. Sundarkumar drew attention to many interesting insights that this story provides. First of all, it is shown that God confers untold benefits on one who stands by principled conduct for its own sake at all costs. Naabaga is the youngest son of Nabaga, one of Manu’s sons. He is the most learned among his brothers and spends a longer time in Gurukula. In the meanwhile, the other brothers, thinking that Naabaga would continue his sastra studies, partition the entire ancestral property among themselves. But eventually, Naabaga returns and asks for his share. Since they have not left anything for him, they tell him to approach their father. The father agrees that this is not right, but tells him he need not be disappointed. He asks him to be present in a great yagna being performed by Sage Angiras and others. He could join them and help them in chanting certain mantras which they might not remember exactly at the appropriate moment. The rishis are pleased with his timely help and before departing, they gift him all the remains of the sacrifice as a token of gratitude. But Rudra, to whom the remains in any sacrifice belong, appears and claims the share given to the boy. The son goes back to the father and the father also agrees that this is the dharma in any yagna. So he asks Naabaga to pray to Rudra and ask forgiveness. Rudra is pleased with the boy and appreciates the fact that the father has stood by dharma and that he has also spoken the truth. Rudra instructs him in Brahma Jnana and also gives him all the wealth that remained unused in the sacrifice. The son then leads a peaceful and prosperous life devoted to God along with his father.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/path-of-dharma/article33604892.ece

19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,||The game plan||Pandemic or not, Malayalam actor-musician Sreenath Bhasi loves being in the creative zone. While the lockdown laid him low temporarily, he brushed up his music to keep things ticking. “In a way, the lockdown initially served as a break because I had been quite busy [with film shoots]. But soon, I was stuck at home for three months or so. Making music was a way of getting out of the stasis,” says Sreenath over phone from Dubai, where he is shooting for Al Karama by debutant director Refiy Muhammed. Teaming up with musician and DJ Shekar Menon, with whom he had a notable collaboration in the 2012 rom-com Da Thadiya , Sreenath brought out the music video ‘KozhiPunk’ (Chicken Punk) in September 2020, based on a 1971 satiric poem, Kozhipanku , by poet K Satchidanandan. With psychedelic visuals and beats, its subtext is dark, hard-hitting and ostensibly political. “I find the poem relevant even today. We, in fact, ended up making quite a few tracks during the period, though we released only ‘KozhiPunk’. We plan to bring out the rest by and by,” he says. Last year, the actor lent his voice as a co-singer for ‘Mathayichan’ in the Fahadh Faasil-starrer Trance . Sreenath says he had a delightful musical experience as a co-curator of the recently held digital Hip Hop festival ‘Para’ (Say) organised by Kochi Music Foundation that was streamed on YouTube. “It was great to see all these artistes coming and performing under one roof. In Kerala, we now have a talent pool of musicians,” he observes. On the film front, the actor from Kochi is looking forward to his first release since the pandemic in the family entertainer Sumesh & Ramesh directed by Sanoop Thykoodam. “It is a light-hearted flick revolving around two brothers, Sumesh and Ramesh. I play Sumesh, who is an unassuming guy and Balu Varghese [actor] is my brother, Ramesh,” he explains. His previous theatre release was Kappela , which was removed from theatres a few days after the nationwide lockdown came into effect last year.  Sumesh & Ramesh was shot before the pandemic. However, the first film Sreenath resumed shooting for was Home, directed by Rojin Thomas of Philips and the Monkey Pen fame. “In Home , I essay the role of a writer who tries to finish shaping the climax of an important movie. He tries to get his creative juices flowing against a tight deadline. The movie is about the pressure he faces,” he adds. Sreenath says once he wraps up Al Karama , he will join the sets of an Amal Neerad venture. He has also signed up for Idi Mazha Kaattu (Thunder, Rain, Wind) alongside Chemban Vinod Jose in which he plays “a school teacher who has gone mad over politics”. Next up is a project with Abhilash S Kumar, who directed the ‘KozhiPunk’ video. The actor says both acting and music come to him naturally. “I don't have to strike a balance. I try to have fun with both. I want to do all these things at the same time and never stick to just one activity. I am also waiting for gigs and shows to get back on track.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/the-game-plan/article33605148.ece
19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,||Power to the women||When Asha Scaria, founder of ethical clothing brand Swara VOW (Voice of Women), broached the idea of an online portal for garments stitched by the women from the tribal communities of Dungarpur, it was met with scepticism. “The women were suspicious of the idea: they wondered whether, and how it would work. The concept of e-commerce — selling and buying online — was foreign to them. They could not understand how that could happen, and why anybody outside Dungarpur would buy what they made,” says Asha. Two years later, not only has the brand provided sustained employment to women employed by it, but also created in them a sense of empowerment. Actors Priyanka Chopra and Bhumi Pednekar have mentioned the brand on their socials. “The recognition empowers the women and makes them feel that they can do anything. They understand the value of their work,” Asha says. Swara is one of the few brands in the country which is a member of the Cultural Intellectual Property Rights Initiative, an international movement which not only recognises cultural IP rights for craftsmen but also acknowledges women as custodians and transmitters of traditional knowledge, designs and manufacturing techniques. Asha says preservation of culture — cultural sustainability — is perceived as the ‘luxury pillar’ of the sustainability movement. Cultural sustainability is defined as the preservation of culture — beliefs, practices, and heritage among others aspects. “What happens to culture when we are done dealing with the more pressing sustainability issues? What if there is no culture left to preserve?” she asks. The brand pivots on the artisan who is acknowledged as an equal partner. In this case women artisans. “We want to enable and empower them,” she says. “The women work from home; they don’t have to step out and they set the pace. This way there is no reason for them to sacrifice their jobs and it keeps them employed, empowered,” says Asha, who hails from Ettumanoor in Kerala. Asha embarked on the project in 2018, when she was in Dungarpur doing the Gandhi Fellowship. It [the Fellowship] grooms fellows to become ‘change leaders’ to initiate change in existing social and public systems. Asha had been interacting with local women so she knew them, their lives and skills. Plus, she had help from others who were part of the Fellowship and were in Dungarpur with her. As part of Government-run skill development programmes or CSR initiatives, the women had acquired basic tailoring, owned sewing machines and had been sewing for local customers. It took some convincing over several rounds of conversations with them — as groups and individually too. Although the women had been stitching, they were put through a month’s up-skilling so that their work would be on a par with what is available online. The first collection was made of indigo-dyed, Dabu fabric — a mud-resist, block technique — sourced from artisans in nearby Akola. The engagement continues, Swara brands and markets saris the artisans make. Asha has already established a rapport with the women as part of her work related to the Gandhi Fellowship. Explaining the idea of online shopping took some time, all devices at hand — smartphones and tablets — were put to use to show how it works. While Swara has trained 40 tailors, it has worked with more than 70 tailors (artisans) directly or through NGOs. The number of tailors the brand works with has come down due to the lockdown. Currently Swara works with clusters identified by SEWA Bharat, a federation of women-led institutions which works towards providing economic and social support for women. Asha works with NGOs that have already mobilised women artisans. Swara works with women in need of support — women in rural and/or tribal areas or survivors of human trafficking. The core areas are product development and marketing. “We help take the artisan’s product to the consumer. Product development is the key, as is understanding the market. We want to help the women who get left behind,” she says. She started with an Instagram handle (@swaravow) and built a base. Swara is registered as a ‘for profit social enterprise’ as she wants to show that a sustainable model, with social welfare at its heart, is possible. She hopes more people would perhaps do the same. The payoff for Asha is the empowerment of the women she works with, “they understand the value of their work when they see it being valued outside. It gives them exposure to the outside world.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/power-to-the-women/article33605157.ece
19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,||The rural route||Harshith Malgireddy, 21, is a BTech final year student from Hyderabad, trying to make sense of all the positive feedback that is coming his way for his debut feature film, Mail , streaming on Aha. “It feels wonderful when people tell me that I have acted well. I love the movies, but I am still not sure what I want to become,” he says when asked about career plans. Harshith is a known face in the TikTok and YouTube circuit, having featured in short films and concept videos. “I’ve been doing videos on and off for the last three years; after working for different YouTube channels, I got selected for Chai Bisket and was part of around 10 of their videos,” says Harshith, keen to dispel the notion that those who make TikTok videos or for YouTube channels are not talented enough. An assistant director spotted him at a dubbing studio when he was working on a video for Chai Bisket and recommended his name to director Uday Gurrala for Mail . “I got the opportunity without having to roam around Krishna Nagar [the locality in Hyderabad where aspiring actors and technicians reside] with my portfolio,” he says. During the lockdown, he had watched the Hindi web series Panchayat and hoped that someone would narrate a rooted, rustic story in Telugu. Naturally, he was overjoyed when he heard the story of Mail , set in rural Telangana: “I loved the story; the writing was so good and newcomers like me, Mani (as the friend Subbu) and Gouri Priya had a good director who could lead us.” A nearly month-long workshop helped him learn the Telangana rural dialect and vibe with his co-stars: “By the time we went to shoot, we knew all the lines and then improvised on the expressions. Darshianna(Priyadarshi) was the senior and popular actor and he, too, made us feel very comfortable,” says Harshith. During the workshop and on set, Harshith would watch how Uday enacted the scenes to the actors and imbibed the body language: “I am pretty good at imitating people.” Harshith has been a film buff since school and gradually began to watch films across languages, learning to appreciate different genres in world cinema: “I began to appreciate movies that are based on real-life stories or have a more realistic tone. I enjoy watching Malayalam films and Fahadh Faasil is my role model.”     I appreciate movies that are based on real-life stories or have a more realistic tone.

19 January 2021||January 19 2021 00:00 IST,||In the village of tents||This is a village, it hits me, as I walk the kilometre and half of the flyover that farmers from Uttar Pradesh have occupied, at the Ghazipur border. There is a sense of community, as people wash clothes or cook together. There are no boundary walls that separate, and the doors — here, the tent flaps — open out into the street. When my cousin Dharmender Rathi, from Nirgajni in west UP’s Muzaffarnagar said he would be joining the protest, I decided to spend a night there, in solidarity. My friend Kiranjeet Chaturvedi joined me, as we talked to farmers, figured out sleeping arrangements, and set up a library with a few Hindi books. Dharmenderbhaiyyahad arranged a tarpaulin covered trolley parked under the flyover as our night shelter, right next to hundreds of others. We reached in the afternoon and were directed to the Mahila (women’s) block accommodation, a series of tents where the 40-50 women at the site could rest. We had our own changing room, a langar , and washrooms right across from here, with a ‘she store’ that had safety pins, sanitary napkins, even underwear. As the women plied us with warm socks and shoes — all donations — we felt safe and cared for. We decided to spend the night with the women — there were about eight in the tent, from the 20s to the 70s. We chatted into the night, as Delhi’s January cold descended. Some were to go to a wedding the next day, and were waiting for news of a bus departing. When they heard that it wasn’t going to, their only reaction was to say that perhaps they were meant to carry on with the sewa (service) — getting up early in the morning, making tea, preparing for the day’s meals by kneading the atta , making rotis. The men would start off thedalat 6 am in large wood-fired cauldrons, for lunch at 1 pm. It’s the best, smokiest dal to savour, and everyone is fed, from volunteers to rag pickers. Farmers rarely venture out of their villages. The thought of them living like refugees had filled me with angst, as I sat in my warm home with all its city luxuries. But here I was in the middle of a bustling village on the highway, being treated like a guest at a wedding, despite the incessant rain. I was amazed at the calm and bonhomie. We had shown up to offer support; instead, they filled us with hope. Farmers are used to changing winds, falling and rising temperatures, and waters flooding their fields. Undeterred they wait patiently, to reap the harvest. As young boys fashioned mud bunds around trolleys, to prevent water gathering under, I realised the fight here is not only against the farm laws, but also for a culture where hard work, resourcefulness, and community are recognised.

19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Women take the stage at Singhu border||Women took over the stage, security and stage management at the Singhu border as protesting farmers observed Mahila Kisan Divas on Monday. The crowd sitting in front of the stage majorly consisted of women. Behind the main stage, two women guarded the rear entrance and women volunteers managed the list of people going on stage to speak. All the speakers on Monday were women. “I am the only daughter of my parents. I lost my mother in 2014. My father told me that more than my wedding, he will be happy if I get martyred fighting for the farmers. If he could send me here, other women too should reach in huge numbers,” said a young Rupinder Kaur from the stage. Santok Singh Sandhu, a member of the stage management committee, said a message was sent to people in villages to carry out awareness drives for women to reach here on Mahila Kisan Divas. “They were also asked to carry out marches in their villages to observe the day. Also, today, no men are allowed to do anything around the stage. From kirtan in the morning to other things by the end of the day, everything has to be done by women,” he said. Groups of women reached the Delhi borders in buses, trucks and tractors to be a part of Mahila Kisan Divas and talked about how important their role is in the ongoing agitation. An 18-year-old Amrit Kaur who arrived with her mother and aunts said the best place for a woman is in the revolution. Pushpinder Dosanjh, a law graduate from Nawan Shahr who had come with her group of friends from Chandigarh, said the langars were started here by women and men are only continuing it. Ms. Dosanjh’s friend Kiran Dhillon, a businesswoman said: “Women are the backbone of the protest. If they were not holding the fort back in the villages by taking care of the farmlands, the men would not have been able to protest here. They have ensured that the protest goes on.” Protesters to Modi Rajeshwari Randhawa from Karnal who had come with a group of 25 women said she wanted to urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take back the three farm laws and “if your people are asking women and children to go back, then I want to tell you that we are all a family. Men and women are incomplete without each other”. The youngest female protestor today was a three-month-old baby whose mother identified her as Japjyot Kaur, from Gurdaspur. “We have brought her here to show that if a little child can be here, those at home should also come out and protest,” said the newborn’s mother Harjot Kaur (26). Observing the Mahila Kisan Divas, a special performance by Lok Rang Noor Art group consisting of men dressed up as women to perform Punjabi dance “gidda”. “We work toward preserving the culture of Punjab and we will exist if people of Punjab will. These laws are against the people of Punjab and we are here in solidarity,” said Noor, one of the artists.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/women-take-the-stage-at-singhu-border/article33605485.ece
19 January 2021||New Delhi,||Transit hubs, travelators part of railway station revamp project||Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on Monday chaired the second meeting related to the proposed redevelopment of the New Delhi railway station along the lines of the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport as part of a first-of-its-kind initiative in the country. Apart from solving a significant issue related to public transportation — 1,400 buses plying on 46 routes travel to and from the station daily without a single bus terminal in its vicinity — two multimodal transit hubs and an underground tunnel housing an Automated People Mover (APM) replete with travelators and electric vehicles are part of the proposal which has been accessed by The Hindu.  The project will, over the next four years, seek to redesign the largest and second busiest railway station in the country with a daily footfall of approximately 4.5 lakh passengers, according to a senior government official. New facilities As The Hindu reported on December 10, the project will see the height of the station being increased to 70 metres, construction of twin towers — each 40 metres high, a hangar for trains, the creation of a passengers’ lounge similar to the airport, an underground parking for 2,000 vehicles and 40 buses in addition to a commercial area. “Chaired the 02nd meeting of the Apex Committee to oversee & facilitate the ‘Redevelopment of New Delhi Railway Station’ under the National TOD Policy, the first of its kind in PPP mode,” Mr. Baijal tweeted. Emphasis was also given on the use of recycled water for non-potable purposes by way of provision of dual piping, the L-G stated. “Directed UTTIPEC [Unified Traffic And Transportation Infrastructure (Planning & Engineering) Centre] for ensuring early examination and approval of the applications submitted by RLDA for the above project. Called upon all Nodal Officers to work in tandem to make this project a success,” he also tweeted. Ease of access The National Transit Oriented Development (TOD) policy is focussed on development around or along a transit node or corridor to facilitate complete ease of access to the transit facilitates and was approved by Mr. Baijal in his capacity as chairman of the Delhi Development Authority in September 2019. Keeping in line with the policy, Multi Modal Transit Hubs are proposed at Ajmeri Gate and Paharganj access points of the station — replete with bus bays for 51 and 40 buses, respectively, and walkways for direct connectivity to the railway station as well as Delhi metro stations in its vicinity. An underground APM with travelators on either side, walkways with sitting spaces and electric vehicles for commuters is also part of the initiative along with the widening of the Panchkuian Road, Basant Lane, Chelmsford Road, Bhavbhuti Marg, Minto Bridge railway under bridge. Four entry ramps on Basant Lane, Chelmsford Road, DDU Marg and near the RUB on Minto Road in addition to five exit ramps on Bhavbhuti Marg, JLN Marg, Minto Road, Chelmsford Road and DB Gupta Road are also proposed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/transit-hubs-travelators-part-of-railway-station-revamp-project/article33605481.ece
19 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Women volunteers to ensure peaceful farmers’ parade||Women are likely to play a major role in ensuring that the proposed tractor rally on Republic Day remains peaceful, according to Kavitha Kuruganti, the only woman delegate on the farm unions’ team participating in negotiations with the Centre. “The fact that women have been a key part of the protest adds to the peaceful nature of the protest. Many of the youth can get very impatient, but having women there curbs them, and ensures that the protest stays peaceful,” she told The Hindu on Monday. Women farmers, as well as women students from Punjab’s universities, were often seen in the forefront in the face-offs with the police at the borders between Punjab and Haryana, as the unions marched toward Delhi. Women are also training to drive some tractors for the rally on January 26. “For Republic Day, thousands of volunteers are being enrolled with the specific task of keeping peace. Many of these are women,” said Ms. Kuruganti, who is here as a representative of the Mahila Kisan Adhikaar Manch, an alliance of women farmers’ organisations and supporters. She was speaking at a small roadside shop on the side of the stage at the Singhu border as the unions marked Mahila Kisan Divas as a celebration of women farmers. “Their primary demand is for their identity as farmers to be recognised,” said Ms. Kuruganti. She pointed out that according to census data, 30% of all cultivators and 43% of all agricultural labourers are women, but few of them have land rights in their own names. The struggle for land and inheritance rights is unfortunately something that most mainstream farm unions have failed to take up, said Ms. Kuruganti. However, the unions have made major strides in recognising women’s identity as farmers over the last six to seven years, and have taken every opportunity to declare it during the protests, she added. “There was widespread outrage at the Supreme Court’s comments which serve to invisibilise women’s roles. Apart from the fact that 15-20% of protesters here at the Singhu border are women, you must recognise that women play a double role. For every man who is sitting here at the border, there are women managing the farm responsibilities back in the village,” she said. Bangalore-based Ms. Kuruganti is not a farmer herself, nor does she come from a farming family. On Tuesday, she will be the only woman on the farmers’ side of the room at Vigyan Bhavan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/women-volunteers-to-ensure-peaceful-farmers-parade/article33605483.ece
