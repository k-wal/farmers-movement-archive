13 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC stays implementation of three controversial farm laws||The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the implementation of three controversial farm laws, calling its order “extraordinary” and a “victory for fair play”. The stay on the implementation of the laws means that the Centre cannot, for the time being, proceed with any executive actions to enforce the laws. The court formed a four-member committee of experts “to listen to the grievances of the farmers on the laws and the views of the government and make recommendations”. At one point in the 11-page order, a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde said the formation of an expert committee “may create a congenial atmosphere and improve the trust and confidence of the farmers”. The stay, the court said, “may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers” and make them confident enough to scythe their way to the negotiating table in good faith. In a concluding paragraph of the order, the court said the farmers’ bodies would “perceive” the “extraordinary” stay as an achievement of their peaceful protest “at least for the present”. It may convince these organisations to “encourage” their members to go home to their livelihoods and thus, protect their lives and health and that of others too. The court said several rounds of negotiations between the Centre and the farmers had produced no results, even as senior citizens, women and children among the protesters were exposed to serious health hazards posed by the cold and the spread of COVID-19.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-stays-implementation-of-three-controversial-farm-laws/article33563162.ece

13 January 2021||Kolkata,||Political drama on birth anniversary||The birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda on Tuesday turned into another occasion of political muscle flexing with both the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) organising road shows in Kolkata. Leaders of both parties visited the ancestral house of Swami Vivekananda in north Kolkata’s Simla Street area to offer their tributes. Along with the State unit BJP leadership, Union Minister for Culture Prahlad Singh Patel and Deputy Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Keshav Prasad Maurya were among those who visited Netaji’s residence. Dilip Ghosh, BJP State unit president and national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya joined the road show organised from Shyambazar to Simla Street. “Every year we not only observe the birth anniversary of Swamiji but also try to live by his ideals. Suddenly we see that the TMC is trying to appropriate Swami Vivekananda,” BJP leader and former State president of the party Rahul Sinha said. The BJP held a number of other events across the State From the TMC, several Ministers including party youth wing president Abhishek Banerjee and North Kolkata MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay were among those who visited Netaji’s ancestral home. ‘No moral right’ Abhishek Banerjee also led a road show from Gariahat to Golpark in south Kolkata. “They (BJP) have no moral right to hold road show by holding a photo of Swamiji…The communal divide which the party that is ruling country has created for its political interest is the most unfortunate,” Mr. Banerjee said after the rally. Later in the day, the Trinamool Congress took exception to the video uploaded by West Bengal unit of BJP from its official Twitter handle. A number of TMC leaders, including Minister Partha Chatterjee and Firhad Hakim, took to social media stating that in the video “Narendra Modi was described as Ghorer Chele Naren , which loosely translates to ‘Son of our house’. It seems that BJP has forgotten that the people of Bengal consider only one Naren (who is popularly known as Swami Vivekananda) to be the ‘son of Bengal”. The pre-monastic name of Swami Vivekananda, who was born on January 12, 1863, was Narendranath Dutta.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/political-drama-on-birth-anniversary/article33563600.ece

13 January 2021||Chennai,||No differences in AIADMK over alliance with BJP: CM||AIADMK co-coordinator and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Tuesday said there were no differences within his party over continuing the alliance with the BJP for the Assembly election scheduled later this year. Besides, he said that he and party coordinator-cum-Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam were working together for the development of the AIADMK, the government and the State. Expressing confidence that the people would give the AIADMK a clear majority, Mr. Palaniswami in an interview to The Hindu — the first to any media organisation since the Parliamentary elections in 2019 — said the party did not believe in changing its policies based on victory or defeat in elections. He remained confident that the party’s allies during the Lok Sabha election would remain with the AIADMK for the Assembly election too. The seat-sharing exercise with the allies would begin only after the Election Commission of India notified the poll schedule, he said. The Chief Minister denied that his government had come up with populist schemes after the AIADMK-led NDA’s rout in the Parliamentary election and insisted that the schemes were devised on the basis of people’s needs. Mr. Palaniswami said the reception to his ongoing electioneering had helped him gauge that the popular mood is in favour of his party. As for hiring independent poll strategists, he said leaders were devising policies based on suggestions from party functionaries on the ground and the role of strategists was limited to meeting the challenges of the changed information technology scenario. The constitution of the Cauvery Water Management Authority and the Cauvery Water Regulation Committee; the notification of the Cauvery delta region as a protected agricultural zone; the kudimaramathu scheme through which water bodies were renovated; and the 7.5% reservation for government school students in medical colleges were among the major achievements of his government, Mr. Palaniswami said. The Chief Minister denied that in February 2017, V.K. Sasikala, former close aide of late party leader Jayalalithaa, had hand-picked him to head the government following the rebellion by then Chief Minister Panneerselvam. According to him, MLAs had preferred him for the top job on the basis of his long track record of contribution and loyalty to the party and its leadership.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/no-differences-in-aiadmk-on-alliance-with-bjp-tn-cm/article33563202.ece

13 January 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi govt. targets 1,000 vaccination sites||The Delhi government has asked all 11 District Magistrates (DMs) to submit a list of vaccination sites, after checking their feasibility, to increase the number of such centres in the city to 1,000, a State government official told The Hindu . On Saturday, the first day of the vaccination drive, inoculation will take place at 89 hospitals and then it will be scaled up. “Inspections on these 1,000 sites, including hospitals, dispensaries and scho-ols, are ongoing. For these sites, the government has also asked the DMs to prepare a total of 1,100 teams, of which 10% will be backup, and submit both the lists on Saturday,” the official said. Also, the COVID-19 vaccination will be carried out six days a week in hospitals, except on Sundays. But in dispensaries, it will take place only four days a week, according to an official document seen by The Hindu . “It is observed that in dispensaries regular vaccination takes place on Wednesdays and Fridays. Therefore, COVID vaccination would be carried out on the remaining four days [Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday],” the document read. The government has identified 621 cold chain points, including hospitals, dispensaries and mohalla clinics, and the 1,000 vaccination sites or vaccinations booths will be established at these cold chain points. “On Saturday, the 89 hospitals will have only one vaccination booth each. But we will soon create multiple vaccination booths at these hospitals,” said Dr. Suneela Garg, director professor at Maulana Azad Medical College, who is a part of the vaccination drive. Each vaccination site will have three rooms: waiting room, vaccination room and observation room. One lakh target The Delhi government’s aim is to inoculate 1 lakh people a day by increasing the vaccination sites to 1,000. Each of the 1,000 sites is expected to inoculate 100 people a day. As per the document, South West district with 123 vaccination sites will have the highest number of such sites, followed by the North district with 110 and the West district with 108. The lowest number of vaccination sites will be in the North East district, where only 65 such sites are proposed. The Delhi government has already collected details of 160 hospitals where the vaccination drive will begin after starting at 89 hospitals, officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/delhi-govt-targets-1000-vaccination-sites/article33563322.ece

13 January 2021||Mumbai,||Will set aside my personal views, says Anil Ghanwat||From a worker with late farmer leader Sharad Joshi’s Shetkari Sanghatana (SS) to a member of a Supreme Court-appointed committee to hold talks with farmers, Anil Ghanwat, a known supporter of Central government’s three farm laws on Tuesday said that he will hold talks with the protesting farmers, irrespective of his personal opinions, and submit its report. Mr. Ghanwat’s former colleagues from the SS however, mentioned that he does not represent views of their organisation as he has already parted ways and supported Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2019 general elections. “He along with few others are no longer with Shetkari Sangathana. They run a different organisation which is called ‘Shetkari Sangathan-inspired from Sharad Joshi’. In 2019, general elections that group took a stand in support of the BJP. We oppose both Congress and the BJP,” said Kalidas Apet, executive president of SS, which is presently being headed by veteran farmer leader Raghunathdada Patil. Mr. Ghanwat came to the limelight in June 2019 when the SS attempted to plant banned Genetically Modified Herbicide Tolerant (HT) Bt Cotton seed in Akola district, which he described as the civil disobedience movement. He has already supported the three controversial farm laws, videos of which are on his YouTube channel. Talking about his appointment, Mr. Ghanwat said he had not applied for the position. “The committee will go to them, if they do not come to us,” he said, when asked about protesting farmers’ unwillingness to talk to the committee.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/will-set-aside-my-personal-views-says-anil-ghanwat/article33563668.ece

13 January 2021||MANGALURU,||Centre has promised to enhance MGNREGA mandays to 150, says Minister Eshwarappa||Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj K.S. Eshwarappa said on Tuesday that the Union government has promised to sanction 50 additional mandays for the State to implement Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme. Speaking to presspersons in Udupi, the Minister said that the Union Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Narendra Singh Tomar at a recent meeting promised to increase mandays from 100 to 150 and sanction an extra Rs. 800 crore for this purpose. The State has achieved 10.5 crore mandays of work against a target of 13 crore mandays in 100 days. The Union Minister appreciated the State’s efforts in implementing the MGNREGA scheme, he said. The Minister said that the gram panchayats in the State now get Rs. 1 crore annual grant from the government, up from Rs. 35 lakh earlier. In addition, they get funds from different schemes of the State and Union governments. Mr. Eshwarappa said that the government has agreed to fund the gram panchayats up to Rs. 20 lakh for their solid waste management projects. Funds will be released to the panchayats under Swachh Bharat Mission based on the size of population. Funds for construction of toilets in rural areas have been enhanced to Rs. 12,000 and Rs. 15,000 for general category and SCs/STs, respectively, he said. Mr. Eshwarappa said that the government will spend Rs. 300 crore in the next two years for harnessing solar energy in gram panchayats by installing solar panels on their buildings. Bids have been finalised for this project. Chief Executive Officers of the zilla panchayats may choose from among the empanelled agencies to implement the project in their districts. When this project is implemented, dependency of gram panchayats on grid power will reduce. Electricity bills consumed a major share of the revenue of the panchayats. The agency that implements the project will also have to maintain the project for five years. The department had consulted experts in the field of renewable energy to formulate guidelines to implement this project, he said. The Minister was in Udupi to participate in the Janasevak Samavesha of the BJP. The samavesha was organised to congratulate the newly elected gram panchayat members supported by the BJP. It was also to prepare the party workers to face the coming elections to the zilla and taluk panchayats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/centre-has-promised-to-enhance-mgnrega-mandays-to-150-says-minister-eshwarappa/article33563637.ece
13 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Winter chill makes comeback in city||The winter chill made a comeback in the Capital with the minimum temperature settling at 4.3 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is three degrees below normal. After a cold start to the year with January 1 recording a minimum of 1.1 degrees Celsius, rain and cloudy weather under the influence of a western disturbance saw the minimum temperature rise to 14.4 degrees Celsius on January 7. With the weather clearing up, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said cold winds were blowing towards the plains from the Himalayas causing cold wave like conditions at several places, including the Capital. The cold wave is likely to continue with the minimum temperatures settling between four and five degrees over the next few days. The maximum temperature settled at 17.6 degrees Celsius, which is two degrees below normal. The coldest areas in the Capital were the weather stations at Lodhi Road and Jafarpur, which recorded minimum temperatures of 4.0 and 3.7 degrees Celsius respectively. The IMD forecast said “due to the prevalence of dry north/northwesterly winds, the minimum temperature is very likely to be below normal over most parts of north-west India during the next 4-5 days, which are very likely to cause cold day/severe cold day conditions” .||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/winter-chill-makes-comeback-in-city/article33563326.ece
13 January 2021||Kolkata,||Sisir Adhikari removed as DSDA head||The West Bengal government on Tuesday removed senior Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Sisir Adhikari from the post of chairman of the Digha Sankarpur Development Authority (DSDA). A notification has been issued by the government reconstituting the DSDA. TMC MLA Akhil Giri has been appointed to the post. The development assumes significance in the wake of Mr. Adhikari’s son and former minister Suvendu Adhikari severing his ties with the TMC and joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Mr. Sisir Adhikari, MP from the Purba Medinipur Kanthi constituency, however, remains with the TMC. His younger son, Dibyendu Adhikari, is the TMC MP from Tamluk in the same district. A few days ago, the TMC removed Soumendu Adhikari, another member of the Adhikari family, from the post of chairman of the board of administrators of the Contai municipality. Following the footsteps of his brother, Mr. Soumendu joined the BJP. Even as a war of words raged between Mr. Suvendu and the TMC leadership, the party had not made any verbal attacks against Mr. Sisir Adhikari, who is among its most senior leaders. Mr. Adhikari has not made any public appearance after his son joined the BJP. The removal of the veteran Trinamool leader indicates that his departure from the ruling party is only a matter of time. The administrators of the Egra and Tamluk Municipalities, considered close to the Adhikari family, have also been removed from their posts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sisir-adhikari-removed-as-dsda-head/article33563604.ece
13 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||CJI against resuming physical hearings||Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde on Tuesday disagreed with the idea of resuming physical hearings in the Supreme Court, saying the court did not want to be the cause of fatalities due to the spread of COVID-19. “We have been facing closedown of courts for nearly a year. It is dangerous to get a congregation of people in courts. We do not want the number of fatalities to increase due to the courts,” he observed. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said it was salutary how the court had not denied justice to anyone by working throughout the pandemic as virtual court. “In a huge country like this, Your Lordship’s court has not denied justice even for a day. It is really salutary,” Mr. Mehta submitted. ‘Reviewing situation’ CJI Bobde said the court was regularly reviewing the situation. He pointed out how the High Courts of Madras and Rajasthan had to close down after resuming physical courts due to the spread of the infection. “We will take appropriate decision after consulting medical authorities,” he said. The three-judge Bench was hearing a suo motu case to provide financial aid to young lawyers struggling to make ends meet during the pandemic. One of the lawyers had sought a physical court hearing in the case. During the hearing, senior advocate P.S. Narasimha, as a senior member of the Bar, said Bar Councils were ready to stand guarantee for government loans of up to Rs. 3 lakh to struggling lawyers. But the CJI said the Bar and affluent lawyers should contribute more than what they had already done. The court asked the Solicitor General to convene a meeting to discuss the proposal of bar associations for the Centre to arrange financial aid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cji-against-resuming-physical-hearings/article33563329.ece
13 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||High Court adjourns to January 18 SEC plea against staying panchayat polls||The Andhra Pradesh High Court on Tuesday adjourned the writ plea filed by the State Election Commission (SEC) against the stay imposed by Justice M. Ganga Rao on the proposed conduct of gram panchayat (GP) elections, for hearing by a regular Bench on January 18. A Vacation Bench of the court comprising Justices U. Durga Prasad Rao and B. Krishna Mohan posted the matter as the first one before a regular Bench to the above date while continuing the suspension of the election notification. Objection on rolls To an objection raised by the SEC that the electoral rolls could not be prepared if the stay remained in force, Advocate-General (A-G) S. Sriram submitted that electoral rolls for the purpose of conducting the gram panchayat elections were prepared way back in March 2020 and a revised list would be received by the Chief Electoral Officer of the State by January 15 and the same duly forwarded to the SEC on January 22. Model code Responding to the SEC’s contention that the Model Code of Conduct, which came into force on January 9, was deemed to be suspended due to the stay order and and there is every possibility of the government launching certain schemes to woo the electorate, the Advocate-General said since the elections are fought on non-party basis, the question of undertaking any such measures did not arise, and if the government wished to take up fresh development activities or implement new schemes, it would do so only with prior permission of SEC. Hence, any apprehension in that regard was preposterous. After hearing both the sides, the High Court opined that posting the matter to January 18 would not cause any prejudice to either party. Justice Ganga Rao granted stay on January 11 on the SEC’s decision to conduct gram panchayat elections in four phases in February after hearing arguments on the house motion petition filed by the government, which strongly objected to the election schedule citing the threat of second wave of COVID and vaccination programme as the grounds for keeping the polls on hold till the situation improved. The SEC filed the writ appeal on the same day (January 11), wherein its standing counsel N. Ashwani Kumar argued that the election notification and the process thereof ought not to be interfered by the court once they had been set in motion.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/high-court-adjourns-sec-plea-against-staying-panchayat-polls-to-january-18/article33563153.ece

13 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||SEC apprises Governor of developments||Andhra Pradesh State Election Commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar met Governor Biswa Bushan Harichandan on Tuesday to apprise him of the recent developments. On Monday, the High Court stayed the gram panchayat poll schedule announced by the SEC, in the wake of a government plea. The State had opposed the move to conduct polls in February in view of the pandemic and vaccination drive. According to information, in a one-on-one meeting, Mr. Ramesh gave a “confidential report” to the Governor. The Commission did not divulge the details of the meeting. In another development, Commission Secretary Vani Mohan was relieved from duty and asked to report to the State government. Commission’s Joint Director G.V. Sai Prasad was already suspended after he went on leave at the crucial time when the Commission announced the local body polls. Mr. Sai Prasad, the senior-most functionary after the Secretary and vested with the administration duties of the Commission, placed a leave letter for a month and deserted his station. The discussion points with Governor, sources say, include the SEC Secretary’s role in the mass leave applied by the Commission’s staff. A bundle of leave applications were submitted to the Commission recently. All the applications, which were in a proforma format, were written “due to coercion”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/top-election-official-meets-governor/article33563081.ece

13 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Former Karnataka Minister’s son arrested in drugs case||After 130 days of eluding the police, Aditya Alva was arrested by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of Bengaluru police at a resort on the outskirts of Chennai. Alva, son of the former Minister late Jeevaraj Alva and brother-in-law of Bollywood actor Vivek Oberoi, who was wanted in connection with the high-profile drug case involving the Kannada film industry and party organisers, had been hiding out at the resort for the past 15 days. Months after raiding the premises of his family and friends, the police finally caught up with Alva late on Monday night. “He was on the run since September last year but we were able to track him down through mobile call record details,” said a senior police official. Alva, who is accused no. 6 in the case, is charged with organising high-profile parties at his house at Hebbal where drugs such as ecstasy and LSD were made available. According to the CCB, synthetic drugs were recovered during the raid at his residence in September 2020, but Alva managed to escape. Searches While on his lookout, the CCB had conducted searches at the house of Vivek Oberoi in Mumbai, and the Bidadi residence of the former underworld don late Muthappa Rai. They also raided an apartment at Vyalikaval owned by Rai’s son Ricky who was summoned for questioning as the police believed he had been aiding Alva. Alva was escorted back to Bengaluru and taken into custody after he underwent a medical examination and a COVID-19 test. “We have recovered his mobile phone and are questioning him about his escape and the places where he had taken shelter in and those who helped him,” said a senior police official, adding that those who abetted him while he was on the run would also come under the CCB scanner. The CCB will be questioning him about the people who supplied the drugs, the parties he organised with another accused in the case, Viren Khanna, and the attendees. Celebrities, including film stars, and children of politicians and businessmen attended the parties organised by both Alva and Khanna. Alva’s arrest comes less than a week after film producer and businessman Shivaprakash Chippi surrendered to the police. Chippi, who is accused no. 1 in the case, gave himself up, and was questioned before he was allowed to leave. Actor Sanjjana Galrani, another high-profile accused in the case, is out on bail, but fellow actor Ragini Dwivedi remains in judicial custody at the Bengaluru Central Prison.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/former-karnataka-ministers-son-arrested-in-drugs-case/article33563077.ece
13 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||We won’t move an inch, say farmers||After the Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered suspension of the three farm laws which the farmers have been protesting against, they maintained that the only way to end the protest is to repeal the laws. Protesting farmers at Singhu border unanimously said they won’t “move an inch” till the laws are repealed and made another point — if farmers leave once, it’ll become very difficult to put together a protest of this stature. “We have nothing to do with what the Supreme Court has to say. It’s between them and the government. If the laws are not repealed, the protest will continue. This has been the single-point agenda since the beginning,” said Baljit Singh, committee member, All Indian Kisan Sabha, who is also a part of the stage management committee at the Singhu border. While farmers welcomed suspension of the laws, some didn’t seem to trust the order’s intention. “It’s good that the laws have been repealed but it looks like a gimmick to end the protest. And once we all disperse, it will become impossible to come back and protest like this again. As it is, we have reached here with much difficulty and are facing lathis and water cannons,” said Jagroop Singh, 45, from Mohali. When we left home, we prayed that we will come back only when the laws are repealed, said Gurmeet Singh, 72, from Hoshiarpur, adding that the SC move is a “sweet toffee” to the farmers. The only statement that will make people leave from here is Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the laws have been repealed, said Manjeet Singh, 50, from Ropar. “They are all scared about the January 26 parade and want us to leave.” Lack of trust in the judiciary is also seen among the farmers. “The Supreme Court seems to be working hand in hand with the government. The government had also said we should send women and children back and the same thing was said by the SC which shows back channelling,” said Daljeet Singh, 35, from Moga adding that committee formation was also government’s idea which has now been ordered by the SC. The problem with suspension is that it can be brought back and eventually, the decision will go in the government’s favour, fears Hardev Singh, 65, from Ludhiana who had retired from the Army in 1991. “For 20 years, I fought against outside forces and now I am fighting our own. Is this our age to fight here? But what to do?” he asked. In the wake of farmers taking their own lives at the stage on Tuesday, many speakers specially focused on telling the protesters not to get carried away. “We are about to enter the door of victory… don’t lose hope,” said a speaker.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/we-wont-move-an-inch-say-farmers/article33563091.ece
13 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Flights take off, India’s vaccine mission takes wing||On the first day of shipment of COVID-19 vaccines on Tuesday, nearly nine flights transported 56.5 lakh doses to different parts of the country. SpiceJet and GoAir carried the first consignment from Pune to Delhi and Chennai, respectively, according to a tweet from Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Puri. At least 13 cities received these shipments from the Serum Institute of India, Pune. They included Kolkata, Guwahati, Shillong, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Bhubaneswar, Patna, Bengaluru, Lucknow and Chandigarh. SpiceJet’s cargo arm, SpiceXpress, carried the bulk of the consignment — 40 lakh doses — on five flights. Of the remaining four, Air India operated one flight, IndiGo operated two and GoAir conducted one flight. Temperature control A ‘puja’ was performed before the three temperature-controlled trucks rolled out of the Serum Institute gates shortly before 5 a.m. and moved towards the Pune airport, about 15 km away, from where the vaccines were flown across India. The “vaccine to kill the disease is being loaded onto the aircraft for distribution all over the country now,” the Pune airport tweeted. Air India said it carried its first consignment of 2,76,000 vaccine doses, weighing 700 kg approximately, from Pune to Ahmedabad. IndiGo said it moved 900 kg to Chandigarh and Lucknow, respectively. “We will be carrying multiple vaccine consignments to cities including Guwahati, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bhubaneswar, Bengaluru, Patna and Vijayawada through the day today [Tuesday]. SpiceJet is fully committed and prepared to transport the vaccine both within and outside India,” said SpiceJet CMD. The government on Monday placed firm orders in advanced commitments for over six crore doses of the vaccines from SII and Bharat Biotech for inoculating three crore healthcare and frontline workers in the first phase of the drive scheduled to start from January 16. The cost is Rs. 1,300 crore.  (With PTI inputs)||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/flights-take-off-indias-vaccine-mission-takes-wing/article33563112.ece
13 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Free water scheme launched in Hyderabad||Municipal Administration Minister K T Ramarao on Tuesday launched the free drinking water scheme in Rahmat Nagar and said that as many as 9 lakh families would stand to gain from it. Mr Rao reached Rahmat Nagar in the morning along with a phalanx of public representatives including Home Minister Mohammad Mahmood Ali and corporators. He interacted with residents and sought to know whether the benefits of welfare schemes of the Telangana government had been reaching them, and handed them zero water bills. Addressing a gathering, Mr Rao compared Hyderabad with Chennai. He said that the latter had been facing issues connected to water supply. He pointed out that Chennai had been bringing water from distant places in trains to cater to the needs of the city. He said that this was not the case in Hyderabad as water was being supplied from the Krishna and Godavari rivers and that the city would not face shortage till 2048. Mr Rao said that Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had promised free water supply from December. With the launch of the scheme on Tuesday, this promise stood fulfilled. The government would bear an expenditure of Rs. 400 crore to Rs. 500 crore towards it. He also said that the issues of power and water in the State had been taken care of. Even as the State dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic, welfare measures including rice to the poor, pension payments, Rythu Bandhu, and the 2BHK scheme had witnessed minor delay.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/free-water-scheme-launched-in-hyderabad/article33563084.ece
13 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC to hear plea against R-Day tractor rally||The Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to examine a plea made by the Centre, through the Delhi Police, seeking an injunction order against any proposed tractor, trolley or vehicle march or any other kind of protest by farmers to “disrupt” the Republic Day events. A three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde issued notice, returnable on January 18, on the government’s application. “It has come to the knowledge of the security agencies through various sources that a small group of protesting individuals/organisations have planned to carry out a tractor/trolley/vehicle march on Republic Day. “The proposed march is slated to disturb and disrupt the august celebrations of the nation on Republic Day and was bound to create a massive law and order situation,” the application said. It said such a protest would cause an “embarrassment to the nation.” Major routes blocked “The right to protest can never include maligning the nation globally,” the government said. Seven major routes leading to Delhi were fully blocked and four partially blocked, it said. Attorney General K.K. Venugopal, for the Centre, said there was no question of a huge group of one lakh people entering the city on Republic Day. “We cannot say where all they will go,” he said. “It should be within the power of police to see a specified number of people enter unarmed,” the CJI replied. Shifting venues The Bench also suggested moving the protest sites from the Delhi borders to a place where the agitation did not hamper public movement in the National Capital. Addressing this issue, senior advocate Vikas Singh said protests could not be held at a place away from public sight. “If farmers don’t get a prominent place to protest, then they can go on protesting indefinitely without anyone noticing the protest. Everybody is saying Ramlila Maidan. Right from Independence, that has been the traditional place of protest in this city,” Mr. Singh said. The court said matters of law and order were best left to the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-to-hear-plea-against-r-day-tractor-rally/article33563092.ece
13 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Cong. flays panel composition||While several Opposition leaders on Tuesday questioned the composition of the Supreme Court-appointed expert committee to examine the farm laws and backed the farmers’ demand for a repeal, former Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar welcomed the top court’s decision and called it a ‘big relief’. The Congress, however, pointed out that all the four members named by the top court had publicly supported the farm laws enacted by the Narendra Modi government and cannot be expected to be a “neutral arbiter”. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted,“Can you expect justice from the people who supported the farm laws? This struggle will continue until the anti-farmer and anti-labour farm laws are repealed. Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan!” At a press conference, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “We don’t know who gave these names to the honourable Supreme Court of India. There was a ray of hope in the manner and fashion in which the Supreme Court of India came out and stood in support of the farmers. Perhaps nobody pointed out the background of the members of the committee or the fact they stand for the implementation of these laws.” Congress ally and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief, Sharad Pawar, who held the Agriculture portfolio during the tenure of United Progressive Alliance regime, welcomed the move. “A welcome decision taken by the Supreme Court of India to put on hold the implementation of three farm Bills and set up a four-member committee to resolve the issues. It is a big relief for farmers and I hope that a concrete dialogue between Central government and farmers will be initiated now, keeping the farmers interests and well being in mind,” Mr. Pawar said. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said farmers had no option but to boycott the court-appointed committee. “Can anyone expect the protesting farmers demanding repeal of agri Laws to talk to such a committee? Why should they? Farmers are left with no other option than to boycott this committee?” Mr. Yechury tweeted. CPI general secretary D. Raja told The Hindu that the constitution of the committee after putting a stay on the implementation raises serious questions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-flays-panel-composition/article33563095.ece
13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||‘People’s reception gives us confidence that we will win a majority’||AIADMK co-coordinator and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who is seeking a mandate on his government’s performance in this year’s Assembly election, is confident that people will return his party to power for a third straight term.  When you assumed charge as Chief Minister in February 2017, you were seen as the hand-picked candidate of V.K. Sasikala, who was perceived to be very unpopular. Were you confident then that your tenure would last its term and you would lead your party in the 2021 Assembly election? You know the kind of crisis that prevailed then. In that situation, a majority of MLAs preferred me and so I became Chief Minister. All the Ministers and MLAs knew that [in the preceding] three-and-a-half years Honourable Amma (Jayalalithaa) had good faith in me. They were aware that I knew about the party affairs well. From the time I first won an election on the ‘rooster’ symbol [AIADMK-Jayalalithaa faction] in 1989 to Amma’s last day, I was loyal to her and the party, never giving any room for distress. I had gone to jail on seven occasions for participating in party protests. Even when my constituency [Edappadi] was allotted to an ally [PMK in 2001] and Amma offered me a different seat, I refused it and worked for the victory of the alliance candidate. I was always loyal to the party, government and leadership; therefore, everyone had faith and I got this opportunity. I had the faith that the soul of Honourable Amma, which is in me, would guide me and this government, which was formed by her, would complete its term. When I took charge as Chief Minister on February 16, 2017, some said this government would not last even 10 days. But now this government is set to complete four years. Amma’s government continues to successfully implement people’s welfare schemes and is performing exceptionally well with the goodwill of the people. As a result of this, the Tamil Nadu government is receiving numerous awards like never before in the past. On this occasion, I would like to state that as Amma had said, the AIADMK government would exceptionally serve the people for several hundred years to come with the sole aim of people’s welfare. What lessons did you learn from the AIADMK-led NDA’s rout in the previous Lok Sabha election? Did the results in any way influence your government’s subsequent policy decisions, say for instance, the declaration of Cauvery Delta as protected agricultural zones or the 7.5% reservation for government school students in medical admissions? Victory and defeat are natural in elections. In a democracy, the people’s verdict is final. We have faith in the people. Our movement [AIADMK], guided by Puratchi Thalaivar MGR and Puratchi Thalaivi Amma, is not one that changes its policies for the sake of victory or defeat. Under any circumstances, we will never backtrack from our policies drafted for the welfare of the people. During my tours to various districts, I learnt about the needs of the local people. It is only on that basis that Honourable Amma’s government is conceiving and implementing each and every scheme. The 2021 Assembly election is crucial for you. The AIADMK has been in power for close to 10 years, it faced a rout in the Lok Sabha polls and the DMK is on an upswing after making significant gains in the rural local body polls. What gives you the confidence that the people will give you a third straight win? In the last 10 years, various schemes have been implemented for the benefit and progress of the people. There is hope. Definitely this time too, the AIADMK will win and score a hat-trick. Wherever I go, people who have benefited from the schemes of the Amma’s government are coming in droves on their own and expressing their massive support. The soul of Puratchi Thalaivar MGR, who still lives in the hearts of the people, and Amma’s soul will always stand by us. Do you foresee any changes in the composition of your alliance and is there a timeframe for finalising the seat-sharing exercise? There will be no change in the alliance. There may be minor differences of opinion due to each party’s policies. Issues such as seat sharing will be discussed only when elections are notified. Even opposition parties have not done it. Numbers being floated in sections of media on the seats to be allotted to allies are unofficial and merely speculative. The party cannot take responsibility for it. Some sections within the AIADMK believe that the alliance with the BJP is an electoral liability. Given this, why did you and [party coordinator and Deputy Chief Minister] O. Panneerselvam unilaterally declare continuation of an alliance with the national party? The alliance formed under our [AIADMK] leadership during the previous Lok Sabha polls (2019) is continuing. There are no differences of opinion within our party on the alliance with the BJP. Only in a manner to reaffirm this, we announced the continuation of the alliance in the function in which the Home Minister [Amit Shah] participated. Several leaders of the BJP were constantly giving the impression that they were reluctant to endorse your candidature for the Chief Minister’s post. At the ground level, would this not create animosity between AIADMK and BJP cadres, affecting electoral outcomes? So far as Tamil Nadu is concerned only the AIADMK is heading the alliance. This front, in Tamil Nadu, will only be known as the AIADMK-led alliance. The AIADMK’s chosen candidate will be the alliance’s chief ministerial candidate as well. There can be no second opinion on this. Not just that, even on Monday, the BJP’s Tamil Nadu in-charge [C.T. Ravi] had said that the AIADMK, which is the major party, will decide on its chief ministerial candidate. Can we expect the AIADMK to contest a majority of seats like the 165 it did in 2011? How many seats do you expect the AIADMK alliance to win in the election? We can’t say now about the number of seats we would contest. That would be finalised only after talks with leaders of alliance parties. As for the number of seats we would win, we cannot put a number to that. However, definitely the AIADMK-led alliance will win a majority of the seats and form the government for a third time in succession. Mr. Panneerselvam and you were once hailed as ‘double barrel guns’ by party leaders. However, now there are reports of friction. Have all the differences between you been sorted out? We both are together exceptionally working for the development of the party, government, the people and Tamil Nadu. Could you elaborate on your ongoing election tour and the response it has drawn? While electioneering wherever I go, seeing the people’s happy expressions on their faces, I have full faith that Amma’s government would be voted back. I have seen six Assembly elections and three parliamentary elections, and can judge people’s mood to an extent. From the reception accorded to us, I am confident that we will win a majority of seats. Would your election manifesto include any assurance for providing an universal basic income? The manifesto will be released during election addressing the requirements for Tamil Nadu’s development and the basic needs of the people. You and [DMK president] M.K. Stalin have hired independent poll strategists. You have come from the grassroots. Is it necessary for established political parties to trust the strategists more than party functionaries? Party functionaries, who meet people regularly, know the ground realities well. Only they are continuously struggling for people’s issues. Hence we are forming strategies to face elections based on suggestions given by field-level party functionaries. At the same time, in accordance with changing information technology scenario, some changes have to be made. Mr. Stalin had submitted to the Governor a memorandum containing corruption charges against you and your Cabinet colleagues. He has put certain conditions to agree to your invitation for a debate on these charges… The Leader of the Opposition is the one who had given a complaint to the Governor levelling false charges against us. I am calling him to debate only on this. How could we debate on what is pending before the court? [Mr Stalin wanted the CM to get a court stay order vacated in a case.] I am prepared to answer his charges but he is refusing and trying to avoid a debate citing excuses. Among the charges in the memorandum, one pertains to a road project in Tirunelveli for which the tender was cancelled one-and-a-half years ago. As the adage goes, a grain is proof for a pot of rice. Therefore, all the charges are false. Unlike in the erstwhile DMK regime when box tender system was followed, we now have a transparent e-tender system in place in which anyone could submit a bid. The competent bidders gets the tender and all this is sorted out at the level of officials and it does not even come to the Chief Minister. In fact, it was during the DMK regime that the estimate for constructing the new secretariat complex had gone up two-fold. Only to cover up corruption charges against the DMK and to derive political mileage in elections, the Leader of the Opposition is placing such charges before the people and trying to confuse them. Do you see scope for a third player like Kamal Haasan to make inroads in the coming election? Or is it going to remain a fight between the two Dravidian parties? As far as Tamil Nadu is concerned, the contest is between alliances led by the two Dravidian parties. People of the State do not support a third front. They have rejected it. The defeat of the Makkal Nala Kootani [People’s Welfare Front] in the 2016 Assembly election is proof of this. What is your advice to party workers in light of you having been made the Chief Ministerial candidate of the AIADMK? The AIADMK, launched by Puratchi Thalaivar MGR, is a movement of workers. Puratchi Thalaivi Amma, who succeeded Puratchi Thalaivar, had guided crores of workers and protected the party and the government. After having been elected Chief Minister subsequent to passing away of Amma, I have been striving hard in a way that the party workers and all commend me. I am an example of how the cadres can come up if they put in hard work. It is the appeal of Mr. Panneerselvam and me that the party workers should work vigilantly and carefully for securing the victory so that the Amma government remains in office.  (74 MoUs envisaging Rs. 61,514 crore investment signed, says CM — Part 2 of interview on Thursday)    The AIADMK’s chosen candidate will be the alliance’s chief ministerial candidate as well||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/peoples-reception-gives-us-confidence-that-we-will-win-a-majority/article33563107.ece
13 January 2021||New Delhi,||PM slams political dynasties||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said political dynasties were the biggest enemies of democracy, and appealed to the youth to join politics. While addressing the valedictory session of the second National Youth Parliament Festival via videoconferencing, he said: “Today, days of winning election by the crutches of a surname are over. Still this malaise of dynastic politics is far from over… Political dynasty promotes self and family instead of putting nation first. This is a major cause of social corruption in India.” Referring to dynasts, he said such people did not fear the law. The next 25-26 years would take India from 75 years of Independence in 2022 to 100 years in 2047 and the same period would be the golden years of the lives of young people today. He appealed to them to keep the country’s interest in mind in whatever they did. Politics, like every field, also needed the participation of the youth. ‘Strong CVs’ Earlier, he said, families would be concerned if their children were interested in politics. Now, honesty in politics was being valued more and elected representatives were aware that they needed to have “strong CVs” before seeking re-election. Mr. Modi also remembered the contribution of Swami Vivekananda, whose birth anniversary was celebrated on Tuesday, and appealed to the youth to take inspiration from him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pm-slams-political-dynasties/article33563109.ece
13 January 2021||Bengaluru,||HC notice to Centre on PIL challenging contempt Act||The Karnataka High Court on Tuesday ordered issue of notice to the Union government on a PIL petition filed by four eminent personalities challenging the constitutional validity of a provision of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, that makes “scandalising or tends to scandalising courts” as a ground for contempt. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum passed the order on the petitions filed by Krishna Prasad, senior journalist and former Editor of Outlook magazine; N. Ram, veteran journalist and former Editor-in-Chief of The Hindu ; Arun Shourie, former Union Minister, and Prashant Bhushan, senior advocate. All the four petitioners have narrated the proceedings faced by them under the Contempt of Courts Act at different point of time before the High Courts and the apex court. Three of the petitioners, Mr. Ram, Mr. Shourie and Mr. Bhushan, had filed a similar petition before the Supreme Court, which in August last year had permitted them to withdraw the petition by giving them liberty to move a High Court. The petitioners have contended in their present petition that Section 2(c)(i) of the Act violates the right to free speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) and does not amount to a reasonable restriction under Article 19(2). The Section 2(c)(i) fails the test of overbreadth, abridges the right to free speech and expression in the absence of tangible and proximate harm, and it creates a chilling effect on free speech and expression, said the petition filed through advocate Maitreyi Krishnan. The offence of “scandalising the court” cannot be considered to be covered under the category of “contempt of court” under Article 19(2), the petitioners contended, claiming that even if Section 2(c)(i) were permissible under the ground of contempt in Article 19(2), it would be disproportionate and therefore unreasonable. “The offence of ‘scandalising the court’ is rooted in colonial assumptions and objects, which have no place in legal orders committed to democratic constitutionalism and the maintenance of an open robust public sphere,” the petition said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-notice-to-centre-on-pil-challenging-contempt-act/article33563068.ece
13 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Labour codes may be implemented before April 1||The four labour law codes enacted by Parliament in 2020 and 2019 could be implemented before the earlier target of April 1, according to Union Labour and Employment Ministry officials. The codes, which have amalgamated 29 laws governing minimum wages, occupational safety, social security into four codes, were earlier expected to be implemented by April 1. However, Labour and Employment Secretary Apurva Chandra on Tuesday said the rules framed under the codes would be finalised by January-end. Once the rules were notified, the codes would come into effect. While the rules under the Code on Wages, 2019 have been finalised, those under the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020, the Industrial Relations Code, 2020 and the Social Security Code, 2020 were yet to be notified. IR Code rules Mr. Chandra said the IR Code rules had been finalised, while the occupational safety and social security codes would be finalised within the next 10-12 days. Around 1,200 comments had been received on the draft rules under the occupational safety and social security codes. On Tuesday, Labour Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar held discussions with trade unions and employers’ organisations regarding the occupational safety and social security rules. Ten Central trade unions — the All-India Trade Union Congress, the Indian National Trade Union Congress, the Hind Mazdoor Sabha, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, the All-India United Trade Union Centre, the Trade Union Coordination Committee, the Self Employed Women’s Association, the All-India Central Council of Trade Unions, the Labour Progressive Federation and the United Trade Union Congress — boycotted the virtual meeting, terming it a “farce” via a joint statement on Monday. “We have been critical of adoption of labour codes by flouting all Parliamentary norms without discussion in absence of the entire opposition from the Parliament and without tripartite consultations. Instead of taking our objections seriously, the government is trying to create a farce of tripartite consultations by setting up this kind of video conference when we know that the physical meetings of the government at various levels are taking place, including the negotiations with the farmers as well as the election preparation rallies in various states, etc,” the statement said. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), the union affiliated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, raised the demand of increasing the limit of earned leave from 240 days to 300 days as per the occupational safety code rules. The Confederation of Indian Industry, which participated in the consultation, sought a clarification on which allowances would be part of wages and submitted its recommendations on the two draft rules, a CII statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/labour-codes-may-be-implemented-before-april-1/article33563089.ece
13 January 2021||Bengaluru,||‘16% of creative sector facing permanent closure’||The creative economy is contracting, organisations are closing permanently to avoid bankruptcy, creative businesses are contending with increasingly difficult choices to cut staff and overheads to ensure they remain resilient, and individual professionals and artisans are facing short-term hand-to-mouth existence. These are some of the main takeaways from the second pan-India survey of the Taking the Temperature Report, which was released on Tuesday. Developed by the British Council in partnership with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and the Art X Company, the report records the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the creative economy in India, including the scale of impact on creative sectors, arts companies and individual artists, managers, and stakeholders. While the first report provided a snapshot of the impact of COVID-19 from March to June, the second report reflects on the depth of the crisis in the creative economy up to October 2020. According to the second report, sectors are adapting to digital and live business models, but some of the workforce is leaving the creative economy and changing careers. It also says that 16% of the creative sector is facing permanent closure now, 22% of the sector is forecast to lose more than 75% of annual income, and 26% of respondents fear they will not be able to continue in the last two quarters of 2020–21. “Fifty-two per cent of the respondents in the second survey are women, increasing gender inequality of opportunity as a result of the short-term impact of the pandemic. About 19% of the sector, despite relaxation of lockdown in June, remains in temporary closure as per Survey 1 and 90% of the sector fears the long-term impact of social distancing on the creative economy,” it says. “Given the length of the COVID-19 pandemic globally, the indicators confirm that the creative economy will most likely be very different in the aftermath in India and its trading nations. While some sectors are adapting with agility, others risk being decimated,” says the report. While acknowledging that some State governments have responded swiftly to provide emergency grants for relief to artists and companies, it terms the “national and area response to invest in the creative economy during COVID-19” as “patchy, relative to the scale of the creative industries”. Among the recommendations made are concerted emergency action for investment between governments and corporates, utilising the National Culture Fund to provide grants for urban and rural traditional performers and artisans, and creating cultural districts in every Smart City to allow for performance spaces, rehearsal venues, libraries, studios, and artists’ offices.

Manoj Naravane on Tuesday said the Army was ready to hold its ground along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh as long as it took to achieve the national objectives, and noted that a collusive threat from China and Pakistan existed and India must be ready for it. “Every summer, for training, a number of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) units come to Tibet and go back once winter sets in. These traditional areas have been vacated. They are well in depth anything from 500-1,500 km away from the border. We should not lay too much significance on these comings and goings. But we keep an eye on them as these are the forces that can be mobilised in 24-48 hours,” he said at the Army’s annual press conference. “There has been no reduction of troops in the friction areas or where we are in eyeball to eyeball situations,” he stated. On the threat of a two-front war, he said a collusive threat existed. It was very much manifesting on the ground. “There is increased cooperation between Pakistan and China, both in military and non-military fields. A two-front situation is something we must be ready to deal with.” He said India and China were working to finalise the dates for the 9th round of Corps Commander talks. Following the Navy and the Air Force, the Army would soon induct women officers as pilots in Army Aviation. Gen Naravane said he had initiated a proposal last month to enable this.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/will-hold-our-ground-on-the-lac-says-army-chief/article33563103.ece
13 January 2021||Hyderabad,||Shifts, short periods for schools, colleges||Colleges and schools may have to function in two shifts with truncated periods after they reopen from February 1, if the COVID guidelines were to be followed seriously, and the final decision will come out on January 20. Two shifts option is being seriously considered by the government to drive away any fear among students and parents and give them the confidence to send their children to the educational institutions after a gap of more than 300 days. It is also to follow the COVID guidelines seriously. In this regard the opinion of private school and colleges managements will be taken at a meeting to be held with them on January 19. Education Minister Sabita Indra Reddy’s meeting with senior officials on the guidelines and standard operating procedures to be adopted for reopening of schools and colleges decided to seek the opinion of stakeholders. “In this backdrop, the meeting on January 19 will give us a fair view on the preparation of final guidelines,” a senior official told The Hindu . A meeting of ministers and officials connected with the residential schools under various wings will also be held on January 18 to discuss the entire gamut of reopening. Since schools and colleges under the residential institutions (General, BC, SC, ST and Minority) also have hostel facility, officials have to make additional arrangements on hostels and mess facilities. Ms. Sabita Indra Reddy told The Hindu that officials have been asked to prepare and submit the guidelines considering all aspects by January 20. They will give clarity on the mode of resumption of classes, class-wise academic activity and also the path ahead for the students of 9th class and above for the academic year 2020-2021. “To be precise, it will be the academic calender for this academic year.” She said collectors have been directed to take necessary steps to prepare schools and hostels ready for classes and commodities like rice, pulses and oil for preparation of food in hostels. The meet was attended by Special Chief Secretary Chitra Ramchandran, and senior officials Naveen Mittal, Omer Jaleel and Sridevasena.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/schools-colleges-may-function-in-two-shifts/article33563209.ece
13 January 2021||Kozhikode,||Life almost back to normal in GCC nations post COVID-19||Life in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have almost returned to normalcy with the COVID-19 cases almost ebbing away and community vaccination drive commencing in phased manner in cities and in full-swing in Dubai. At the same time, the Health Department in these nations have taken precautionary measures against the new coronavirus variants that emerged in the U.K., Japan and South Africa which experts declare are more significant and more transmissible. Already they have appealed to the public to strictly follow the guidelines to prevent the spread of the disease. The GCC nations are now reporting fewer number of active cases. In the UAE, the number of active cases is hovering around 25,000, while in Saudi Arabia the positive cases are around 2,000, and Qatar and Bahrain below 3,000, Kuwait 4,500 and Sultanate of Oman around 6,000. Business picking up Business is picking up and no signs of the pandemic could be seen except for people wearing mask. Despite low footfall, malls, cinemas, hotels and restaurants are open. People have been strictly asked to adhere to the guidelines such as physical distancing. Gatherings and get-together parties have restrictions on number of people attending them. Worshippers can enter mosques only five minutes before prayer. In Dubai, schools have reopened with strict COVID-19 safety measures in place and in Abu Dhabi , schools are offering only off-site learning for the first two weeks of the new school term till January 17. Schools have not reopened in Saudi Arabia that has the second second highest Non-Resident Indian population after the UAE among the GCC nations. Two vaccines At present, two vaccines in the UAE – Sinopharm and Pfizer-BioNTech – are available for use on eligible individuals against the COVID-19 infection. The only drawback faced by most expatriates is lack normalisation of commercial flights from India to many sectors in the GCC. There are no return flights to Saudi Arabia as of now. Flights are, however, operating under an air bubble agreement between India and the GCC nations Also, India is not on the green list of countries where international travellers are exempted from quarantine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/life-almost-back-to-normal-in-gcc-nations-post-covid-19/article33563546.ece
13 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||SC order on farm laws partial victory: Agri Minister||Minister for Agriculture Singireddy Niranjan Reddy has termed the Supreme Court’s suspension of the implementation of the three controversial farm laws for the time being as a partial victory for farmers protesting against the laws. Responding to the Apex Court’s decision on Tuesday, the Minister thanked the court both for keeping the laws in suspension and for appointing a committee of experts for finding a way forward. He requested the court for inclusion of all State governments in the committee along with representatives of farmers’ association and the Centre. Blames media He also blamed the media for not highlighting the farmers’ agitation going on the outskirts of Delhi as also elsewhere in the country for over 40 days now. He also observed that the media had given some space to the agitation unable to avoid it following the constitution of the experts’ panel by the Supreme Court. Mr. Niranjan Reddy hoped an amicable and democratic resolution to the stalemate once the Supreme Court appointed committee takes the view of all States. Earlier in the day, speaking after inaugurating the Rythu Vedika building at Uppariguda in Ibrahimpatnam constituency, he said all schemes by the State government such as Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Vedika, sheep distribution, subsidised supply of seed and micro irrigation implements, free and uninterrupted power supply to agricultural pump sets, were aimed at empowering the farming community and making them a united force. He stated that the new farm laws would not allow procurement of even 20-25% of the farm produce at the support price. Irrespective of such restrictions, the State government had been procuring all major crops till the stocks lasted with the farmers, in spite of incurring about Rs. 7,500 crore loss during the last six years. He demanded the inclusion of support price provision in the new farm laws and opined that whether the new farm laws would have adverse or positive impact on agriculture would be known only after a couple of farm seasons. Minister P. Sabitha Indra Reddy and Ibrahimpatnam MLA Manchireddy Kishan Reddy also took part.  The new farm laws would not allow procurement of even 20-25% of the farm produce at the support price.

13 January 2021||KOCHI,||CBI can probe LIFE Mission case: HC||Holding that there is a prima facie case to be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Kerala High Court on Tuesday dismissed the petitions filed by U.V. Jose, Chief Executive Officer, LIFE Mission, and Santhosh Eappen, managing director, Unitac, a construction company, seeking to quash the First Information Report (FIR) registered by the CBI into the alleged irregularities in the implementation of the LIFE Mission project at Wadakkachery in Thrissur district. Justice P. Somarajan observed that a clear criminal conspiracy to divert foreign contribution to the hands of a third person — Unitac Builders and Developers and Sane Ventures — “is prima facie evident from the mere fact that no agreement was entered into between the UAE Red Crescent and the State government in furtherance of a memorandum of understanding (MoU)” signed between the LIFE Mission (State government) and UAE Red Crescent. The agreements entered into by the two companies with the Consular General of the UAE without the ‘juncture’ of either the UAE Red Crescent, the fund provider, or the LIFE Mission were contrary to the spirit and understanding of the MoU. The court said the CEO of the LIFE Mission had perpetrated the delinquency by accepting intervention of third persons and permitting them to go ahead with building constructions and even offered all sorts of help in obtaining the necessary plan and permit from the local authority for the construction. The typical nature of the facts involved in the case would reveal ‘a high profile intellectual fraud played in furtherance of the MoU so as to avoid audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and to get kickbacks and gratifications.’ IAS officers should ‘check and balance’ while formulating and implementing policy decisions in accordance with the law in force. It was up to civil servants, the non-political executive, to implement the policy by due process of law. No liability on CM Their failure to address the issue or mischief, if any, done by them in the matter of its implementation could not by itself be a ground to extend any criminal liability against the political executive (the Chief Minister, Ministers and the legislature), unless the same was brought to their notice with its legal consequences in writing, the court said. Even proactive steps taken by the political executive in the implementation of the project/policy decisions “may not, by itself, make them responsible for any criminal liability, especially in a case of this nature, wherein a well-designed and intelligently hidden agenda was scrupulously employed by the civil servants in connivance with the middleman, the Consulate General of the UAE, Thiruvananthapuram, unless it was known or made known to them with its legal consequences specified in writing by the civil servants,” the court observed. Dismissing a contention that the government had not given consent or permission for a CBI probe in the case, the court pointed out that a notification issued by the State government on June 8, 2017 had accorded sanction to the CBI to register and investigate the crimes. Besides, the Chief Minister on July 8, 2020 had requested the Centre to employ Central agencies for effective investigation into the alleged irregularities in the LIFE Mission implementation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cbi-can-probe-life-mission-case-hc/article33563073.ece
13 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||In his first speech at UNSC, Jaishankar slams China and Pak.||Urging UN Security Council members not to make false distinctions of “good” terrorists and “bad” terrorists, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar made indirect references to both China and Pakistan for delaying the process of designating terrorist individuals and entities, as well as failing to stop the funding of terror. In a speech to the UNSC that convened a session to mark two decades since the 1373 anti-terror resolution was passed after the 9/11 attacks in the U.S., Mr. Jaishankar called for “zero tolerance to terrorism”. “The practice of placing blocks and holds on listing requests without any rhyme or reason must end. This only erodes our collective credibility,” Mr. Jaishankar told UNSC members, in a reference to a number of blocks and holds China placed on designating Pakistan-based terrorists including Jaish-e-Mohammad Chief Masood Azhar before agreeing to put him on the UNSC’s 1267 sanction list in May 2019. Without directly identifying Pakistan, Mr. Jaishankar also referred to States that are “clearly guilty of aiding and supporting terrorism, and wilfully provide financial assistance and safe havens” to them, and in a reference to underworld don and terror financier Dawood Ibrahim, spoke of “five- star treatment” he reportedly enjoys in Pakistan. “We, in India, have seen the crime syndicate responsible for the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts not just given state protection but enjoying five-star hospitality,” Mr. Jaishankar said listing an eight-point “action plan” to “credibly” address the menace of terrorism. Mr. Jaishankar also made a call for “enhanced UN coordination with the FATF”, just ahead of a meeting of the Task Force’s Asia Pacific Joint Group (APJG), which will review Pakistan’s performance in countering terror financing and money laundering.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-first-speech-at-unsc-jaishankar-slams-china-pak/article33563096.ece

Today, we urge them to fulfil the promise they made on the floor of the House,” Mr. Bukhari said. The Apni Party, comprising former PDP and Congress leaders, was floated after the removal of Article 370 and 35A. Mr. Bukhari demanded the release of political prisoners and holding of early Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir. “The government can reserve seven Assembly seats and hold Assembly elections without waiting for the delimitation commission report,” he added. He asked the Centre to formulate an employment policy for Jammu and Kashmir to address “burgeoning unemployment” and demanded restoration of 4G speed mobile Internet. Mr. Bukhari said the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, comprising the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), would fall apart as they had divergent ideologies. “They [political parties] have come under one umbrella for their political survival. They have not united for the people’s cause, but for their political motives. It was only the Apni Party which stood firmly for the people and demanded restoration of statehood, protection to land and jobs,” said Mr. Bukhari.

13 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Allay fears on anti-cow slaughter ordinance: HC||The Karnataka High Court on Tuesday ordered issue of notice to the State government on a PIL petition questioning the validity of the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Ordinance, 2020. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum passed the order on the petition filed by Mohamed Arif Jameel, a social worker from Bengaluru. Meanwhile, the Bench asked Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadgi to clear apprehension about likely prosecution of farmers for transporting cattle within the State even for the exemption granted for bona-fide agriculture and animal husbandry purpose as the government is yet to frame rules prescribing manner of such transportation. The Bench also made it clear that it may have to pass limited interim order to protect farmers from prosecution for transporting cattle for permitted agricultural and animal husbandry purposes till the rules are framed if the government is unable to allay the apprehension expressed by the court.  It was contended in the petition that the new law, which gives primacy to the directive principles over the fundamental rights of citizens, had breached the constitutional provision of right to livelihood under Article 21 of the Constitution by imposing economic burden on farmers, cattle traders, and butchers. The Ordinance was also a violation of right to carry one trade or business and amounts to infringement of Article 19(g) of the Constitution besides depriving citizens to food of their choice. “Many farmers, including Hindus, were selling unproductive cattle. But now they are forced to care for them even when they cannot afford to feed them,” the petitioner claimed, while contending that expenditure to maintain unproductive cattle in shelters is unacceptable in a developing country like India where the resource of the State is limited. Source of protein Contending that “beef is an excellent source of protein”, the petitioner said the new law “denies the poor and marginalised persons the cheapest source of protein as 15% (over 180 million) Indians, including Dalits, Muslims, Christians, and other backward castes, Adivasis, consume beef.” The petitioner expressed apprehension that the new law would result in increase in incidents of cow vigilantism in the State, especially in the coastal region.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/allay-fears-on-anti-cow-slaughter-ordinance-hc/article33563071.ece
13 January 2021||Hyderabad,||Guntur Srinu gives the slip to police||Hyderabad police who were on a hunt to nab Srinivas Rao Choudhary alias Guntur Srinu, one of key accused in the alleged kidnap of businessman K. Praveen Rao and his two brothers, located him near Pune in Maharashtra, where he was taking shelter. But, the fugitive gave the slip and remained untraceable till Tuesday evening. The police have landlocked with surveillance and are pursuing him minute-by-minute. His family members and other contacts are under the constant surveillance of the police. “By the time we reached the hotel, he managed to escape. We found the photocopy of his identity card submitted at the hotel, and his presence was also recorded in the CCTV cameras there,” an officer associated with the investigation of the case told The Hindu . He said that Srinu will be nabbed in a day or two. Several teams were sent to Kurnool, Jaggaiahpet, Nandigama in Andhra Pradesh, and even to Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra to ‘weed out’ the accused. Meanwhile, 10 more persons were taken into custody by the police and were being questioned on the conspiracy and execution of crime and their association with former minister AP Bhuma Akhila Priya Reddy, a prime accused in the case. They were picked up from Goa and other places. Akhila Priya’s brother Jagat Vikhyat Reddy, who is currently at large, is suspected to be one of the key persons in the conspiracy, as police found definitive involvement of the latter. With this the total number of accused may rise 20. “During investigation, we found clinching evidence on the ‘active role’ of Vikhyat in conspiracy and execution of the kidnap, ” another officer said. Vikhyat, and his sister Bhuma Mounika have been vocal on the alleged kidnap and land dispute ever since their elder sister was arrested. The former minister who was shifted to Begumpet women police station from Chanchalguda prisons for three-day police custody had been denied all the allegations levelled against her. “Despite showing her all the technical evidence , she is denying her role in the kidnap,” the officer said. Police also quizzed her why the land dispute cropped up now. Akhila Priya is being questioned on her role. Her husband M Bhargav Ram Naidu continued to remain untraceable.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/guntur-srinu-gives-slip-to-police/article33563485.ece
13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Farm leaders reject SC panel as a ‘govt. ploy’||“All members of this committee are pro-government, and they have been promoting and justifying these laws from the beginning. They have been writing in the newspapers, claiming that these laws are in farmers’ interests,” he said. One of the proposed committee members, food and agricultural policy expert Pramod Kumar Joshi, told The Hindu he had not yet received any official communication from the Supreme Court, and would not comment until he had seen the committee’s terms of reference. He has previously characterised the farmers’ repeal demand as “bizarre”. ‘Big bold step’ Another member, agricultural economist Ashok Gulati, has been a long-time advocate for farm reforms and welcomed the Centre’s announcement of the new laws as “big, bold steps in the right direction which will benefit both farmers and consumers”. The other two members of the committee — Bhupinder Singh Mann and Anil Ghanwat — head pro-reforms farmers groups. After submitting a memo to Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar last month, Mr. Mann had told The Hindu that “reforms are needed in order to make agriculture competitive”, but urged amendments along the same lines that the Centre has already proposed. “We opposed the formation of this committee on principle, no matter who was part of it. That is why we issued a press note last night itself, as a preventive and precautionary measure. We did not ask for such a committee, we did not even go to court at all, as our struggle is with the elected government which is responsible for policy decisions,” said Krantikari Kisan Union president Darshan Pal. “However, our worries about the process are proved by the constitution of this committee, and who was chosen to be on it...this is a fraud exercise.” With regard to their Republic Day plans, union leaders said the Centre was misleading the Supreme Court on the issue. “We are going to protest peacefully. We don’t want to occupy Parliament. We have no plan to go to Lal Qila. On our side, violence will not be tolerated,” said Mr. Rajewal, adding that the tractor parade would take place in Delhi as well as in other locations across the country.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/farm-leaders-reject-sc-panel-as-a-govt-ploy/article33563085.ece

Indian Medical Council of Research (ICMR) head Dr. Balram Bhargava spoke about the vaccine regime that would be followed. “There will be a gap of 28 days between two doses and the effectiveness begins 14 days after the second dose. During the vaccination process and after that also, COVID-19 appropriate behaviour is a must.’’ Member (Health) Niti Aayog Dr. V.K. Paul said the two vaccines available in India were safe and that there should not be any doubt about this. “They have been tested on thousands of people and the side-effects are negligible. All the vaccines in the world used currently against COVID-19 have been cleared under the emergency-use framework. As we go ahead, we will have more options. India has also been able to get these vaccines at very competitive prices,’’ he stated. Mr. Bhushan noted that the situation was worrisome across the world with cases graphs still climbing in the U.S., the U.K., Brazil and South Africa.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-option-to-choose-vaccines-says-govt/article33563086.ece
13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||SC stays rollout of three controversial farm laws||It noted that deaths, not due to violence, but either of illness or by way of suicide, had occurred already. The court lauded the peaceful nature of the protests and stated that it did not want to stifle it. However, it noted Attorney General K.K. Venugopal’s “support” of a “specific averment” by the Indian Kisan Union that an organisation, Sikhs for Justice, banned for anti-India secessionist movement, is financing the agitation. Reports of ‘Khalistanis’ In his turn, Mr. Venugopal orally remarked in the hearing that there were reports that “Khalistanis” had infiltrated the protests. The hearing on Tuesday took place in the absence of four senior lawyers, including senior advocate Dushyant Dave and advocate Prashant Bhushan, who had said they represent a bulk of the protesting farmers’ organisations. Senior advocate Harish Salve, who appeared for a party supporting the farm laws, said the four lawyers did not log into the virtual hearing on Tuesday. Chief Justice Bobde was, however, unperturbed by either the lawyers’ absence or statement by farmers on Monday night. “There are as many opinions here as there are farmers. Let the organisations talk to the committee. You can either resolve the problem or you can agitate indefinitely without any purpose,” he said. The court order made it clear that farmers’ bodies “shall” participate in the discussions of the committee. “The representatives of all the farmers’ bodies, whether they are holding a protest or not and whether they support or oppose the laws shall participate in the deliberations of the committee and put forth their view points,” it directed. Committee members The committee consists of Bhupinder Singh Mann, National President, Bhartiya Kisan Union and All India Kisan Coordination Committee; Dr. Parmod Kumar Joshi, agricultural economist, Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute; Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices; and Anil Ghanwat, President, Shetkari Sanghatana. The committee has to start work in 10 days and submit a report to the court in two months. The government would take care of their expenses. The court directed that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system in existence before the enactment of the farm laws should be maintained until further orders. In addition, the farmers’ landholdings should be protected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-stays-rollout-of-three-controversial-farm-laws/article33563087.ece

But it helped the Border Security Force’s Guwahati Frontier catch more of them and the contraband items they were ferrying in 2020 than in 2019. In 2020, the personnel of 11 battalions under the Guwahati Frontier seized cattle heads, phensedyl, yaba tablets, ganja or marijuana, opium and other items worth Rs. 20.70 crore.

Thomas Isaac’s 12th Budget to be presented in the Assembly on Friday is expected to chart out a new course for the educated unemployed. Homemakers and women who have crossed the age limit for applying for government jobs through the Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) will also be not left out as new employment avenues are to be generated. Welfare pensions A hike in the welfare pensions is on the cards. The salaried class will get new pay and allowance from next fiscal as the announcement of implementing the 11th Pay Commission report will figure in the Budget. “COVID-19 that has snatched many lives and hit all sectors of the economy has also created a new situation. A new job market has emerged and the brand name of Kerala has increased. We are going to take leverage on these and it will be spelled out in the Budget,” Dr. Isaac told The Hindu amidst giving finishing touches to the Budget at the Inspection Bungalow, Kovalam. “Transition of Kerala into a knowledge economy will be the centrepiece of the Budget. Like the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), it will be equally innovative and will lead the State to knowledge-based development in the years ahead,” he said. A comprehensive package, including skill development, start-ups and knowledge industries, is being planned.

13 January 2021||Mysuru,||Anti-tobacco cell objects to smoking visuals in KGF 2 teaser||The teaser of big budget Kannada movieK.G.F Chapter 2may have garnered millions of views on various online platforms since its release last week, but the Karnataka State Anti-Tobacco Cell has taken exception to the visuals showing actor Yash lighting a cigarette and smoking. Contending that the visuals showing the actor smoking a cigarette violated Section 5 of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) 2003, also known as COTPA 2003, the cell has decided to seek deletion of the teaser from online platforms and also removal of posters of the film that promote smoking. “The actor has a large number of fans, particularly among the youth. If he smokes (on screen), people will emulate him. So, we are asking them to remove the teaser from the online platforms and also posters of the movie,” said an official in the cell. A letter objecting to the visuals have been sent to the film director Prashant Neel, Mr. Yash, producer Vijay Kiragandur, and the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce. The cell, however, will not ask the filmmakers to remove the scene from the movie. “The law says that a smoking scene can be included in the movie provided there is editorial justification for the same, but an anti-tobacco health spot or messages will have to run as a scroll on the screen during the scene,” the official said. Meanwhile, anti-tobacco crusader Vasanthkumar Mysoremath said Mr. Yash’s smoking scene leads to “unhealthy promotion of cigarette smoking amongst his followers – the youth.” Mr. Mysoremath, who is also the honorary advisor of Cancer Patients Aids Association and convenor of the Anti-Tobacco Forum, Mysuru, said Mr. Yash, who has been appreciated for his contribution to social causes, should have refused to portray himself as a “habitual smoker” in films. Mr. Mysoremath recalled that tobacco activists had objected to smoking scenes even in KGF Chapter 1 , released in 2018 and certain changes had been made in the final print.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/anti-tobacco-cell-objects-to-smoking-visuals-in-kgf-2-teaser/article33563069.ece

13 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Marina vendors say many old-timers left out, want fresh count||In November 1966, when the ship, Stematis, ran aground and large crowds gathered to see the spectacle, P. Kuppan, now 76, was a youngster and remembers having pushed his mother Ponnammal’s peanut cart to the spot to sell their wares. “Since my father died when I was young, my mother took up this business,” recalls the old-timer, who now sells sugarcane juice behind Gandhi Statue on Marina Beach. Having weathered many a storm in his life, not finding his name on the list of vendors on the Marina came as a blow to him. “I am saddened by this. I took up the sugarcane juice business before my son was born. He has been selling popcorn. Both our names are not on the list; so are those of Ayyasami, Anusuya, Selvam, Rathnam and many others in our bay. I pray to Goddess Periyapalayathamma that we be able to vend our goods again on the Marina,” Mr. Kuppan said. Vendors on the Marina have been complaining that they have not been enumerated properly and many names have been left out by the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC). Following a direction from the Madras High Court, the GCC has made several attempts to bring order to the place, including by enumerating the shops and trying to bring in stalls that look uniform, and even conduct elections for the associations. However, the vendors say all these have been done in a haphazard manner. P. Muthu, president, Tamil Nadu Nethaji Subash Chandra Bose Amaippu Saara Matrum Kattumaanam and Meen Pudi Thozilallar Paadhukaappu Peravai, who himself is a vendor and has been aggrieved by this process, has approached the court seeking a re-enumeration. “Certain GCC officials have just made up a list of vendors, they are just random names. We want a fresh enumeration under the direct supervision of the court,” he said, adding that vendors having merry-go-rounds, balloon aim and shoot stalls, too, should be allowed. “They are not allowing certain categories, we are told. Those who ran shops earlier should be allowed to vend again,” he added. K. Bharathi, of the South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association, said, “These shops, which are not permanent structures, have helped families educate children and settle them in their lives. They have not become affluent but continue to live in rented accommodation. During the lockdown, since the shops were shut, many went hungry, and on hearing that, NGOs stepped in to help. They are suggestions that shopkeepers prepare the items at home and sell them on the beach. That won’t work since people are doubly careful about what they consume. The civic body should take proper care while deciding something; there should be no loss of livelihood.” List ready Meanwhile, the GCC has finalised a list of around 18,000 applicants for hawking on the beach under the categories of A and B after the scrutiny of applications. The category A is for existing vendors and category B is for city residents who wish to start businesses on the beach. Civic officials said the list of persons eligible for participation in the draw of lots would be published on January 6. Smart carts would be allotted based on the draw of lots to be held in the presence of former Sikkim High Court Chief Justice Satish K. Agnihotri on January 20 and 21. More than 1,400 vendors of Marina beach have been found eligible for smart carts. Such applicants have submitted street-vending identity cards issued by the GCC. At least 16,000 city residents are eligible for licence to vend on the beach, said officials who scrutinised the applications. The officials said applications without signatures had been rejected. Applications submitted by residents of neighbourhoods outside the city limits had also been rejected. Civic officials said the first batch of 300 smart carts would be ready shortly. Another batch of 300 would be distributed to licence-holders one month after the launch. The last batch of 300 is expected before the announcement of the Assembly election. Fishermen are rejoicing since at a hearing on Friday, the High Court observed that the welfare of fishermen and their rights were more important than the beautification of the Marina. The court said beautification could be carried out simultaneously, but the welfare of fishermen should be the priority.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/marina-vendors-say-many-old-timers-left-out-want-fresh-count/article33563812.ece
13 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||State receives 5,36,500 doses of Covishield vaccine||Tamil Nadu received its first consignment of a COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday. As many as 5,36,500 doses of Covishield arrived in Chennai from Pune. They are being dispatched to the districts ahead of a vaccination drive scheduled to be held at 307 places across the State on January 16. Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said the State had been allotted 5,56,500 doses of COVID-19 vaccines, including 5,36,500 doses of Covishield and 20,000 doses of Covaxin. Doses of Covishield, supplied by the Serum Institute of India (SII), Pune, arrived at the Chennai airport around 10.30 a.m., and were taken to the State vaccine store on the premises of the Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services (DMS). A GoAir flight carrying 59 boxes containing the vaccine left the Pune airport at 8.45 a.m. and landed in Chennai at 10.25 a.m. There were 1,200 vials in each box. The Airports Authority of India Cargo Logistics and Allied Services Company Limited has been assigned the role of monitoring the shipments from Pune to various cities, including Chennai. A Joint Director of the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine will oversee the transportation of the vaccines from the airport. Each district has designated cold chain officers. From the State vaccine store, 5,12,200 doses were distributed to 10 regional vaccine stores (RVS), including those at Chennai, Cuddalore, Tiruchi, Thanjavur, Madurai, Sivaganga, Tirunelveli, Vellore, Salem and Coimbatore, leaving a buffer stock of 24,300 doses at the State vaccine store.

The Tiruchi RVS would get 40,200 doses for distribution to Tiruchi, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Aranthangi, Pudukottai and Karur. A total of 28,600 doses were allotted to the Thanjavur RVS. The Madurai RVS would be getting 54,100 doses, Sivaganga 19,000, Tirunelveli 51,700, Vellore 42,100 and Salem 59,800. Mr. Radhakrishnan said the doses were dispatched in accordance with the number of healthcare workers in the respective districts. The Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) had readied facilities to transport the vaccines. P. Umanath, Managing Director, TNMSC, said these vaccines should be maintained at a temperature of two to eight degrees centigrade. The Health Secretary said 2,000 vaccine centres had been readied in the State. As per Central government guidelines, healthcare workers, followed by frontline workers, would be inoculated first. Officials of the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine said they were starting off with Covishield. Around 4.39 lakh healthcare workers have registered themselves to receive the vaccine in the first phase. “Vaccination is voluntary,” Mr. Radhakrishnan said. To a question on an internal circular of the Tamil Nadu Government Doctors’ Association regarding the safety of the vaccines, he said this was an internal circular, and everyone had the right to hold discussions on the subject. With schools all set to reopen for students of Classes 10 and 12, the School Education Department has sought two crore multi-vitamin tablets and as many zinc tablets from the TNMSC. Work to dispatch the medicines from TNMSC warehouses has begun, Mr. Umanath said. Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar on Tuesday said necessary steps had been taken to administer the COVID-19 vaccines to identified personnel across the State on January 16. Addressing the media at Viralimalai, he said the vaccines would be administered only to pre-registered personnel. Noting that comprehensive measures had been taken to administer the vaccines as per the Central government’s guidelines, Mr. Vijayabaskar said Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami would inaugurate the vaccination process.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tamil-nadu-receives-536500-doses-of-covishield-vaccine/article33563264.ece
13 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||More retailers visit Koyambedu market||The Koyambedu market received additional vehicles on Tuesday, ahead of Pongal. However, the demand for sugarcane and turmeric is reportedly yet to pick up. Unlike previous years, sugarcane trucks carried out trade at a separate space at the rear end of the market. On Tuesday, about 200 truckloads of sugarcane arrived, and this number is expected to go up by Wednesday. Wholesale traders noted that only 50% of sales occurred in the last two days. This could be due to limited working hours and business from a different place. Each 20-piece bundle of sugarcane sold for Rs. 350- Rs. 500, with single pieces priced at Rs. 40. Similarly, the market received about 50 truckloads of turmeric and 25-piece bundles sold for Rs. 100. Traders expect that sales will pick up from Wednesday as Pongal draws nearer. Traffic congestion prevailed around the market despite sugarcane sellers being allotted a separate space for business. The Federation of All Associations of the Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex announced that the market would remain closed on Saturday on account of Pongal, and it would only function on January 17. Normally, the market is closed for two days for Pongal holidays. But it would be kept open this time for the benefit of retailers, the federation said. This year, vegetables used during Pongal sold faster and at a nominal rate. P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Association, said, “Since Monday, we’ve had 40%-50% more sales than normal. The market got 40-50 additional truckloads of vegetables. But there was not much difference in price as trade opened after the Sunday holiday.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/more-retailers-visit-koyambedu-market/article33563268.ece
13 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chaos rules Asia’s largest bus terminus, despite virus threat||The lessons learnt from the fruit and vegetable market nearby, identified as a super spreader location for COVID-19 soon after the lockdown was announced, seem to have had little impact on the management of the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus (CMBT) in Koyambedu. Inadequate facilities and poor hygiene are the hallmarks of the bus terminus, hailed as Asia’s largest such facility, where thousands visit every day. The sprawling space just before the huge sign board bearing the name Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. MGR Bus Stand is utilised by buses of the Metropolitan Transport Corporation. Poor illumination at night has commuters literally running around. “People have to run here and there to board a bus. Most of the time the public address system does not work. When buses pull up into the bay, one has to run along with the bus to get a seat,” said Narmada, a social activist and regular commuter from Anna Nagar. At the entrance of the huge complex, there are hardly any metal detectors or police standing to frisk passengers and only a private security personnel stands guard. Sanitisers and temperature checks are absent. A shelter for homeless The bus stand looks more like a shelter for the homeless, passengers who are on transit, destitute elders, migrant workers and runaways .  At any given point of time at night, about 2,000 people sleep in the huge corridor. Raja, a security guard who lost his job recently due to the pandemic, said: “I came back from my native place in Theni district to rejoin the job but my employer told me that he would respond only tomorrow. I have only Rs. 400 in my hand and have to stay here as I have nowhere else to go.” V. Panneerselvam, from Ariyalur, said: “I am a daily wage earner at the market and I cannot afford lodges. This place is much more comfortable since free toilets are available. Only thing we have to fight for is space.” No one is available in the control room of CCTVs at night. The corridors are unclean and garbage is strewn all over in the bays where State Transport Corporation buses are parked. Of course, private conservancy workers sweep the terminus during the day. Unclean toilets with broken doors remain unusable, while bottles and litter are strewn everywhere. In the late hours, chaos prevails with no information on the arrival of buses to the bays. R. Thinesh, who was waiting for a bus, said: “Announcements are not made at the departure terminal and passengers have to hang around with their baggage without any idea as to how long they should wait. After the bus arrives, we have to run behind the bus to board and get a seat.” “There are no proper and adequate civic facilities. Buses are parked haphazardly, often causing traffic snarls inside the terminus. During the festival season, it takes over two hours for buses to leave the terminus. It lacks a public announcement system. People face hardship in locating buses for their destination. Some bus bays are unused,” said Arul, a commuter from Jafferkhanpet. No quality check The quality of food and snacks sold at the eateries is bad and not fit for consumption, a commuter charged. There are several complaints on the exorbitant prices being charged for food, snacks and water bottles. V. Aravindh, a journalist, had a harrowing experience when he went to send off his friend. He said: “Around 10.40 p.m., I bought vegetable biryani for Rs. 80 from an eatery, but found it stale. When we went to return the food, the shopkeeper refused to return the money. There is no quality check on the food outlets.” The dysfunctional drinking water facility and broken taps are advantageous to shopkeepers to sell their water bottles at higher prices. “Amma Kudineer costs Rs. 10 a bottle but the kiosk which sells the bottles is closed at night. We were forced to buy branded water bottles for Rs. 20 to Rs. 25 from shops located inside the terminus. Moreover, the quality of water is suspect,” said Archana from Vaniyambadi. The dormitory meant for the bus crew is not maintained well. “The crew drive long-distance buses the entire night and every day in the morning until 11.30 a.m. They have to wait in a long queue to fill fuel since the CMBT has only two bunks. Later, they sleep in the dormitory for only a few hours before proceeding on the next trip. The dormitory premises are cleaned by outsiders, who are engaged by us,” said an office-bearer of a transport union. Further, it takes an hour for a bus to get out from the terminus to reach the bypass, thanks to traffic snarls. The omnibuses are parked on the road for want of space on the premises. A senior official of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), which maintains the bus stand, said efforts were made to keep the premise neat and tidy. Conservancy workers collect 100 kg to 120 kg of garbage from the premises every day and clean the floor and toilets regularly. Regular raids are conducted on eateries to check the quality of food and prices. “With the help of police officials, we are taking steps to evict people who use the pavement as their shelter,” said the official.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chaos-rules-asias-largest-bus-terminus-despite-virus-threat/article33563273.ece
13 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Vacancies in Secretariat a cause for concern||Several vacancies in various departments housed on the Secretariat campus in Chennai have become a cause for concern. It is said that the vacancies were causing delays even as the government is racing against time to clear all the files ahead of the Assembly election. Most of the vacancies are of Under Secretary and Deputy Secretary posts in various departments. Though the sanctioned strength of Under Secretaries is around 240 in 36 State government departments (in what is known as ‘one unit’, excluding the Finance and the Law Departments), more than 150 posts are vacant. “The Under Secretaries are also posted as Public Information Officers [PIOs] for giving replies to RTI Act queries. Since about 70%-75% of posts are vacant, the response to RTI applications are also delayed,” said a section officer. Section officers are not promoted as Under Secretaries. The promotion of typists, assistants and assistant section officers have also been affected as the Under Secretary posts have not been filled. Another officer said certain litigation relating to the issue were pending in court, despite over 60 hearings. “Only because the government extended the services of government employees by one more year with effect from last year, some Under-Secretaries are still in service. If not for the announcement, there would have been more vacancies,” he added. When contacted, a senior official told The Hindu that the government was not able to fill these vacancies due to the pending litigation. However, instructions have been issued to the Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department to promote these (litigating) section officers to the Under Secretary posts, subject to the outcome of the case. “However, we could not do the same for Deputy Secretary posts, since only a few positions are vacant and there are multiple claimants for each of these posts,” the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vacancies-in-secretariat-a-cause-for-concern/article33563295.ece
13 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Disclose status of arrear exams, High Court tells universities||The Madras High Court was on Monday informed that various universities in the State have decided to conduct arrear examinations, after the court, through its interim order on December 1, 2020, restrained them from declaring that all students had passed without conducting examinations — online, offline or both modes. Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, therefore, directed the individual universities to file reports by February 4 indicating the status with respect to the conduct of the arrear examinations. The direction was issued on a batch of cases filed against the State government’s decision to cancel the arrear examinations.  In defence of G.O. Defending the government order (G.O.) issued on August 26, 2020 (to pass all students), Special Government Pleader E. Manoharan told the court that it was issued to save students from COVID-19. He also said that the G.O. was in consonance with the then advisory issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which had insisted on conducting the final-year examinations alone. PIL petitions However, after former Anna University Vice-Chancellor E. Balagurusamy and advocate B. Ramkumar Adityan filed public interest litigation petitions challenging the G.O., the UGC filed a counter-affidavit insisting on the conduct of the arrear examinations. Since the COVID-19 situation, too, had improved by December, the court passed interim orders, he said. ‘Quash G.O.’ On the other hand, advocate E. Vijay Anand, representing the former Vice-Chancellor, urged the Bench to quash the G.O. and order that the students could not be declared to have passed the arrear examinations without writing them. The counsel said that it would set a bad precedent and demoralise the meritorious students who had cleared all the papers promptly.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/disclose-status-of-arrear-exams-hc-tells-varsities/article33563750.ece

13 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Banks deny loans to over 15,000 street vendors in Chennai||Banks continue to deny loans to street vendors under PM SVANidhi during the COVID-19 pandemic in the city, even after seven meetings with the Greater Chennai Corporation. At a meeting of bankers on Monday, the GCC advised them to disburse loans to all street vendors. “As many as 19,000 street vendors have applied for loans under the PM SVANidhi scheme. Banks in Chennai have disbursed loans to only 2,600 street vendors. Some banks have disbursed loans to most of the applicants. But most of the banks have rejected the applications,” said an official of the GCC. At a meeting held a few weeks ago, Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash directed the banks to disburse loans to all applicants in 10 days. But the bank branches disbursed loans to less than 500 street vendors before the deadline. As a result, the GCC is planning to compile a list of all branches that have rejected the applications. The data will be shared with the Central and State governments. At least 15,000 street vendors who have identity cards are yet to get loans. Most of the letters of recommendation issued by the GCC were rejected by the banks, which argued that the applicants did not have identity cards. Corporation officials explained to the bank representatives that the letters were issued to those who did not have identity cards. They stressed the need for creating awareness among bank officials of the importance of such loans during the pandemic. The bank representatives said they did not have the manpower to help the street vendors during the pandemic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/banks-deny-loans-to-over-15000-street-vendors-in-chennai/article33563818.ece
13 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Classes 10, 12 to resume from Jan. 19||Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Tuesday announced that schools would reopen for students in Classes 10 and 12 across the State from January 19 as parents in about 95% of the schools had asked for the resumption of physical classes. “Permission is being granted for allowing not more than 25 students in each classroom and by complying with the guidelines issued by the government. Hostels are also being allowed for those students,” Mr. Palaniswami said in a statement on Tuesday. The Chief Minister also instructed the Health Department to give vitamin and zinc tablets to boost the immunity of all students. “I request the parents, the teachers and the students to cooperate with the precautionary measures being taken by the government to contain the spread of COVID-19,” he added. The decision to reopen schools for Classes 10 and 12 was taken based on inputs received from the District Collectors, public health and medical experts, and senior Ministers last year and also the opinions received from parents between January 6 and 8 this year. This is the third time that the State government has decided to reopen schools for Classes 10 and 12 since the COVID-19 lockdown was imposed in March last year. In September last year, the government decided to reopen schools for students of Classes 10, 11 and 12, “on a voluntary basis”, to seek guidance from their teachers from October 1. The decision was eventually deferred until a second decision in October to reopen schools for Classes 9, 10, 11 and 12 from November 16. However, a few days before November 16, the State government announced that schools would not reopen on the said date after it analysed the feedback from parents. It said that a fresh reopening date would be announced after taking the COVID-19 situation into consideration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/classes-10-12-to-resume-from-jan-19/article33563252.ece

13 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Remembering a trendsetting thavil maestro||Valangaiman, a town in Thiruvarur district, gets its name from the fact that Lord Siva in the temple there holds a deer in his right hand. It is a rare idol. In the world of Carnatic music, it occupied an important place because of thavil player Valangaiman Shanmugasundaram Pillai, whose birth centenary is being celebrated this year. To keep alive the memory of the maestro, Parivadini, a charitable organisation promoting music, has released a table calendar. “He exemplified a traditional thavil maestro — both in his way of playing the instrument and physical appearance. Clarity was his forte,” said thavil maestro T.R. Govindarajan. Interestingly, Shanmugasundaram Pillai was not born in Valangaiman. His birthplace is Segal Madappuram near Thiruthuraipoondi. His family moved to Sri Lanka when he was a child. After establishing a career in music there, he came back to India to learn from Nachiar Kovil Raghava Pillai. Valangaiman became inseparable from his name after he settled there. Though he played for all great nagaswaram players, for almost 30 years he accompanied Sheik Chinna Moulana. He was a trendsetter when it came to accompanying other instruments. He first played for flute Mali and N. Ramani. “He came forward to play for Mandolin Srinivas and the combination created a wave in the music world. His concerts with violinist L. Subramaniam and his brothers are also well received. He even played for T.N. Seshagopalan in his vocal concerts,” said Mr. Govindarajan. Srinivas had acknowledged how Shanmugasundaram gave a fillip to his career in the initial years. The way he controlled the instrument to produce soft sounds to suit instruments other than nagaswaram was amazing. “He accompanied me when I was a boy and told me not to be overawed by his presence. ‘Let us see what we can do together’ was the word of encouragement,” recalled nagaswaram player Injikudi E.M. Subramaniam. “He was a team player and elevated the concert together with other musicians. The way he played during raga alapana is something unique, and now that style has almost disappeared,” he said. Parivadini founder Lalitharam said the calendar also has the portraits of thavil maestros Raghava Pillai and Needamangalam Meenakshisundaram Pillai.  His concerts with violinist L. Subramaniam and his brothers are well received. He even played for T.N. Seshagopalan T.R.

13 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Fishermen at loggerheads over berthing space in Kasimedu||Two boat associations are at loggerheads over space to berth their craft in the Kasimedu fishing harbour. A group of around 50 mechanised boats that are occupying the low-level wharf meant for smaller fibre boats is causing the problem. “They are refusing to move and when the winds are heavy or the tide is high, the smaller boats get hit and damaged. Due to lack of space, these fibre boats are berthed some 5-6 boats away, which leads to men falling into the water and getting hurt due to the stones and rods at the bottom. There are at least 10 wharfs for the larger mechanized boats that number around 1,000,” explained Nanjil Ravi of Akhila Indhiya Meenavar Sangam. M. Vijesh, who represents the small boats, said the issue should be amicably resolved and that they did not want to create a ruckus over it. “They are our brethren. They should understand our problems. A section of the boats did move out. But some boats are still berthing here. This will cause damage to the wharf too since it cannot withstand the loading and unloading operations,” he said. The Fisheries Department had sent notices to the owners of the boats and also to the association representing them. Their diesel subsidy, too, was suspended for a certain time. However, they managed to get that lifted. A meeting with the association members has been planned, said a source in the department.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fishermen-at-loggerheads-over-berthing-space-in-kasimedu/article33563815.ece

Mr. Gandhi will be spending around four hours in Madurai as part of the party’s ‘Rahulin Tamizh Vanakkam’ initiative. He will land in Madurai and travel to the venue to watch the proceedings. Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) president K.S. Alagiri told presspersons that Mr. Gandhi’s visit is also meant to give moral support to farmers across the country who are protesting against the farm laws, and to celebrate the culture and heritage of Tamil people. “Rahulin Tamizh Vanakkam is a way to show his closeness with the people of Tamil Nadu, how much he likes them, and to show his gratitude to the people of the State,” Mr. Alagiri said. This will be Mr. Gandhi’s first visit in a long campaign schedule the TNCC is drawing up for him, Mr. Alagiri said. “He will not be making any political speeches on January 14. Right now, we have not scheduled any meeting with farmers. But if he wishes to, he may meet them,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rahul-gandhi-to-watch-jallikattu-in-avaniyapuram/article33563255.ece

They will issue an advisory for members based on the reports. With the vaccination against COVID-19 for healthcare professionals and workers set to begin soon, the TNGDA sent a circular to all State executive committee (EC) members of the association. The TNGDA said the government had announced the starting of the vaccination drive against SARS-CoV-2. The government planned to launch the drive with two vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin. The Centre had announced the start of vaccination for healthcare professionals on January 16. “In this situation, some of the doctors and other frontline workers have expressed concern on the safety of the vaccine supplied and if they have a choice. Some doctors have expressed unwillingness to vaccinate themselves for the fear of serious complications vis-a-vis the disease [infectivity and mortality],” the association said in the circular. Due to the queries raised and the doubts prevailing among some doctors, the TNGDA had sought an opinion from three independent top specialists on the safety, efficacy and choice of vaccines offered, by January 13. It will issue an advisory for its members and other stakeholders based on those reports after the scheduled TNGDA emergency executive committee meeting on January 14. “We will finalise the advisory on January 14. It will mostly be on the type of vaccine to be preferred and who should take it. It is mostly surrounding the safety aspect,” an office-bearer said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/doctors-association-seeks-opinion-on-vaccine-safety/article33563256.ece
13 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||It was part of the first master plan||The Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus (CMBT) is located in the northern periphery of the city along Jawaharlal Nehru Salai (Inner Ring Road) at Koyambedu. Built at a cost of Rs. 103 crore, Asia’s largest bus terminus was inaugurated by former Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa on November 18, 2002. The launch of the facility, which was part of the first master plan drafted four decades ago, was expected to ease congestion at Esplanade, Basin Bridge, Broadway and Saidapet, where State-run buses were operating. Long-distance State Transport Corporation buses were prohibited from entering the city beyond the Inner Ring Road. Omni buses were provided space adjacent to the Koyambedu market. The terminus was designed taking into account the future requirements and constructed on an area of 36 acres with a total built up area of 17,840 sq ft, which includes a main terminal hall, bus fingers, large office spaces, shops, maintenance shed, crew restrooms and other incidental structures. Three bus fingers had the facility to park 180 buses at a time in bays, besides an idle parking area for parking 60 buses. Around 2,000 buses operate from the CMBT every day. It has a separate large area for parking cars, autorickshaws and two-wheelers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/it-was-part-of-the-first-master-plan/article33563274.ece
13 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Owners of vehicles with toll exemption can apply online for FASTag cards||The National Highways Authority of India has launched a new portal for vehicles that are exempted from payment of toll charge at its plazas. These vehicles will be issued with radio-frequency enabled FASTag cards if they apply online on http://exemptedfastag.nhai.org/ “This is to make the process easier for such vehicles that have to otherwise submit physical copies of applications to the respective regional office of the NHAI, who then sends it to the headquarters, which sends it to another agency, and then the FASTag is issued,” a toll operator said. “There are around 35 categories of vehicles that are exempted from paying toll since they are travelling in the service of the nation. If they submit the applications online along with the supporting documents, the process can be speeded up and FASTags can be issued quickly,” said Pavan Kumar, NHAI Regional Officer. Official vehicles used by Members of Parliament, Ministers, MLAs, MLCs, High Court Judges, Chief Secretaries, Governors, Lt. Governors, foreign dignitaries, executive magistrates and vehicles used by the armed forces, police and fire services, those used as ambulances and vehicles classified as invalid carriages, used by the differently abled, can apply through this portal. A toll plaza operator said besides the officially exempted vehicles, at times they had issues with vehicles of local leaders and politicians. “They sport party flags and refuse to pay. Sometimes there are arguments and fights at toll plazas,” he said. At present, around 74% of national highway users in the State are FASTag compliant. The NHAI is taking steps to increase the number. Motorists have time till February 15 to procure FASTags for their vehicles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/owners-of-vehicles-with-toll-exemption-can-apply-online-for-fastag-cards/article33563276.ece
13 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Plan to deploy modern pushcarts on Marina beach put on hold||Steps taken by the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC), at the insistence of the Madras High Court, to procure and deploy 900 modern pushcarts for use by vendors at Marina Beach hit a roadblock with the Supreme Court directing the civic body to maintain status quo. Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman, Navin Sinha and K.M. Joseph passed the interim order on an appeal preferred by AIR Systems Limited, one of the bidders for the supply of the push carts. The judges directed the Corporation to maintain status quo as on Tuesday and not proceed further. PIL filed In 2015, Fishermen Care, a non-governmental organisation, had filed a public interest litigation petition in the High Court regarding welfare of fishermen. In 2018, a Division Bench, led by Justice Vineet Kothari (now transferred to Gujarat High Court), expanded the scope of the case. The Bench began issuing a series of directions for the beautification of Marina Beach by regularising vendors and clearing the fish sellers squatting on its loop road. As part of the beautification process, the GCC decided to procure modern and colourful pushcarts. When tenders were called for, two firms submitted their bids. While AIR Systems Limited quoted Rs. 16.44 crore, A Quad Enterprises quoted Rs. 17.20 crore. However, the tender was allotted to the latter because the former supposedly did not conform to other conditions. Immediately, AIR Systems Limited filed a writ petition before a single judge and obtained an interim order in its favour on November 10. However, when this was brought to the notice of the Division Bench, it stayed the single judge’s order and tagged the writ petition along with the PIL petition. Equal split Subsequently, the Bench suggested that the contract could be equally divided between both firms so that all 900 pushcarts could be procured within three months and the Corporation obliged. On December 4, the court ordered that both the suppliers should also be penalised for delay in supply. Ordering that 300 pushcarts must be supplied every month, the Bench said the suppliers would suffer a penalty of reduction of price to the extent of 10% per cart if the delay was more than two days, 25% per cart if the delay was more than a week and 50% per cart if the delay was more than 15 days. When the case was listed again on December 14, a senior counsel representing AIR Systems told the court that his client was not interested in taking up the contract since the company was not agreeable to the penalty clause of reduction in price if there was a delay in supply.

Palaniswami was making new announcements every day because the election to the Assembly was round the corner. “He has announced free data cards for students. But the people are ready to say ‘ta ta’ to him,” he said while addressing students of the Anita Achievers Academy. Mr. Stalin said the academy, aimed at empowering women, was started in memory of Anita whose aspiration to join a medical college was cut short by NEET, despite scoring high marks in Plus Two. “Women should learn and take up employment. Acquiring skills will make them independent,” he said. Mr. Stalin said though a resolution was adopted in the Assembly against NEET and sent to Delhi, no action had been taken so far. “The AIADMK government is not in a position to argue against NEET. When elected to power, the DMK will use all its might to dispense with NEET,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/people-ready-to-give-a-farewell-to-aiadmk-claims-stalin/article33563289.ece

Thirumavalavan on Tuesday said that the Centre must revoke all the three farm laws against which the farmers have been protesting in New Delhi for the last 50 days. In a statement, Mr. Thirumavalavan said the Supreme Court’s stay on farm laws was not a permanent solution to the problem.  Sustained protests The sustained protests by the farmers and their threat that they would enter New Delhi had managed to move those in power at the Centre by an inch, the VCK leader added. “The stay is just a temporary victory for the farmers. The Modi government should look at this as a warning and as a way forward and repeal the farm laws completely. And pass a law that guarantees MSP immediately. If the stay is just to scuttle the farmers’ protests, it will become detrimental to the interest of the government and protests will intensify,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/repeal-farm-laws-says-thirumavalavan/article33563291.ece

From December onwards, several teachers have been saying that schools should be allowed to call senior students for a discussion in class rooms before taking up the board examinations later this year. “As a next step, we are appealing to the government to announce that the academic term be extended by at least two months so that we have enough time with the students and ensure they are well prepared to take up the exams,” said P.K. Ilamaran, president of the Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Associations. K.R. Nandhakumar, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Nursery, Primary, Matriculation and Higher Secondary Schools Association, said that clarity regarding the board examination timetable at the earliest and the proposed syllabus reduction would help them proceed in the right direction. “When we get more information regarding how many days a week we can work, and the working hours, we can then plan the schedule which we can put into effect from January 19. The rule of not more than 25 students per class will be strictly followed,” he said. While the School Education Department had already given a draft SoP about the safety measures to be followed on campus in case schools are reopened, schools said they expected further instructions closer to the date of reopening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/state-governments-decision-to-reopen-schools-for-classes-10-12-welcomed/article33563298.ece

13 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||When arrack flowed freely on the sands||The shops on the Marina have been there for over seven decades, recall old-timers. “There were shops when Arignar Anna and MGR were the Chief Ministers. We have watched them drive past us and waved at them. No police or Corporation officials came threatening us,” said a former paan vendor, who sold “sweet beeda” behind the Gandhi Statue since the 1980s. In the 1970s, a pack of peanuts used to be sold for 10 paise and a mango piece for just 2 paise. “There were not many vendors at that time. Peanuts, corn on the cob, raw mangoes and sharbat used to be what beach-goers would find and, that too, at select locations. Of course, the mobile murukku and sundal vendors were very much part of the ethos of the place, and these snacks continue to find a place on the sands,” said C. Ranganathan, who visits the Marina regularly. There also used to be a time when the beach was known for the sale of sundakanji , a fermented rice brew made on the beach and buried under the sand. In the late 1980s, there have been many instances of arrack being found by the city police during raids. Arrests, too, happened in areas, including Balaji Nagar and Rotary Nagar. Fishermen from some hamlets, including Urur and Olcott Kuppam, were also known to vend sundakanji , which was sold at Rs. 10 for a 300-ml sachet. “When things began to get out of hand, the police intervened and raids were conducted on the homes of those brewing this drink. They were asked to stop the business and instead sell food on the Marina, which is how another section of people got into it,” said Kabaddi Maran of Nochikuppam. Since many spots on the Marina and Besant Nagar beaches were not very populated after dark, they were also chosen by some beach-goers to consume alcohol.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/when-arrack-flowed-freely-on-the-sands/article33563813.ece

Palaniswami to take a cue from the Kerala government and offer tax concessions to films and other industries in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an official statement in Chennai, the DMK president said the Kerala government, led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, had taken every step to safeguard the public. Mr. Vijayan had announced tax concessions to all industries during the pandemic. Pointing to Kerala’s announcement that entertainment tax would not be collected till March 31 and a 50% concession would be granted for electricity tariff to cinemas, the DMK president said time had also been extended to pay property tax as well. ‘Dream factory’ “In Tamil Nadu, the film industry is known as a dream factory and provides employment to thousands. They are severely hit by the pandemic. The AIADMK government should follow the Kerala government and offer tax concessions to the film and other industries,” Mr. Stalin said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-chief-demands-tax-cuts-for-films-other-industries/article33563293.ece

When asked why the BJP’s stand on the issue had suddenly changed, Mr. Murugan said that was not the case. He said the DMK alliance had not been finalised, and nobody knew whether the Congress, the Left parties and other outfits were part of the alliance. He said even the chief ministerial candidate of the DMK front had not been announced. “Wherever Udhayanidhi Stalin goes, the cadre raise slogans stating that he is the future Chief Minister...

Wilson, who argued against the farm-related legislation in the Supreme Court, on Tuesday said it was wrong and misleading on the part of the Attorney General to say that south India was supporting the law. “I repudiated his claim. Tamil Nadu is opposing it. That we have challenged the legislation itself is the fact that we are not supporting. Vijayawada is burning and I submitted photographs to support my argument,” Mr. Wilson told reporters in Chennai. Mr. Wilson, who appeared on behalf of the DMK, said everyone knew how the laws were rushed through in Parliament when they were introduced. “Especially in the Rajya Sabha, we asked for a division. When we opposed it as there was no division, they were passed in the guise of a voice vote. It was totally against the rules and procedure,” he said. He said legislative competitiveness was in question because the subject involved was a List II subject. “Agriculture is a List II subject. Parliament has no competence at all to pass an Act and it should be stayed,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-repudiates-a-gs-claim-on-farm-laws/article33563292.ece

The launch has been delayed by litigation pertaining to the existing conservancy workers. A special purpose vehicle, created by the GCC and Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited, will carry out the operations in the Tiruvottiyur, Manali, Madhavaram and Ambattur zones. GCC Chief Engineer N. Mahesan said 825 battery-operated vehicles, 12 compactors and 12 mechanical sweepers would be used. The private operator would start the work in Tiruvottiyur in the third week of February. The operations would begin in Manali in the second phase of the launch, before being expanded to Madhavaram and Ambattur, he said. “We depend on more battery-operated vehicles to ensure 100% door-to-door waste collection. Mechanical sweepers will clean all main roads,” Mr. Mahesan said. All market areas would also be cleaned with mechanical sweepers. A total of 2.5 lakh households in the four zones generate 2,800 tonnes of solid waste every day. The special purpose vehicle would focus more on mechanical sweeping and door-to-door waste collection using battery-operated vehicles, he said.

Invitees restricted The number of invitees would also be restricted to ensure physical distancing norms, he said. The wearing of face masks and the use of sanitisers for all invitees would also be enforced in coordination with the Health Department.

Nearly 260 contractors, who are members of Coimbatore Corporation Contractors Welfare Association, are executing projects for Public Works Department, local bodies, Highways, and the Electricity Department across the State. Their annual turnover is Rs. 3,000 crore. These contractors went on a strike as steel prices have seen steep increase in the last three months. The Association said in a release that steel prices that were around Rs. 36,000 a tonne three months ago were Rs. 70,000 a tonne now. With no control over the prices, construction contractors in the government sector were hit hard. They also feared further increase in prices. The contractors needed 30 % hike in project costs to meet the high raw material prices. The Association had written to the officials and Ministries concerned in the Central government. It had approached the court and taken up the issue with the Competition Commission of India.  Ban on export The MSME industries had been asking for ban on export of steel. But there was no effort from the government to control the prices. If there was no measure from the government, the Association planned to announce indefinite strike. Only if the steel and cement prices reduced would it be possible for the contractors to complete on time the projects taken through e-tenders, the press release added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/contractors-in-coimbatore-go-on-strike-for-a-day/article33563427.ece

13 January 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||CM shielding Pollachi case accused: MLA||The AIADMK government and the Chief Minister who handled the Home Department were shielding the Pollachi sexual assault case accused, DMK Coimbatore east unit in-charge and Singanallur MLA N. Karthik alleged at a press meet here on Tuesday. The CBI taking two years to arrest three accused, the proximity of those arrested so far to the ruling party leaders, and the police revealing the name of a victim to dissuade others from lodging complaints were proof enough that the Chief Minister was shielding the accused, Mr. Karthik alleged. Mr. Karthik accused Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani and Assembly Deputy Speaker Pollachi V. Jayaraman of pressurising the Chief Minister to go slow on the case because they were close to the accused and wanted to protect them. And, the proof for the government going slow on the investigation was that there was no action yet against the accused’s political godfathers. However hard it might try, the AIADMK would not be able to close the case. Once the DMK returned to power, it would ensure that it brought all the accused and their political masters to justice, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-shielding-pollachi-case-accused-mla/article33563305.ece

Addressing a gathering at Sivagiri here on Tuesday, as part of his ‘Re-imagining Thamizh Nadu’ campaign, he said that many felt that MNM will take 10 years to grow. Pointing out the party’s growth in short tenure, he said that it was possible only because of the support of the people and asked them to bring change by casting their vote to the party. He said that his party is not striving to bring people above the poverty line, but above the prosperity line. He reiterated that the party’s promise of offering wages for homemakers was criticised by many, but cited that the Supreme Court had in a case pointed out fixing of notional income for homemakers. “We have policies for each sector,” he said and added that revolution had begun and only if women think, change will happen. The leader said that the pathetic condition of the government schools across the State is worrying and questioned how they could deny the basic needs. “People’s party need to come to power and the party is the people’s tool”, he said. Earlier addressing the party cadres at a private marriage hall in the city, he said that honesty is the party’s strength and asked people not to cast their vote on the basis of caste.

Led by its president S. Durairaj, members said that land was identified for constructing houses for 82 differently abled persons at Nalla Goundan Palayam at Chithode on December 21, 2018. However, the land is full of boulders and without levelling the ground, houses cannot be constructed. In November, members staged a protest after which Erode Revenue Divisional Officer Saibudeen assured to level the ground. But, the earthmover inducted into service removed the rocks and the land was not levelled. Hence, urging the administration to level the ground, members began their protest on Monday. Tahsildar Parimala Devi and Town DSP Raju held talks with them during which members said that until the work is undertaken, they will not withdraw their protest. They said that 2.1 acre was identified for them which are full of boulders and levelling would take at least Rs. 15 lakh. They said that they are unable to bear the cost and wanted the administration to carry out the work. Members said that they are ready to accept alternative land, but they wanted all the 82 members to be allotted site at the same place. They opposed any move to classify them based on caste and allocation of land.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/differently-abled-persons-demand-levelling-of-ground-allotted-to-them/article33563414.ece

13 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||‘Lack of food and water in Tejas Express’||A section of passengers travelling in Tejas Express complained of lack of drinking water, beverages and snacks. The train was re-introduced on January 10 after cancellation due to poor patronage. The passengers said that they were put to lot of sufferings on the first train that left Chennai Egmore on Sunday. “The train leaves Chennai Egmore early in the morning at 6 a.m. People have neither time to cook breakfast or buy food or water bottle as even hotels are not opened at that time,” complained J. Jerin (34) of Nagercoil. Onboard railway employees claimed that distribution of food and water had been stopped after a passenger made a complaint. Mr. Jerin said many passengers who failed to bring water had to suffer till the train reached Tiruchi. The worst part is that the train arrived Tiruchi station with a delay of an hour. Some of the passengers had pleaded with the travelling ticket examiners to make the halt for additional five minutes so that everyone could buy water and food. He complained that even toilets were not maintained properly in the premium train. “But, claiming that the train was already running behind the schedule, the TTE refused,” said another passenger, A. Ramachandran (62) of Theni. Besides, elderly people found it difficult to buy food and water as the train stops for a brief while at the station. Mr. Ramachandran said that the online ticket itself had made a mention that no food would be supplied with the ticket. However, water bottle, coffee/tea, snacks and food packets that were sold in the train earlier were missing on Sunday. However, a railway official here said that Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation that operates the train could not make arrangement for the water and food immediately as operation of the train was announced all of a sudden. Onboard sale of water bottles, coffee, snacks and noodles resumed on Tuesday, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lack-of-water-and-food-in-tejas-express/article33563397.ece
13 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Sugarcane sale up for Pongal||Simmakkal and Yanaikkal areas here were awash with sugarcane bundles on Tuesday as farmers and commission agents were selling them to customers ahead of Pongal festival. There are two types of sugarcanes known as ‘Aalakarumbu’ and ‘Senkarumbu,’ of which the former is sent to sugar mills and the latter is grown only for Pongal festival. Vendors were selling bundles of 15 sugarcanes each for Rs. 400, Rs. 350, Rs. 250 and Rs. 200, depending on the length and quality. Despite the higher arrival of sugarcane following copious rainfall, the profits are lower this year, say farmers and commission agents. B.J. Kamaraj, a commission agent, said that purchase cost from farmers, cane cutting, transport and labour cost will total up to around Rs. 300 for each bundle. “But we earn only marginal profits from retail sales. The spending capacity of the people have come down owing to the financial distress caused by COVID-19 pandemic,” he said. The mild drizzles witnessed in the city on Tuesday also affected the sale of sugarcanes, said Vazha Karuppu, a retailer. “There has been a steady drop in the household consumption of sugarcane nowadays. People buy a few sugarcanes just for the sake of the Pongal festival,” he added. Despite having good yields of sugarcanes this year, the farmers were not able to earn higher margins, said R. Murugan, a farmer from Chinna Mangulam. Farmers say that the government procured a bundle of sugarcane for around Rs. 225 to be sold at the ration shops as part of the Pongal gift hamper. “But this is lower as compared to last year when the government procured a bundle for Rs. 280. The farmers also sold sugarcanes for lower rates to the government as they were anxious that they might not be able to sell their produce after the Pongal festival,” added Mr. Murugan. Middlemen procure a sugarcane bundle for only around Rs. 230 from farmers, said P. Thangapandi, a farmer. “It is high time that the farmers started selling sugarcanes directly to customers without middlemen,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sugarcane-sale-up-for-pongal/article33563634.ece
13 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Ongoing works, rain, festival shopping choke city roads||With road works under Smart Cities project under way, choking of arterial roads from Albert Victor Bridge up to Vilakkuthoon Junction, and Mahal Road up to Nelpettai has become a routine feature in the last few weeks. Incessant rain and Pongal shopping crowd have added to the chaos that almost brought the traffic to a grinding halt on these roads. Piling up of vehicles near Nelpettai sometimes results in logjam even on the A.V. Bridge which has a cascading effect at Goripalayam junction too. Even evicting encroachments by onion shops and lorry parcel service offices on East Marret Street could not bring any relief as most of the vehicles from northern parts of the city took these roads for festival shopping. “Despite banning of trucks, the number of small cargo vehicles that keep shifting goods from outside the city into the core city areas added to the confusion,” a police constable said. Ever since underground drainage work started on East Veli Street, vehicles have been moving on a snail’s pace, said J. Kaleel Raghuman, who runs a shop on the street. “Even ambulances were caught in the chocking traffic and to ease the traffic, we have made a minor change at the Munichalai signal on a trial basis,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police, K. Sugumaran. Vehicles coming from Munichalai Road are not allowed to take a right turn on East Veli Street to go to Nelpettai. Instead, they are allowed to take left turn towards St. Mary’s Church. While smaller vehicles like two-wheelers and autorickshaws take the bylanes connecting East Veli Street with East Marret Street, bigger vehicles have to go up to Vilakkuthoon junction to take East Marret Street. This arrangement also allows vehicles coming from East Marret Street to the junction through Swami Sannithi Street to take free left turn without any hassle. Waiting time on the signal has significantly reduced and as a result piling of vehicles up to Anna Statue junction has come down. “We will post a few more traffic police personnel in this area to effectively regulate the traffic during the festival season,” Mr Sugumaran said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ongoing-works-rain-festival-shopping-choke-city-roads/article33563632.ece

13 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Mini clinics to play important role in vaccination drive: govt.||The Tamil Nadu government has informed the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court that any delay in employing essential staff for the Amma Mini Clinics at this stage would cause irreparable damage to the capacity of the State to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. It would also affect efforts to fight other seasonal diseases and derail the plan to implement the massive vaccination exercise. The government said the employment of essential staff was only temporary and contractual in nature. In a counter-affidavit submitted to the court, the Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine T.S. Selvavinayagam said work relating to the COVID-19 pandemic had to be done without disturbing or compromising the regular health programmes. This cannot be done if regular staff are diverted to fever clinics and mini clinics. The counter was filed in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) petition that challenged the method adopted to recruit the staff. The COVID-19 pandemic had brought back focus on the augmentation of healthcare infrastructure and human resources, with a view towards the promotion of disease prevention, preparedness and response plans to prevent outbreaks, the counter said. It was submitted that a 24-member high-level committee set up by the State government to recommend measures on the post COVID-19 revival of the economy, headed by Dr. C. Rangarajan, had recommended the augmentation of the healthcare infrastructure by setting up such clinics. A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi granted time to the petitioner to peruse the counter and file a response. The PIL petition was filed by Madurai advocate G.V. Vairam Santhosh. The case was adjourned till next week. The State agreed to maintain status quo on the recruitment till then.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mini-clinics-to-play-important-role-in-vaccination-drive-govt/article33563257.ece

13 January 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||HC modifies punishment imposed on teacher||Dismissing the writ petition filed by a Physical Education Teacher who had challenged the departmental punishment imposed on him on certain charges, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court observed that a teacher had to be a role model to students. Justice M. Dhandapani observed that the teacher was the backbone of the next generation and unless he or she inculcated good habits in the minds of the students, who looked upon their teacher as their role model, the foundation of the country would be shaken. The court was hearing the writ petition filed by S. Andrew Chandra Kumar of Thoothukudi in 2010. In 2008, the petitioner had left the school premises in the forenoon session on a full working Saturday to attend to his wife who was sick. He said that he left the leave application on the table of the headmaster as he was not available at that time. However, the department authorities said that he had entered the room of the headmaster and signed the attendance register forcibly. It was submitted that the petitioner was granted an opportunity to present his side of the case, but failed to appear before the inquiry committee. Hence the committee decided to punish him by dismissing him from service.  Three charges The judge took note of the fact that three charges were levelled against the teacher: failing to give necessary physical education coaching to the students, forcibly signing the attendance register and using filthy language against the headmaster, which was confirmed by other teachers. The court observed that the misconduct of the petitioner in the presence of other staff members could not be brushed aside without inflicting punishment on him. Therefore, the finding of the inquiry officer did not call for any interference. However, taking into account the fact that the health condition of his wife would have been on the mind of the petitioner on that particular day making him react in such a manner, the court modified the punishment to that of compulsory retirement with pension benefits.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-modifies-punishment-imposed-on-teacher/article33563805.ece

The scam, which rocked the medical aspirants in 2019, led to the arrest of as many as 17 persons including students, their parents and brokers. Based on the confessions, the CB-CID police went in search of Rasheed. A native of Kerala, he was reportedly in Bangalore. On January 7, he appeared before the Judicial Magistrate Court here and surrendered. Following this, the police took him into custody for interrogation. He is understood to have revealed some information about money transactions to get admissions in private medical colleges in Bangalore. The private colleges gave seats to aspirants based on the NEET score and to get higher marks in the NEET, Rasheed and his accomplices from Bihar and Gujarat had played a role in impersonation at examination centres. A top officer said that the network of brokers, who had access to the private medical colleges, forced some parents to pay a huge sum apart from capitation fee to get admission. He said that Rasheed had engaged some people to impersonate students in the NEET examination for which he had collected money through his accomplices. The CB-CID police produced the accused before the JM Panneerselvam, who had directed him to be in judicial custody till January 21, the police said and added that they may investigate more suspects in the case based on inputs from Rasheed. An anonymous e-mail received by the authorities in Theni Government Medical College in 2019 unravelled the mystery behind the impersonation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/key-suspect-in-neet-case-back-in-prison/article33563386.ece
13 January 2021||THENI,TAMIL NADU||Vehicle movement hit on Bodimettu||Widespread drizzle in many parts of the district resulted in boulders falling on the Bodimettu ghat section. Therefore, vehicle movement had to be suspended for about an hour on Tuesday. Officials said that though the continuous drizzle did not help in getting water for tanks, it damaged the soil on the ghat section. Bodimettu is a prime intersection for Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Everyday, hundreds of workers and tourists go through the ghat section to reach Kerala. The ghat section, which is 26 km, has 17 hairpin bends. Boulders had fallen at the 4th hairpin bend, which forced officials to suspend traffic at Bodimettu and Mundal check posts. Vehicle movement resumed after clearing the boulders. Traffic got choked for over an hour as vehicles had piled up on both sides.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/vehicle-movement-hit-on-bodimettu/article33563403.ece
13 January 2021||THOOTHUKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Crops cultivated on 1.72 lakh hectare||With all systemised water bodies brimming and rain-fed tanks have water for about 60% of their maximum capacity, crops have been cultivated on 1.72 lakh hectare in the district. According to S.I. Mohideen, Joint Director of Agriculture, the district had received 444.42 mm of rainfall till December last against its annual average rainfall of 429.44 mm. Consequently, all rain-fed water bodies have 60% of water on an average. At the same time, Papanasam and Manimuthar Dams are overflowing to trigger flood in the Tamirabharani, which is feeding all system tanks in the district. In other words, all system and rain-fed tanks of the district are full. Buoyed by this favourable trend, farmers have cultivated paddy on 14,000 ha so far even as preparations are on to cultivate foodgrain on another 5,000 ha to surpass this year’s target of 17,000 ha. Since northern parts of the district, known for rain-fed crops, experienced good rainfall since November, greengram and blackgram have been raised on 78,500 hectares and maize, corn, pearl millet etc. cultivated on 69,000 hectares. Of this, corn has been cultivated on 47,000 hectares which stood at 33,000 ha last year. Moreover, cotton (5,300 hectare) and oilseeds (3,000 hectares) have been cultivated on more area this year. “The district, which would see farming operations on 1.37 lakh hectares on an average every year, has exceeded it to touch 1,72,442 hectares this year. More importantly, farmers have insured their crops cultivated on 1,40,248 hectares,” Mr. Mohideen said. When asked about the crop damage caused by cyclone Burevi-induced rain, he said 516 farmers had lost crops cultivated on 510 hectares and compensation to the tune of Rs. 55.51 lakh had been sought from the government. In the first phase, Rs. 44.67 lakh had been released to be given to 466 farmers. The Joint Director said the district had adequate quantity of chemical fertilizers including urea (4,500 tonnes), DAP (1,750 tonnes), potash (1,300 tonnes) and complex (2,700 tonnes) at various points considering the increased area of cultivation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/crops-cultivated-on-172-lakh-hectare/article33563796.ece
13 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Crop damage to be assessed in Tiruchi||Factoring in recurring instances of crop lodging and water-logging during the monsoon, the State government has asked the revenue and agriculture departments to enumerate the damaged crop in the district. According to official sources, a total of 1,13,000 acres has been brought under paddy cultivation during the samba season. The area coverage is 9,000 acres more than the last season. Besides delta areas such as Musiri, Thottiam, Pullambadi, Lalgudi, Andhanallur and Manikandam, the crop has been raised in several rainfed areas too. The standing crop has reached an advanced stage of harvest. In normal circumstances, harvest should have already begun in some parts of the district. It gradually picks up momentum by the end of the month and early February, according to officials. Until the last week of December and early January, the conditions looked ideal for a bumper harvest. But the ongoing torrential rain, which is unusual in January, has dampened the spirits of farmers. The district has received intermittent rain for the last one week, but has proved to be counterproductive to farmers looking forward to a bumper harvest. While water-logging has been reported in several areas, crop lodging has been noticed in hundreds of acres. Areas brought under paddy cultivation in the first phase have borne the brunt of the unseasonal rainfall. The paddy crop raised in hundreds of acres in Inampuliyur, Pothavur, Posampatti, Perugamani, Sirugamani, Pettavaithalai, Pulivalam Kodiyalam and other areas have been affected. “It is painful to see the well-grown paddy crop lodged on the field due to continuous rain at an unwanted juncture. We are highly disappointed and farmers have taken it to the notice of officials and demanded suitable compensation,” says Ayilai Sivasurian, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam. Confirming the reports of crop lodging in several areas, a senior official of the Agriculture Department says the State government has sought a report on crop damage. Based on it, field officials of agriculture and revenue departments have begun enumeration of damage to the standing crop. According to a preliminary report, more than 1,000 hectares of paddy crop raised in Andhanallur, Manikandam and Manapparai blocks have been damaged. Since more rainy days have been predicted, the affected areas may go up. A clear picture will emerge in a week, the official adds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/crop-damage-to-be-assessed-in-tiruchi/article33563374.ece

During an informal chat with the reporters after visiting both dams on Tuesday, Collector Vishnu said inflow of water into both dams had increased phenomenally after catchment areas of these reservoirs experienced precipitation of 85 mm and 70 mm respectively on Tuesday (till 4 p.m.). As the dams had reached the maximum capacity, 21,000 cusecs of water was released from the Manimuthar Dam and 8,000 cusecs of water was discharged from Papanasam Dam taking the total quantum of discharge into the Tamirabharani from the two dams to 29,000 cusecs. Hence, people living close to the Tamirabharani watercourse and 87 low-lying areas had been alerted. Eight families from Aladiyoor near Ambasamudram had been moved to the nearest relief camp even as 187 more relief camps had been kept ready to receive the relocated population. “I appeal to the public not to go near the river until further orders as the Tamirabharani is in spate. I appeal to the youth not to risk their lives by taking selfies while standing dangerously close to the menacingly flowing river,” said Mr. Vishnu, who asked the police and revenue officials to constantly monitor the situation round the clock. The Collector said drinking water, toilets, food, medical team, generators etc. had been kept ready in relief camps. With the rain continuing in catchment areas of the dams and discharge of water from the dams in the Tamirabharani increasing, two teams of NDRF personnel are to be deployed in the district. “Each team will have 25 well-trained NDRF personnel,” Mr. Vishnu said. Sub-Collector, Cheranmahadevi, Pratik Tayal, District Revenue Officer A. Perumal and Public Works Department engineers accompanied the Collector. Superintendent of Police N. Manivannan has urged the public not to go near the river. Taking bath in the river would be very dangerous as the river is swelling, he said in a statement. However, residents from villages close to the dam went to the reservoir to have a close look of the discharge of water through the seven surplus shutters and take photographs.

13 January 2021||Afshan Yasmeen,KARNATAKA||6.47 lakh doses of Covishield arrive in Bengaluru||Karnataka on Tuesday finally received its first consignment of the COVID-19 vaccine. The consignment comprising 54 boxes of 6.47 lakh doses of Covishield vaccine reached Bengaluru airport at 11.40 a.m. The vaccine consignment weighing 1,728 kg was received by a team of officials comprising Bengaluru Urban District Health Officer (DHO) Srinivas Golur and other Health Department officials in charge of the State vaccine store in Bengaluru. The consignment was then transported to the State vaccine store on the premises of the Health Department’s old building near Anand Rao Circle in a vaccine van. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said although the State was expecting 11.34 lakh doses in the first consignment, it is getting 7.95 lakh doses as of now. “The remaining will arrive soon and we will inform the people of the State about it shortly,” he said. He said the vaccine will be first administered to the registered 6.6 lakh healthcare workers apart from other frontline workers from the Police, Revenue, RDPR Departments and municipal corporations. Each dose of vaccine is 0.5 ml and each vial contains 10 doses of vaccines. The second dose should be given 28 days after the first dose and immunogenicity will develop after 45 days, he said adding that ‘Not for sale’ is being written on the vial to avoid misuse. Arundathi Chandrashekar, Mission Director, National Health Mission, said the process of distributing the vaccine to districts will begin from Wednesday. “We had worked out the allocation assuming that the State will receive 11.34 lakh doses as told earlier. However, as the number of doses sent in the first consignment is lesser, the allocation is being reworked for equitable distribution to the districts. We will start distribution from Wednesday,” she added.  Storage, transportation Although vaccines usually have a shelf life of six months to one year, the current stock has a shelf life of four and half months till May end. Vaccines were transported in 54 boxes to the State vaccine store in a van. State Deputy Director (Immunisation) Rajani Nageshrao  told The Hindu that there is no need to transport the stocks in refrigerated trucks as each box has frozen ice packs that maintain optimal temperature for long. “At the store we have kept the vaccines in the walk-in-cooler where a temperature of +2 to +8°C will be maintained throughout. While distributing,we again pack with fresh frozen ice packs and send it to districts,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/647-lakh-doses-of-covishield-reach-city/article33563218.ece

13 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||On eve of expansion, Ministers lobby for change in portfolios||Several senior Ministers in the Cabinet, unhappy with the portfolios allotted to them, have reportedly pushed for a reshuffle of portfolios even as the Cabinet is set to be expanded on Wednesday, sources in the BJP said. With all vacancies in the Cabinet being filled on Wednesday, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is expected to allocate most of the ministries that he presently holds and reallocate portfolios that a few Ministers hold as additional charge. Party sources said that at least four senior Ministers, meanwhile, have asked for a change in their portfolios too. Revenue Minister R. Ashok, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar, and Agriculture Minister B.C. Patil are keen on a change in their portfolios, the sources said. While these Ministers have also indicated their preference, the Chief Minister is yet to take a call, his close aides said. ‘Impossible to allot’ “Any change in their portfolios will lead to change in others too, which needs to be carefully considered so as to not create discontent in the Cabinet. Some of the portfolios some Ministers have sought are almost impossible to be allotted to them without causing heartburn to others,” a strategist close to the Chief Minister said. However, he also added that the Chief Minister was unhappy with the performance of a few Ministers in the Cabinet and was thinking of a reshuffle, but whether it would involve senior Ministers is the moot question. Mr. Yediyurappa is likely to allocate Energy, Small Scale Industries, Kannada and Culture, Youth Empowerment and Sports, and Backward Classes Welfare portfolios. He is expected to retain Finance, Planning, Information and Public Relations, and Bengaluru Development portfolios, sources said. Minor Irrigation, Medical Education, Sugar and Sericulture departments, presently held as additional charge by Ministers will likely be redistributed. With H. Nagesh most likely to be dropped, Excise Department will also likely be allotted to one of the new inductees. Case of Jolle Women and Child Welfare Minister Shashikala Jolle, who was reportedly initially on the list of Ministers to be dropped from the Cabinet, lobbied hard with the party high command and is likely to escape the axe, sources in the party said. Ms. Jolle, speaking to media persons in Raichur, said this was not the first time rumours had spread that she would be dropped. “I will abide by the party’s decision,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/on-eve-of-expansion-ministers-lobby-for-change-in-portfolios/article33563229.ece
13 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||TKM lifts two-month lockout||Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) on Tuesday withdrew the lockout that was imposed over two months ago at its Bidadi manufacturing plants, after the TKM Employees’ Union went on a strike protesting the suspension of one of the factory workers and alleged unilateral increase of workload. “TKM Management has decided to withdraw the lockout, but without compromising discipline and productivity. This will be in the interest of both team members and their families as well as the company. This has come to effect on Tuesday in both our plants at Bidadi,” said the company in a statement. Responding to the development, TKM Employees’ Union said the unilateral increase of the workload was the main cause of the workmen’s protest. The union’s various attempts to invite management’s attention to this issue were turned futile. The union has taken exception to the company asking for signing an undertaking. “Asking employees to sign undertaking even after lifting the lockout is nothing but a continuation of illegal lockout,” stated Gangadhar M.N., Joint secretary, TKM Employees’ Union. The union has demanded settlement of workload norms, payment of full wages during the lockout period, and withdrawal of suspension of workers and cancellation of charge sheets/punishment orders. However, the auto major said employees returning to work would sign a simple undertaking for good conduct and work discipline. The suspension pending enquiry of 66 unionised employees for alleged serious misconducts would continue and domestic enquiries would be conducted adhering to the principles of natural justice, said the company. “We believe that our success depends upon the dedication of our team members. Furthermore, as a people-centric company, TKM has been at the forefront of providing a conducive working environment including competitive compensation packages, as well as unique welfare measures over and above the statutory requirements, to improve the quality of life of its workforce,” TKM said. In light of the continued “illegal strike” by TKM Employees’ Union, the management was forced to announce the lockout on November 9 and a second lockout on November 23, 2020. The company had partially resumed production a fortnight ago with over 1,200 team members who were willing to sign an undertaking, the company further said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/tkm-lifts-two-month-lockout/article33563237.ece
13 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||1.47 lakh vaccine doses to reach Belagavi today||As many as 1.47 lakh doses of Covishield will reach Belagavi on Wednesday. The stock will be re-distributed to eight districts in North Karnataka from Belagavi. State Deputy Director (Immunisation) Rajani Nageshrao, who is monitoring the entire process, told The Hindu that the allocation to the districts is being worked out in such a way that the present stock of 7.95 lakh doses is enough to vaccinate a set of healthcare workers in two doses. “This is to ensure that those who get the first dose also get the second dose after 28 days with the existing stock,” she said. Stating that the Centre is working out the allocations, she said: “The Centre is taking into consideration 50% of the 6.3 lakh healthcare workers who had registered till January 8 and working out the allocations for districts. This is to ensure that even if there is some wastage, the existing stock is enough for two doses of the shortlisted 50% registered healthcare workers till January 8.” Sources said this was because it was still not clear when the next stocks would arrive. “Although the State has been told that we will get a total of 13.92 lakh doses, we do not know when the remaining stocks will arrive. In such a scenario, if the entire stock is used only for the first dose there can be uncertainty about the second dose,” sources said. “As the vaccination is a two-dose process in a gap of 28 days, the entire exercise can go waste if the second dose is not given on time,” sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/147-lakh-vaccine-doses-to-reach-belagavi-today/article33563222.ece
13 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC imposes cost of Rs. 1 lakh on litigant for scandalising court||The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday imposed a cost of Rs. 1 lakh on a petitioner for scandalising the court by alleging that all the judges from Karnataka can be influenced by a former Chief Justice of India while seeking a case of civil dispute related to a mutt to be heard by a non-Karnataka judge. Though the court termed the petition as a “classic example of scandalising the court as defined in the Contempt of Courts Act,” it refrained from initiating criminal contempt of court proceedings by citing the Supreme Court’s 1978 judgement, in the case of S. Mulgaonker Vs Unknown, for showing ‘majestic liberalism’ in such instances, and also due to withdrawal of the petition. A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum, passed the order on a petition, filed by 72-year-old V. Gururaj, a resident of Hanumanthnagar in Bengaluru. The petitioner also said that another petition, in which he is one of the respondent, related to a civil dispute over Vyasaraja Mutt (Sosale), should also be heard by the Chief Justice or any other judge not having practised before the High Court of Karnataka . The Bench, while masking the name of the former CJI in the order, pointed out that the petitioner had said that “all the judges from Karnataka have one or the other way owe allegiance and veneration for the undisputed intellect of the former CJI” besides making allegation against the former CJI that he would “interfere” in the litigation. ‘Human beings’ “We must remind the petitioner that the judges are human beings and they are bound to have respect for honourable and persons of intellect. Merely because they respect a such persons, it does not mean that they are guided by them. Unfortunately, the petitioner cast aspersion on the former CJI while on the other hand describing him as a person of undisputed intellect,” the Bench also observed. ‘Unfortunate’ “It is unfortunate that the petitioner has gone to the extent of alleging that all the judges from Karnataka would be influenced by the former CJI, who was also a judge of the High Court,” the Bench said, while holding that averments made in the petition amounts to scandalising of the High Court and tend to lower the authority, interfere with administration of justice, and interference in the judicial proceedings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-imposes-cost-of-rs-1-lakh-on-litigant-for-scandalising-court/article33563241.ece
13 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||NIA chargesheets Bengaluru ophthalmologist in ISKP case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday filed a chargesheet against Abdur Rehman, an ophthalmologist from Basavanagudi,who was arrested in August 2020 in connection with a case related to the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP). It was filed in the Special NIA Court, New Delhi, under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. The 28-year-old doctor who worked at M.S. Ramaiah Medical College has been charged with furthering the ideology and activities of proscribed terrorist organisation ISIS/ISKP in connivance with five other accused in the case for committing subversive and anti-national activities in India. He allegedly used his medical knowledge of ophthalmic lasers and other devices to develop applications for the medical and military requirements of ISIS. “He achieved significant progress towards developing a medical application for treatment of ISIS terrorists and also developed Laser guided Anti-Tank Missile application for controlling the trajectory of the missiles to enhance their effectiveness for furthering the cause of ISIS,” said the NIA in a release. ISKP is the Islamic State’s Central Asian province which covers Iran, Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The group is accused of carrying out several attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Against five others Earlier, NIA officials had filed chargesheets against five people in connection with the case: Jahanzaib Sami and Hina Bashir Beigh from Srinagar, Abdullah Basith from Hyderabad and Sadiya Anwar Shaikh and Nabeel Siddick Khatri, both residents of Pune. In March 2020, the Delhi Police Special Cell arrested Jahanzaib and his wife Hina for alleged links with the ISKP. According to the officials, the couple was planning subversive activities in India. The NIA, which took over the probe, arrested a journalism student Sadiya Anwar Sheikh, 20, and Nabeel Siddick Khatri, both residents of Pune, who were also allegedly part of the ISKP module in July 2020. According to the NIA, they were part of the conspiracy to carry out ‘subversive activities in the garb of anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests’. Their arrests led the police to Abdur Rahman who was arrested in Bengaluru. “During the investigation it was revealed that Rahman while studying at Bangalore Medical College, got radicalised, after listening to the online lectures of hard line Islamic preachers including Anwar Awlaki,” said the NIA. ‘Travelled to Syria’ Subsequently, he came into contact with other radicalised youth and travelled to Syria in December, 2013, where he allegedly participated in various terrorist activities of ISIS. After his return to India, he continued to remain associated with the ideology of ISIS, said the NIA in a media release. Further investigation is on in the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/nia-chargesheets-bengaluru-ophthalmologist-in-iskp-case/article33563206.ece

The Election Commission had taken their service at polling booths during the elections. They were involved in the election duty to avoid the spread of COVID-19 infection. They did thermal scanning of the voters, apart from keeping the place sanitised. As per the guidelines from the State Election Commission, they were entitled to Rs. 700 honorarium per day. More than 1,000 ASHA workers in rural areas were involved. D. Nagalakshmi, State secretary of ASHA Workers Association, told The Hindu that the taluk health officers had issued orders assigning the job to ASHA workers on the polling day. “Our workers stood in front of the polling booth throughout the day. However, they have not been paid honorarium so far”, she said. The association met Deputy Commissioner R. Girish in Hassan recently and submitted a memorandum demanding the early release of the dues. “In some districts, the district administration had paid the amount soon after the elections. However, in Chitradurga and Koppal districts, the administration paid the amount after our intervention. The officers in Hassan have not yet released it”, said Ms. Nagalakshmi. The Deputy Commissioner had assured the committee he would look into the issue and resolve it within a week. “ASHA workers get an honorarium of Rs. 4,000 per month.

13 January 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||South Western Railway revives defunct water supply system||Making good use of the restrictions during lockdown and post-lockdown period, the engineering section of the South Western Railway (SWR) has revived a defunct water supply system and in the process, has ensured savings of Rs. 9 lakh per month in water bills. An engineering team of the zone executed the revival plan and reinstated the water supply system from Devaragudihal Lake which comprised relaying a total of 700 metres of pipeline along the 16-km-long stretch from lake to the city and other civil works. Devaragudihal Lake, one of the largest water bodies in the Indian Railways with a capacity of 1,935 million litres, was constructed in 1907 by Southern Mahratta Railway to meet water requirements of the Railways in Hubballi. The lake, surrounded by hills on three sides and a 599-metre-long bund, is spread over 382 acres of land, with surface water area of 278 acres. It is 12 km away from the city. The lake, which supplied water to the railway colonies and pit lines in Hubballi for a century, dried up in 2010 disrupting water supply. As the system lay defunct for almost a decade, the pipeline and other infrastructure had been damaged. According to a press release, following a direction from General Manager of South Western Railway A.K. Singh and under the initiative of Additional General Manager P.K. Mishra, the team of railway officials, led by Divisional Railway Manager, Hubballi, Arvind Malkhede and Principal Chief Engineer of South Western Railway Vipul Kumar and others, executed the project worth Rs. 2.5 crore to revive the water supply system by restoring all engineering and electric works. Landscaping of the lake was also taken up under the project. Under the revival project, cleaning of intake well, stone pitching, lake cabin room renovation, mass tree plantations and a selfie point, structural and aesthetic renovation of the pumphouse at Ahobalapur, repair of two reservoirs on the hilltop, relaying of damaged pipeline and other works were taken up and completed. The team which executed the project comprised P. Mahender, Vamshi K. Budarapu, W.P. Ashtikar, Pawan Gadewad, J.V. Ramana Rao, Ishan Shrivastava, H.T. Prakash, Sanjay Kumar, among others. Mr. A.K. Singh along with other officials, including P.K. Mishra, Roopa Srinivasan, Mr. Arvind Malkhede, R.K. Sharma and Mr. Vipul Kumar, inaugurated various completed works recently. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. A.K. Singh said that following heavy rain in the last two years, the lake was full to the brim now and with the revival of the old water supply system, railway colonies, station and pitlines would get adequate water. While the revival would reduce water bills, it also reiterated the commitment of Indian Railways towards protecting environment, he said. According to the authorities, the revival of the old system would mean supply of 10 to 12 lakh litres of water to railway colonies and workshop. South Western Railway will be able to save Rs. 9 lakh per month in water bills and it will also increase the water supply frequency to the colonies and to the pitlines. As a safety measure, apart from two solar panels and two UPS with backup power supply of six hours, 4 MP IP-based CCTV cameras have been installed at 10 locations along the water supply route, the release said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/south-western-railway-revives-defunct-water-supply-system/article33563441.ece
13 January 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Make the best use of time, students told||Senior Civil Judge and Member Secretary of Dharwad District Legal Services Authority Rajesh S. Chinnannavar has urged students to make the best use of time available at their disposal to pursue their dreams and fulfil them. He was speaking at the National Youth Day programme at G.K. Law College in Hubballi where he also inaugurated the College Union and Gymkhana activities and an orientation programme on Tuesday. Elaborating on the significance of time, he narrated a story on how the present day youth were wasting it on things which would hardly contribute towards fulfilling their dreams. “Mobile phone is like a double-edged sword. It is useful and at the same time, it will spoil your future if used wrongly,” he said. Listing out the fundamental duties of citizens, Mr. Chinnannavar said that while everyone was aware of their fundamental rights and fought for them, it was equally important that they performed their fundamental duties too. Quoting from Swami Vivekananda, he told students to think, give work to their minds and extend their mental horizons by developing the habit of reading. Presiding over the function, college principal Sharada Patil told students to read extensively and train their brains to think out of the box and emerge as good leaders or good legal professionals who would contribute towards finding solutions to societal problems.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/make-the-best-use-of-time-students-told/article33563448.ece

AITUC district president Prabhudev Yelasanghi said that the Centre had ended 44 labour laws and made four codes against labour thereby curbing their rights. The trade union also criticised the new farm laws and the Electricity Bill 2020 enacted by the BJP-led government. The new farm laws had triggered widespread protest across India as they failed to ensure protection of the farming sector from exploitation and fair prices for their produce. Mr. Yelasanghi demanded that the State government should immediately clear the dues of KSRTC employees and revise their salaries and provide other benefits. He also demanded minimum wages for anganwadi workers and mid-day meal workers. The trade union also stressed that employees in both the organised and unorganised sectors should get minimum wages.

13 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Focus on making city policemen more people friendly||Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar on Tuesday said that improving the traffic scenario, curbing crimes, including drug abuse, and making the police more people friendly were on the agenda before him. Speaking to reporters at a Meet the Press programme organised by Mangaluru Press Club and Dakshina Kannada Union of Working Journalists here, Mr. Kumar said that he understands Mangaluru as a sensitive area insofar as law and order is concerned. During the 10 days of his working here, he has been making efforts to understand the commissionerate, the people and the issues involved. Having initiated area commanding operation to drive away those creating nuisance in poorly-lit public places late in the night; holding a parade of accused in drug-peddling cases and those in drug abuse cases and beach round-up operations, Mr. Kumar said, he received kudos as well as criticism for these actions. The primary intention was to make the city safe for all residents, mainly the vulnerable section — elders, children and women. For traditional reasons, people would be out late in the night to attend programmes or ceremonies and it is the duty of the police to ensure their safety, he said. At the same time, people too need to treat policemen with love and affection as the latter sacrificed their personal life while discharging their duty. The Police Commissioner said that he has taken serious note on the recent attacks on policemen. He added that stringent action would be taken against those attacking police personnel. Responding to a question regarding traffic police personnel flagging off vehicles to check records in the middle of the road, Mr. Kumar said that he was considering the Bengaluru and Mysuru models where police use enforcement and hand-held cameras to book cases, for introduction in Mangaluru too. This, however, would take time, he said and promised that there won’t be any harassment to road users. He would also go through the vehicle towing system prevalent in the commisionerate limits, Mr. Kumar said.  Media clinic Earlier, Mr. Kumar relaunched the media health clinic wherein specialist doctors would be available for media persons once a month at the Patrika Bhavan. The association had initiated the idea in April 2019 in collaboration with A.J. Institute of Medical Sciences and Research. The facility was extended to the general public in November 2019. However, the clinic was closed due to the COVID-19 situation. Association president Srinivas Nayak Indaje, secretary Ibrahim Adkasthala, office-bearer Jitendra Kundeshwara and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/focus-on-making-city-policemen-more-people-friendly/article33563649.ece

Suresh Kumar to conduct examinations as they were gearing up for the final assessment with the reopening of the schools and colleges since the beginning of this month. The response came when the Minister went around various schools and PU colleges in Chamarajnagar district to interact with the students on the government’s decision and to elicit their opinions/suggestions. Mr Kumar got satisfying replies from the students to many of his questions with regard to their studies and classes. When Mr. Kumar, who is also the Minister in charge of Chamarajanagar district, asked the students whether they wanted to remain in their homes for some more time, they replied: “It would have been nice if the schools had begun much before. We are happy that the schools have finally commenced.” The Minister said the government was keen to reopen the schools but the COVID-19 pandemic “did not let us to take the call” since the students’ health was also equally important besides their academics. When Mr. Kumar asked the SSLC students how it would be if they are passed without an examination, the students replied in the negative and said they are determined to write the examination. In reply to another question on why should the examination be conducted, the students said, “Without the examination, it would be like seeing the meritorious and non-meritorious students on the same benchmark. Without the examination, the talent of the students will not be known. We should know our aptitude and where we stand. It will be satisfying if the marks are awarded based on our performance in the examination.” Applause The students clapped when the Minister said the SSLC examination had been scheduled in June and wished them all success along with an advice to them to study well and bring happiness to their parents by doing well in the exams. “We resolved to conduct the examination last year for SSLC and PU amidst the pandemic though other States desisted from conducting the examination. This was to ensure that the students get marks as per their ability,” he said. “Please conduct the examination sir. We shall be ready by the time the examination approaches,” the students replied. Talents The Minister said last year’s SSLC examination brought forth many exemplary talents with many children coming from economically poorer sections scoring well. “We got to know their talents because we conducted the examination. Without the exam, we wouldn’t have known these hidden talents. Do well in your studies and come out with the flying colours,” he advised. During interaction with PU II students, the students thanked the Minister for downsizing the syllabus as there was shortage of time to make preparations for the examination. In reply to another question from the Minister on whether they were scared of coming to the college with the pandemic still not over yet, the students said they have taken all precautions such as wearing masks and maintaining social distance. “All these measures have instilled confidence in us and we are happily coming to the college.

13 January 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Subway to access Mysuru zoo||Mysuru will soon be getting yet another subway as the work linking the zoo and its parking lot, passing through the busy Shalivahana Road, is expected to be ready by February end. The zoo has proposed to throw open the new facility for visitors from March if all works get over by next month. The project was taken up at a cost of Rs. 1.79 crore and nearly 80 per cent of the work had been done, according to the zoo management. The scheduled completion of the project that began last year was six months. The road was closed for some time to facilitate the work and alternative routes had been notified for vehicle movement. “We have told the contractor to complete the work by next month and we have been assured that the facility will be ready for the launch in March. Accordingly, we would be making preparations. The subway will be a big relief as it eases congestion on the busy road that runs in front of the zoo,” said zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni. The project would have been done by now but the pandemic delayed the work. Hundreds of tourist vehicles are parked at the parking lot located in front of the zoo and the tourists rush to the zoo crossing the busy road, causing congestion. Children and elderly citizens often used to find it difficult to cross the road. Shalivahana Road connects Mysore Race Club, Siddhartha Layout, Ittigegud, Lalitha Mahal Road, T. Narsipur Road, Alanahalli, Chamundi Hills and localities on the foothills. Mr. Kulkarni said the subway had become inevitable for visitors’ safety and also for smooth traffic management. The road used to get choked during Dasara and holidays. The zoo attracts footfalls of over 10,000-15,000 a day. However, the numbers have dropped now over the pandemic but the management is confident of getting back the numbers once the situation eases. The police deploy two to three traffic constables daily to ease congestion and for the safety of zoo visitors crossing the road.  There are also plans to introduce battery-operated buggies between the parking lot and the zoo and vice versa for ferrying the visitors once the subway was commissioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/subway-to-access-mysuru-zoo/article33563683.ece
13 January 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||DC leaves House panel meeting||Mysuru Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri on Tuesday sought permission from the chair and excused herself from a meeting of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly’s Committee on Papers Laid on the Table, stating that the agenda of the day did not pertain to her office. The committee chairman and K.R.Nagar MLA, S.R. Mahesh of the Janata Dal (Secular), who had a standoff with her in the past, did not mince words when he said that she could leave if she had other important work following which the Deputy Commissioner left the hall. The incident is perceived in some quarters as a continuation of the simmering discontent between a section of the MLAs and the IAS officer which has come to the fore frequently in the last few months. Tuesday’s incident took place soon after the official introduced herself. Ms.Sindhuri, who was seated in the front row and was wearing a mask, sought permission to leave as none of the issues listed pertained to her office. But Mr. Mahesh asked her to remove the mask and speak as “you are not clearly audible’’. But Ms. Sindhuri retorted saying it was not advisable to remove the mask and refused to do so. Then she repeated her plea following which Mr. Mahesh said that the committee was in the city on behalf of the Speaker and she, as the Deputy Commissioner of a district, was informed as per the protocol. There are senior members in the committee and the district administration should have received them, he said. “But we are happy you are here though it is not compulsory’’, Mr. Mahesh added. However, on prompting by other members on the dais, Mr. Mahesh told Ms. Sindhuri that she could leave as there were no issues listed on the agenda which required the presence of the DC, following which she left the hall. The proceedings, captured on the camera, is being projected as continuation of the MLAs’ lack of rapport with the official. However, other officials who attended the meeting said there was nothing wrong in what transpired during the day as the DC’s presence was not required and the committee members had permitted her to leave.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/dc-leaves-house-panel-meeting/article33563686.ece

The MLA had then complained of “breach of protocol’ and threatened to move a privilege motion against her. More recently an interaction programme to redress public grievances launched by Ms. Sindhuri, was cancelled as the MLAs were not invited. K.R. Nagar MLA.S.R.

13 January 2021||YADGIR,KARNATAKA||Congress is a sinking ship as it has lost credibility, says Jagadish Shettar||Terming the Congress as a sinking ship, Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar has said that the Congress will never come back again to power even in the next 20 years as that party has lost credibility. He was addressing a gathering at a Janasevak programme in Yadgir on Tuesday after felicitating members of gram panchayats elected newly with the support of the BJP. Mr. Shettar said that candidates supported by the Congress had failed to win the trust of voters in the recently concluded gram panchayat elections. “We won 45,246 seats against 86,183 constituencies in 5,670 gram panchayats which faced elections in the State. The winning ratio was more than 50 %. The Congress and the Janata Dal(S) failed to reach the voters. The verdict in the gram panchayat elections is really encouraging for the party in facing the coming taluk and zilla panchayat elections successfully,” he added. The Minister said that infighting between Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah and KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar over becoming the next Chief Minister of the State has reached a different level. The dream of these two leaders will remain just a dream as the BJP won’t let them come to power, he added. “After the gram panchayat election results, the Congress leaders have become haggard. Thus, they are touring the State with their ‘Sankalpa Yatre’. No such yatras will help them win the trust of the people again. The party itself has lost its base at the national level. Its senior leaders have started opposing Rahul Gandhi becoming the Congress president. Thus, the party will never come to power again,” he said. Appreciating the joint efforts of BJP leaders Malikayya Guttedar, Umesh Jadhav, Baburao Chinchansur and others in defeating Congress leader M. Mallikarjun Kharge in the last Lok Sabha elections in Kalaburagi, Mr. Shettar appealed to the newly elected gram panchayat members to follow the party leaders and work hard in the joint efforts to bring success to the BJP in all elections. He said that all initiatives have been taken to bring new industries to Yadgir district. Minister for Animal Husbandry and district in-charge Prabhu Chavan, Mr. Umesh Jadhav [MP], Minister for Women and Child Development Shashikala Jolle, Mr. Baburao Chinchansur [Chairman of Nija Sharana Ambigara Chowdayya Development Corporation], Narasimha Naik, MLA and Chairman of Urban Water Supply and Sanitisation Board, and MLA Venkatareddy Mudnal also spoke.

13 January 2021||YADGIR,KARNATAKA||I am only opposing RSS, not Kurubas’ demand for ST tag: Siddaramaiah||Siddaramaiah, Leader of the Opposition, clarified that he was not opposing the Kurubas’ demand for Schedule Tribe tag but only opposing the RSS for its hand in the struggle, and warned against the agenda of trying to divide the Kurubas. He was addressing Halumath SamkritikaVaibhava, an annual cultural and traditional programme of Kurubas, organised by the Kanaka Guru Peetha at Tinthini Bridge near Veeragota village in Deodurga taluk of Raichur district on Tuesday. Mr. Siddaramiah, who targeted the RSS and K.S. Eshwarappa, Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, said, “The RSS’ hands are behind the present agitations led by Mr. Eshwarappa. Thus, I am keeping myself away. But, the efforts of the RSS to divide Kurubas by politicizing the issue will not succeed.” He asked why was Mr. Eshwrappa not putting pressure on the Union and State governments for the ST tag but holding agitations instead? Is he fighting against his own government or Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, he questioned. He said that he had sent a recommendation to the Centre recommending to include Kurubas in four districts in Hyderabad Karnataka region in the ST tag when he was CM, but it was not considered yet. “I also wrote the committee of Anthropomorphic Survey and Study to conduct the detailed survey on the status of Kurubas in the remaining districts and submit the report. Mr. Eshwarappa should ask the committee about the survey. Until the survey is complete, it is impossible to include Kurubas into ST,” he said. “I will not change my stand no matter whether I am in power or not and will always adhere to my conscience. But, few people have been misleading others about me for not taking part of the agitations,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/i-am-only-opposing-rss-not-kurubas-demand-for-st-tag-siddaramaiah/article33563452.ece

Yediyurappa directed officials and members to focus on mobilising resources, apart from taking up citizen-centric development works. The Chief Minister, who also holds the Bengaluru Development portfolio, chaired a review meeting of the works taken up by the zilla panchayat on Tuesday. During the meeting, he lambasted the zilla panchayat officials on learning that of the annual revenue of Rs. 578.58 crore, as much as Rs. 317.48 crore went towards payment of salaries and Rs. 257.34 crore towards transportation. The State government has sanctioned Rs. 90 crore, including Rs. 25 crore for drinking water schemes and the rest for road and drain development, which will soon be released, he said. L.K. Atheeq, principal secretary, Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, said that the 93 gram panchayats coming under Bengaluru Urban limits collected Rs. 180 crore as property tax annually. He admitted that many properties are not under the tax net. “By using technology to bring more properties under the tax net, another Rs. 500 crore may be collected,” he said. He said that GPS mapping and survey had been taken up and would be completed in another two months. Officials suspended Mr. Yediyurappa directed the officials concerned to suspend two officials, one from the Slum Board and another from the Ambedkar Development Corporation, for not turning up at the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/officials-get-an-earful-from-chief-minister/article33563213.ece

PSI Soumya and Head Constable Jayaprakash Reddy, attached to Baiyappanahalli police station, were investigating a theft case when they zeroed in on a man from Chamarajapet who reportedly bought a stolen mobile phone from the thief. The police summoned the accused to the station and demanded Rs. 2 lakh from him to avoid arrest. Unable to pay the money, his family approached the ACB and filed a complaint. A team of officials trapped Reddy while he was accepting an advance amount of Rs. 1 lakh on Monday. When Reddy realised that it was a trap, he handed over the cash to Constable Kumar. In a bid to escape from the ACB sleuths, Kumar ran but slipped. He suffered a fracture on his leg. After retrieving the money, ACB officials recorded Kumar’s statement.

13 January 2021||ALAPPUZHA,KERALA||Groyne fields to come up soon||The construction of groyne fields ( pulimuttu ) in Kattoor will begin soon. In a bid to tackle sea erosion, 34 groynes with a total length of 3.16 km will be constructed from Omanapuzha to Vazhakoottam pozhi. Officials said the groynes would be built using tetrapods weighing five and two tonnes. “The work on constructing groynes was commenced in October. The construction of tetrapods is making good progress,” said an official on Tuesday. Mararikulam grama panchayat president Sangeetha said the construction of groynes would benefit 160 families directly and more than 600 families indirectly. Besides, around 20 hectares of land could be protected from sea erosion. Groynes would be constructed 100 metres apart. Each groyne would have a length of 40 metres from shore into the sea and 20 metres width. A total of 23,000 tetrapods of two tonnes and 4,000 tetrapods of five tonnes would be used for the purpose. The project would be completed in one-and-a-half years at a cost of Rs. 49.9 crore. Besides, a sea wall would be constructed at Kattoor, officials said. The State government last year decided to establish 114 groyne fields at five places off the Alappuzha coast at a cost of Rs. 184 crore under the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). The other four groyne fields would be built in Haripad, Ambalappuzha and Alappuzha Assembly constituencies. The structures would directly benefit 625 families and between 1,500 and 2,000 families indirectly. Earlier, granite boulders were used for constructing groynes. Granite shortage However, an acute shortage of granite in the State forced the authorities to look for alternatives. “Small granite stones will be laid and tetrapods will be placed above it. This way, we can minimise the use of granite in the construction of groynes,” the official added. Sea erosion had become severe in coastal areas of Alappuzha district, especially during the monsoon season. Several houses were destroyed after high swell waves pounded areas in Ambalapuzha, Kattoor, Arattupuzha, Kakkazhom and other places in recent years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/groyne-fields-to-come-up-soon/article33563614.ece

The tiger, aged about seven years, had triggered panic over the past one week in the area after it attacked a forest range officer and killed three domestic animals. “When the animal was located near a deserted house inside a plantation near Seetha Mount around 2.30 p.m., after a search of three days, a team of veterinarians led by A. Ajesh, assistant forest veterinary surgeon, fired the first tranquillizer dart,” D.K. Vinod Kumar, Chief Conservator of Forest (Northern Circle), Kannur, said.  The animal hid inside a bush around 15 minutes after being hit by the dart. When it came out, the team’s attempt to fire the second dose went in vain as the animal charged at the officials, he said. Binesh, 30, a forest watcher sustained injuries after the tiger attacked him. He was admitted to a hospital at Meppadi with injuries to his right hand.  Unsuitable terrain “The terrain was not suitable to fire darts and the ferocious nature of the animal prevented us from firing the second dose,” Mr. Vinod Kumar said. “We pursued the big cat five times but it entered the BTR after crossing the Kabani around 6 p.m.,” he added. “It is suspected that the animal had deep neck injuries after it had got stuck in a wire snare. The snare was intact on its neck and it could have forced the animal to enter human habitations in search of easy prey,” he said. “We have briefed the Field Director of the BTR and asked him to adopt steps to rescue it,” Mr. Vinod Kumar added. As many as 20 camera traps were set up on the banks of the river to monitor its movements and a forest team deployed for patrolling, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tiger-now-moves-to-bandipur/article33563581.ece

The LDF secured a majority in Development, Welfare, Health and Town Planning committees, while the UDF has a majority in the Works Standing Committee. Five seats remain vacant totally in three standing committees and these will be filled in another election to be held on January 18. The UDF currently has five seats in the Finance committee, while the LDF has four, leaving a single vacant seat that the LDF is hopeful of bagging next week, to give both sides an equal tally in the crucial committee.  BJP’s chance In a first for the corporation, the BJP could possibly gain a majority in a standing committee. Four out of five BJP councillors secured seats in the Tax Appeals Standing Committee. BJP councillor Sudha Dileep Kumar, who secured a seat in the Education and Sports Standing Committee, resigned immediately and will now contest for a vacant position in the Tax Appeals Committee, which could give the BJP five out of nine seats in a single committee. K.P. Antony, who had contested independently, and abstained from voting in the elections to the posts of Mayor and Deputy Mayor, chose to support the LDF in the elections to the standing committees. In a painstaking process that lasted seven hours, the election was held in two phases – the first was for a single seat reserved for women in each of the standing committees, while the second phase was for the remaining general seats. While the Finance Standing Committee has ten members, the others have nine each. BJP councillors voted for UDF-backed candidates in the election to the seats reserved for women in six standing committees, giving the UDF candidates a total of 37 votes in each case. Invalid vote In four of these cases, where the LDF and UDF candidates polled 37 votes each, the returning officer drew lots, picking the names of three LDF candidates and one UDF candidate. In the case of the Standing Committee for Works, a vote by an LDF councillor was considered invalid, giving the UDF a majority in that committee. Ms. Sudha Dileep Kumar said that the party’s councillors only voted for UDF-backed ‘Independent’ candidates. “We did not vote for any of the Congress candidates, but for those who contested independently or were backed by other constituents of the UDF,” she said. The candidates they voted for were Laila Das of the Indian Union Muslim League, Kajal Salim who contested independently but was backed by the Welfare Party, Sunitha Dixon of the Revolutionary Socialist Party, Suja Lonappan of the Kerala Congress (Joseph) and Mary Calesta Prakasan who contested independently.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-votes-udf-to-majority-in-works-standing-committee/article33563563.ece

13 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Unauthorised biomedical waste disposal under scanner||The State Pollution Control Board will soon prepare a list of healthcare facilities in Ernakulam functioning without its authorisation for treatment and disposal of biomedical waste. A preliminary assessment revealed that more than 50% of the healthcare institutions lacked the authorisation to manage the biomedical waste generated on a daily basis. The board had recently submitted the status report on the healthcare facilities in Idukki not having the authorisation from the board for treatment and disposal of biomedical waste. The list was submitted before the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal in the case related to the lack of implementation of the Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 in the State. The tribunal had asked the board to file a detailed report on the action taken against the violators. Senior board officials said that all institutions under the Directorate of Animal Husbandry; Directorate of Health Services; Director, Ayurveda Medical Education; Directorate of Medical Education; Indian System of Medicine; Directorate of Homoeopathy; State Mission Director, National Health Mission; Directorate of Panchayats; Director, Urban Local Body and private medical facilities, including clinics, would have to obtain consent from the board for treatment and disposal of biomedical waste. The majority of the generators here were found to be depending on the Indian Medical Association Goes Ecofriendly (IMAGE) facility in Palakkad for disposal of the biomedical waste. Some of the healthcare facilities have incinerators. However, the spike in the quantity of the biomedical waste generated in the wake of the pandemic had exposed the gaps in the actual quantity of waste generated and the the waste treated through the IMAGE facility. The report filed before the NGT pointed out that the total quantity of biomedical waste generated was 42,932 kg daily. The total biomedical waste treated and disposed of through the IMAGE facility was 36,853 kg per day while the corresponding figure of waste treated in captive treatment facilities was 3,557 kg daily. The board has stressed the need for improved cooperation by local bodies in ensuring the implementation of the biomedical management rules by not giving/renewing licence to the healthcare facilities which do not have the board’s authorisation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/unauthorised-biomedical-waste-disposal-under-scanner/article33563553.ece
13 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Alarm at 5th accident at Elamkulam curve||The death of a youth after his two-wheeler rammed a metro pillar on the accident-prone curve at Elamkulam on SA Road on Sunday midnight has sent alarm bells ringing, especially so since it is the fifth accident death to be reported here during the past six months. It was less than a month ago that two others - a two wheeler rider and the driver of an autorickshaw, lost their lives in separate accidents at the curve. Official sources said that Sunday’s accident could have been averted if the KMRL had installed reflectors, warning boards and a rumble-strip to forewarn motorists of the steep curve on the smooth road. “The metro agency failed to act on the direction issued by the police and MVD to ready the three safety precautions, following fatal accidents in December,” they said. The KMRL is SA Road’s custodian, although it is owned by Kochi Corporation, since the metro agency had resurfaced the corridor after the metro viaduct was built about a year ago and is bound to do repair and other works during the defect-liability period, it is learnt. A senior traffic police official said that the police had made repeated pleas to the metro agency to augment safety measures at the stretch, which is one of the most dangerous blind spots in the city. Most of the accidents occurred after two wheelers rammed the metro pillar 824 and 825 at the curve since they are not clearly visible at night. Installing reflectors and cats-eye studs on the road will give motorists an idea of the impending curve. The Enforcement RTO (Ernakulam) Shaji Madhavan said that one ought to inspect CCTV footage in the locality and take the statement of the injured co-rider of Sunday’s accident victim to know how the spot had become highly accident-prone. The head of the Automobile Engineering Department of SCMS, Kochi, Manoj Kumar B. said that many government agencies did not care for the safety of road users. “Accident black spots like the Kariyad curve on the National Highway must be identified and measures taken to prevent loss of life and property...Accountability must be fixed, while motorists - especially youth, must drive safely,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/alarm-at-5th-accident-at-elamkulam-curve/article33563557.ece

Teachers said that they ask the primary contacts of the infected to opt for home quarantine. “We also ask them to take a test before rejoining,” they said. Hostel wardens have been asked to step up surveillance against the violation of safety protocol. Students are not allowed to crowd in any spot or share their food. Special care has to be taken in the common dining room and other areas inside the hostel. They have been told not to venture out of their rooms, if a student or teacher of their class tests positive. B. Prakash Kumar, Registrar of Mahatma Gandhi University, said that managements have been told to strictly adhere to safety guidelines and protocol prescribed by the Health Department. Inform authorities They have to inform the health authorities if a student or teacher/non-teaching staff is reported positive. Steps should be taken to disinfect classrooms and carry out necessary follow-up steps, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/colleges-step-up-vigil-against-pandemic/article33563555.ece
13 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Post COVID-19 recovery, some struggle with mental health issues||For some patients, recovering from COVID-19 has led to a slew of mental health issues ranging from sleeplessness to anxiety and panic attacks. The District Mental Health Programme has been fielding calls from patients in the post-COVID phase, after they have tested negative. In one instance, a son called the helpline on behalf of his father who was experiencing behavioural issues including heightened anger and memory loss after testing negative for the virus. In another case, counselling was provided to a nine-year-old who, after testing positive for the virus, relived some of the trauma of a heart surgery the child had undergone two years ago, leading to panic attacks. Dr. Soumya Raj, who is the nodal officer for the District Mental Health Programme, said that some people, after their recovery, have also sought help in dealing with habits like nicotine or tobacco use. “It could be out of an urge to kick bad habits after a bout of COVID,” she said. A smoker who had fought off the virus, approached a post-COVID clinic with breathlessness, but his vitals were stable, she says. He had been experiencing panic attacks out of fear that a relapsed smoking habit after quitting, might have worsened his condition. People who require mental health support are referred to counsellors at the mental health programme from post-COVID clinics that are functioning at PHCs. If reassurance does not suffice, they are referred to a psychiatrist and consultation is provided via telemedicine. If their troubles have not subsided, a visit to the General Hospital is mandated. When people began to report sleep deprivation while recovering from the infection, the State decided to actively reach out to those who have tested negative from November onwards, said Dr. Kiran P.S., nodal officer for the State Mental Health Programme. The counsellors now call people who were infected around 20 days after they have tested positive to check for psychological problems, he says. Sleep disturbance, even without anxiety, is seen as a common problem, Dr. Kiran says. Depression and anxiety are also reported. Dr. Soumya says that most problems have subsided with reassurance or small doses of medication. People in the 40 to 60 age group have reported the most issues, she says. “People in this age group have also dealt with psychosocial problems including financial ones on being hospitalised.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/post-covid-19-recovery-some-struggle-with-mental-health-issues/article33563565.ece

The petition was filed by the Christian Association and Alliance for Social Action on Tuesday. According to the petitioner, Jesna Maria James had been missing since March 22, 2018 from her home at Vechoochira. She was a second year BCom student at Kanjirappally St. Dominic College. The High Court had dismissed a habeas corpus petition in 2018 seeking to trace her and produce her saying that the court could not act on mere apprehensions or vague allegations. The petitioner pointed out that the investigation officer of the Crime Branch K.G. Simon, who retired on December 31, 2020, had stated in his interactions with the media that Jesna was traced and would be brought back to the State after the lockdown. It was, therefore, clear that she had been traced by the police.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/hc-moved-to-produce-missing-girl/article33563543.ece
13 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Plea for title deeds for small industries||The Kerala State Small Industries Association (KSSIA) has demanded that the State government help small units by granting them title deeds to the land they had hire-purchased from the government on industrial estates and in the industrial development areas as per an April, 1969, order from the government. Title deeds should be distributed to those industrial unit owners who had fully met their hire-purchase conditions and made full payment to the government, said M. Khalid, president of the association, on Tuesday. The condition in 1969 was that once the entrepreneur paid the full amount as the cost of the land, title deeds would be granted, but those who had met their obligations had not got the papers for land, he added. Lack of proper papers for land is a problem for an industrial unit owner because it becomes difficult to access bank credit or transfer the unit to another entrepreneur or even to add a new partner for a project. There are 17 industrial estates under the State Industries Development Corporation as well as 37 mini industrial estates and seven industrial estates. These include the Palluruthy industrial estate and the Vazhakulam (Mudickal) industrial estates in Ernakulam district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/kssia-demands-grant-of-title-deeds-to-small-industries/article33563558.ece
13 January 2021||KOLLAM,KERALA||Scaled-down revelries, but Vijay fans unperturbed||Usually it is the day their frenzy crosses all limits with merry drummers, firecrackers and colossal cut-outs. But this year lakhs of Vijay fans attached to thousands of units across the State will be settling for something simpler – a moderate bash as Master opens in cinema halls on Wednesday. Instead of the regular euphoria, there will be toned-down festivities since the COVID-19 protocol is in place. Also, the first film to get a theatrical release in Kerala after a long break due to the pandemic, the Vijay-starrer was expected to hit the screens in April 2020. “We couldn’t plan anything except a bike rally and it’s for the first time we are skipping the release-related revelries. But we also don't want to spread the virus,” says M. Manoj of Palakkad Thalapathis. No midnight show Though many fans are not happy about breaking their first-day-first-show ritual, they have no options due to limited shows and reduced seating capacity. For many fans the biggest disappointment is the absence of early morning shows that usually start at midnight. “Now the first show begins at 9 a.m. and the film is not screening in some malls. If it was nearly 10 screens last year, this year we have only two screens in Kollam city. We have more than 10,000 registered members in Kollam city alone and many of us will have to wait,” says Murali Ganesh of Kollam Nanbans, one of the largest units in Kerala. The unit had installed a 175-ft cut-out of their idol prior to the release of Sarkar , but this time the members are going for a scaled-down celebration. While the fan associations ensured tickets for their members on the release day during previous years, it will be an impossible task now. “Usually we buy 2,000 tickets for the first show in Kollam city, but this year it has come down to around 500 due to unavailability of seats.” Lack of time Vijay fans also complain that they hardly got any time to prepare for the release as the decision to open cinema theatres came at the eleventh hour. “Some of us were planning to go to Tamil Nadu, but then decided to stay back,” a fan said. They are also worried over the possibility of technical glitches that may affect the screening. “Some theatres have reported issues with their sound and projector system. Even late in the evening the checking is going on and we are worried,” says Sreeraj from the Thiruvananthapurm unit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/scaled-down-revelries-but-vijay-fans-unperturbed/article33563570.ece

The project, which was originally slated to be complete last year, has moved at a snail’s pace owing to the delay in completing the land acquisition proceedings. Though the works have gathered momentum, the State government is required to complete the acquisition of land for constructing the approach roads to the station here. Dispute settling Meanwhile, a meeting will be convened at the railway station here on Wednesday with regard to settling the dispute over land acquisition at Pakkil so as to expedite the track-doubling work. Southern Railway is slated to complete the construction of 10 overbridges along the 17-km stretch between Ettumanur and Chingavanam.

Mr. Pottekkad said he was thrown into a state of utter poverty during the COVID-induced lockdown. The artisan, in his 60s, said he used to spent most days in a year at various exhibitions. “I had put all my savings into preparing for exhibitions that were to be held closer to Vishu last year. But that never happened and I struggled to get past the financial crisis,” he said, adding that the financial aid provided by the State government did not help him much. “We were waiting for the government to give the nod for exhibitions. This has become like home for us,” said Shobha Mohandas, an artisan selling bamboo artefacts and herbs. The Rajasthan Grameen Mela features a variety of handloom and handicraft products such as stone jewellery, block print dress materials, traditional bedsheets, Bengal handworked sarees, black metal craft, Meenakari jewellery, Channapatna toys, and Rajasthani footwear. The exhibition is being held in compliance with the COVID-19 protocol. The response to the mela was cold when it began on January 5. But people have started dropping in and the weekends are the busiest. “I used to visit every exhibition here for almost a decade before the lockdown.

He would sing at the Srimookambika temple, Kolllur, Karnataka. This year, he could not. Or rather, the coronavirus did not let him: he was stuck at Dallas, United States. So he had to offer his musical tribute to the goddess online. However, his 81st birthday was made special by his fellow singers from Malayalam cinema. Twenty-eight of them came together and sang a song written and composed as a tribute to him. It was the idea of singer Shwetha Mohan. She tuned the song written by B.K. Harinarayanan, got it rendered by playback singers and made it into a video.  Gandharva gaayakaa. .. proved a hit on YouTube where it attracted more than 1 lakh views within two days. For someone who had never composed before, Shwetha has done a fine job. “I have already paid musical tributes to my favourite singers like Lata Mangeshkar, P. Susheela and S.P. Balasubrahmanyam by rendering their songs,” says Shwetha. “I felt I should compose a sing especially for Yesudas, my icon.” She wanted to bring in as many as singers a possible. They were happy to oblige, so the song got a stellar line-up that included K.S. Chithra, Sujatha, Unni Menon, M.G. Sreekumar, G. Venugopal, Srinivas, Biju Narayanan, Madhu Balakrishnan, Vijay Yesudas, Devanand, Gayatri Asokan, Jyotsna, Rimi Tomy, and Harishankar. “Everyone got their portion of the song recorded and shot on video and sent it to me,” says Shwetha. “It felt nice to listening to my composition in different voices.” Her mother Sujatha helped her choose the line for each singer. “Shwetha worked hard on it,” she says. “Her talent for composing came as a surprise to me.” Veteran singer and actor Krishnachandran too is impressed. “The tune is perfect for the song,” he says. “I was happy that I could be part of such a fine effort.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/yesudas-gets-a-birthday-melody-from-fellow-singers/article33563523.ece

13 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Congress-IUML likely to take pragmatic stand on seat sharing||The Congress–Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) combine is expected to take a more pragmatic approach towards seat-sharing in Kozhikode and Kannur districts in the forthcoming Assembly elections. The exit of the Jose faction of the Kerala Congress(M) and the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) has given the combine elbow room to streamline their electoral outlines in the districts that are crucial for the Assembly polls. Together, Kannur and Kozhikode districts have 24 Assembly segments. Of this, the United Democratic Front (UDF) won three seats in Kannur and two in Kozhikode. While the Congress has two legislators from Kannur, it has none in Kozhikode. Some Congress leaders have pointed out that seat allocation and wrong choice of candidates resulted in the defeat of their candidates. They believe that the Assembly elections are a golden opportunity to rework their poll strategy. Better generalship Better political floor generalship this time could yield rich dividends for both the parties with the Congress taking over some of the seats now vacated by the LJD — Koothuparamba, Mattannur, Vadakara, and Elathur. The Kerala Congress (M) had contested from the Perambra segment, and the UDF had lost all those seats in 2016. The Congress leaders say that their nominees contesting in the hill regions of both districts stand a good chance to capture the lost seats. In Balussery The decision of the party to swap the Balussery seat with the IUML for Kunnamangalam segment in Kozhikode had backfired. The same was the case with the Thiruvambady segment which has been a traditional seat of the Congress party. Previously, Cyriac John and P.P. George of the Congress had represented the segment. In the 2016 polls, had the Congress contested from Thiruvambady, the seat would have been won by the UDF, say the leaders.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/congress-iuml-likely-to-take-pragmatic-stand-on-seat-sharing/article33563527.ece

Anil RadhakrishnanTHIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Will skywalk find a place in Budget?||Will the 3.8-km covered skywalk aimed at hassle-free movement of pedestrians and connecting the Secretariat, KSRTC bus terminal and Central railway station make it to the Budget as the alignment has been finalised? With the 4 to 5-m wide skywalk being listed as a priority project by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in his interactions, votaries of the project hope that Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac will help decongest the arterial Mahatma Gandhi (MG) road by allocating funds for the project. Arkitechno Consultants (India) Private Limited, which had won the bid floated by the Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP) for the Public Works Department (PWD) for preparing the DPR, is busy preparing the pre-feasibility report. For the consultant, the challenge is to complete the DPR before the April 2021 deadline. KIIFB funding The government is looking for making available funds from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) and if skywalk figures in the Budget, it will make it easy for getting KIIFB funds, it has been pointed out. Escalators, lifts and facilities for easy movement of pedestrians to the other side of the carriageway is being planned. The skywalk will be below the proposed Light Metro line. Rough estimates have put the cost of the skywalk at Rs. 250 to Rs. 300 crore for the 3.8 km. A steering committee headed by Chief Secretary Vishwas Mehta that met on January 8 cleared the alignment from three routes, including those through Government Press Road and Housing Board Junction. The skywalk, to come up in steel pillars, is to begin from near the Sports Council after the YMCA gate of the Secretariat, passing along the MG Road and ending near the East Fort bus stand near the Gandhi Park. The skywalk along the side of the Central stadium is to provide access to the Secretariat and its Annexes. A connection has been proposed to the two terminals of the Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station starting from Overbridge and Pazhavangadi Junction via the Central Theatre road. From near the Government Treasury, it will move along Pulimoodu, Ayurveda College Junction to Overbridge. The project also aims at integration with railway station, KSRTC’s Thampanoor and East Fort bus terminals, various bus stands, light- metro route and two of its stations, Smart City’s underpass, utility shifting and multi-level car parking project, and various other city landscaping projects.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/will-skywalk-find-a-place-in-budget/article33563771.ece

The Centre has officially communicated the same to the State, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said in a statement here on Tuesday. The regional vaccine stores at Thiruvananthapuram will receive 1,34,000 doses, Ernakulam 1,80,000 doses, and Kozhikode 1,19,500 doses. The Centre has informed that 1,100 doses of the vaccine from the consignment reaching Kozhikode will have to be distributed in Mahe.  Special arrangements Ms. Shylaja said special arrangements had been made so that the vaccine was taken to the regional stores maintaining cold chain conditions. Senior health officials said the vaccine would be administrated amongst health-care workers in such a manner that a second dose of the vaccine to be delivered after 28 days of the first dose would be reserved first. This meant that only half as many number of health-care workers as vaccine doses available would be vaccinated, at least until more vaccine consignments reached the State. COVID-19 vaccination is being launched nationwide on January 16 and the vaccination will take place at 133 sites across the State. A total of 3,62,870 health workers have registered for vaccination in the first phase. They include 1,70,259 health-care workers in the public sector and 1,92,611 in the private sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/states-first-vaccine-lot-soon/article33563574.ece

He said that the board of the Kerala Rapid Transit Corporation (KRTL) formally approved in October 2020 the revised detailed project reports (DPR) for the Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode light metro projects that were prepared in view of the Centre’s new metro rail policy.  The Chief Minister said the delay had not resulted in a cost escalation so far. According to the revised DPRs, the project costs for the Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode light metro projects had been estimated as Rs. 4,673 crore and Rs. 2,773 crore respectively. These included Central tax and land acquisition costs, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/light-metro-flyover-work-soon/article33563777.ece

Alex, 20, a second-year undergraduate student at a college in Kattakada, was arrested for allegedly murdering his neighbour Jaan Beevi of Vandithadam. Helper’s grandson The accused is the grandson of a woman who used to work as a helper in the deceased woman’s house. She was found dead on January 8 by the helper. The incident had taken place when Jaan Beevi’s son, an Under Secretary in Secretariat, was not at home. According to the police, Alex committed the murder during a burglary bid. He gained entry to the house by unlocking the door from outside using a stick. While Jaan Beevi tried to thwart him, the accused tied her hands behind her back and stole two gold bangles and a necklace. He allegedly banged her head on a wall repeatedly before fleeing. Deep injuries While no wounds were found, the post-mortem examination revealed deep injuries in the head. This prompted the police to explore the possibility of murder. The presence of ear-rings on the woman’s body and the fact that other valuables in the house remained intact led the police to suspect that the crime had not been committed by a habitual offender. Alex was questioned on Monday, but was let off. However, contradicting statements by him prompted the police to take him in custody. On Tuesday, he reportedly confessed to the crime. He also took the police to a tutorial college nearby where he hid the stolen valuables.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/college-student-arrested-on-murder-charge/article33563773.ece

The LDF placed seven members on most of the committees, which have a maximum of 12 or 13 members each, ensuring a majority. Elections were held to the eight standing committees of the Corporation. With the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also fielding the maximum number of councillors in the finance, tax appeal and education standing committees, separate elections had to be held for each of these committees. No election was required on the works standing committee as only the required number of members submitted nominations from various parties. The BJP was hoping to take advantage of a reported rift within the LDF, as the Communist Party of India (CPI) was unhappy with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)]’s plan to take the chairperson’s post in most standing committees. The CPI only has the finance committee, which Deputy Mayor P.K. Raju will head. The tax appeals standing committee chairperson post is to be shared between the four smaller LDF constituent parties. Seven councillors each However, with all LDF councillors as well as the three Independents voting for the front’s candidates, the Opposition did not stand a chance to gain control on most committees. The LDF has placed seven councillors each on all standing committees, except finance and development committee. With the finance committee, already in its kitty, the LDF did not have to place more members for a majority here. Even after a long-winded election process, which went on till 6 p.m., four committees were left needing two more members each. For this, elections will be held on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ldf-likely-to-gain-control-of-panels/article33563774.ece

Kerala had become the graveyard of Public Service Commission rank lists and the “PSC had become party service commission”, said Shafi Parambil of the Congress, seeking leave for an adjournment motion. Plight of youth Citing the suicide of Anu, a postgraduate of Karakonam who failed to get posting even after securing 77th rank on the PSC list for civil excise officer as the rank list was cancelled, he said the government was doing great injustice to the youth through these manoeuvres. Mr. Parambil said backdoor appointments and steps to regularise staff were taking place in the Kerala Institute of Local Administration, Keltron, and Tourism, Culture, and Labour Departments overruling the objections of the Finance and Law Departments. Denying the charges, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the Opposition was trying to create a smokescreen on appointments. “All appointments are made in a transparent manner without corruption. Steps are being taken to report vacancies as soon as possible to the PSC. Only compassionate and sports quota appointments are made from outside. All on the list will not get postings. Those who fail to make it will be dejected,” he said. As many as 1,51,513 people had been either given appointment or issued advisory memo through the PSC, he said. Steps had been taken to work out special rules and report vacancies to the PSC. Making permanent those who had worked in an institution for decades was a “humanitarian consideration”, he said. This had been done only for those who had completed 10 years of service and where the PSC rank list was not live. Following the Chief Minister’s reply, Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan denied leave for the motion. Before staging a walkout in protest against the chair’s decision, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said appointments had been made in 42 loss-making public sector undertakings, besides government and semi-government institutions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/govt-ignoring-psc-rank-lists-oppn/article33563567.ece

Peethambaran. Transport Minister A. K. Saseendran of the NCP was present. Mr. Peethambaran later told reporters that the talks were constructive and would continue. NCP divided The NCP was reportedly divided over whether it should handover the Pala Assembly seat to Jose K. Mani of the Kerala Congress(M). The incumbent MLA, Mani. C. Kappan, of the NCP had wrested the constituency from the KC(M) in a hard-fought byelection in 2019. He was reportedly adamant against giving up the seat to his erstwhile political foe. However, Mr. Saseendran, who heads a powerful faction in the NCP, had reportedly argued for accommodating the KC(M) in the Left Democratic Front (LDF). He reportedly felt that the LDF stood a better chance of winning the Assembly polls. The NCP could ill-afford to be seen as a destabilising factor in the LDF. Moreover, the United Democratic Front (UDF), with its arguably poor showing in local body polls, was on the “decline”. Kappan’s stance Sources close to Mr. Kappan said the MLA reportedly felt that a faction in the NCP was using the KC(M) as a pretext to undercut his possible chance of becoming a Minister were he to hold on to the Pala seat and the LDF came to power again. Moreover, party workers close to Mr. Kappan felt that the KC(M) had not brought rich dividends for the LDF, as claimed by Mr. Jose. Pawar petitioned Mr. Kappan has reportedly petitioned NCP president Sharad Pawar against the move to take Pala away from the NCP. Mr. Pawar was expected to arrive in Kerala on Saturday to parley with NCP and LDF leaders. Mr. Jose was reportedly intense about contesting from Pala, a constituency held for decades by his late father K.M. Mani. He has made no open claim for the constituency except stating that “Pala” was an inalienable “feeling” for KC(M) workers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cm-intervenes-in-ncp-rift-over-pala/article33563575.ece

Informing the Assembly of the CBI’s decision, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday said the move was dubious, considering the “lame excuses” that the agency had made. The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) had registered a case in 2006 into the corruption allegations in setting up an effluent treatment plant at the TTP. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, and former Industries Minister V.K. Ebrahim Kunju were those named in the graft case. While stating its inability to take over the investigation, the Ministry of Personnel, Pension and Public Grievances stated various reasons, including difficulties in collecting documentary evidence from foreign companies that were involved in the project 20 years ago. Responding to a question whether the CBI move smacked of an understanding between the Congress and the BJP, the Chief Minister said the reasons cited were not adequate for its decision and that it appeared to have been made on the basis of a pre-conceived script.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cbi-says-no-to-ttp-probe-cm/article33563576.ece

A flurry of questions raised by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) regarding graft cases during the United Democratic Front (UDF) rule irked the Opposition that alleged it was a planned attack. The names of several prominent UDF leaders, including Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, former Minister Anoop Jacob, V.D. Satheesan and P.T. Thomas, were dragged into discussions during the question hour when LDF members sought information regarding the status of the police and Vigilance cases that involved them. While Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan expressed his inability to divulge information in many cases due to the lack of details, he said the government was considering granting nod to the Vigilance preliminary probe against Mr. Chennithala in view of the recent revelations made by hotelier Biju Ramesh in the bar bribery scam. The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau had conducted a confidential inquiry on the basis of Mr. Ramesh’s claims. After a slew of questions that appeared to put the UDF leaders in a tight spot, Mr. Chennithala hit back by saying that the supposed strategy was meant to intimidate them for having “exposed the government that is drowning in scams”. Refusing to cede ground, the Chief Minister said the Opposition was unfazed at the progress achieved by the LDF government during the last four-and-a-half years. The Opposition’s baseless allegations against the government found no traction among the public as seen in the recent local body polls. Things came to a head when Mr. Thomas raked up the SNC-Lavlin corruption case that involved the Chief Minister. He claimed that the Supreme Court had postponed the hearing in the case 19 times. Mr. Vijayan responded that it was the court’s discretion to decide on a date for the hearing and that he had been acquitted by lower courts. Accused MLAs To a query, Mr. Vijayan pointed out that UDF MLAs V.S. Sivakumar, V.K. Ebrahim Kunju, M.C. Kamaruddin, and K.M. Shaji and LDF MLAs P. Unni, U. Prathibha Hari, P.V. Anwar, and E.S.

After 2009, the State had not been included in the Union government’s literacy scheme, and as a result had not received any funds from it. Twelve years later, the State had been included in the scheme owing to the State government’s programmes in the field of literacy, Minister for General Education C. Ravindranath said in a Facebook post on Tuesday. The Kerala State Literacy Mission had contacted the Department of School Education and Literacy at the Centre many times seeking funds for its projects and inclusion of the State in the literacy scheme. The literacy mission’s activities, supported by the State government, were a success and noticed at the national level. The mission also received a special invitation to take part in the International Literacy Day celebrations held at the national level. Mission director P.S. Sreekala presented the State’s experiences and its projects on the occasion. In the wake of all these achievements, the Union government has now included the State in the Padhna Likhna Abhiyan.

Muraleedharan on Tuesday said the Kerala High Court order sanctioning the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe the corruption and foreign contribution irregularity in the UAE-LIFE Mission deal was a slap in the State government’s face. At a stroke, the court has exposed the hollowness of the State’s argument that the CBI probe was politically motivated. The court has accepted the CBI’s position that the LIFE Mission had violated the provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act in the contract to build modern housing for the poor in Thrissur using funds from the UAE-Red Crescent. The government had hastily ordered a Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau inquiry to fend off a CBI probe. The High Court has recognised the ruse. The CBI can now investigate the LIFE Mission Chief Executive Officer’s role in the deal, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/muraleedharan-hails-hc-verdict/article33563545.ece

13 January 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||‘YSRCP fleeing battlefield under COVID alibi’||The YSR Congress government has lost the confidence to win elections at this point in time and has realised how much anti-incumbency sentiment has set in among the rural population, hence has been vehemently opposing the conduct of panchayat elections, Telugu Desam Party Politbureau member and party Anantapur district president Kalava Srinivasulu has said. Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, he said that the YSRCP is fleeing the battlefield under the alibi of COVID-19. He questioned them as to how did their government allow the opening of wine shops during the peak of the pandemic, while the lockdown was still in place, resulting in the gathering of hundreds of people at one place. “Did any student become COVID-19 positive after you allowed the educational institutions to be opened? How did the protocol not come in the way of your party leaders organising the anniversary of your ‘padayatra’ with thousands of people marching together and meeting people?,” Mr. Srinivasulu said. He pointed out that the protocol was thrown to winds even in the distribution of pattas in the last two weeks with massive public meetings organised at the constituency level and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy himself addressing a similar meeting at Nellore, but when it comes to conducting elections, it does not want to give support to SEC N. Ramesh Kumar. “YSRCP is fearing a defeat as Mr. Ramesh Kumar will conduct free and fair elections,” Mr. Srinivasulu said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-fleeing-battlefield-under-covid-alibi/article33563178.ece

13 January 2021||KADAPA,ANDHRA PRADESH||A temple where only men and cows are allowed||The restrictions on entry of women into the Ayyappa temple in Sabarimala and the controversies surrounding the tradition have been making headlines for years now. But not many know that a similar practice is in vogue in the little-known Hanuman shrine in Kadapa district . The Sanjeevaraya Swamy temple at Thippayapalle in Pullampeta mandal is another ‘men-only’ shrine. By tradition, the men from the village perform the daily rituals and manage the temple affairs. Let alone entry into the temple premises, women are prohibited even from partaking the prasadam. What folklore says Since decades, the residents of the cattle-rich village have been eking out their living by selling milk and butter in the nearby towns. A popular folklore has it that a strange disease had broken out in the village, affecting the livestock. A sage had installed a huge boulder etched with sacred text ( Beejaksharalu ) in the village and asked the village to let the sick cows rub their bodies against it. As the suggestion worked wonders, the villagers got the boulder consecrated in a temple and the villagers have been worshipping the consecrated stone as Lord Hanuman since then. The cows are made to pass through the shrine. Sankranti rituals The temple gets abuzz during the Sankranti festival every year as only males from the village prepare ‘pongali’ and offer it to the Lord on the weekend ahead of the Sankranti. This year too, male members from the 70 houses in the village gathered at the shrine and prepared ‘pongali’ with rice, jaggery and pulses which was offered to the deity. The ‘prasadam’ was then distributed among the male members of the village. “The residents of Thippayapalle make it a point to visit their village on this special occasion every year irrespective of the places they have settled down,” says B. Ramanatham, a resident of the village . Another legend has it that the village was shifted from its previous place as Goddess Kothapuri Yellamma, the village deity, got irritated with the sound of the churning of milk. Apart from keeping the traditions alive, the village elders say, the sprawling grazing fields abutting the Seshachalam forest is also a key to the impressive cattle wealth, In the recent decades, the temple has got a welcome arch and a compound wall. However, the consecrated stone at the heart of the shrine remains the same with no barriers, where only only men and cows are allowed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/temple-in-kadapa-out-of-bounds-for-women/article33563079.ece

13 January 2021||KURNOOL,ANDHRA PRADESH||Close shave as acid tanker overturns in Kurnool||A major mishap was averted after a large tanker carrying Hydrochloric acid (HCL) overturned on the Alur-Aspari Road in the district. The fumes emanating from the tanker led to a scare among people, about 2 km from the Alur town, in the early hours of Tuesday. The acid, which was leaking from the tanker from 3.30 a.m., was plugged and transferred into another similar container brought from Kurnool, by 8.15 p.m. The acid was being transported from Rayalaseema Alkalis in Kurnool to Jindal Steels in Ballari district of Karnataka. A case of rash and negligent driving was registered against the vehicle driver. District Fire Officer V. Sreenivasa Reddy said the site of the accident was away from human habitation and the acid was non-combustible and non-poisonous, but emanating toxic fumes that could harm humans coming within 50 metres of the tanker. Adoni Deputy Superintendent of Police K. Vinod Kumar said that within 10 minutes of getting information, the Fire Department and Police personnel reached the spot and cordoned off the area. “Curious onlookers were kept at bay, as soon as the crowd from nearby areas swelled after daybreak. A police picket was arranged and passersby on the highway were not allowed to stop there and there was no traffic congestion as the vehicle had fallen off the road in open fields,” Alur Circle Inspector V. Bhaskar said. “We kept the foam compound ready in case there is any fire. It is non-combustible, but water-reactive, hence, care was taken to ensure no water fell on it,” Mr. Sreenivasa Reddy said. The quantum of the leak was luckily not much, so only some dry grass around the vehicle got burnt, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/acid-tanker-tips-over-in-kurnool/article33563722.ece

13 January 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Centuries-old temple set to regain past glory||Rama temple in the ancient port town of Motupalli in Prakasam district has long remained neglected for various reasons. Now a group of indologists has come together to give a facelift to the 1,000-year-old temple of the Chola times having a ‘garba griha', ‘antarala’, ‘arthamandapa’ and ‘mahamandapa’. The temple had received patronage from the then rulers. Motupalli had been an important international port during the medieval period and remained prominent during the Kakatiya, Vijayanagara and Qutub Shahi regimes, recalls E. Sivanagi Reddy, historian and CEO, Cultural Centre of Vijayawada and Amaravati. But for various reasons it has lost its past glory over a period. All-out efforts are now being made to bring back past glory to the temple, according to Motupalli Parirakshana Samithi president Ronda Dasaratha Rami Reddy. “'We have chalked out a plan for restoration of the heritage structure in archaeological terms under Dr. Sivanagi Reddy,” he says, adding historian Jyoti Chandramouli has also been roped in to finalise a detailed project report. The historical importance of the place could be well understood by the account of Italian traveller Marco Polo about the active EXIM trade in 1287 when it came under Rani Rudramadevi of the Kakatiya dynasty, says Dr. Sivanagi Reddy. Rare inscription Motupalli is also known world-wide for its unique and only one of its kind inscription on marine insurance for sea-borne traders issued by the Kakatiya emperor Ganpati Deva in 1234 AD engraved on four sides of a pillar now located in the nearby Veerabhadra Swamy temple. Known as ‘abhaya sasanam’, it was further renewed by Anavema Reddy and Vijaynagara emperor Devaraya, according to Dr. Sivangi Reddy. The DPR will be taken to Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy for carrying out the renovation work. Development activities The development activities include removal of sand dunes, construction of ‘pradakshinapatha, arresting of roof leakage, reconstruction of ‘dwaramandapam’ and installation of ‘dwajasthambham’ and ‘balipeetham’ and ‘kalyanamandam’, according to Mr. Dasaratha Rami Reddy. Samithi vice-president Venkata Rambhupal says a flower garden as mentioned in ‘Vaikanasa agamas’ was proposed within the temple premises. Open air museum An open air archaeological museum is also planned to showcase the scattered sculptures of historical significance and ensure their safety and security.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/centuries-old-temple-set-to-regain-past-glory/article33563173.ece

13 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Govt. plans to make free power to farm sector a permanent scheme||The State government is initiating measures to make the nine-hour supply of power to the farm sector free of cost a permanent scheme. It has instructed the power utilities to focus on building a permanent and robust system for supply of free power to the agricultural connections across the State on a permanent basis, making it clear that it is ready to bear the cost required to strengthen the free power scheme. Solar power plant The State has embarked on installation of a 10,000 MW solar power plant for supply of free power to the farm sector for the next 30 years. The power utilities will also commission new power transformers at various 400 KV sub-stations and construct 200 KV switching stations as part of the move to strengthen the supply network. “Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy wants the capacity of the feeders to be upgraded. Funds to the tune of Rs. 1,700 crore have been sanctioned for the purpose. The upgradation works have been completed and free power is being supplied to 99 % of the feeders and the rest will be covered by the end of rabi season,” said a senior AP-Transco official. Minister for Energy B. Srinivasa Reddy said the move would make agriculture a profitable venture and empower the farmers. “The State will progress if farmers are happy,” he said. Plans are also afoot to implement the free power scheme through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) under which the entire amount will be deposited in the accounts of farmers who will pay it to the Discoms. DBT scheme “The DBT scheme will enable farmers to question the Discoms on the quality of the power supplied to them, thereby improving the accountability factor. The government is spending Rs. 8353.58 crore on the implementation of free power scheme,” said Energy Secretary N. Srikant. Mr. Srikanth reviewed the power supply scheme with AP-Transco Joint Managing Directors K. Sreedhar Reddy and K. Venkateswara Rao, Director (Finance) K. Muthu Pandian, Director (Grid and Transmission) K. Praveen Kumar, Chairpersons and Managing Directors of Discoms S. Naga Lakshmi, H. Harinatha Rao and J.P.

Chandrababu Naidu held the State government responsible for this. “As many as 1,779 farmers have resorted to the extreme steps during the last one and a half years. The anti-farmer policies of the YSCRP government is to blame for this,” said Mr. Naidu while addressing the TDP coordinators and in-charges of Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies through video conference on Tuesday. Mr. Naidu accused Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy of betraying the farmers in the State after coming to power. “Mr. Jagan had made tall promises before the elections. The suicides of farmers and agricultural coolies have gone up by 55% during the YSRCP’s tenure,” said Mr. Naidu and called for ‘burning the anti-farmer G.O.s issued the State government in the Bhogi bonfires during the Sankranti celebrations.’ Expressing concern that the farmers in the State had suffered heavy losses owing to the recurrent vagaries of nature, Mr. Naidu alleged that the farmers had not got either crop insurance or input subsidy. “Dues of more than Rs. 2,700 crore pertaining to purchase of food grain by the government are pending. The paddy that was discoloured due to heavy rains was not purchased at the government centres. The middlemen are walking away with all the benefits. The farmers are being exploited badly,” said the TDP president. Now, Mr. Naidu said, situation is such that farmers are dumping tomatoes on the roads in Kurnool district in the absence of remunerative price.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-policy-blamed-for-farmer-suicides/article33563516.ece

13 January 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Sankranti rush chokes bus stations in city||The Dwaraka and Maddilapalem bus stations witnessed a heavy rush on Tuesday, as a large number of people gathered there to go to their native places on the occasion of Sankranti festival. There were long queue lines at ticket booking counters of non-stop buses. Though the RTC officials operated non-stop buses to Narsipatnam, Vizianagaram, Srikakulam and Kakinada for every 10 to 15 minutes, all the buses were packed. Seats of the buses were occupied in less than a minute after the vehicles were kept at the bays. The RTC officials have arranged 1,000 special buses to various parts of the State, apart from Telangana and Tamil Nadu. These special buses are being operated in addition to regular ones. Several people have reserved their seats to avoid rush. A large section of people were seen boarding the buses, despite the officials telling them that all seats were booked. They were ready to stand all along the journey. Conductors of a few buses were seen informing the passengers that 90% of seats were reserved and board only if they are ready to stand and take the journey. Women travelling with their children faced a lot of problems. “We are not aware of online booking and till the last two days, we had not planned our trip. It is tough to stand and go for almost three or four hours, but there is no option,” said Trinadh, a daily labourer, who was leaving along with his wife and two children, to a village located about 40 km from Palasa in Srikakulam district on Tuesday. Meanwhile, COVID-19 norms were thrown to the wind at the bus stations. Leave alone sanitising hands while boarding a bus, most of the passengers were not even wearing masks. Conductors who were busy managing the crowd expressed helplessness and requested people to wear masks. Police constables conducted checks to avoid thefts, chain-snatchings and other crimes. RTC and police officials made announcements in mikes urging people to take precautions. Taking advantage of the rush, a few private travel buses running to various destinations in and around the State were seen charging double the price from passengers. Officials from the Transport Department have conducted raids on various private travel buses and booked 27 cases. Deputy Transport Commissioner G.C. Raja Ratnam said that they have formed special teams and have been conducting raids since January 11. Five buses were found charging more from the passengers, seven were found not maintaining passenger details, seven were flouting/misusing stage carrier norms and one was found flouting COVID-19 protocol, he said. “Buses charging extra fares from the passengers will be seized,” he warned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/sankranti-rush-chokes-bus-stations-in-vizag/article33563840.ece
13 January 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Death of crows triggers panic in Vizag||Spotting of five dead crows on the Collectorate premises here on Monday created panic as word spread that the birds died all of a sudden. The incident caused a concern in the wake of the outbreak of bird flu in some States. The dead crows were found in a dry drain behind the main building of the Collector’s office. The crows died in quick succession, according to sources. On getting information, Joint Director of Animal Husbandry D. Ramakrishna, Dr. S. Nagamani and a team from the department went to the spot and collected samples. “A post-mortem examination of the crows has revealed that they were infected by pasteurella. There are no symptoms of bird flu like respiratory tract and lung infection that are usually seen in avian influenza. We have reared the culture and the bacteria will grow after 48 hours. The cause of their death will be known after that,” Dr. Ramakrishna told The Hindu on Tuesday. “In all, five dead crows were found at the spot and two of them are suspected to have died at least two days before the others. There is no immediate cause for worry. We have formed 43 teams for surveillance all over the district. The poultry farmers have been advised to disinfect their farms to check the possible spread of the virus through wild birds in view of the detection of bird flu in some States,” he added. When his attention was drawn to the reporting of the death of a few crows at NAD junction, DRM's office compound and Zilla Parishad premises during the last few days, Dr. Ramakrishna said that preliminary investigations have not revealed bird flu in any of the dead crows. The tests were being done at the Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (ADDL) Lab at the Government Veterinary Hospital in the city. Precautions at zoo “We have already initiated measures in view of the COVID-19 pandemic for disinfection of the bird and animal enclosures in the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park(IGZP). A meeting was held with the staff and workers and they were educated about the bird flu symptoms and the need to keep a watch on crows and birds from the wild coming into the zoo,” said IGZP curator Nandani Salaria. “The branches of trees close to the bird enclosures or across the top have been chopped off to prevent contact with wild birds and their droppings falling into the enclosures. The mesh is being cleaned regularly, sand changed and strict vigil being maintained,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/death-of-crows-triggers-panic-in-vizag/article33563082.ece

13 January 2021||ERRAVALLI (SIDDIPET DISTRICT),TELANGANA||Erravalli a deserted village now||About eight kilometres from Rajiv Rahadari, the moment one enters the village, the doors are found locked and shops shut. Barely one or two persons are seen on the road. With the by-elections for Dubbak Assembly over and ruling party suffering a defeat, the government has now focused its attention in completing the Mallannasagar project. Erravalli is one among the villages in Kondapaka mandal of Siddipet district that will be submerged under the reservoir. Over 80% oustees had already vacated the village in the last few days. A word that ‘good houses are being occupied’ by early birds spread and villagers soon, vacated their houses, group after group, and temporarily shifted to the double bedroom houses at Sangapur. But, about 30 people are still residing in the village as they think that if they leave, they might not get the remaining compensation from the government. “Life is scary, especially at night, for us. With dogs barking and weeping at night and snakes making frequent appearances, we are somehow surviving in this deserted village. I had a house that I sold to the government for Rs. 15 lakh for the construction of Mallannasagar project. But, I was not allotted any house as my name was not included in the list. How come my name is not there in the beneficiaries’ list when people of the same age group were able to get an allotted house?” asked Kokkonda Lakshmi. She said that about 18 people from their village had approached the High Court regarding this issue, out of which only three were paid compensation. People who are still living in the village feel they have been punished for having a land or a house here. None of the government officers has visited the village to check on them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/erravalli-a-deserted-village-now/article33563504.ece
13 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||CS reviews arrangements for COVID-19 vaccine delivery||With the vaccine for COVID-19 starting to arrive in the State, the State government has directed Collectors to take steps to ensure that necessary arrangements are made at the identified launch sites in their respective districts in line with the operational guidelines issued to them. The arrangements should include measures for dealing with any cases of adverse effects on the people following administration of the vaccine. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar has asked the Collectors to appoint Special Officers for each launch site and entrust them with the responsibility of overseeing the arrangements there. He held a video conference with the Collectors on Tuesday to review preparations for COVID-19 vaccination following instructions issued by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao at a review meeting on Monday. The Chief Secretary sensitised the Collectors to the importance of the programme in which all the healthcare workers, both government and private, would be administered the vaccine. They were advised to keep reserve vaccinators at each site. Steps should be taken to facilitate presence of pre-identified beneficiaries through network of district officials. Given the importance attached to the vaccination programme, the administration at district level should seek participation of public representatives at all levels. Mr Somesh Kumar also asked the Collectors to schedule smaller number of beneficiaries on the first day and based on the feedback and lessons, ramp up the number thereafter. Eatala’s letter Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender has written to public representatives to play an active role for hassle-free COVID-19 vaccination programme. In letters sent to all levels of the representatives starting from sarpanch to Ministers, Mr Rajender asked them to play an active role to ensure the vaccines are administered according to priority, and to generate public awareness about the vaccination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cs-reviews-arrangements-for-covid-19-vaccine-delivery/article33563475.ece
13 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||IPM back in the limelight, thanks to vaccine arrival||It is an abandoned building in Narayanguda with flaking plaster, broken steps, scattered office furniture lying around and strays wandering about. The pediment has ‘1896 Laboratories’ written on it. “We used to manufacture vaccines here until a few years ago. Now, this is a RT-PCR testing centre for COVID-19 which is functioning from the new block,” says a health official at the rear of the abandoned building known as Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM). As vaccines have been flown to Hyderabad in a cold chain for delivery to frontline health workers, the IPM is not in the picture for the vaccination programme. “We currently run a vaccination programme in another building for rabies victims who come here from far off places,” says the health official. The IPM in Narayanguda began as a ‘plague depot’ in 1870. The word depot was used as animals used to be tethered for use as vaccine reservoirs. According to scientific literature from that time, direct transfer of vaccinal matter from cow or buffalo to human subjects was the norm. In 1896, it became the central laboratory where vaccines were created and distributed. In 1910, it became a vaccine depot as the Nizam’s government introduced glycerinated vaccine lymph for the manufacture of smallpox vaccine. The animal virus acquired from Mumbai was used to vaccinate calves in Amravati in Maharashtra. A part of the lymph produced was mixed with lanoline and then used on children. The lymph collected from these human subjects were then used to keep up vaccination from calf to calf, and these inoculated calves were taken from village to village. The institute was at the forefront for smallpox vaccine before the disease was eradicated. The institute was a manufacturing centre for the anti-rabies vaccine that used tissue from neural tissue. Even during the fight against the HIV epidemic, the IPM was a key centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ipm-back-in-the-limelight-thanks-to-vaccine-arrival/article33563479.ece
13 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Status quo over UoH land||Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili of Telangana High Court directed the State government to maintain status quo with regard to 18.30 acres of land belonging to University of Hyderabad in Gachchibowli. Passing the interim directions o a writ petition filed by the UoH stating that State government was interfering with possession of the said land by laying a road, the judge posted the matter after two weeks for next hearing. The University of Hyderabad knocked the doors of HC seeking an order to restrain State government from interfering with its land in Gachchibowli. UoH Registrar P. Sardar Singh, in a writ petition, requested the HC to declare State government’s attempts to take over the land for laying a road as arbitrary and illegal. In 1975, unified Andhra Pradesh allocated 2,324.05 acres of land to UoH, which was established by the Centre, under survey numbers 1 to 9 and 14 to 24 and 25 of Kancha Gachchibowli village of Serilingampally mandal in Rangareddy district. According to the petitioner, the State government subsequently took back nearly 700 acres of that land and reassigned the same to various institutions and some private individuals. The government assured to provide alternative land but the assurance never materialised. Nine years ago, Rangareddy district Collector wrote to Chief Commissioner of Land Administration (CCLA) securing permission to resume 10.23 acres of the university land in survey no. 25 for laying a road. The university opposed the proposal stating that Union Cabinet Secretary in 2011 clarified that no property of the University can be parted with unless the Union government approved it. Meanwhile, the Collector instructed Serilingmapally Tahsildar to hand over that land to GHMC to lay the road. The petitioner told the court that he noticed that GHMC started levelling of ground work to lay the road five days ago. “All our efforts to reason with the Respondents fell under deaf ears,” he stated in the petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/status-quo-over-uoh-land/article33563484.ece

13 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Rules for special tribunals in land related cases notified||After initial delays, the State government has finally notified the constitution of the special tribunals for expeditiously disposing of land related cases in districts across the State. Three months after the passage of, what it claimed revolutionary reforms in the Revenue administration, the government has notified rules for the constitution and functioning of the special tribunals. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao introduced the Bills in the monsoon session of the Legislature in September doing away with the old systems of land administration which witnessed protracted litigations. The government at the time said it had resolved to abolish the three-tier system involving the legal systems comprising revenue courts at different levels to resolve land related issues. The Chief Minister announced that tribunals would be constituted at the district level exclusively to deal with land related issues so that they could be redressed at the earliest in the interests of the land owners. The government accordingly notified the rules pertaining to the special tribunals on Tuesday in accordance with the provisions of the Telangana Rights in Land and Pattadar Pass Books Act 2020 passed during the monsoon session of the Legislature. Special tribunals would be constituted in all the districts consisting two members, the district collector and the additional collector (revenue). In case of vacancies in the post of additional collector (revenue), the additional collector (local bodies) would be the member of the tribunal and in the event of both posts lying vacant, the District Revenue Officer would be made the member of the tribunal. All cases pending before the revenue authorities within the district under the provisions of the Telangana Rights in Land and Pattadar Pass Books Act, 1971, would be transferred to the special tribunals with immediate effect. The special tribunals have been mandated with the responsibility of holding sittings in the district headquarters, but should hold the sittings at divisional and mandal headquarters if necessary. They would be provided with supporting staff and the government made it mandatory to computerise the record of each of the proceedings taken.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rules-for-special-tribunals-in-land-related-cases-notified/article33563498.ece

A beautiful display of a village ‘Tirunallu’ was depicted by the students on the occasion. Makar Sankranti involves a host of signature delicacies prepared exclusively to celebrate the festival with sesame and jaggery, and using them as base, the young chefs of Regency prepared 150 dishes which included the lip-smacking Arisalu, Bobbatlu and Jantikalu, festival starters Chegodi and Murkulu as well as 30 varieties of pickles. The entire food preparation and display was so appealing that it made many heads turn. Jackfruit biryani, Kaju Munnkaya curry, Bellam charu, Sajja Rottelu and many such authentic items were served. All the savouries were served on banana leaf, said principal P. Ramesh Kumar Reddy. Telangana Chef Association president Dharmender Lamba and well-known chefs Naveen Nagaraj, Ramesh Chandra and Yadagiri from Hands in Hospitality, Sathyam from Novotel Hyderabad Airport, Indian-American restaurateur and entrepreneur of 21 Spices in Florida Asif, and Praveen from Ministry of Tourism, Government of India, were the guests.

13 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Zhu Wei was not ‘tight-lipped’||The 27-year-old Chinese national Zhu Wei alias Lambo, one of the key suspects in alleged financial irregularities by instant loan app companies cases, was of little help to the police as he did not reveal any information which was of substantial consequeneto unearth the multi-crore fraud and the real culprits. Zhu Wei, who was granted five-day police custody by a local court on January 7, was remanded in judicial custody on Monday. Hailing from Jiangxi in China, he finished his engineering there and came to India on a business visa in January last. He was the overall head of operations of loan apps managed by four companies. “Apart from his personal background, and how he applied for a job in key fugitive suspect Yuan Yuan alias Jennifer’s company, he did not say anything concrete,” an investigator told The Hindu . The cyber experts managed to retrieve data from Zhu Wei’s personal laptop and they had enough technical evidence to prove his role in the ‘fraud’, the officer said. However, another suspect K Nagaraju, who wa also granted police custody, told police about his role in the firms, and details about his other Chinese ‘bosses’ who were in constant touch with him through WeChat messaging app. “Nagaraju opened 15 current accounts at various branches of ICICI Bank for different companies by taking authorisation letters from the directors,” the officer said quoting the suspect. Nagaraju also used his credit cards to make payment to Google for uploading a few instant loan mobile applications on their Playstore, he said. The suspect also informed police of the operations of a few companies in question. The investigators have found 108 bank accounts were opened with ICICI Bank in Gurugram and other places in the National Capital Region. The South-East Asia operations of ICICI are monitored from its Gachibowli office in the business district of Hyderabad. “We have been pursuing with ICICI Bank to provide the details relating to persons involved in opening the current accounts, the companies and other entities involved. But, the concerned officials are passing the pillow from one department to another without yielding any result,” the officer said. He said that they were unable to make any further progress in the cases, as the bank officials were delaying in providing account statements and other details. On the other hand, the officials said that they are unable to get positive support from Google as it has provided a platform on its Playstore to these delinquent app companies. So far the Telangana police have identified over 350 loan apps, and wrote to Alphabet Inc. to remove them from the Playstore. “They have removed only a handful of them, and the majority are still available for people on their platform. It is a cause of concern,” the officer said hoping to get a response from the giant search engine. At least six people ended their lives due to the harassment by the app companies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/zhu-wei-was-not-tight-lipped/article33563486.ece
13 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Rectify’ higher education: BJP to Governor||The Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday brought to the notice of Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan the ‘deteriorating’ higher education sector in Telangana due to the ‘negligence’ and ‘inaction’ of the TRS government and called for her intervention to ‘rectify’ the situation. Party leaders, including P. Muralidhar Rao, K. Laxman, N. Ramchander Rao and Manohar Reddy, met the Governor at Raj Bhavan and submitted a memorandum explaining about the current state of affairs in the universities beset with “inordinate delay in appointing vice-chancellors, shortage of teachers, crumbling infrastructure and lack of funds”. Students had played a key role in attaining TS with the hope of betterment in various aspects but their hopes are doused by the government, and hence, Ms. Soundararajan’s intervention will go a long way in helping the first generation students belonging to rural and downtrodden sections of the society, they told her. Except two universities, all the others are without VCs for more than 18 months. IAS officers appointed as in-charge VCs have no time and registrars have been taking decisions to please the pressure groups, resulting in further fall in academic standards, they said. The Commissioner of Higher Education has been calling the shots in the absence of VCs, a ‘weak council of higher education’ and a ‘reluctant principal secretary’. It took five years for the government to reconstitute executive councils and it filled them with student leaders of the ruling party and none with proven eminence in any field of specialisation. “It is a shame that not even a single recruitment has taken place in the higher education system after Telangana formation with hundreds of vacant teaching positions at various levels. For example, Osmania University’s psychology department has just two assistant professors. It is no better with other universities,” the memorandum said. Differential salaries to contract lecturers teaching regular courses and self-financing courses is “highly discriminatory and need to be withdrawn immediately” as those teaching the latter are getting about 75% less than contract teachers recruited in regular vacancies. Vacancies in non-teaching staff galore with OU having 1,700 whereas sanctioned strength is 7,000! About 70% of sanctioned teaching strength of degree colleges is vacant with student-teacher ratio of 1:80 as against UGC norm of 1:20. Same goes with junior colleges when there are “hundreds of well qualified PGs waiting for employment notifications”. Block grants are not sufficient to pay salaries, hostels are in a miserable state and there are no funds for maintenance of buildings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rectify-higher-education-bjp-to-governor/article33563494.ece

Union Minister for Urban Development Hardeep Singh Puri gave away the award virtually to DMA N. Satyanarayana on Tuesday. The award is for CDMA-TS assessing 14 lakh properties in 72 municipalities sometime ago. Now, the DMA is planning to utilise the same satellite technology to assess other parameters too - to take up 20.80 lakh property tax assessments, 6.79 lakh water tap connection assessments, 1.45 lakh trade licences assessments, 4,000 advertisement hoardings and four lakh cell towers using the ‘Bhuvan Integrated Mobile Application’ developed in coordination with the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC). “We are planning to integrate the captured property assessments with respective modules to have realistic data and also to increase the tax base without actually increasing the tax rates,” said Mr. Satyanarayana, in a press release. The programme is being taken up under the ‘Pattana Pragathi’ programme in all urban local bodies. The mobile app helps in identifying the under-assessed or un-assessed properties by matching their images with the satellite imagery which would augment the revenue by identifying the under assessed and un-assessed. The initiative also helped the citizen to view his/her property in a spatial form with complete property details in a single platform without visiting the local municipal body office and avoiding any human interface, added the release.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ts-cdma-bags-award-for-geospatial-mapping-of-urban-properties/article33563514.ece

The association appealed to the Chief Minister, K. Chandrashekhar Rao to intervene in the issue and that the varsity in Telangana is protected as it would promote quality higher education here. The teachers also urged the varsity administration to take up the issue with the state government in fixing the boundaries and getting the title deed.

13 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Nizam’s kin urge Centre to settle Jewellery Trust tax issue||The kin of VII Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan have requested Union Finance Minister to direct the officials concerned to look into the litigation over income tax and wealth tax pertaining to the Nizam Jewellery Trust towards one-time resolution and settlement to end the dispute running for the last 26 years. In a letter addressed to the Union Finance Minister recently, Najaf Ali Khan, one of the grandsons of the VII Nizam, said the dispute was dragging on since 1995 and most of the beneficiaries of the trust have become senior citizens and having health and financial issues. Some of the beneficiaries have expired too during the last 26 years, he noted. Explaining the dispute, Mr. Najaf Ali Khan said that the VII Nizam had created various Trusts for the benefit of his family members and one of them was the Nizam Jewellery Trust, which was being overseen having powers to sell the jewellery. After a prolonged litigation and with the intervention of the Supreme Court, the Central Government had agreed to purchase the jewellery for an amount of Rs. 206 crore in January 1995. Then, the Trustees had initiated action for the sale of jewellery. The corpus was distributed among about 114 Nizam’s family members. As on date, 39 of them had expired, Mr. Najaf Ali Khan stated. When the Trustees were about to hand over the jewellery to the Centre, the Income Tax Department raised a total demand of Rs. 30.5 crore as arrears of income tax and wealth tax. The amount was paid from Rs. 206 crore on January 12, 1995 and it included Rs. 15.45 crore arrears of income tax and wealth tax. Later, a major portion of it was resulted in refunds. The Nizam Jewellery Trust office and its chartered accountants had misguided the income tax officials by giving wrong information on the adjustments of refunds according to the list of beneficiaries, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/nizams-kin-urge-centre-to-settle-jewellery-trust-issue/article33563511.ece

13 January 2021||KHAMMAM,TELANGANA||Thati Vanam project kicks off||Around 3.75 crore palm trees, including small and high yielding variety, have been planted across the State as part of concerted efforts to give a fillip to the centuries-old traditional occupation of toddy tapping in Telangana, said Minister for Prohibition and Excise V. Srinivas Goud on Tuesday. The State government waived the tax on palm trees to the tune of Rs. 16 crore and embarked on palm sapling plantation drive in mission mode to revive the traditional occupation and uphold its pride, he remarked. The Minister was speaking after inaugurating the Thati Vanam (Neera project) at Ramannapeta under the Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) limits on Tuesday. As many as 3,000 palm saplings, including the Indian date palm plants (Giraka Thati, Bihari Thati, Eetha and Kharjura), have been planted on 6.20 acres under the aegis of the local toddy tappers’ society at an estimated cost of Rs. 28 lakh as part of the Haritha Haram. Highlighting the nutritional value of neera, the natural extract from palm trees, the Minister said that the natural sap offers rich health benefits, particularly for bone health. A ‘neera cafe’ is being constructed near the Tank Bund in Hyderabad at an estimated cost of Rs. 8 crore, he said, adding that efforts were on to promote the palm nectar (neera) in a big way across the State.

13 January 2021||NALGONDA,TELANGANA||Long queues at toll plaza may be a thing of past||Unlike the second week of January two years ago, police teams camped at the Pantangi toll plaza near Choutuppal and the Korlapahad toll plaza near Kethepally on NH-65 (Hyderabad-Vijayawada) are much relaxed now. On January 13, 2019, natives heading to Andhra Pradesh for Sankranti were stranded in vehicles at Pantangi for several kilometres for at least two hours. Confusion whether the toll tax waiver, between January 13 and 16, announced by the Telangana government was applicable on national highways continued till situation turned chaotic, and the District Collector and the NHAI intervened. A year later, though FASTag or electronic toll collection was tentatively introduced on ‘compulsory and deadline basis’, only about 50% of the vehicles got the radio frequency identification tags stickered. Sankranti journeys were still an unpleasant experience. But now, going by the pre-Sankranti scenes at toll plazas in undivided Nalgonda, and supporting official estimates, one can believe the serpentine queues and bumper-to-bumper toll traffic are history. Of the three toll plazas on national highways in the district, the Gudur gate on NH 163 (Hyderabad-Warangal) is not much affected by Sankranti. Officials say the plaza clocks about 32,000 vehicles a day and about 70% payments are by FASTag. But on a recent Sunday, only about 18,000 vehicles (55%) used FASTag. Smooth flow GMR officials, the concessionaire of toll plazas on NH-65, at Pantangi, the busiest gate, Korlapahad near Suryapet and Chillakallu near Jaggayapeta, say increased FASTag compliance changed the experience for highway users and managers. “Traffic around Sankranti, starting from January 9, would be standing in one or two kilometres. But in the corresponding dates now, the traffic flow was smooth, and the maximum ‘cash lane’ queues do not exceed 200 metres. Around 85% of vehicles are with a FASTag,” K. Srikanth, GMR project manager, says. He, however, adds that more awareness is needed to tag the untagged, to make journeys hassle-free, save time and fuel. Officials are also wary about vehicles that would be passing through the toll gates only for festivals, and hence FASTag compliance percentage might see a dip, meaning there could be chances of swelling traffic on a particular date or for a few hours. While FASTag exits take a minimum two-second reading, for manual transactions it is 10 seconds. Officials plan to rope in staff with hand-held devices and open all gates for ‘cash also’, if situation demands. Past figures show the maximum traffic, measured as passenger car unit per day, at Pantangi would be around 60,000 on January 13, a day before the festival, and the following week start after the festivities conclude.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/long-queues-at-toll-plaza-may-be-a-thing-of-past/article33563510.ece

13 January 2021||Mumbai,||NCP lauds SC stay on three farm laws, but farmers firm on repeal||Terming the Supreme Court order staying the implementation of the three controversial farm laws as a ‘big relief’ for farmers, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar on Tuesday said it would lead to a concrete dialogue between the Central government and farmers. Farmer leaders from Maharashtra, however, called it only a step forward and clarified that the farmers’ agitation would not stop until all the three laws were repealed. Last month, Mr. Pawar met President Ram Nath Kovind and sought a repeal of the three farm laws. “A welcome decision taken by the Apex court of India to put on hold the implementation of three farm bills and set up a four member committee to resolve the issue. It is big relief for farmers and I hope that a concrete dialogue between central government and farmers will be initiated now, keeping the farmers interests and well being in mind,” Mr. Pawar tweeted. Maharashtra NCP chief Jayant Patil said the Centre should repeal the laws. Mr. Patil, in a video message, thanked the apex court for staying the implementation of the laws. Referring to the farmers’ protest, he accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of not responding to the demands of peasants. He said never were farmers of the country compelled to protest like this in free India. “I thank the SC for staying the implementation of the laws. I am sure the farmers who have gone to Delhi will not retreat till the laws are revoked,” the State Water Resources Minister said. “The PM and the BJP should immediately take the step to repeal the laws, which the Supreme Court views as appropriate to be stayed,” he added. Party spokesperson and State Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik said that the government should use this opportunity and stop being adamant. “A new proposal should be prepared to bring out new laws by revoking the present ones,” he said. Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader and former MP Raju Shetti said the stay order smelt of a government conspiracy against farmers. “Farmers have never demanded a stay on these laws, but have sought their repeal. The Supreme Court has not even considered this and instead formed a four-member committee. All members have openly supported these laws,” he said. Mr. Shetti said that it was a complete betrayal of protesting farmers. “The Central government is trying to create an impression for the time being that laws are being stayed. But those will be implemented again after the committee’s report,” he said. Ajit Nawale, Maharashtra unit head of the All India Kisan Sabha, said that the demand of farmers was to annul the laws. “The umbrella body of protesting farmers has already declared that it will not hold talks with the committee. We are firm on our demand,” he said, adding that the apex court’s order was only a small step towards the bigger goal.

13 January 2021||Mumbai,||Drugs case: Mumbai’s Mucchad Paanwala shop co-owner held||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Tuesday arrested Ramkumar Tiwari, one of the owners of the famous Muchhad Paanwala shop in Mumbai, in connection with a drugs case, an NCB official said. The paan shop, located at Kemps Corner in south Mumbai, is famous as it is frequented by celebrities. Mr. Tiwari was apprehended by a team of the NCB after questioning. His name cropped up during investigation into a drugs case in which three persons, including a British national, were arrested with 200 kg of drugs from Khar and Bandra on Saturday, the official said. The drugs included ganja, imported contraband like ‘OG Kush’ (a strain of cannabis indica), and curated marijuana, some of which had been sourced from the U.S., he said. Mr. Tiwari was summoned by the NCB for questioning on Monday and his statement was recorded, the official said. Following the questioning, he was placed under arrest on Tuesday, the official said, adding that further probe into the case was on. The NCB on Saturday arrested three persons, including a British national, for allegedly supplying imported varieties of ganja in the metropolis. One of those arrested is a suspect in the drugs case being probed after the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June last year. Mr. Tiwari was produced before a magistrate’s court later in the day and he was remanded in 14-day judicial custody as the NCB didn’t press for his custody, a lawyer said. His bail plea is likely to be heard on Wednesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/drugs-case-mumbais-mucchad-paanwala-shop-co-owner-held/article33563366.ece

13 January 2021||New Delhi,||Vaccine arrives at Delhi hospital amid tight security||The first consignment of Covishield vaccine, containing 2.64 lakh doses, for the Capital reached the central storage facility at Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital (RGSSH) on Tuesday amid high security. A SpiceJet flight carrying the vials landed at the Delhi airport around 10 a.m. on Tuesday, four days ahead of the vaccination drive on January 16. Special Commissioner of Police (Operations and Licensing) Muktesh Chander said they ensured smooth passage of the vaccine from the airport to the hospital, where adequate police arrangements have been made. A Delhi government official confirmed the development, adding: “Delhi received 22 boxes of the vaccine, each containing 1,200 vials. Each vial has 10 doses.” The Delhi government, however, did not officially share any information on the development. As of Tuesday evening, the vials had not been moved to the 89 hospitals where inoculation will begin on Saturday. The police will ensure smooth transportation of the vaccine to designated sites when the immunisation drive begins. “It will be escorted smoothly and necessary security arrangements will be done at the 89 vaccination centres in Delhi,” Dr. Chander added. Officials said three layers of security: CCTV cameras, Delhi Police personnel and the hospital’s own security staff are in place around the storage facility at RGSSH. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Shahadra) Amit Sharma said, “We have deployed the personnel at the storage area of RGSSH.” From the hospital, the vaccine will be transported to immunisation centres in special vehicles under heavy security. The police control room has been directed to respond promptly to calls from cold storage points, vaccination sites, and immediately pass on the information to PCR vans, local police, traffic police and any other agency. The vaccine came on a day when the national capital reported 386 new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, taking the total to 6,30,892, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Tuesday. The death toll has risen to 10,707 with 16 more fatalities reported in a single day. A total of 75,913 tests were done in 24 hours.

13 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Kejriwal has gone back on ‘free’ vaccination promise, says Cong.||Delhi Congress president Ch. Anil Kumar on Tuesday alleged that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had earlier promised to provide free COVID-19 vaccination to 95% of Delhiites, but had gone back on his word. Mr. Kumar also said that the Delhi government has failed to create a robust health infrastructure to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic as none of its mohalla clinics had figured in the 89 centres selected for the vaccination drive from January 16. “The mohalla clinics were of no use in testing/treating COVID-19, as it was without doctors, nurses, paramedics and infrastructure. The COVID-19 crisis exposed the lies of the Kejriwal government’s claim about mohalla clinics being the refuge of the poor for free treatment,” Mr. Kumar said. The Delhi Congress said that the Delhi government’s U-turn in providing free COVID-19 vaccine to Delhiites was another instance of the Kejriwal government’s double talk, and bolting away from reality, when the situation demanded a firm, solid stand by the government, even if it involved heavy expenditure. Earlier in the day, Mr. Kurmar led a delegation to submit a memorandum to the Lt. Governor, seeking reconstruction of the demolished Hanuman Temple at Chandni Chowk in its original place. The Delhi Congress said that the temple was demolished by the BJP-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation with the concurrence of the government in Delhi to widen a road without either bothering to protect this historic temple or ensuring its relocation. The memorandum pointed out that the demolition of the Hanuman Temple has wounded the religious sentiments of the people, and the Hanuman idol has been consigned to a civic body godown as “case property”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/kejriwal-has-gone-back-on-free-vaccination-promise-says-cong/article33563348.ece
13 January 2021||New Delhi,||BJP chalks out strategy for 2022 civic polls||Learning from its defeat in the Assembly elections last year, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will seek to deliver promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP-led Centre over the last two years as part of its strategy for the 2022 municipal corporation elections. From the regularisation of unauthorised colonies and granting ownership rights to their residents to issues related to construction on the banks of the Yamuna, the Capital is scheduled to see a flurry of “development activity” till the first quarter of the coming year, party sources said. According to a source, representatives from the party’s State leadership had brought several such initiatives to the attention of the Union Ministries concerned, requesting them to expedite “delivering on the promises” made to the people of Delhi. “There is a view within the party that it was unable to convince people about the benefits of the regularisation of unauthorised colonies in the run up to the Delhi Assembly elections last year,” a source said. In time for polls “So, there is a need not only to fulfill the promise made to citizens but also to do so in time for the municipal corporation elections next year so that voters are able to see the benefits of bringing the BJP back to power even if it is at the municipal level,” the source also said. Till the first quarter of 2022, the party will aim to fulfill as many infrastructure and policy related promises made in the run up to the 2020 Delhi Assembly elections through bodies such as the Delhi Development Authority and the Centre’s Urban Development Ministry, a leader said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-chalks-out-strategy-for-2022-civic-polls/article33563350.ece

The new structure will come up in the Jahanpanah City Forest area here, officials said. The approved land was allotted by the DDA “at the same site” where the old structure existed in the forest area in south Delhi. The decision to change the use of the allotted 400 sqm of land from “recreational to public and semi-public for religious purpose” was taken during an online meeting of the authority, the highest decision-making body of the DDA. The meeting was chaired by Delhi Lieutenant-Governor (L-G) Anil Baija, who is the Chairman of the urban body. In early October last year, the DDA had approved the proposal to allot the piece of land, and also recommended the change of land use. “After the allotment, a public notice was issued inviting objections and suggestions from the public for this purpose. After that, it went to the Board of Enquiry and Hearing, which cleared the proposal. And, today it was approved by the authority too,” a senior official said. It will now be sent to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs for final notification.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/dda-approves-change-of-land-use-for-new-ravidas-temple-structure/article33563346.ece

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said it will hear the application along with the main petition, which is already listed for hearing on January 19. Ms. Maulekhi, in her latest application, has highlighted that there has been a bird flu/avian Influenza outbreak in the country that has led to death of thousands of birds. She said that States such as Rajasthan, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana have already culled thousands of birds and animals. She said in the past, Ghazipur market has been the epicenter of avain flu outbreak in Delhi.

13 January 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi police arrest wanted U.P. criminal||Delhi Police has arrested a wanted criminal of eastern U.P., who allegedly killed a rival gang member in a shoot-out in Lucknow’s Gomti Nagar, officials said on Tuesday. The accused has been identified as Kanhaiya Vishwakarma alias Girdhari from U.P’s Varanasi, they said, adding that a 9-mm pistol and a live cartridge have been seized. On Monday, the police got a tip-off regarding a suspicious person carrying a weapon in Rohini’s Sector-11. A team was formed and the accused was later nabbed. Interrogation revealed that on January 6, he killed one Ajit Singh of a rival gang in Lucknow. Ajit, 39, who was a notorious criminal of Mau district, with 17 cases registered against him and his accomplice Mohar Singh were travelling in an SUV when three motorcycle-borne assailants opened fire at them. After killing Ajit, he wanted to make Delhi his hideout. He was arrested when he was looking for a house here. A reward of Rs. 1 lakh was declared on his arrest in a 2019 case where he killed one Ritesh in Varanasi. Over 20 cases have been registered against him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-police-arrest-wanted-up-criminal/article33563356.ece

13 January 2021||New Delhi,||CM meets delegates on setting up academy||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal met a delegation of people from Goa, who are settled in the Capital, following a decision of the Delhi Cabinet to set up a Konkani Academy in the city, on Tuesday. The government stated that delegation thanked the Chief Minister and said the academy was an attempt to ensure that Konkani culture reaches everyone. “We have people from across the country, from States like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, West Bengal, Gujarat, East and North-East India. Likewise, we have people from Goa, who have come and settled in Delhi,” the Chief Minister said. “We set up Marathi Academy last year, which has been running since then. It was the demand of the Konkani speaking people since then that a Konkani Academy should be set up. Since the time we announced the Academy, it has been received very well,” he also said. In a related development, addressing the concluding session of the Chief Minister’s Urban Leaders Fellowship (CMULF) programme, Mr. Kejriwal appreciated their hard work and wished them luck for future endeavours. He said he hoped that the CMUL Fellowship Programme had sensitised them towards resolving the problems of general public.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cm-meets-delegates-on-setting-up-academy/article33563349.ece
13 January 2021||Washington,||Worries rise over more violence in U.S.||U.S. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf announced his resignation unexpectedly on Monday as worries rose over more violence during President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration next week. Mr. Wolf’s departure as head of the body in charge of security for the January 20 event came five days after President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, hoping to prevent Mr. Biden from replacing him. The Homeland Security Department oversees several law enforcement bodies, including the Secret Service, the point agency for security for the White House and the U.S. President. Mr. Wolf named Pete Gaynor to replace him. But the move did not end questions over whether the U.S. capital city would be adequately secure over the coming week. An internal FBI document warned of the possibility that armed Trump supporters could hold protests in all 50 States between the coming weekend and January 20, according to U.S. media. The White House issued a statement saying that Mr. Trump had “declared that an emergency exists in the District of Columbia and ordered Federal assistance to supplement the District’s response efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from the 59th Presidential Inauguration from January 11 to January 24, 2021”. It said the order gave the Department of Homeland Security the authority to act “to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in the District of Columbia”. The Pentagon said on Monday it had authorised 15,000 National Guard troops to be deployed for the inauguration. Already 6,200 troops are on the ground in Washington, and a total of 10,000 are planned by the coming weekend, said General Daniel Hokanson, chief of the Defense Department's National Guard Bureau. Another 5,000 could be deployed by the day of the inauguration, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/worries-rise-over-more-violence-in-us/article33563058.ece
13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||‘As interests realign, a third major political party could emerge in the U.S.’||Jeffrey A. Engel, who heads the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University, analyses the attack on the U.S. Capitol, its significance and consequences. Edited excerpts:   On whether the attack on the Capitol was a moment of reckoning for the country and whether there is going to be a before and an after… I think so, because I don’t think anything really has changed since last Wednesday, except people’s realisation that a line has been crossed. You know, President Donald Trump has been saying seditious things for weeks and weeks now. But there wasn’t any follow on. And he says, frankly, lots of things which never come true. In fact, President Trump rarely says things that are true, to be honest. And what we saw last Wednesday was the general public for the first time seeing with their own eyes, the consequences … Americans are going to recognise that yes, we do in fact need boundaries on what is, and is not acceptable conversation and acceptable political behaviour. President Trump has said he is not going to attend Joe Biden’s inauguration. The last time this happened was when Andrew Johnson boycotted Ulysses S. Grant’s inauguration in 1869. Has this been considered by any other President in recent history? I don’t believe so. We pride ourselves — or used to — on the peaceful transfer of power. This is the moment that we show the world and show the American people pictures of one person handing over power to another. So every President since 1869 has shown up at their successors’ inauguration, whether they like them or not... The best example I think is 1933, when Franklin Roosevelt took over from Herbert Hoover in the middle of the Great Depression. The two men couldn’t… wouldn’t… talk to each other, they despised each other so much. Yet they rode in the same car together to the Capitol. In fact, it was so cold, they actually rode underneath the same blanket to stay warm. Over this past week, there seems to have been a shift in how critics of Vice-President Mike Pence think of him, and history is probably going to judge him much more kindly now. Would you agree? I suspect history will treat him kindly, but for an entirely unimpressive reason. I have been amazed since last Wednesday, [at] how much praise the Vice-President has received for doing the bare minimum … what the Constitution requires. Usually we think of political courage as requiring some innovation, some insights and willingness to break with, if not tradition, norms, in order to clear a new political path. That’s not what the Vice-President did. His role was ceremonial and he conducted a ceremonial role. Doing what you’re required to do, I think is not bravery. It’s rarely praiseworthy, yet it shows how unusual a time we are in that simply doing the bare minimum was able to get Vice-President Pence praise and as you said, probably a nicer critique from history. While there is resistance from Senate Republicans to convict President Trump if he is impeached by the House, there is also an opportunity for them here to prevent him from holding future office. Do you think some of them are thinking that they can be rid of that choice that they have to repeatedly make between President Trump and the Republican Party? To be completely blunt, the actuarial tables suggest that he’s probably not going to be physically able to do it, or frankly, if you really believe the tables, there’s a not insignificant chance that he will not survive the next four years; I am not saying anything about him personally — just because of his lifestyle, because of his weight, because of his age, et cetera. So I have not been impressed that he’s going to run again, but I do think it’s clear that he is not going away in terms of being a force within American politics, or at least a loud voice within American politics. So I don’t know, the Senators are necessarily thinking that they need to impeach the President in order to keep him from running. But I do think that what they want to do is impeach the President frankly, because he has attacked them … what we actually just witnessed here is one co-equal branch violently attack, not just with words, but with actual deaths, members of another co-equal branch. Abstracting from whether the impact has been positive or negative, purely in terms of the magnitude of impact, which American President comes closest to Donald Trump? I think Andrew Johnson would be my guess. Andrew Johnson was Vice-President when Abraham Lincoln was shot … He was arguably the nation’s most racist President. He arguably was the one who was the biggest jerk. Now other Presidents give him a run for his money on that one, but you know, it’s a conversation you don’t want to be in. And President Johnson was impeached in the last months of his time in office largely because of the angry rhetoric he employed, attacking Congress. And the fact that he was violating congressional will openly and to a lesser extent inciting violence. Do you think that there’s going to be a third major political party forming in the near term? That’s what history suggests … Donald Trump ran against the Democratic party, but also ran against traditional Republicans — the George W. Bush - Mitt Romney wings of the Republican Party. Obviously he was successful in controlling the party and then ultimately winning the presidency, but those people haven’t gone away. That doesn’t mean everybody who is in the Republican Party is going to continue under that brand, which suggests — especially given that the people who are most antagonistic towards Trump are by and large towards the centre of the political spectrum and there is of course a centre wing of the Democratic Party as well — that there is a ripe moment here for a coalescing of these two into a new political party. Now, before Democrats get very excited about that, I should point out that every previous time in American history we have seen one party collapse, it takes the other party down with it over the course of the next several election cycles, just because it completely realigns the interest groups and the coalitions and the alliances within the broad electorate.

13 January 2021||Kuala Lumpur,||Malaysia declares state of emergency over virus surge||Malaysia’s king declared a nationwide state of emergency on Tuesday to fight a coronavirus surge and Parliament was suspended, with critics charging that it was a bid by the unstable government to cling to power. The surprise move came a day after the Prime Minister announced sweeping new curbs across much of the Southeast Asian nation, including the closure of most businesses, and warned the health system was “at breaking point”. Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah agreed to declare an emergency until August 1 following a request from Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, the national palace said in a statement. It is the first time Malaysia has declared a national state of emergency in over half a century and Mr. Muhyiddin, in a televised address, confirmed Parliament would be suspended and elections would not take place for the time being. Not a coup, says PM But the leader, whose 10-month-old administration is showing signs of falling apart, insisted that “the civilian government will continue to function”. “The emergency declaration... is not a military coup and a curfew will not be enforced,” he said, insisting that he was committed to holding a general election once the outbreak is brought under control. The announcement came after Mr. Muhyiddin’s key coalition allies started withdrawing support, which could have led to the collapse of the government and snap national polls that some feared could worsen the outbreak. Mr. Muhyiddin has narrowly survived a series of challenges in Parliament since taking office but is now thought to have lost his majority. Malaysia kept the virus in check for much of last year with a tough lockdown but, once curbs were eased, cases accelerated and have repeatedly hit fresh records in the recent days. The country has reported more than 1,38,000 virus cases and 555 deaths. As well as suspending political life, the declaration gives the government powers to take over private hospitals as government facilities become overwhelmed, and get extra help from the military and the police, Mr. Muhyiddin said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/malaysia-declares-state-of-emergency-over-virus-surge/article33563060.ece
13 January 2021||New Delhi,||Ahead of Gyawali’s visit, Nepal, India differ on conducting ‘border talks’||The Kalapani territorial dispute is expected to be “raised” by Nepal during the Joint Commission meeting to be held here during the visit of Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gywali this week, but there will be no “border talks”, officials here confirmed. The visit, which was announced by Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli in his speech to the Upper House of Parliament, will instead focus on the Joint Commission agenda, which includes a broad spectrum of development projects, the officials said, adding that the boundary issue that erupted last year over Nepal’s decision to include Indian territories in its map, would be handled separately only when the designated Foreign Secretary-level mechanism, which is agreed upon bilaterally, meets. In Nepal, however, officials said the resolution of the dispute remains important for improving overall bilateral ties that plunged to new lows last year. “We have been urging India repeatedly through diplomatic notes to bring the border dispute to the table and the Joint Commission is an opportunity for us to that,” said Rajan Bhattarai, Foreign Affairs Adviser to Mr. Oli, explaining Nepal’s direction for the Joint Commission talks. Mr. Gyawali is expected to reach here on Thursday. The 6th Joint Commission meeting has been delayed by more than a year because of the row over the Kalapani issue and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Commission met for the 5th round on August 22, 2019, when the entire gamut of bilateral relation was discussed. Mr. Oli had said that Mr. Gyawali would discuss “the issue related to the border and several other matters”. Mr. Gyawali is expected to deliver a public lecture at the Vivekananda International Foundation on January 15. Vaccine supply It is understood that Nepal may raise its requirement of COVID-19 vaccines and both sides may discuss an agreement for their supply, once the government clarifies its plans to allow the export of Covishield and Covaxin. “India will have greater clarity on export of COVID-19 vaccines within the next few weeks,” External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar was quoted as telling a Reuters news agency event on Monday, indicating that the government may still consider prioritising its domestic vaccine requirement before sending consignments abroad. Nepal is also expected to raise the need to discuss and adopt the Eminent Persons Group (EPG) report which has been completed but has not found official recognition from the Indian side. The EPG, constituted by Prime Minister Modi and Mr. Oli in February 2016, had recommended several measures such as firming up Nepal’s land boundary with India and the revision of historic treaties. “The established procedure agreed among the members of the EPG was that the completed report should be submitted to the Indian PM first. The report is now ready but it is yet to be accepted by the Indian PM,” Mr. Bhattarai said. Mr. Gyawali’s visit comes weeks after Mr. Oli recommended dissolution of the Lower House of Parliament — Pratinidhi Sabha. The “broader message” of the visit is likely to be India’s silent acknowledgement of the action of Mr. Oli. India had to engage Mr. Oli now as the other option would be to wait for the election which may not be held in the foreseeable future. Prime Minister Oli has called for election in April-May, however the legal process over the dissolution of the Lower House is under way and sources indicated that they are expecting that the polling could be postponed. “As far as we are concerned, the Joint Commission between the Indian and Nepalese Foreign Ministers is one of the topmost politically important bilateral mechanisms. It should have met earlier but could not be held. We welcome India’s decision to host the meeting,” said Mr. Bhattarai.

Intelligence officers dismantled a four-member IS cell in the eastern province of Nangarhar that had planned to murder Ross Wilson as well as Afghan officials, the National Directorate of Security said. Mr. Wilson, the U.S. Charge d'Affaires in Kabul, has steadfastly condemned a series of assassinations in the capital and other cities of prominent Afghans including journalists, activists and politicians in recent months. “The main assassin and facilitator of the cell, Abdul Wahed, had planned to assassinate the U.S. Ambassador in Afghanistan as well as some high ranking Afghan officials,” the NDS said in a statement. “Their plan was foiled with their arrest.” The NDS did not offer further details and the U.S. Embassy in Kabul did not respond to requests for comment. In recent months, deadly violence has rocked Afghanistan, including a new trend of targeted killing of prominent Afghans which has sowed fear and chaos despite the Taliban and government engaging in peace talks.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/is-plan-to-kill-top-us-envoy-in-kabul-foiled/article33563055.ece
13 January 2021||Washington,||U.S. rebrands Cuba as state sponsor of terrorism||President Donald Trump’s outgoing administration on Monday returned Cuba to the U.S. blacklist of state sponsors of terrorism, erecting a last-minute roadlock to expected efforts by President-elect Joe Biden to ease tensions. The terror designation severely hampers foreign investment and can only be removed after a formal review by the Biden administration, meaning it may remain in force for months. With nine days left in office, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited Cuba's ties with Colombian rebels, alliance with leftist Venezuela and sanctuary to several U.S. fugitives in justifying the blacklisting. “With this action, we will once again hold Cuba’s government accountable and send a clear message: the Castro regime must end its support for international terrorism and subversion of U.S. justice,” Mr. Pompeo said in a statement, referring to former leaders Fidel and Raul Castro. “The United States will continue to support the Cuban people in their desire for a democratic government and respect for human rights, including freedom of religion, expression and association," he said. President Barack Obama in 2015 delisted Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism as he moved to normalize relations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/us-adds-cuba-to-terrorism-blacklist/article33563059.ece

Ranjan Ramanayake, a Deputy Minister of the United National Party before it was voted out in 2019, claimed that he was being targeted for speaking out against corruption. The 57-year-old was sentenced to “rigorous imprisonment” by the Supreme Court for making the remarks in 2017 to reporters outside the Prime Minister’s official residence in Colombo. “We convict him for the offence of contempt of court... and sentence him to four years rigorous imprisonment,” the court said in its verdict. Mr. Ramanayake was a Deputy Minister in the government of then President Maithripala Sirisena when he made the remarks after a meeting with top anti-corruption officials. Following the change in government, Mr. Ramanayake was arrested and charged for allegedly recording more than 1, 00,000 personal phone calls. The sometimes lewd and compromising contents were leaked on social media early last year, causing a major scandal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/sri-lanka-jails-ex-minister-for-saying-judges-are-corrupt/article33563136.ece
13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Reclaiming SAARC from the ashes of 2020||Thirty-six years after it first began, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), appears to be all but dead in the water. The year 2020 marked the sixth year since the leaders of the eight nations that make up SAARC were able to meet. Further evidence of its perilous position, if any was needed, came on the SAARC charter day on December 8, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi made it clear that India’s position on cross-border terrorism from Pakistan that led New Delhi to refuse to attend the SAARC summit in 2016 in Islamabad, is still in place. This indicates that the grouping, which cannot convene unless all leaders agree to meet, is unlikely to do so in the near future. The shadows over the meets Over the past year, India-Pakistan issues have impacted other meetings of SAARC as well, making it easier for member countries, as well as international agencies to deal with South Asia as a fragmented group rather than a collective, working with each country in separate silos or in smaller configurations. However, the events of 2020, particularly the novel coronavirus pandemic and China’s aggressions at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) shone a new spotlight on this mechanism, and should make the Modi government review its position and reverse that trend. India’s problems with Pakistan on terrorism, territorial claims and on its role in blocking SAARC initiatives on connectivity and trade are well known. Even so, India’s refusal to allow Pakistan to host the SAARC summit because of those problems is akin to giving Pakistan a ‘veto’ over the entire SAARC process. The insistence is particularly puzzling given that Mr. Modi and his cabinet ministers continued to attend Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meetings along with their Pakistani counterparts, including the SCO Heads of Government meeting in November where New Delhi even invited Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan (he deputed another official). While China’s incursions in Ladakh and the Galwan killings constituted the larger concern in the year, India did not decline to attend meetings with the Chinese leadership at the SCO, the Russia-India-China trilateral, the G-20 and others. No concerns over territorial claims stopped the Modi government from engaging with Nepal either, despite Mr. K.P. Sharma Oli’s decision to change Nepal’s map and Constitution to include Indian territories. In a year when the pandemic has forced most multilateral summits to go online, it is inexplicable that India cannot attend a virtual SAARC summit hosted by Pakistan, which would allow the South Asian process to move forward. Pandemic-caused challenges Second, reviving SAARC is crucial to countering the common challenges brought about by the pandemic. To begin with, studies have shown that South Asia’s experience of the pandemic has been unique from other regions of the world, and this needs to be studied further in a comprehensive manner (“Pandemic Preparedness and Response to COVID-19 in South Asian Countries”; https://bit.ly/3qdhCsN) in order to counter future pandemics. Such an approach is also necessary for the distribution and further trials needed for vaccines, as well as developing cold storage chains for the vast market that South Asia represents. The pandemic’s impact on South Asian economies is another area that calls for coordination. Apart from the overall GDP slowdown, global job cuts which will lead to an estimated 22% fall in revenue for migrant labour and expatriates from South Asian countries (https://bit.ly/2MRZvKp), there is an expected loss of about 10.77 million jobs and US$52.32 billion in GDP in the tourism sector alone from the impact of COVID-19 (https://bit.ly/39oXRHV). World Bank reports that have estimated the losses have all suggested that South Asian countries work as a collective to set standards for labour from the region, and also to promoting a more intra-regional, transnational approach towards tourism, citing successful examples including the ‘East Africa Single Joint Visa’ system, or similar joint tourism initiatives like in the Mekong region or the Caribbean islands. A time for regional initiatives In the longer term, there will be a shift in priorities towards health security, food security, and job security, that will also benefit from an “all-of” South Asia approach. The impact of COVID-19 will be seen in broader, global trends: a growing distaste for ‘globalisation’ of trade, travel and migration all of which were seen to have helped the pandemic spread from China, as well as a growing preference for nativism, self-dependence and localising supply chains. While it will be impossible for countries to cut themselves off from the global market entirely, regional initiatives will become the “Goldilocks option” (not too hot and not too cold), or the happy medium between globalisation and hyper-nationalism. It would be important to note therefore, that as the world is divided between regional trade arrangements such as new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA (North America), the Southern Common Market, or MERCOSUR for its Spanish initials (South America), the European Union (Europe), the African Continental Free Trade Area, or AfCFTA (Africa), the Gulf Cooperation Council, or GCC (Gulf) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP (South East Asia and Australasia including China), India’s only regional trading agreement at present is the South Asian Free Trade Area, or SAFTA (with SAARC countries). China’s quest In dealing with the challenge from China too, both at India’s borders and in its neighbourhood, a unified South Asian platform remains India’s most potent countermeasure. At the border, it is clear that tensions with Pakistan and Nepal amplify the threat perception from China, while other SAARC members (minus Bhutan), all of whom are Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) partners of China will be hard placed to help individually. Significantly, from 2005-14, China actually wanted to join SAARC. Officials recall that every SAARC summit during that decade period saw a discussion on whether China could be upgraded to member status (from observer status). On each occasion, it was fought back by India and most other countries in the grouping, with the logic that despite sharing boundaries with three South Asian countries, China is not South Asian. Despite the rebuff, China has continued to push its way into South Asia, as several statistical indicators for investment, trade, tourism and South Asian student preferences for universities (https://bit.ly/3i4jfWI;https://brook.gs/2LMpv9q;https://brook.gs/2LG1t07). In the past year, the Chinese government, and its Communist Party of China party arms such as the United Front Work Department, or the UFWD have used the opportunities presented by the pandemic to push ahead with this quest. Apart from sending medicines, personal protective equipment kits, and promising vaccines to most SAARC countries as part of its “Health Silk Road” initiative, China’s vice minister has held three separate meetings with combinations of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and discussed economic issues and Sinovac vaccine availability with them (https://bit.ly/3i2vlQk). Experts suggest that it is only a matter of time before Beijing holds a meeting of all SAARC countries (minus India and Bhutan), for they are all part of the BRI, and even that they will be invited to join RCEP, which India declined. India’s steps, more bilateral In contrast, India stepped up its health and economic diplomacy in the region, but apart from one SAARC meeting convened by Mr. Modi in March, these have been bilateral initiatives, not a combined effort for South Asia. These are some of the reasons that led all SAARC leaders other than Mr. Modi to urgently call for the revival of SAARC during their charter day messages. Despite the despondency, the rationale for its existence remains intact: while history and political grievances may be perceived differently, geography is reality. Seen through Beijing’s prism, India’s SAARC neighbourhood may be a means to contain India, with the People’s Liberation Army strategies against India over the LAC at present, or in conjunction with Pakistan or Nepal at other disputed fronts in the future. New Delhi must find its own prism with which to view its South Asian neighbourhood as it should be: a unit that has a common future, and as a force-multiplier for India’s ambitions on the global stage. suhasini.h@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/reclaiming-saarc-from-the-ashes-of-2020/article33563042.ece
13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||The debilitating side-effect of a flawed vaccine trial||More than a decade since the human clinical trial of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine — it was controversial and carried out without proper consent on nearly 23,500 girls in the 10-14 age group in Vadodara, Gujarat and Khammam district of Andhra Pradesh — and eight years after the Supreme Court of India slammed the government for slipping into “deep slumber” in addressing the “menace” of illegal clinical trials carried out in India by multinational countries, nothing much seems to have changed. The phase-3 clinical trial of Bharat Biotech’s COVID-19 vaccine, Covaxin, by a private hospital in the Bhopal-based Peoples College of Medical Sciences & Research Centre appears to suffer from serious violations and as a result, closely resembles the HPV vaccine trial. The HPV vaccine trial was carried out by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), a non-governmental organisation, in collaboration with the governments of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Incidentally, the ICMR, tasked with promulgating research ethics guidelines, is the co-sponsor of the Covaxin trial.  The informed consent process, the cornerstone of ethics in clinical trials, was grossly violated during the HPV trial in Andhra Pradesh; consent forms of nearly 2,800 child participants were signed by a hostel warden or headmaster and not the parents. Many missteps During a press conference on January 10 and even earlier to other media outlets, the Covaxin trial participants alleged that they were ignorant of what they were signing up for. If true, it amounts to the consent nowhere close to being a truly informed one. According to them, no efforts were apparently taken to explain and inform them of the pros and cons of taking part in the trial, nor were they told that they would either get a vaccine candidate or a placebo. Instead, they were misled by the trial site to think they were getting a COVID-19 vaccine for free. The participants were not made aware of their rights to free medical care in case of any adverse events. They were not given any time or option to discuss with the family before signing the consent form, either. As documents show, at least in a few instances, the consent was taken after vaccination, which amounts to a serious violation. They also alleged that they were not given a copy of the consent form and other documents to prove their participation. Following the October 2013 Supreme Court order, the Indian regulator had in 2019 made mandatory an audio-video recording of the informed consent process of each vulnerable individual participant before conducting clinical trials. And a written consent from the participant had to necessarily be taken before the audio-video recording of the informed consent process. Since many of the 700-odd participants are illiterate, an impartial witness should have been present during the entire informed consent process to append his/her signatures to the consent form. There is no evidence that this was followed, based on what the participants said during the press conference. In the Covaxin trial in Bhopal, over a dozen of the 700 adults from three-four communities living close to the hospital have told the media that they were lured with monetary benefits of Rs. 750. Luring people to participate in clinical trials by offering money is unethical. However, the company in a press release states that a decision was taken to reimburse all participants at the rate of Rs. 750 for each study visit. The company claims the reimbursement amount was approved by every institutional ethics committee at the study sites, and is not an inducement. While reimbursement for actuals, such as lost wages and cost of transportation to the trial site, is permissible, it amounts to inducement when a payment of Rs. 750 is openly announced; during the press conference, the participants highlighted the payment announcement. It is unclear if the institutional ethics committee even approved street announcements to be made inviting people to the trial. Whether a site can advertise and even the content of such promotional material need prior approval from the institutional ethics committee. Follow-up and care While free medical care in case of any adverse event is a right of each trial participant, there have been at least a few documented instances of violation. In other cases, the participants, unaware that they were part of a clinical trial and hence entitled to free medical attention, had sought care from private practitioners. With at least some participants not possessing their own mobile phones, medical follow-up over phone, even if there was one, was not actually possible. If the HPV vaccine trial was investigated by a Parliamentary Standing Committee, such an independent investigation becomes all the more necessary as the ICMR is the co-sponsor of the trial. One of the participants at the Peoples College of Medical Sciences & Research Centre died on December 21. While Bharat Biotech claims that all due processes were followed following this development, it is unclear why no information about the death of the trial participant, who belongs to a tribe, was made public by the Indian regulator. In the case of serious adverse events following injection with AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine in a trial outside India, the information was made public, and the trial was halted at all sites while an investigation was under way. The Serum Institute was also ordered to halt the trial by the Indian regulator pending investigation. Act quickly Only a thorough and impartial probe will restore confidence in clinical trials. All the more as a couple of COVID-19 trials have already progressed to the phase-3 trial stage and few more are in the early stages of testing. With two vaccines already approved for restricted use and the virus spread slowing down, recruiting participants will prove to be all the more challenging. The conduct of a highly unethical trial, if not thoroughly and quickly investigated, can adversely impact the conduct of these studies already under way. prasad.ravindranath@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-debilitating-side-effect-of-a-flawed-vaccine-trial/article33563044.ece
13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||In ancient Al-Ula, forging a new future||On January 5, the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) met at the ancient town of Al-Ula in Saudi Arabia to end the bitter discord that three of its members — Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain, along with Egypt — have had with their partner, Qatar. On June 5, 2017, the Arab Quartet, as they styled themselves, subjected Qatar to an onerous diplomatic boycott and a total land, sea and air embargo. They accused Qatar of destabilising the region with its support for Islamist groups. They then presented Qatar with 13 demands including severing ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, diluting relations with Turkey and Iran, and shutting down the Al Jazeera network, in order to normalise ties. Viewing these demands as an encroachment on its sovereignty, Qatar rejected them. This led to the boycott which was accompanied by shrill invective against Qatar on national media, which included threats of violence and even regime change. Now, three and a half years later, the boycott has ended. Background to the boycott Ten years ago, the Arab Spring uprisings across West Asia had thrown up popular demands for reform — an end to authoritarian rule and the restoration of Arab “dignity” through freedom and democracy. Four leaders fell under these pressures, which also gave rise to two new developments: one, Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated parties came to power in Egypt and Tunisia; and, two, Saudi Arabia decided to divert demands for domestic reform by highlighting a threat from Iran. Asserting that Iran had hegemonic designs across the region, the Kingdom shaped opposition to Iran on sectarian basis and confronted it in theatres of its influence – Syria and later Yemen. The Brotherhood, with its grassroots mobilisation and a political platform that marries Islamic principles with Western-style democracy, poses a serious challenge to the existing monarchical order that provides no scope for popular participation. Hence, Saudi Arabia and the UAE watched with horror the Brotherhood’s electoral successes, culminating in Mohammed Morsi being elected President in Egypt in 2012. Fearing that a successful Brotherhood administration would become a model for their countries as well, the two GCC allies supported the Egyptian army’s coup against Morsi in July 2013. Qatar and the Brotherhood Qatar, a GCC member, has over several years been a maverick in GCC counsels. Besides supporting its independent television channel, Al Jazeera, that often criticises regional leaders, it is a major supporter of the Brotherhood. Though explained as an expression of its independent foreign policy, the reason goes deeper: the former Emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, and his son, Sheikh Tamim, the present ruler, aspire to play a major role in regional affairs, overcoming with their wealth the disadvantage of Qatar’s small size. In pursuing their regional role, they have been sensitive to U.S. interests. Thus, after the events of 9/11, when the U.S. was convinced of the need for wide-ranging reform in the region, it believed that the Brotherhood, with its blend of Islam and democracy, could achieve change. Hence, Qatar’s backing for the Brotherhood from the early 2000s and later, specifically of Morsi, was in line with U.S. interests. U.S. President Donald Trump’s visceral hostility towards Iran and total support for Saudi Arabia gave the quartet the opportunity to change Qatar’s ways: through the boycott of June 2017, they sought to pressurise their partner into submission. This approach failed: with its huge resources, Qatar could weather the financial assault, while the backing of Turkey, Iran and two GCC partners, Kuwait and Oman, ensured that the movement of goods and people was maintained. Turkey, led by an Islamist party, became Qatar’s strategic partner, and even challenged Saudi regional leadership on doctrinal and political bases. Recently, when the UAE and Bahrain “normalised” ties with Israel, both Qatar and Turkey affirmed their support for Hamas, the Islamist party in power in Gaza. The two countries are also partners in Libya, ranged against the group backed by Egypt and the UAE in the ongoing civil conflict. Possible re-alignments The most likely reason for the reconciliation at Al-Ula is the incoming Biden presidency in the U.S.: it is expected that, besides reviving the nuclear agreement with Iran and easing sanctions, Joe Biden could focus on Saudi Arabia’s dismal human rights record and the war in Yemen. Hence, the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was anxious to project his conciliatory approach to the incoming administration by patching up with Qatar. The reconciliation has evoked no enthusiasm from the other sponsors of the boycott. The UAE and Egypt feel particularly threatened by the Brotherhood; they sent low-level delegations to Al-Ula and their media comment has been tepid. Both have made clear, as has Bahrain, that future ties with Qatar will depend on its conduct. No one, however, believes that Qatar will dilute its backing for the Brotherhood, delink itself from Turkey, or even tone down commentary on Al Jazeera. The UAE has its own reasons for hostility towards Qatar. It has far greater concerns relating to the threat from the Brotherhood than other GCC members due to the influence of its domestic Brotherhood-affiliated Al Islah party. Again, its leaders are also keen to emerge as major players in regional affairs on the back of close links with the U.S. They therefore see Qatar as a rival hindering their aspirations. The Al-Ula conclave could herald some major shifts in regional alignments. There could be a nascent Saudi-UAE competition, with the UAE ingratiating itself with the U.S. and supporting its interests in diverse theatres – Yemen, the Horn of Africa and the western Indian Ocean. Turkey and Qatar, possibly with Iran, could then seize the opportunity to re-engage with Saudi Arabia and Egypt, thus shaping an alternative regional coalition that would perhaps be closer to Russia and China than to the U.S. As Mr. Biden takes charge in the U.S., the Al-Ula conclave could trigger the emergence of a new regional order in West Asia.

13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Policing a turbulent democracy||On January 6, a violent mob loyal to President Donald Trump attacked the iconic Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. Ever since it started becoming clear that Democrat Joe Biden was set to win the 2020 presidential election, emotions started running high. Many threatened to resort to violence if Mr. Biden was declared the winner. The assault on Capitol Hill was therefore not an unexpected event, particularly when viewed against the backdrop of Mr. Trump’s own inflammatory rhetoric preceding the incident. For those who supported Mr. Biden, Mr. Trump’s verbal assault bordered on instigation. Congress is now determined to impeach the President for this. Failure to protect Capitol Hill More than the ugly conduct of Mr. Trump and his supporters, what is now also being discussed — and rightly so — is whether the assault could have been foiled. How prepared were the law and order agencies for the worst-case scenario? Did they arm themselves adequately to meet all probable contingencies? These are questions that will normally be raised anywhere in the democratic world after such an outrageous incident takes place. The Washington Police and intelligence establishments face the heat squarely for their failure to protect the sanctity of the historic institution. An Indian policeman would wonder how the rampaging mob was allowed to go so close to Capitol Hill and then enter the building. In my view, the Indian police would have kept the mob at a distance of at least one kilometre from the building and erected a police wall to prevent such an invasion. The more boisterous among the gathering would also have been removed from the scene at the earliest. This would no doubt have led to mob violence. But the Indian police have never hesitated to use force to disable rioting crowds. There is no report to suggest that the Capitol Police used sufficient force to keep the crowd at bay. The situation no doubt demanded huge reinforcements from neighbouring agencies and the National Guard. According to some reports, no one at the Capitol requested for additional security requirement, although the former chief of the Capitol Police has denied this. The intricacies of policing Washington D.C. are somewhat analogous to those administering Delhi. Although Delhi is for all purposes a ‘State’ as defined by the Constitution, operational control over the Delhi Police rests with the Union Home Ministry. This is an arrangement laid down by the Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act. Under this law, the Delhi Legislative Assembly can make laws in all subjects except in matters pertaining to public order, police and land. Successive Chief Ministers have cribbed about this strange arrangement, but to no avail. The position will remain unchanged unless a constitutional amendment is brought about to confer full Statehood on Delhi. An amendment to this effect will, however, remain a pipe dream for a long time to come. This is the lacuna that permits politics to be injected into policing matters in India. No Central government, whatever its political complexion, is a saint in the matter. The mode of policing the American capital is a shade different from what prevails in India. The U.S. Capitol Police is an independent police department which reports to the House Speaker and Senate President. It can and frequently does ask other Washington D.C. law enforcement agencies for extra resources. It can also ask the National Guard and federal law enforcement agencies for assistance. The National Guard is drawn from the U.S. Army and Air Force and is somewhat weighed down by the dual control of the States and the federal government. The inexplicable fact here is that despite intelligence and warnings, the Capitol Police failed to reinforce itself ahead of the January 6 attack. Was there some politics here that accounted for the apparent reluctance to beef up security? President Trump could have drawn on the National Guard, but he did not do so for obvious reasons. He was possibly abetted by a Republican-controlled Senate. A poor track record The charge levelled by many observers in the U.S. is that law enforcement was guilty of providing kid-glove treatment to the rioters. This, they say, was in sharp contrast to the ruthlessness displayed in countering the Black Lives Matter agitators. The huge numbers arrested during the Black Lives Matter movement are highlighted to contrast the modest figure rounded up at Capitol Hill. It is difficult to support or reject this charge of a police bias, although the U.S. police have often been accused of racism. While discussing the happenings in Washington, some critics of our Central government allege that the track record of our own police is not any better. They cite the incidents at Jawaharlal Nehru University on January 5, 2020 and the Jamia Millia campus on December 15, 2019 to establish that the police turn a blind eye when it is politically inexpedient to haul up law breakers. The allegations made on both occasions were that several outsiders were allowed by the authorities to infiltrate into the two institutions and physically handle students who were protesting against the administration. No one has been arrested following the JNU incident. In the case of Jamia, there have been a few arrests, but allegedly selective so as to not offend those who wield influence in the institution. Official inquiries have been held into both incidents, but to little avail. In such cases, only painstaking investigation can establish that outsiders went in with the intention of causing trouble. Even an investigator with a high reputation for objectivity and political neutrality finds it difficult in such instances to find the required evidence. Policing a democracy is a complicated exercise. An acceptable balance has to be struck between operational autonomy and the need for the political executive to retain control over the police so that the latter do not commit excesses or become politicised. Such a formula is attractive on paper but rarely works in the field. R.K.

13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Restoring credibility of the GOP||In an unprecedented move, the U.S. House of Representatives will be voting on Wednesday to impeach President Donald Trump a second time. The Republicans’ need to impeach Mr. Trump is even greater than that of the Democrats. They must exorcise Trump’s ghost so that they can regain some of the credibility they lost following their leadership’s abject surrender to the President’s narcissistic whims and lies that instigated the attack on Capitol Hill. Why support impeachment? The only way for them to redeem themselves is to take the lead in the impeachment process both in the House and the Senate. There are many reasons that should prompt them to do so. First, Mr. Trump made the Republican Party his personal preserve and used it for his own glorification and profit. Most Republican leaders fell into his trap because they believed that this was a small price to pay in order to curry favour with Mr. Trump’s raucous base that had become the public face of the Grand Old Party (GOP), and which was seemingly their most loyal vote bank. Now they must extricate themselves from Mr. Trump’s clutches after he has brought the party into disrepute. Second, even if Mr. Trump is not impeached or not removed under Article 25 (which allows the Vice-President to become acting President when a President is unable to continue his duties due to various reasons), he will face charges of a serious nature for inciting insurrection and mayhem against legally constituted authority after he leaves office. This will rub off on his supporters in Congress who either applauded him or were mute spectators of his despicable behaviour. Third, as long as Mr. Trump is politically active and has the support of his hard-core base, he and his supporters will not allow a credible GOP candidate to emerge for the 2024 election. If Mr. Trump is nominated again, which is possible if he is not impeached and disqualified, he will drag the party and its Senate and House candidates down with himself in 2024 thus damaging the party’s revival prospects in the near future. It is therefore in the party’s interest, and especially of those Republicans with presidential ambitions, to see that his political career is finished and that the impeachment also includes the clause that will not allow him to run for office in future. Mr. Trump’s removal is essential for a leader of national stature to emerge in the GOP who can be a credible candidate in 2024. Surveys show that a majority of Americans not only condemn the attack on the Capitol but also hold Mr. Trump personally responsible for it. A politically active Mr. Trump could send the GOP into a tailspin for years if not decades. Possible delay Even an impeachment after Mr. Trump leaves office could disqualify him from running again. This appears to be an increasingly likely scenario for two reasons. One, even if the House passes the articles of impeachment this week, the Senate will not be able to take it up until inauguration day, as it is not scheduled to reconvene until January 19. Two, Speaker Nancy Pelosi may decide not to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate for consideration until 100 days after Mr. Biden has taken office to allow the new President to get his cabinet confirmed and take steps to combat the pandemic, and ensure that his first three months in office are not overshadowed by the controversy surrounding impeachment. There is much talk in Washington about the relative merits of accountability versus healing. This is a false dichotomy. Both can take place simultaneously reinforcing each other. As severe wounds have been inflicted on America’s body politic by a Republican President enabled by a collaborating GOP leadership, several of whose members outpaced the President in their inflammatory rhetoric, it is imperative that the Republican Party takes the lead on both counts — holding Mr. Trump accountable and reaching out to the Democrats. Only this will begin the healing process.

13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Imposing a compromise||The Supreme Court’s interim order in the ongoing contestation between large sections of the farmers and the Centre over the new farm laws may be motivated by a laudable intention to break the deadlock in negotiations. However, it is difficult to shake off the impression that the Court is seeking to impose a compromise on the farmers’ unions. One portion of the order stays the three laws, seeks to maintain the Minimum Support Price as before and prevents possible dispossession of farmers of their land under the new laws. The stated reason is that the stay would “assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers” and encourage them to go to the negotiating table. However, it is somewhat disconcerting that the stay of legislation is effected solely as an instrument to facilitate the Court’s arrangement rather than on the basis of any identified legal or constitutional infirmities in the laws. The order forming a four-member committee may indeed help relieve the current tension and allay the government’s fears that the Republic Day celebrations may be disrupted, but it is not clear if it would help the reaching of an amicable settlement as the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body spearheading the protests, has refused to appear before the panel. The Court’s approach raises the question whether it should traverse beyond its adjudicative role and pass judicial orders of significant import on the basis of sanguine hope and mediational zeal. The Court did make its position amply clear during the hearing, with the Chief Justice of India, S.A. Bobde, faulting the Centre for its failure to break the deadlock arising out of the weeks-long protest by thousands of farmers in the vicinity of Delhi, demanding nothing short of an outright repeal of the laws. It is only in the wake of the government’s perceived failure that the Court has chosen to intervene, but it is unfortunate that it is not in the form of adjudicating key questions such as the constitutionality of the laws, but by handing over the role of thrashing out the issues involved to a four-member panel. It is not clear how the four members on the committee were chosen, and there is already some well-founded criticism that some of them have already voiced their support for the farm laws in question. The Court wants the panel to give its recommendations on hearing the views of all stakeholders. Here, the exercise could turn tricky. How will the Court deal with a possible recommendation that the laws be amended? It would be strange and even questionable if the Court directed Parliament to bring the laws in line with the committee’s views. While a negotiated settlement is always preferable, it is equally important that judicial power is not seen as being used to dilute the import of the protest or de-legitimise farmer unions that stay away from the proceedings of the panel or interfere with the powers of Parliament to legislate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/imposing-a-compromise/article33563037.ece
13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Strained ties||The recent three-day-long protest, led by Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, under the banner of the Secular Democratic Progressive Alliance, against Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi came as no surprise, given the strained ties between the two constitutional functionaries. They have been at loggerheads over many matters, most recently on the appointment of the State Election Commissioner, an office critical to holding elections to local bodies in the Union Territory. But the principal issue of contention is the implementation of direct benefit transfer in the public distribution system using cash, instead of free rice, being given to beneficiaries. The agitation was meant to highlight the demand of the Congress and its allies for the recall of the Lt Governor. As a prelude to the stir, the Chief Minister presented memoranda to President Ram Nath Kovind and Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy, accusing Ms. Bedi of “functioning in an autocratic manner” and adopting an “obstructionist attitude” in ensuring the progress and welfare of people. On her part, Ms. Bedi has advised him to refrain from misleading the public about the Centre and her office. She has even attributed his “anguish and disappointment” possibly to the “diligent and sustained care” exercised by the Lt Governor’s secretariat “in ensuring just, fair and accessible administration following the laws and rules of business scrupulously”. With the Assembly election likely in April or May, the Chief Minister leading the protest against the Lt Governor was clearly an act of political mobilisation, even though the Congress’s major ally, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, chose to stay away from it. The agitation should be seen as a reflection of the political reality in the Union Territory as Mr. Narayanasamy does not have any effective Opposition. This allows him to turn all his energy and time against the Lt Governor instead of on his political adversaries at a time when the election is near. And this seems to be his strategy to ward off any criticism against his government’s “non-functioning” by laying the blame at the doorstep of the Lt Governor. On her part, Ms. Bedi should take into account the legitimate requirements of an elected government and try to accommodate Mr. Narayanasamy’s views on important matters such as the free rice scheme. After all, the Centre itself did not see any great virtue in the DBT mode when it decided to give additional food grains (rice or wheat) free of cost at five kg per person a month to ration cardholders during April-November last year — a relief measure during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the near breakdown of communication between the Lt Governor and the Chief Minister, the Centre should step in, in the interest of smooth administration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/strained-ties/article33563038.ece

The two Prime Ministers were agreed that the Commonwealth was a useful institution, but shared the fear that it would be extremely difficult to deal with the chain reaction produced by this ill-advised British move to placate South Africa at the risk of provoking retaliation by the African nations. The Canadian Prime Minister was making a gallant bid to enlist India’s co-operation to salvage the Commonwealth with some face-saving formula if the African leaders decided to precipitate a crisis by staging a mass walk-out in Singapore. But he confessed that he did not have any plan of action or strategy in mind at the moment, even after his talks last night with Mr. Edward Heath, British Prime Minister. Mrs. Gandhi made it clear to Mr. Trudeau that while India would do what it could to avert a showdown in Singapore, it would have to consider whether it was worthwhile for it to continue in the Commonwealth if the African countries decided to quit in protest against the British action. She said the basic concept behind the Commonwealth was not only complete equality between all the member-States, but also avoidance of racial discrimination.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/india-canada-fears-over-uk-move/article33563046.ece

13 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Inflation slows to 4.59% as food prices ease||India’s retail inflation decelerated appreciably to 4.59% in December, from 6.93% in November, dipping below 6% for the first time since March 2020 as food prices cooled. Other data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Tuesday, however, showed that a nascent industrial recovery, which had begun in September, retreated in November as industrial output shrank 1.9%. The lowest consumer price inflation (CPI) print in 14 months was driven by an sharp slowdown in food price inflation, which eased to 3.4% in December, from the preceding month’s 9.5% . India’s index of industrial production (IIP) for November was dragged lower by mining and manufacturing, which both shrank, as per quick estimates. Mining output contracted 7.3% in the month, while manufacturing declined 1.7%, indicating an unwinding of inventory build-ups with the quenching of pent-up and festive demand. Electricity production grew for the third month in a row, rising 3.5% year-on-year. The NSO also revised upwards the index for the preceding three months by incorporating more production data. As per the final data for August 2020, the IIP had shrunk 7.1% in the month, narrower than the 8% estimated earlier. In September, industrial output had edged up 0.5% — higher than the 0.2% growth estimated earlier — after shrinking for six months. Industrial output grew 4.19% in October, higher than the 3.6% quick estimate. “The November data once again shows that the uptick witnessed in the month of September and October was due to a combination of festive and pent-up demand and the recovery is still shallow and fragile,” said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings & Research. “The unevenness and fragility of the current recovery is evident with only 10 out of 23 industry group showing positive growth in November,” he pointed out. Inflation surprise Vegetable prices witnessed a 10.4% deflation in December, compared with inflation of 15.5% inflation in November. An accompanying moderation in the inflation rates for meat and fish, eggs and pulses, helped the consumer food price index record its slowest pace of increase in 16 months at 3.4%. Core inflation too eased marginally to 5.5% in December, helping overall inflation moderate after having remained above the central bank’s tolerance band for price gains — of plus or minus two percentage points from its medium-term target of 4% — for a prolonged period. “While the considerable softening in the CPI in December 2020 offers welcome relief, it is unlikely to prove adequate to allow for rates to be eased in the upcoming policy review, as the headline inflation may only record a limited further decline before resuming an uptrend,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA. Initial data for this month also suggest a continued plunge in vegetable prices, but point to a broad-based rise in prices of other food items, especially edible oils, Ms. Nayar observed. “Additionally, the hardening prices of crude oil, and its partial transmission into domestic retail prices, remain a concern,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/inflation-slows-to-459-as-food-prices-ease/article33563034.ece
13 January 2021||New Delhi,||Update won’t affect privacy: WhatsApp||In the wake of a backlash over its updated privacy policy, Facebook-owned WhatsApp on Tuesday clarified that the update would not affect users’ messages to friends or family. The changes only relate to messaging a business using the platform, the messaging service provider said. “We want to address some rumours and be 100% clear we continue to protect your private messages with end-to-end encryption...Our privacy policy update does not affect the privacy of your messages with friends or family,” the instant messaging firm tweeted. In an FAQ posted on its website, WhatsApp added that this update includes changes related to messaging a business on WhatsApp, which is optional, and provided further transparency about how the company collects and uses data. Interestingly, in a new survey by community social network LocalCircles comprising almost 9,000 participants, 15% respondents said they would stop using WhatsApp, while 26% said they would “drastically reduce” their usage of the platform and start using other platforms such as Signal and Telegram. About 24% respondents said they and their groups were considering moving to other platforms. About 18% of those surveyed said they would continue using WhatsApp and let their data be used. ‘Will not use payment’ Additionally, 91% users said they would not use WhatsApp’s payment feature and 67% users said they would not chat with businesses if payment and transaction information was shared with Facebook and third parties. WhatsApp in its blog clarified, “Neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can read your messages or hear your calls with your friends, family, and co-workers on WhatsApp. Whatever you share, it stays between you.

Production was being carried out by production supervisors, support staff and other team members who worked hard to make the highest quality cars, TKM said. Despite the disruption at its Bidadi factory, Toyota reported sales of 8,508 units of cars in November and 7,497 in December 2020 against 8,312 and 6,544 units respectively in the corresponding months a year earlier, the company said. The automaker, which has the capacity to manufacture 3.10 lakh units of cars per annum at its plants in Karnataka, is currently in the process of readying its plant 2 to manufacture a Toyota-Suzuki alliance model starting 2022.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/minimised-impact-of-lockout-on-sales-orders/article33563021.ece

13 January 2021||Chennai,||Cement firms reject cartel charge, urge realty price cut||The South India Cement Manufacturers’ Association (SICMA), a newly formed group, has rejected charges of cartelisation and instead urged the government to ensure that builders’ cut prices by at least 50% so as to make housing affordable and help reinvigorate overall demand in the economy. In a letter to the Prime Minister, copies of which were released to the media here, SICMA said the primary reason for the poor growth of the housing sector was the builders’ lobby’s efforts to hold on to margins of ‘more than 100%’ by maintaining the prices of flats/ houses at artificially high levels. This had led to an unsold inventory of 75 lakh flats across nine major markets, it said. “What is ailing our industry and in-turn India’s growth is, poor growth of housing,” N. Srinivasan, president SICMA, asserted at a media briefing. “The sole reason for the same is the artificially high prices of flats/houses,” he added. Contending that pricing flats at reasonable levels would boost the economy and job creation and aid the cement industry, which had been struggling with 60% capacity utilisation, SICMA asked the Centre to direct builders to come clean on costing. “Despite 28% GST and rise in raw material prices, cement makers are selling a 50 kg bag for Rs. 230 for infrastructure projects,” Mr. Srinivasan said Mr. Srinivasan said cement prices varied depending on the brand. Also, cement was only 1.5-2% of the construction cost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/cement-firms-reject-cartel-charge-urge-realty-price-cut/article33563027.ece

13 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Eetee Maheta lauds Zeel Desai||It has been remarkable return to the professional circuit for Zeel Desai after a full season was lost to the pandemic. To reach the $15,000 ITF women’s tennis event final in Monastir, Tunisia, last week was an encouraging effort by the 21-year-old Zeel, who was ranked world No. 18 among juniors in 2017. With coach Todd Clark moving away from the Ahmedabad Racquets Academy to a new challenge, Zeel has returned to her former coach Jignesh Raval. Zeel had the 25-year-old Eetee Maheta as her travelling coach in Tunisia. A fighting player, who was once in the top-5 among women in India before a knee injury curtailed her career, Eetee was understandably delighted with Zeel’s show. Incidentally, Zeel beat Eetee in her last professional singles match in Gwalior three years back. “Zeel did a fantastic job, especially considering that she was away for many months from competitive tennis. It takes a lot of positivity, confidence and courage to perform this well in your first tournament. She stayed strong on the crucial points to execute such a strong performance,” said Eetee. The focus for Zeel would be to sustain the good work and possibly fight for a place in the national team. She had endured a week-long quarantine in Tunisia before relaunching her professional career. “If she improves on the depth of her groundstrokes and the percentage of her first serve, Zeel will be able to have better results,” observed Eetee. Coach Rawal had trained Eetee also and was able to trust her with the responsibility of not only taking care of Zeel but also Vaidehi Chaudhari and Paras Dahiya. Vaidehi reached the women’s quarterfinals in the first tournament while Dahiya has been getting better despite enduring the qualifying matches. “I am very happy with the way all three are performing. If they stay confident and believe in their abilities, good things will come their way,” said Eetee. Having seen both sides — as a player and coach — Eetee felt that “tennis is still the same and certain golden rules do work. I am enjoying my time with the players”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/eetee-maheta-lauds-zeel-desai/article33563318.ece
13 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Punjab shock for Karnataka||Siddharth Kaul’s superb spell of four for 26, including a hat-trick, and Prabhsimran Singh’s unbeaten 89 powered Punjab past Karnataka by nine wickets in Elite Group A of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Twenty20 Trophy at Alur (1) ground here on Tuesday. Punjab moved to the top with two wins in as many matches, while Karnataka slipped to a first loss in two outings. Falling apart After being put in, Karnataka stumbled to a sub-par 125 for eight in 20 overs. Only Rohan Kadam (32, 33b, 3x4) showed some fight, while the more established players — Devdutt Padikkal (19), Karun Nair (13) and K. Gowtham (13) — faltered. Punjab seamer Siddharth’s hat-trick came in the 17th over when he dismissed Kadam, Aniruddha Joshi and A. Mithun in succession.  Punjab faced no trouble in the chase, reaching the target with 5.2 overs to spare. Young wicketkeeper-batsman Prabhsimran and Abhishek Sharma (30, 30b, 2x4, 1x6) set Punjab on the right track, putting on 93 for the opening wicket. Prabhsimran returned unbeaten with a 52-ball 89 laced with nine fours and five sixes. Devdhar, Shivam shine In another fixture, Railways outclassed Uttar Pradesh by eight wickets. Mrunal Devdhar (57, 52b, 8x4) and Shivam Chaudhary (56 n.o., 39b, 6x4, 1x6) helped Railways reach the small 134-run target with 14 balls to spare. With two wins, Railways is tied with Punjab on points, but the latter is ahead on net run rate.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/punjab-shock-for-karnataka/article33563190.ece
13 January 2021||KOLKATA,||TN romps to a 10-wkt. win||Openers N. Jagadeesan and C. Hari Nishaanth’s brilliant batting earned Tamil Nadu a commanding 10-wicket win over Assam in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 cricket tournament at the Eden Gardens here on Tuesday. Put in to bat, Assam managed to score 126 for seven. Tamil Nadu achieved the target in 15 overs to post its second victory. Even though Pallav Das punished Sandeep Warrier early, Tamil Nadu bowlers’ tidy performance kept their team on top. M. Mohammed provided the breakthrough in the fifth over as Pallav (19) pulled one to mid-wicket. Striking in tandem Tamil Nadu captain Dinesh Karthik utilised his resources well. Bowling in tandem, spinners R. Sai Kishore and M. Ashwin stuck to tight lines and extracted some turn to pick up two wickets apiece.  Sai Kishore accounted for Rishav Das (15) and Abhishek Thakuri, while Ashwin dismissed Denish Das (15) and Saahil Jain. Assam, which could not score a boundary for eight overs in the middle period, had some relief when Rajjakuddin Ahmed (29, 14b, 4x4, 1x6) played a cameo that included a few big hits on the onside and down the ground. Riyan Parag’s late charge (24, 26b, 1x4, 1x6) also helped Assam, which gathered 53 runs in the last five overs. Opening up After getting used to the track in the first two overs, the Tamil Nadu openers switched gears to play some entertaining shots. Nishaant (47 n.o., 40b, 5x4, 1x6) chose Arup Das and Jagadeesan (78 n.o., 50b, 8x4, 3x6) picked Pritam Das for special treatment to plunder 14 and 16 runs in third and fourth overs respectively. The left-right combination not only pulled and drove with authority, but also ran well between the wickets. Jagadeesan achieved his maiden fifty, while Nishaanth remained three shy of his second consecutive half-century.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tn-romps-to-a-10-wkt-win/article33563247.ece
13 January 2021||KOLKATA,||Vivek stars in Bengal’s win||Vivek Singh’s maiden unbeaten 100 helped Bengal record a 16-run win over Jharkhand in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy at the Eden Gardens on Tuesday. Choosing to bat, Bengal registered 161 for six before restricting Jharkhand to 145 for nine and earn its second victory. The left-handed Vivek drove, cut and pulled powerfully to keep the bowlers under pressure. Improvisation was on display in Vivek’s audacious strokeplay as he slammed 13 fours and three sixes while scoring his hundred off 64 balls. The 27-year-old laid a good foundation by adding 60 runs with fellow opener Shreevats Goswami (27, 28b, 3x4) and then put on 37 and 32 with Manoj Tiwary (12) and Shahbaz Ahmed (6) respectively. Jharkhand started cautiously start as it gathered 36 for one in the first six overs. Captain Ishan Kishan (22, 25b, 2x4, 1x6) tried to accelerate before he was caught at deep mid-wicket off off-spinner Arnab Nandi. As the Bengal bowlers built up the pressure, Jharkhand lost a wicket every over between the 10th and 13th. In the other match played at the Jadavpur University Campus, Hyderabad, which had lost narrowly to Assam, edged out Odisha by six runs. Batting first, Hyderabad rode on a 68-run second-wicket stand between opener Tanmay Agarwal (34) and No. 3 Tilak Varma (44) to score 153 for eight. In reply, Odisha made a spirited chase through Govinda Poddar 50, Subhransu Senapati (43 n.o.) and Rajesh Dhuper (30 n.o.), but fell agonisingly short.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/vivek-stars-in-bengals-win/article33563458.ece
13 January 2021||Sydney,||Bumrah out of Brisbane Test||The injury-ravaged Indian team was dealt another blow on Tuesday as pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah was ruled out of the fourth Test against Australia due to an abdominal strain. If that wasn't enough, Mayank Agarwal — tipped to be Hanuma Vihari's replacement in the playing XI in Brisbane — took a knock on his hands and is suspected to have sustained a hairline fracture. Ashwin in pain To make matters worse, R. Ashwin's back spasms have aggravated after battling for three hours on the final day, leaving few options for India on the bench. Bumrah, key to India's attack, sustained the strain during the drawn third Test in Sydney. It is learnt Bumrah's scan reports showed a strain and the team management does not want him to aggravate the injury, keeping in mind the upcoming four-Test series against England. The two-Test old Mohammed Siraj seems set to lead the Indian pace attack comprising Navdeep Saini, Shardul Thakur and T. Natarajan. Also worrying the team management is that after K.L. Rahul's departure and Hanuma Vihari's grade 2 tear, there are no back-up middle-order batsman left in the reserves. The only two available batsmen are out-of-form openers in Prithvi Shaw and Mayank. Depleted resources It remains to be seen if India, given the depleted resources and long tail, decides to take the conservative route of playing four bowlers and six batsmen with Rishabh Pant as the wicketkeeper. If Mayank's scans reveal a bruise and not a fracture, it could well be Prithvi Shaw batting at number three followed by Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajhinkya Rahane with Mayank at number six. And, the collective experience of the pace attack could well be three Tests and 10 balls (Siraj two, Saini one, Shardul 10 balls on debut, Natarajan yet to play).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bumrah-out-of-brisbane-test/article33563123.ece
13 January 2021||Sydney,||Paine regrets sledging Ashwin||Australia captain Tim Paine apologised on Tuesday for his “tirade” against R. Ashwin on the final day of the drawn Sydney Test. He said he was “bitterly disappointed” at his conduct. Paine said frustration got the better of him on Monday when he tried to unsettle Ashwin, who played a key role in India salvaging the draw. Bad leader “I want to apologise for the way I went about things yesterday... my leadership wasn’t good enough, I let the pressure of the game get to me,” Paine told reporters. Stump microphones picked up Paine making a series of verbal jabs at Ashwin. But the tail-ender was defiant and his unbeaten 39 helped keep the series level at 1-1. Paine acknowledged his actions undermined the goal he set himself when appointed Test captain in 2018 to revamp the team’s toxic culture after the ‘Sandpapergate’ ball-tampering scandal. Paine was also fined for dissent after an expletive-laden rant at umpire Paul Wilson on day two of the match. Smith’s antics Star batsman Steve Smith, who was Australia’s captain during the sandpaper cheating scandal, also attracted negative attention when footage suggested he scuffed up batsman Rishabh Pant’s guard at the crease. Paine said it was just part of Smith’s regular routine. “It’s one of his mannerisms, he was marking centre, he wasn’t by any stretch of the imagination trying to change guard or do anything like that,” he said. Looking the fool Paine dropped three catches during the epic final day, including a chance from Ashwin shortly after their exchange, which did not help his mood. “I ended up looking the fool didn’t I? You open your mouth and then you drop a catch,” he said. He said he spoke to Ashwin after the match and they joked about it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/paine-regrets-sledging-ashwin/article33563126.ece
13 January 2021||bangkok,||Saina, Prannoy cleared to play||Indian shuttlers Saina Nehwal and H.S. Prannoy were cleared to play in the Thailand Open after they tested negative for COVID-19 in the fourth round, invalidating their previous positive results that had forced them out of the tournament hours earlier on a chaotic Tuesday. Both the Badminton World Federation (BWF) and Badminton Association of India (BAI) confirmed the development. BAI intervenes “BAI took up the matter with top BWF officials to make sure that if the tests were negative, the players’ matches were rescheduled and no walkover was given,” said a BAI statement. “Saina, Prannoy and Jones Ralfy Jansen (Germany) had tested positive on the PCR test, but their antibody IgG was positive. A positive antibody test means a person has been infected with COVID-19 in the past. It does not mean they are currently infected,” BWF said in a statement. Earlier in the day, chaos gripped India’s campaign when Saina was forced out following a positive COVID-19 test, while Prannoy’s participation hung in the balance after his sample came out negative following a positive result in a bizarre turn of events. P. Kashyap, too, had been forced to withdraw “due to close proximity” with wife Saina. His participation will now depend on the result of another test. Sai Praneeth loses Meanwhile, on court, Denmark's Mia Blichfeldt shocked Rio Olympics silver medallist P.V. Sindhu 16-21, 26-24, 21-13 in the opening round. Sindhu, seeded sixth, lost to the World No. 18 in a 74-minute battle. In men's singles, World No. 13 B. Sai Praneeth lost 21-16, 21-10 to Thailand's Kantaphon Wangcharoen. The Indian mixed doubles pair of Satwik and Ashwini got the better of Indonesia’s Hafiz Faizal and Gloria Widjaja 21-11, 27-29, 21-16.  The results (first round):   Men: Kantaphon Wangcharoen bt Sai Praneeth 21-16, 21-10.   Women: Mia Blichfeldt bt P.V. Sindhu 16-21, 26-24, 21-13.

13 January 2021||CHENNAI,||Beginning of a new dawn, says Short||Grandmaster Nigel Short, the current vice-president of world chess body FIDE, has been quite vocal about the issues facing the sport in India. In 2019 he spoke strongly against the All India Chess Federation (AICF) as being anti-player and authoritarian. In an exclusive chat with The Hindu on Tuesday, the 55-year-old Brit welcomed the new AICF body. Short was happy that the impasse in the administration of Indian chess was finally over. “I am glad that the AICF had elections. It has been finally resolved through the ballot box and not through the courts. This is the beginning of a new dawn,” he said. Short welcomed AICF’s announcement of a new chess league. “I know that there was an idea a few years ago of starting an Indian Premier League for chess. That was torpedoed politically. It is better late than ever,” he said. Elite tournaments According to Short, India needs to organise elite tournaments, one which it did not focus on earlier. “There is an issue at the top-end. Not enough of really elite prestigious events. That is something that needs to be addressed,” he said. Short said AICF can run elite tournaments every year with good television coverage and equally good commentators. “Chess has reached the mainstream in other countries like Norway where they have chess on TV. It attracts a very large audience. It is not something that is impossible,” he said. FIDE, Short said, hasn’t found the perfect commercial model to attract sponsors, and that is one aspect that the world body is still not able to find all the answers for. “The model with which FIDE was run was the inverse of what a successful international sporting federation is like. We have not historically done that. “We have only partially succeeded in making the sport attractive to sponsors,” he admitted.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/beginning-of-a-new-dawn-says-nigel-short/article33563245.ece
13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||There are times when technique is less important than courage||Coaches are fond of saying that there is no substitute for proper technique in cricket. But there has always been a substitute: a large heart. You can either step out and drive a fast bowler in pursuit of victory or stay back and take blows on the body for a draw. That at one point in the Sydney Test India were going for a win is testimony to the character of this relatively young team. Then they had the resilience to hang on for a nail-biting draw. The triumph of hope over probability makes sporting contests memorable. The Oval analogy The last time India batted as long and with as much character to draw a Test was in 1979. Sunil Gavaskar made 221. But otherwise that Oval chase and this Sydney one are remarkably similar. At 366 for one (chasing 438), India were within sniffing distance of a stunning win. When the second wicket fell, skipper Venkatraghavan promoted a young Kapil Dev in order to do what Rishabh Pant did in Sydney. That change backfired, this one succeeded up to a point. Such are the vagaries of the game. Venkatraghavan lost his captaincy, Ajinkya Rahane is being hailed as a hero. Success and failure are often separated by a hair’s breadth. After the match, R. Ashwin’s wife Prithi tweeted that her husband had thrown his back and had been in “unbelievable” pain the previous night, adding he “could not bend down to tie his shoelaces.” It is a sign of the times that we get such information on social media and not from official sources. We must insist that players be allowed to take wives on tours! Be that as it may, Ashwin’s back will take its place alongside V.V.S. Laxman’s listing problem ahead of the Kolkata Test of 2001, Gavaskar’s toothache during his first double century in the West Indies, Anil Kumble’s broken jaw with which he bowled in the West Indies, Kapil Dev’s strained thigh and Dilip Doshi’s injured foot which didn’t prevent them from bowling Australia out for 83 and winning in Melbourne, and of course every one of Tiger Pataudi’s innings. There is something about this Indian team the country can be proud of. In the past individual players have stood up in the face of adversity and delivered. In this series the whole team has. To win a Test after being dismissed for 36 in the previous one is difficult enough. To bat through 97 overs in a day with just eight wickets in hand, one batsman injured previously and another in the course of the innings is the stuff of fairy tales. And sporting legends. Gritty Vihari Hanuma Vihari has shown bottle in the past; so has Ashwin. By batting through nearly 43 overs while struggling physically and under the double onslaught of the bowling and the sledging calls for the big heart we spoke of. There are times in Test cricket where technique is less important than courage — if Vihari writes his autobiography, he has a title right here! If Pant’s was one of the finest attacking innings on the last day of a Test, Vihari’s was one of the finest defending. Ashwin’s natural sense of timing showed through the cloud of tension, and it was a beautiful sight. Australia’s desperation was sad to see. Skipper Tim Paine has apologised saying his “leadership was not good enough.” Nor was his catching (he dropped three). Or his silent assent when two of his players crossed the line. There was Matthew Wade throwing the ball at the injured Vihari in the hope he would jump out of the way and make his injury worse. This was pathetic. Two sides of Smith Steve Smith once again displayed both the Jekyll and Hyde aspects of his character. His innings of 131 and 81 were a continuation of a masterclass he has been holding in the art of batting which is unique to himself. On the final day, he was seen erasing Pant’s guard at the crease. The childishness of the ploy does not take away from the fact that such things bring the game into disrepute. Will either Wade or Smith pay? Or be given a talking-to? Their actions weren’t illegal, but left a bad taste in the mouth. Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah have had to deal with racist taunts while fielding near the boundary. A team which has had to put up with isolation, injuries and long stays away from home doesn’t need to deal with racism too. India go into the final Test at Brisbane without two, maybe four of their Sydney eleven. Australia have not lost a Test there this century, winning 40 Tests while losing just eight. Under pressure they have shown a tendency to turn to the worst part of themselves. India will need a lot of heart.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/there-are-times-when-technique-is-less-important-than-courage/article33563121.ece

13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Music in temples||Musical instruments to be used during invocatory prayers are specified in the Pancharatra Agamas, said P.T. Seshadri in a discourse. Iswara Samhita says that jallari should be played for Vishnu; Kahala for Saraswathi, mardala for Chandra, tantri for Gandharvas, harsva mardala for Bhu Devi, pataha for Lakshmi, Kaamsya for Brahma. This is the rule to be followed during dwajarohana (hoisting of the flag) during Brahmotsava. Paadma Samhita says that during pradosha and during abhisheka, musical instruments must be played. When the deity is being decorated (alankarasana), worship through dance, veena and flute is required. In his Nitya grantha, Ramanujacharya says that during alankarasana, chinha, kaahala and beri must be played, and dance must be performed. When Brahmotsavam begins, the beri is struck. Once the beri is sounded, no one should leave the town until the Brahmotsavam concludes. Nine talas are mandated for beri — Ahvaana, pakshi, yushmat, mama, panchama, Indra, kumuda, Viswaksena and maatraadeena. During dwajarohana, khaga taala should be played on beri for Garuda, bali tala for Viswaksena, sama tala for Kumudan, malla tala for the five weapons of Vishnu, paddhava for Kumudakshan, malla tala for Vamana, mangala for Sankhukarna, jaya tala for Sarvanetra, Bhadra for Sumukha, and Adi for Agni. All devatas come to witness the Brahmotsavam. Paadma Samhita says sama tala is played in the East, paddhava in the South, malla in the South West etc. Manavala Mamunigal says that talas gajagarna, choragathi, Lakshmikirti, makharadwaja must be used for Thiruvaimozhi pasurams. Beri and dundubhi are mentioned in Vedanta Desika’s Yadavabhyudaya.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/music-in-temples/article33563114.ece

Srinivas stayed in the hunt for the National crown as he edged past a resurgent Mohammed Arif in the second knock-out round of the Indian online carrom challenge. Executing an ultimate slam in the fifth board that fetched him 10 positive points, Srinivas was able to keep his score to 13 over eight boards. Mohd. Arif looked set for a dramatic finish on the last board, but missed the last shot for the ultimate slam. The white slam brought the score down to 15 for Arif, while an ultimate slam could have reduced it to 10. In the final, Srinivas was scheduled to face Mohd. Ghufran. In the women’s event, S.

13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||NEUFC-BFC play out a draw again||Nothing much separated Bengaluru FC and NorthEast United when they met a month ago and played out a 2-2 draw. The two shared points in the return leg of the Indian Super League too at the Tilak Maidan Stadium, Vasco, on Tuesday, this time with a 1-1 result. After Luis Machado had put NorthEast ahead in the 27th minute, Rahul Bheke equalised for Bengaluru in the 49th. That meant there was no change in the ISL table, with Bengaluru lying sixth with 13 points, one more than the seventh-placed NorthEast, both having played 11 matches. Though both sides had come into the match looking for a victory, neither looked sharp enough to penetrate the rival defence in the early part. The deadlock was broken by some sloppy defending from Bengaluru. Federico Gallego won the ball, without too much of an effort, from Dimas Delgado, went past Juanan and seemed to have a go at the goal, but it turned out to be a perfect pass for Machado who slotted home. Bengaluru tried hard to cancel out the goal in the opening half itself and though it dominated possession in the final 15 minutes, NorthEast’s defence stood firm. Goalkeeper Gurmeet Singh came up with a superb save to deny Cleiton Silva on the goalline. Poor goalkeeping Bengaluru, however, didn't have to wait too long for the equaliser. The strike had more to do with poor goalkeeping than great shooting skills. Gurmeet should have been able to gather the 20-yarder from Rahul, but somehow let the ball through.  The result: NorthEast United 1 (Luis Machado 27) drew with Bengaluru FC 1 (Rahul Bheke 49).   Wednesday’s match: Odisha FC vs Chennaiyin FC, 7.30 p.m.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/neufc-bfc-play-out-a-draw-again/article33563188.ece

Smith revealed that he does it out of a conditioned reflex of trying to visualise and do a little shadow practice on the pitch. “It’s something I do in games to visualise where we are bowling, how the batter is playing our bowlers and then out of habit I always mark centre,” said Smith. “It’s such a shame that this and other events have taken away from what was a great batting performance by India,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/smith-denies-scuffing-pants-guard-mark/article33563127.ece

13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Kinetic curios at the park||A light breeze makes the leaves swirl, square objects rotate and chimes tinkle at DoScience, the experiential science centre corner in Sanjeevaiah Park in Hyderabad. Robust and metallic, these artistic kinetic wind sculptures captivate viewers as they gracefully spin in the wind. The centre, that has been fabricating its own Science models, wanted to explore more innovative concepts and take up an engineering challenge. “Greater Hyderabad Muncipal Corporation (GHMC), which had been looking to place unique models at traffic islands, got in touch with us,” informs Aparna Vishwanatham, co-founder, Bookmark Trust.  This resulted in the first of the creations — two wind sculptures, a butterfly design and a spinner with blades (akin to a fan) that were installed at Khairatabad and Telugu Talli flyover in November 2019. Having succeeded in creating two models that rotated on a horizontal axis, the team set out to make wind sculptures with vertical axis. After brainstorming about designs, a five-member team fabricated the exhibits — the team handles installation and outsources laser cutting and fine welding that needs large machinery— at a unit attached to their Science centre. The work on designs took off from June, 2020 (Unlock 1.0) and the team has created nine kinetic wind sculptures till now. Post the easing of lockdown, families trickling into the park are enamoured by these models built on aerodynamic forces. The wind-powered curved artistic metal pieces give rise to a sense of wonder, and also give children a headstart to Science. “Our core principle has been to initiate learning in a happy, informal way sans any age restriction. When we bring a science model into a public space, like a sculpture at a traffic island or in a park, it gets people talking about the art and the conversation around Science becomes mainstream,” points out Aparna. A light breeze with a minimum speed of 1.5 meters per second is enough for a rhombus wind sculpture to gently rotate. The sculpture needs maintenance once every three years. Aparna adds, “During research, we also found that these are commonly found internationally in public spaces and even houses (smaller, five-feet-tall ones) but are rare in India.” The main challenge to engineering a kinetic wind sculpture lies in its balance. Citing an example of kites, Aparna explains, “It is not just breeze that flies a kite; it needs to be built to balance forces required for the kite to stay up in the sky. One needs to engineer the forces for a movement so that they perform the function that you want them to.” With a range of colour schemes, these easy-to-install wind sculptures are also up for sale in Hyderabad and other cities, priced between Rs. 2.5 lakhs and Rs. 3.5 lakhs per unit range.  One can reach out by email to contact@doscience.co.in or call 9177202202.    Different wind sculptures Made of mild steel blades, The Windmills (17 feet high) has two windmill-like fans (diameters of eight feet and six feet), each rotating about the horizontal axis. Together, they rotate about the vertical axis. The Rhombus (two models — 8 ft 9 and 7 ft 2 in outer diagonal) is a nested square formed by two Ls and a central square. The three components rotate individually, about the vertical axis and require only a wind speed of 1.0 mps to gently move. The Butterflies (17 feet) has two fans with nine blades, each rotating about the horizontal axis. The two fans together rotate about the vertical axis. The Chimes has 16 rotating circular-ring stainless pipes with gongs The Helix and the Double Helix have 12x2 leaves (in the shape of DNA) and 15x2 leaves on 10-foot and 12-foot long poles. The leaves rotate about a vertical axis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/kinetic-curios-at-the-park/article33563593.ece
13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||Cinema’s new platforms||Malayalam actor Suraj Venjaramoodu has two movies releasing this Friday (January 15). Both are releasing on two new OTT platforms — The Great Indian Kitchen on Neestream and Vaakku on Prime Reels. OTT platforms dedicated to Malayalam content have entered the fray in a big way. While Prime Reels is a platform for new releases, Neestream has in store new Malayalam releases, web series, live TV and entertainment programmes in addition to a library of old movies. “Our plan is to have new releases every Friday and additional releases on special days. This will continue even after theatres reopen on Friday this week. We have seen films being taken out of theatres within a few days of release citing poor box office collection. However, a film will stream on Prime Reels for 45 days. It is like a theatre from home. The rate is Rs. 99 per movie if you make an advance booking and Rs. 149 after that. We have already entered into an agreement to stream eight films and are in talks with a dozen other producers,” says Thomas Sebastian, managing director of Kochi-based Prime Reels. Neestream too is planning new releases every Friday. “After we announced the release of The Great Indian Kitchen , there has been a rise in subscriber base. Now, besides the various subscription plans, we have a pay-per-view scheme where you have to pay for only the movie you want to watch. A couple of new web series are also under production,” says Charles George, regional head-Kerala, Neestream, owned by NeST Technologies Corp. The increase in new OTT platforms is attributed to the fact that ‘mainstream’ OTT platforms [read Netflix and Amazon Prime] have become selective about streaming original Malayalam content. Although Malayalam cinema scored on the OTT space during the lockdown, the situation is no longer the same. “Big stars and big banners have become the criteria for some of these platforms to purchase a Malayalam movie. That’s where the new platforms come into play,” says a filmmaker. When theatres reopen after a gap of nine months, there is a queue of over 80 movies that are ready for release. Also, 40-plus movies are in various stages of production. With several big films in the list, low-budget films would end up getting a limited number of screens. “It would have taken a year or so for our film to make it to theatres. We don’t regret the decision to have an OTT release since the film has been well-received,” says Satheesh Paul, director of Guardian, which dropped on Prime Reels on January 1. While Confessions of a Cuckoo, starring Durga Krishna, is currently streaming on this platform, Sumesh & Ramesh , with Sreenath Bhasi and Balu Varghese in the lead, releases on January 22. Jeo Baby, director of The Great Indian Kitchen , says that leading OTT platforms had their reservations about streaming his movie.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/cinemas-new-platforms/article33563590.ece
13 January 2021||January 13 2021 00:00 IST,||These Indophiles like it quirky||Samyukta Nair’s sleepwear label Dandelion has had a sombre, global aesthetic so far. Param Sahib’s design aesthetic, on the contrary, is more flamboyant and vibrant. He calls himself ‘the maximalist designer’ and his bridal wear is anything but subdued. When these two creative minds decided to collaborate, they knew they had to step out of their comfort zone and meet midway to roll out a collection that spells cheer. The new collection, called Hurrah Hindustan, marks Dandelion’s foray into daywear. Think loungewear that can be dressed up or down, to beat the blues of extended work-from-home routine. Coordinated pyjama sets, asymmetric jumpsuits, tiered and maxi dresses, ruffled shorts and kimono-inspired tops are all part of the line. Hurrah Hindustan’s USP are its quirky prints with motifs inspired by Indian history and culture. “We chose five prints — the ‘King of Hearts’, ‘Queen D of Dandelion’, ‘Technicolor’ prints inspired by tassels and ladi s, the ‘Elephant Whisperer’ with motifs inspired by elephants in royal processions of yore and temple visits, and ‘A Walk on the Wild Side’ where the motifs are reminiscent of old Indian stamps,” says Param. Samyukta and Param were clear that they wanted a home-grown collection which would be modern and yet rooted in Indian history: “We are Indophiles who take pride in Indian culture. It was challenging to give that nostalgia-tinted cultural ethos a modern twist,” says Samyukta. The sharing of ideas, and finalising of colour palette, silhouettes and prints mostly happened online as Mumbai-based Samyukta and Ludhiana and Delhi-based Param collaborated virtually during lockdown. “2020 forced everyone to look inward and emphasise more on the homefront. In India, sleepwear is a small segment and there is a tendency to wear something old. With a lot of people confined to home and wanting clothing that’s comfortable and cheery, there was a need to re-look sleepwear and loungewear,” says Samyukta. The relaxed silhouettes and pop of colour and prints, they hope, will find enough takers. The clothes are priced under Rs. 5,000: “We have used 100% cotton and the garments are easy to wash. The idea is not to buy too many clothes but buy ones that last long,” says Param.  Hurrah Hindustan is on dandeliondreams.co.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/these-indophiles-like-it-quirky/article33563596.ece
13 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Protesters plan to burn copies of contentious farm laws today||For 71-year-old Baljinder Singh from Ludhiana, this will be the first time that he will be away from home on Lohri, and the festivities don’t feel the same this year. This year, protesting farmers have planned to burn copies of the three controversial farm laws on Lohri. ‘Not missing home’ “I’ll be away from my family for the first time but I am not missing home. My wife, son and daughter-in-law told me to come back after winning the battle,” Mr. Baljinder said, adding that they’ll all celebrate at the Singhu border like a family on Wednesday. “We will burn the copies of the law in protest”. Baljit Singh, committee member of the All India Kisan Sabha and stage management committee member, said that they have given a message to farmers across the country — those who celebrate Lohri — to burn copies of the laws. “We have asked farmers in villages to burn copies of the laws and also discuss how they can contribute to the protest in as many way as possible,” he said. Part of tradition Mr. Baljit said that the reason for the call to burn the copies is because as tradition, they throw black sesame seeds in the fire as a symbol of burning bad elements. “For us, there’s nothing worse than the laws. Hence, along with the black seasame seeds, copies of the law will also be burnt”. At the Singhu border on Wednesday, farmer leaders said that logs of wood will be placed at various places across the long stretch and peanuts, revdi , and popcorn have been brought from villages to be thrown into the fire as part of the tradition. “Kilos of popcorn and peanuts have been brought from villages for Lohri. People from a village have brought their own trolleys. We all, however, will share,” said Manpreet Singh, 60, from Ludhiana. ‘No reason to celebrate’ While the spirit of festivities was visibly absent among protesting farmers, some at least said they would celebrate with their newly formed families and friends at the protest site.  However, there were some who said they won’t. “Nearly 70 people have died so far because of these laws, what’s there to celebrate. I don’t think I will celebrate but wish well all who will,” said Inderpal Singh, 50, from Hoshiarpur. Rupinder Singh, 45, from Ludhiana shared the same sentiment and said Lohri doesn’t hold anything special for him this year. If the laws are not repealed then I am ready to spend all festivals here,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/protesters-plan-to-burn-copies-of-contentious-farm-laws-today/article33563339.ece
13 January 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Repeal farm laws, say Cong., AAP||Following the Supreme Court’s decision to stay the implementation of the three farm laws, leaders of the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party in Punjab pushed for the repeal of the legislations. The State BJP leaders have urged farmers to withdraw their ongoing agitation. ‘Centre’s arrogance’ Congress Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa said he was disappointed with the arrogance of the Central government. “The fact is that the Supreme Court should not be stepping in to hold laws in abeyance. I am shocked at the lengths the Government of India will go to ignore Parliament and, through that, the will of the people,” he said in a statement. “I again urge the Central government to repeal these Acts and bring a new set of laws that can be scrutinised by a select committee. The farmer unions have made it clear that they will not stop their protests and will not appear in front of the committee as set up by the Supreme Court... this is a result of the four members that are a part of the committee. The majority of these members have written publicly in favour of these farming laws. Given their statements, I would be hard pressed to believe that they would be neutral arbiters,” he added. AAP’s Punjab president and Lok Sabha MP Bhagwant Mann said the party fully supported the demands made by the farmers. ‘No compromise’ “The party does not want any compromise with the self-respect of the farmers and the only way to overcome the deadlock is to repeal the black agricultural laws; forming a committee is not a permanent solution,” Mr. Mann said in a statement. Mr. Mann alleged that most of the people included in the committee were representatives of the Central government. “We want the abrogation of anti-farmer black laws. Whether the Supreme Court revokes them or the Central government, we have nothing to do with it. All we need is the cancellation of these laws,” he said. Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma appealed to farmers to call off their protest in view of the Supreme Court directions. Mr. Sharma said that the fears of farmers about the discontinuation of Minimum Support Price or the ‘mandi’ system were completely unfounded.

13 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Doval spurs youth to take nation-building path||National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval on Tuesday said that the youth of India is bursting with energy to march ahead with patriotism and that if they put their collective energy towards nation building, they could transform India and the world at large. ‘A visionary’ Mr. Doval was delivering the first Swami Vivekananda Memorial Lecture at Jawaharlal Nehru University. The lecture marked the culmination of a week-long Swami Vivekananda Youth festival that was organised at the university. Mr. Doval said that Swami Vivekananda was a revolutionary young monk and a visionary who was the first to make the world look towards India and realise the glory of Hinduism. “It was Swami Vivekananda who made a multitude of Indians believe in themselves and take responsibility for their destiny that ultimately led to India’s Independence,” said the National Security Adviser. He added that at the time when Swami Vivekananda was propagating his message, the country was politically saturated, economically impoverished, socially fragmented and psychologically stunned to silence and his message helped people look towards a better future with hope and a belief that it can be changed. Jawaharlal Nehru University Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar said that Swami Vivekananda has often spoken about the importance of education, the role of the youth in nation building and integrating Indian spiritualism with modern progress. “When all of us are trying to build a sustainable world with inclusive growth, based on Indian ethos, the teachings of Swamijibecome all the more important today,” Mr. Kumar said. Last year, a statue of Swami Vivekananda was unveiled at the Administration Block of JNU by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The statue stands on the opposite side of ‘Freedom Square’, where a statue of Jawaharlal Nehru stands — built with the help of contributions from the university alumni.  It was Swami Vivekananda who made a multitude of Indians believe in themselves and take responsibility for their destiny that ultimately led to India’s Independence Ajit Doval National Security Adviser||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/doval-spurs-youth-to-take-nation-building-path/article33563337.ece
13 January 2021||Patna,||Ruckus at Bihar Congress office||Discontent within the Bihar Congress over its dismal performance in last year’s Assembly election spilled over on Tuesday as the party’s new State in-charge Bhakta Charan Das visited the party office in Patna. A video of a scuffle between party leaders and disgruntled workers at Mr. Das’s meeting has gone viral on social media, capturing scenes of the ruckus amid slogan shouting against him. The party had convened a meeting of its Kisan Morcha (farmer’s cell) to discuss the plans to organise a march to Raj Bhawan on January 15 against the three new farm laws. However, soon after the meeting began, some party leaders started shouting slogans against Mr. Das and party’s dismal electoral performance. It soon escalated into physical violence with some farm leaders throwing chairs, leading to pushing and shoving, with Mr. Das caught between the two groups. The protesting leaders raised slogans and waved banners against Mr. Das, which said “ Dalal bhagao, Congress bachao (Chase away brokers and save Congress)”. In the video, senior leaders like Bhagalpur MLA Ajit Sharma can be seen trying to pacify the protesters but in vain. Mr. Das was later escorted out by senior leaders. ‘Protesters not from farmer’s cell’ “Those who were protesting were outsiders. They were not from party’s farmer’s cell. We’re identifying those who broke party’s discipline and will take action against them,” Mr. Das later told media persons. BJP took potshots on the issue. Party spokesperson Nikhil Anand said, “Now the Congress has lost all its political relevance in Bihar.” Earlier on Monday, when Mr. Das had visited the State party headquarters, Sadaqat Ashram, for the first time, party leaders including Janardan Sharma and Sanjiv Kumar Toni accused senior leaders of partiality in ticket distribution in the Assembly election. When some party leaders tried to pacify them, a scuffle took place with Mr. Das watching. The new chief has said he looks upon Bihar as his “ karm bhoomi” . Mr Das was appointed after party leader Shaktisinh Gohil expressed his inability to continue on health grounds.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/ruckus-at-bihar-congress-office/article33563333.ece
13 January 2021||New Delhi,||3 of family held for stealing jewellery from shop||Three members of a family have been arrested for allegedly stealing gold jewellery from a shop in south Delhi’s Chhatarpur, the police said on Tuesday. The accused: Mithlesh, 55, her 21-year-old daughter Durgeshwari and son Chirag, 19, are from Madangir. They would usually target elderly shopkeepers at jewellery stores, said the police. The complainant, Shambhu Dayal, on December 25, 2020, said two women came to his shop and asked him to show them some earrings. After looking at some earring, they left the shop without buying anything. Later, the shopkeeper found that one box of earrings was missing. On watching the CCTV footage, he saw that the women stole the box, which weighed 50g. DCP (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said the CCTV footage of the shop and nearby spots were analysed and it was revealed that the two women had arrived at the shop with a man on a red scooty, who was waiting outside the jewellery store. “During the investigation, it was revealed that the scooty had crossed the border and reached Sikanderpur. This route was taken to mislead the police. But on checking the details of the scooty, our team managed to reach Madangir from where the offending vehicle was traced,” he said. The three accused were nabbed soon after. All three of them have criminal backgrounds, the police said. The woman’s husband and two elder sons are involved in more than eight criminal cases, including murder, robbery, snatching and thefts, said Mr. Thakur. The vehicle and stolen jewellery have been recovered from the accused. Mithlesh was earlier arrested in 2013 in a case of murder.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/3-of-family-held-for-stealing-jewellery-from-shop/article33563341.ece
13 January 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi’s air ‘poor’; may worsen today||The air quality of Delhi, Gurugram, and Noida was in the “poor” category on Tuesday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. The national capital’s air quality is expected to deteriorate in the next few days. “The AQI is likely to slip from ‘poor’ to the lower end of ‘very poor’ tomorrow Jan. 13]. Lower to middle end of the ‘very poor’ category is forecasted for January 14. The AQI is likely to further deteriorate on January 15 to the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category due to calm winds and extremely low ventilation condition,” said government-run monitoring agency System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). The effect of stubble burning on the city’s air quality remained low on Tuesday. Also, the speed of surface-level winds was “high”, which aided in dispersion of pollutants. But the “mixing layer height”, which is the height from the ground level up to which pollutants can be dispersed, was “moderate”. This led to lesser accumulation of pollutants near the surface.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/delhis-air-quality-may-worsen-today/article33563340.ece
13 January 2021||GUWAHATI,||Cong. leader alleges ‘injustice’ to STs, OBCs in Assam||Assam Congress Legislature Party leader Debabrata Saikia has written to the National Human Rights Commission alleging “gross injustice” to the people from some Scheduled Tribe and Other Backward Class communities. He cited the examples of 1,300 families of “forest villages” facing eviction from Dibru-Saikhowa National Park and 1,500 families set to lose their farmlands in Mikir Bamuni Grant because of a private solar power project. In his petition to the NHRC, Mr. Saikia said the State government was going back on its promise of suitably rehabilitating the people and trying to evict them. He also drew the NHRC’s attention to the government’s move to evict primarily Karbi (ST) and Adivasi (OBC) communities from Mikir Bamuni Grant. The land is to be handed over to a private solar power company.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cong-leader-alleges-injustice-to-sts-obcs-in-assam/article33563332.ece
