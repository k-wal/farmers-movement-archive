05 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Seventh round of talks with farm unions ends in stalemate||The seventh round of talks between Union Ministers and protesting farm unions on Monday failed to resolve the deadlock over three new agricultural reform laws. Both sides stuck to their own positions and accused the other of stubbornness, with the Centre seeking to discuss specific concerns on the laws and the farmers demanding total repeal. The next meeting will be held on January 8. Tens of thousands of farmers have now completed 40 days of agitation on the borders of Delhi, braving bitter cold and pouring rain over the last few days. “There will be no ghar vapasi (return home) until the laws are repealed,” Rakesh Tikait, leader of one factions of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, vowed after the meeting with Union ministers. Although the 41 union representatives and three Central ministers were closeted in the conference centre of Vigyan Bhavan for four hours, an extended lunch break — during which the ministers held internal consultations — took up almost half that time. The meeting began with the attendees observing two minutes’ silence to pay respects to the more than 50 protestors who have died over the course of the agitation. Farm unions also urged the Centre to condemn the “brutality” of the Haryana Police, which had used tear gas and chilli grenades on a group of protestors who broke through barricades on the Delhi-Jaipur highway on Sunday. During the first hour, the ministers listed the benefits of the three laws, saying they would bring more marketing choices for farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/seventh-round-of-talks-with-farm-unions-ends-in-stalemate/article33497631.ece
05 January 2021||New Delhi,||Biggest COVID-19 vaccination programme set to begin: PM||The world’s biggest inoculation drive against COVID-19 is set to begin in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday, a day after India’s drugs regulator approved two vaccines for restricted emergency use. Lauding scientists and technicians for the ‘Made in India’ vaccines, he said the country was proud of them. “World’s biggest COVID-19 vaccination programme set to begin in India. For this, the country is proud of the contributions of its scientists and technicians,” he said. India’s drugs regulator on Sunday approved Oxford University’s COVID-19 vaccine Covishield, made by the Serum Institute of India, and the indigenously developed Covaxin, of Bharat Biotech, for restricted emergency use, paving the way for a massive inoculation drive. Addressing scientists at the National Metrology Conclave, Mr. Modi said it must be ensured the ‘Made in India’ products not only have a global demand but also global acceptance. “Quality is as much important as quantity; our standards should rise with our scale in our quest for ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’,” he stressed. The PM said that in any progressive society, research was key, and its effects were commercial and social. “We do not want to fill the world with Indian products, but we must win the hearts of every customer of Indian products in every corner of the world.” Quality of services in our country and products, from the public and private sectors, will determine India’s strength in the world. He pointed out that, historically, countries had progressed in direct correlation to their effort to promote science.

05 January 2021||January 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Low-cost train service from city to KIA now a reality||The much-awaited local train services from Bengaluru city to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) commenced on Monday morning as the first train left KSR Bengaluru at 4.45 a.m and reached the newly built halt station near the airport around 6 a.m. The South Western Railway (SWR) also operated a new train service from Yelahanaka to the KIA. The SWR is now operating five pairs of trains on the route. The inaugural service from the city to the airport was a low-key affair. Along with some passengers, rail activists, senior officials of the SWR, Member of Parliament P.C. Mohan and security staff travelled in the first train. The SWR sold a total of 34 tickets for the first trip. The SWR provides a stoppage at the halt station for two minutes. The newly built halt station is 230 metres long and is located on the north-west corner of the airport. The halt station has various amenities, including a ticket counter, granite seating, toilets, coffee shop, drinking water and security system. A Passenger Information System displaying flight departure has been displayed at the station. Opposite to the ticket counter, a mural titled ‘Many beats, one dance’ depicting various mudras and dance movements catches the eye. For the benefit of passengers, the BIAL has built a connecting road and operates a free shuttle bus service from the halt station to the terminal area. The distance is covered in 10 minutes. The BIAL has identified three stops to drop off employees before reaching the terminal area. Divisional Railway Manager Ashok Kumar Verma said, “At present, there are a total of 10 train services on the route that include three new pairs of trains from the City to Devanahalli. The schedule of these three pairs of trains has been fixed based on BIAL’s suggestion. We are open to running more trains based on patronage in the coming days.” Ticket prices Ticket prices range from Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 depending on the route - a far cry from the Rs. 700 to Rs. 800 it would cost by taxi from Majestic to the Airport, and Rs. 240 for the same distance by Vayu Vajra buses. The DRM said in future, people can also buy monthly passes to travel in these trains: “Once the Railways give the green signal to resume train services across the country, we will start issuing passes and regular travellers on this route also can buy passes and travel to the airport.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/low-cost-train-service-from-city-to-kia-now-a-reality/article33498115.ece

As per the release, over 2,800 km of fibre optical cables will be installed, in parallel to underground distribution cables, to strengthen communication network. Pushing some 7,200 km of distribution lines underground is expected to reduce technical and commercial losses by 30%. The project would install 1,700 automated ring main units adapted with a distribution automation system (DAS) to monitor and control the distribution line switch gears from the control centre. The fibre optical cables would be used for smart metering systems, distribution automation system in the distribution grid, and other communication networks said the statement. According to the ministry statement, the loan will strengthen the capacity of the Bescom in operation and maintenance of underground cabling, environment and social safeguards, financial management and commercial financing. “Improved financial management capability will help Bescom access domestic and international commercial financing market,” it further said. In addition to $100 million sovereign loan, ADB would also offer another $90 million loan without a sovereign guarantee for the project to Bescom.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/rs-730-crore-adb-loan-to-modernise-bengalurus-power-distribution-system/article33498117.ece
05 January 2021||MYSURU,||As active cases dip in State, three districts buck the trend||December saw active COVID-19 caseload continuing to slump across Karnataka, except in districts like Mysuru, Kodagu, and Chickballapur where the numbers remained more or less steady or registered a marginal increase. The number of active cases in the State started to fall from mid-October, when it reached a high of 1.2 lakh, before reaching around 55,000 by October-end, and 23,279 by November-end. The decline continued in December with 11,271 active cases on December 31, which was roughly around the same level in early July. The biggest dip was seen in Bengaluru Urban, where numbers fell from a high of 66,000 during mid-October to 34,459 by October-end, and 17,248 by November-end, before reaching 7,233 on December 31. Decrease in infections While the consistent decline has been attributed to a dip in daily infections and a healthy discharge rate, the active cases in Mysuru, Kodagu, and Chickballapur have remained more or less steady during December. In Mysuru, the active cases, which reached around 8,200 in early October, slid to 1,633 by October-end before reaching 355 by November-end. However, no remarkable change was observed during December when the caseload increased to 442 on December 31. Similarly, Kodagu’s caseload, which reached around 780 in mid-October, came down to 207 by the end of October, before reaching 78 by November-end. But, December saw it rise marginally and reached 99 by December 31. In Chickballapur, the caseload that breached the 2,000-mark in mid-October came down to 336 by the end of October, and 178 by November-end. However, December saw the numbers remaining steady and by December 31, the numbers had reached 222. Similiarly, the cases in Chamarajanagar district remained more or less the same – 79 and 80 – on November 30 and December 31 respectively. Chidambara, an official from the Department of Health and Family Welfare in Mysuru, who is monitoring COVID-19 testing in the district, said the reason behind the number of active cases in Mysuru not dipping during December was the vigorous screening, increased testing, and quality surveillance by the health officials. “The number of tests in Mysuru continue to range between 4,000 and 6,000 and even reached almost 10,000 last week owing to testing for teachers and students,” he said. “In a viral outbreak, the cases will only plateau and will not reach zero,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/as-active-cases-dip-in-state-three-districts-buck-the-trend/article33497775.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy dubbed it a form of ‘guerrilla warfare’ by the divisive forces with a hidden agenda to defame the government. Mr. Reddy expressed anguish throughout his address delivered after the virtual inauguration of IGNITE 2020, the 63rd Andhra Pradesh State Police Duty Meet here on Monday. As the four-day event is scheduled to deliberate on the ways and means to strengthen the department’s effective functioning on various fronts, the Chief Minister said the meet should also take up for discussion the ways to curtail such negative campaign and lies spread through the social media with a ‘political motive’. “The department should prepare itself to handle such political guerilla warfare,” he said in his address via web. ‘Planned attacks’ Expressing concern over the instances of defacement of religious structures being projected as ‘government’s failure’, he wondered how such events occurring at the dead of the night in private temples tucked somewhere in the hinterland or on the hilltop could be attributed to the government. Finding a pattern in the way the attacks had happened, he said all of them were timed around the launch of the State government’s prestigious welfare programmes, in an apparent bid to eclipse the ‘good news’. He cited over half a dozen instances when such destructive events propped up in the social media around the time some major scheme was launched. According to him, the hoax on Durga temple destruction in Guntur was floated during the launch of Nadu Nedu, desecration of statues in Pithapuram timed with the launch of price stabilisation scheme for farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/curtail-guerrilla-warfare-by-opposition-jagan-tells-police/article33497622.ece

According to the circular, schoolteachers should inform the students in advance about the books and notebooks to be brought to school on a particular day and frequently check their bags to ensure that they are not carrying unnecessary material.

It adds that the teachers should take the responsibility of checking the weight of school bags of the students every three months on a day selected for the whole class and any information about heavy bags should be communicated to the parents. Drinking water facility To reduce the weight of the school bag, the circular says that it is the duty and the responsibility of the school management to provide quality potable water in sufficient quantity to all the students in the school so that they do not need to carry water bottles from their homes. “Heavy school bags are a serious threat to the health and well-being of students. The heavy school bag has severe/adverse physical effects on growing children which can cause damage to their vertebral column and knees,” the circular reads. “Heads of Schools under the Directorate of Education are hereby directed to adhere to the revised guidelines to reduce the weight of school bags for students in Primary, Secondary and Senior Secondary Schools,” the notice says. It adds that files and thin/light exercise books should be preferred to thick/heavy ones.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/doe-circular-asks-teachers-to-check-weight-of-school-bags/article33498178.ece
05 January 2021||MANGALURU,||Two endosulfan victims continue to wait for stipend dues||Eight months into writing a petition to the Karnataka State Human Rights Commission (KSHRC) over dues of monthly stipend, bedridden endosulfan victims, Trupti and her brother, Mithun alias Dinesh, from Kadeshwalaya village of Bantwal taluk, are yet to see any benefit. It was in March 2017 that Trupti and Mithun were identified as endosulfan victims. As both were found with profound mental retardation, orders were passed to grant monthly stipend of Rs. 3,000 to Trupti and Mithun from 2014. The stipend were to be deposited in the bank account of their mother Yamuna. The two received the first instalment of the stipend of Rs. 12,000 each on February 2, 2018. Subsequently, Rs. 3,000 was paid every month in the name of Trupti till August, 2018. Two monthly stipend of Rs. 1,400 each in the name of Trupti were deposited in December 2020. Monthly stipend of Rs. 3,000 in the name of Mithun was paid till January 2019. Following report of the health staff who visited their house, stipend of Rs. 1,400 was deposited in the name of Mithun in Ms. Yamuna’s account in the post office from November 2019 to July 2020 and stipend of Rs. 3,000 each from August 2020 to December 2020 was paid. In response to a petition on dues in payment of stipend, Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra submitted on November 29 to KSHRC that action has been taken to resolve technical glitches and clear all dues to Trupti and Mithun. He also enclosed the related report submitted by the Bantwal Tahsildar. Submitting a rejoinder to Mr. Rajendra’s statement, Ms. Yumana told KSHRC that the State government was yet to clear dues from 2014 till the release of the first instalment. The government is silent on payment of stipend for the months that were missed. “I am mentally drained in taking care of my children. As I have lost strength in visiting offices for stipend, I plead to you to arrange for timely payment of stipend,” she said and sought action against officials responsible for irregular payment of stipend.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/two-endosulfan-victims-continue-to-wait-for-stipend-dues/article33498309.ece
05 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Central Vista: Supreme Court to pronounce judgment today||The Supreme Court will on Tuesday pronounce judgment on various petitions challenging the redevelopment project of the Central Vista area here. A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar, while reserving the case for judgment in early November 2020, had said the court would examine whether the project complied with land use and environmental regulations peculiar to the area which houses Parliament and Central Secretariat buildings. It had also indicated that it may not have to fully accept the submissions made by the petitioners that there was a prohibition on building new structures.  Foundation stone laid On December 7, the Supreme Court had allowed the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the new Parliament building on December 10 after the government gave an undertaking to keep in abeyance any construction or demolition of buildings and shifting of trees and wait for the verdict. The SC had expressed its displeasure with the Centre for “aggressively” continuing with the construction, demolition and shifting of trees even as the questions concerning the legality of the project were in court. The government has defended its redevelopment plan saying that the existing building was under tremendous pressure and not a brick of the heritage structures will be touched while constructing the new Parliament.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/central-vista-supreme-court-to-pronounce-judgment-today/article33498179.ece

05 January 2021||CHENNAI,||T.N. permits theatres to screen movies with full seating capacity||The Tamil Nadu government on Monday said movie halls in the State will be permitted to screen movies at full seating capacity. Though the State government allowed cinema halls to reopen with 50% seating capacity in November last year, movie fans did not return to theatres in large numbers for several reasons. While the risk of contracting COVID-19 was one of the reasons, the theatres weren’t able to screen new releases as producers were reluctant to release their movies with just 50% capacity. With the number of COVID-19 cases steadily falling in the State, a Government Order said that the Tamil Theatres and Multiplex Owners Association had placed a request with the State government to allow them to increase the capacity from 50% to a full house. The theatres will be permitted to screen movies with full capacity by following all the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The decision is expected to open the flood gates in the industry as a number of big budget movies, including actor Vijay’s Master and actor Dhanush’s Jagame Thandhiram , are slated for release.  In wait-and-watch mode A majority of theatre owners are expected to allow full occupancy in cinema halls from Pongal, adhering to the SOPs laid down by the government. However, some of them said they would restrict it to 70%-80%. “We don’t want to take chances [in view of COVID-19 spread]. We will sell only 70% of our tickets,” said a theatre owner in Chennai. “Fans who walk in shout, laugh and they breathe in and out. Considering all these factors we want to be cautious. Like hotels, we don’t want to see another COVID-19 cluster here. And if anything goes wrong, then all theatres will be under the scanner,” he said. Even now, almost 400 theatres have not resumed operations and are in a wait-and-watch mode. Those who are operating are yet to bring back their entire workforce.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tn-permits-theatres-to-screen-movies-with-full-seating-capacity/article33497684.ece
05 January 2021||Staff Reporter Mumbai,||Congress set to get new head in Maharashtra||Maharashtra Congress is set to undergo a leadership change with the current State unit president and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat having been asked to tender his resignation. Mr. Thorat, who was in Delhi on Monday, was unavailable for comment. According to sources, he has offered to resign. The rejig in Maharashtra is said to be part of the attempt to revive the party and to present a more aggressive face. The party’s central leadership is reportedly unhappy with the State leaders who were found to be on the defensive about their lacklustre performance in the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, where the other two partners are Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Recently United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi had to write to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray about the common minimum program (CMP) and the budgetary provisions for Scheduled Tribe and Scheduled Caste communities. Among the top contenders for the post of State unit president are ministers in the MVA government Nitin Raut (Power), Sunil Kedar (Animal Husbandry), Amit Deshmukh (Medical Education), Yashomati Thakur (Women and Child Welfare), Vijay Vadettiwar (Relief and Rehabilitation), and former Maharashtra Congress chief Manikrao Thakre and former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/congress-set-to-get-new-head-in-maharashtra/article33498336.ece
05 January 2021||London,||Assange’s extradition to U.S. rejected by U.K. court||A British judge on Monday blocked the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to the United States to face espionage charges, finding that he was at serious risk of suicide. District judge Vanessa Baraitser said the 49-year-old Australian publisher’s actions in leaking secret documents went “well beyond” that of a journalist, and he would have been “well aware” of the dangers the leak posed.  But facing the “harsh conditions” likely in the U.S. jail system, Mr. Assange’s mental health would deteriorate, “causing him to commit suicide” with the determination of a person with autism spectrum disorder, she ruled, siding with a diagnosis by psychologists. Inside the Old Bailey Court in central London, Mr. Assange wiped his forehead as the decision was announced while his fiancee Stella Moris burst into tears and was embraced by WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson. Ms. Moris, who has two young sons with Mr. Assange, said the ruling was “a victory” but she would not celebrate until he was free and also appealed to United States President Donald Trump.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/assanges-extradition-to-us-rejected-by-uk-court/article33497628.ece
05 January 2021||New Delhi,||Repeal law permitting seizure of livestock: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to “delete” its three-year-old law which allowed seizure and subsequent confiscation of livestock from people who depended on these animals for a livelihood, even before they were found guilty of cruelty towards them. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde warned the government that it would “stay” the implementation of a 2017 law, which allowed authorities to seize cattle on a mere suspicion that they suffered cruel treatment at the hands of their owners or were being primed for slaughter. These animals, the law prescribes, would then be lodged in gaushalas as “case property” to await the court’s verdict. In short, a farmer, a livestock owner or a cattle trader loses his animals before being found guilty of the charge of cruelty. “Understand one thing here... These animals, and I am not talking about pet dogs and cats, are a source of livelihood. You cannot just seize and keep them confiscated like that... Your rules are plainly contrary to Section 29 of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, under which only a person convicted of cruelty can lose his animal. You either delete this (rule) or we will stay it,” Chief Justice Bobde told Additional Solicitor General Jayant K. Sud, appearing for the Centre.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/repeal-law-permitting-seizure-of-livestock-sc/article33497629.ece

05 January 2021||UDHAGAMANDALAM,||Carcasses from goshala for Mudumalai’s scavengers||To increase the availability of food for vultures in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), the Forest Department is allowing dead cattle from a goshala (cow shelter) located nearby to be left for the scavengers. The goshala is located in Mavanallah, in the MTR buffer zone. The decision was taken after conducting a thorough study, along with field inspections. Medical records and veterinarians from the Animal Husbandry Department confirmed that the goshala was not using Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) that are harmful to wildlife, including vultures. Mudumalai is home to three critically endangered, and one endangered, species of vultures. B. Ramakrishnan, assistant professor, Department of Zoology and Wildlife Biology at the Government Arts College, Udhagamandalam, justified the decision. “Consent was given only after visits to the goshala over a period of many months by researchers and Forest Department officials, after the perusal of their medical records, [and of] lists of drugs used to treat cattle, and after consultations with local veterinarians who treat the cattle there,” he said. “The breeding success of vultures can vary due to a number of factors, with the most important being food availability,” Mr. Ramakrishnan said. A pair of mating vultures may even abandon their nest due to a lack of food, he pointed out. “It is for this reason that this initiative may prove to be extremely important,” said S. Bharathidasan, secretary of Arulagam, a conservation NGO which has been working on vulture conservation in the Sigur plateau. According to him, each month, two or three of the cattle at the goshala die of natural causes. Only those cattle that die of old age and natural causes will be left to the scavengers. “The goshala is incredibly well-run and has maintained meticulous records for its cattle, which made this effort even possible,” said Mr. Bharathidasan. The carcasses will be left inside the huge property of the goshala itself, which is away from human habitation and has a regular movement of forest staff, said S. Manigandan, a research scholar studying vultures from the Government Arts College in Udhagamandalam. The breeding season for vultures starts from November and extends to March. MTR Field Director K.K. Kaushal said other species such as wild boar, dhole and the striped hyena, would also benefit from the initiative.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/carcasses-from-goshala-for-mudumalais-scavengers/article33497636.ece

05 January 2021||Bengaluru,||HDK promises major party rehaul ahead of Sankranti||Amidst rumours of alleged “tacit understanding” with the ruling BJP and under pressure due to successive electoral defeats post-2018, Janata Dal (Secular) appears set for a organisational rehaul. Party leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Monday announced dissolution of all party posts, except the post of president, and formation of a core committee comprising senior leaders to decide on all important issues. Blueprint ready The blueprint for the party’s restructuring, he said, is ready and will be unveiled before Sankranti. “A core committee will be formed at the State-level to monitor activities. Separately, representatives from all the 224 constituencies will be drawn into the central party office and attendance in monthly meeting will be mandatory for those in the central team. Similar structures would be set up at district and taluk levels,” the former Chief Minister said. “Apart from strongholds and potential areas, organisation structures will be set up in places where party is weak or has no base. Identity card will be given to party workers.” His announcement at the Yuva Janata Dal (S) meeting here on Monday came a day after he attacked BJP over the issue of alliance, and close on the heels of gram panchayat poll results. While both Mr. Kumaraswamy and party State President H.K. Kumaraswamy claimed party’s performance had been good in the GP elections, it comes in the backdrop of BJP claiming major inroads into Old Mysore region, the traditional stronghold of JD(S). Early start “To prepare the party for the 2023 elections and the immediate elections for the taluk and zilla panchayat, it is necessary that party is strengthened,” Mr. Kumaraswamy argued. He said that “JD (S) era” could begin in 2023 if hard work is put in over the next two years. In the restructuring process, an organising secretary, general secretary and vice president will be appointed to each of the four revenue divisions, he added. Urging the party workers and office bearers not to lose morale over the defeat in byelections to the Assembly, he said that trends in general elections will be different. Mr. Kumaraswamy said that he had already planned five key programmes to be implemented if the party is voted to power in 2023. Earlier, Mr. H.K. Kumaraswamy claimed that party-backed candidates both in Old Mysore region and North Karnataka had done well. “In Sira where we recently lost in the byelections, party-backed candidates have done exceedingly well. We can give the list of candidates and panchayats,” he added. Yuva JD(S) president K. Nikhil claimed that Mandya voters had not let the party down, and 70% to 80% of winning candidates were backed by JD(S).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hdk-promises-major-party-rehaul-ahead-of-sankranti/article33497958.ece
05 January 2021||Hyderabad,||Experts roped in to track loan app transactions||The probe into app-based instant loan companies’ harassment of borrowers widened with the Hyderabad police roping in financial experts and data analysts to pour into voluminous data pertaining to 1.40 crore loan transactions involving nearly Rs. 21,000 crore, apart from cryptocurrency. Experts have been mandated to follow the money trail and zero in on the ultimate recipients. The investigators, who were initially shocked by the volume of money involved in the fraud, started examining the leverage effect of these 1.40 crore financial transactions as most of them were highly leveraged. The financial gearing is so humongous that one entry had given rise to geometric progression of step down transactions, said Hyderabad Additional Commissioner of Police (Crimes and SIT) Shikha Goel. “We have taken financial experts and data analysts on board who can help us unravel the huge number,” she said, adding that they are using certain financial softwares to decode the huge number. She said that it is too early to say if these transactions were meant only for loan disbursement, repayment or there are any other reasons, including merchants or money circulation.  Multiple circulation “The volume of the amount provided by the Razorpay gateway pertaining to four companies may not be the small loans which people have taken, there may be other multi-circulation,” Ms.Goel said. Now, the investigators have to study if multiple transactions were happening at the same time and if the same money was moving. “Each of this gets recorded as a different transaction. But, the actual amount involved in the fraud will come out once we remove the duplication, and follow the money trail,” the officer said, adding that the amount might be higher or much lesser. The 1.40 crore transactions happened over payment gateways and bank accounts linked to the accused companies and a large number of international transactions also happened through bitcoins, Ms.Goel said, adding that the bulk of transactions have taken place over the last six months. The officers are also probing whether there were any hawala transactions. At least five people have committed suicide in the State over online loan harassment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/experts-roped-in-to-track-loan-app-transactions/article33497540.ece
05 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Tractors roll in for R-Day parade||While talks were underway between farmer leaders and Union Ministers in central Delhi on Monday, protesters at the Singhu border were gearing up for the January 26 tractor parade. “We have wanted to end the protest since the day we came here but the Central government will not agree [to repeal controversial farm laws] and so, we will continue our struggle,” said Harmeet Singh, 45, a farmer from Patiala. On January 2, farmer leaders had announced that thousands of protesters would march into Delhi on Republic Day and hold their own parallel tractor parade if their demands are not met. “We will start preparing for the tractor parade now and our tractor will also participate in it,” said Harmeet. Sukhchain Singh Bhullar, 67, from Hoshiarpur, said they have asked villages in Punjab and Haryana to send more tractors to take part in the rally. “Most of the tractors and trolleys at the Singhu border will remain parked here as we have been camping here for over a month now and will not clear the place. Therefore, more tractors have been called in from Punjab,” he said. Fifty-eight-year-old Ranjeet Singh from Jalandhar said that not all tractors would be part of the parade. “Security will be of utmost importance while deciding on the tractors. Most of the tractors that will be part of the parade will be designed in such a way that the occupants will not be affected by tear gas shells and water cannons,” he said. All the farmers The Hindu spoke to on Monday were of the opinion that the talks would remain inconclusive. “The government believes that we will stay for a month or two and then leave. They will not bend. What I think is that they will eventually put a stay on the laws for a year to satisfy their ego,” said Ranjeet. Six meetings have already taken place between farmer leaders and the Centre without any resolution, said 55-year-old Ashok Mittal from Patiala. “ Hum jo sochke aaye vo to leke jaenge… hum din nahin gin rahe (We will take what we have come to take… we are not counting days)”. Owing to Sunday’s heavy downpour, the protest site was filled with garbage, cups, plates and plastic. Staying dry By the time volunteers were able to clean up the muck, the rain started again. The protesters are managing to stay dry in their tractors and trolleys, which are covered with multiple layers of thick plastic. Even the langars continued from underneath tarpaulin-covered tractors.  The Centre believes that we will stay for a month or two and then leave. They will not bend.

05 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Adverse events must be reported fortnightly||Both Bharat Biotech and the Serum Institute of India (SII), which have received approval from the Drugs Controller General of India for manufacturing and distributing their COVID-19 vaccines, are expected to submit reports every 15 days on adverse events among those vaccinated, if any, for two months. After this, they would have to submit such reports once a month. The vaccines developed by both companies haven’t gone through all the required tests, particularly the trials that determine whether the vaccines are effective in Indians. Both companies have been given approvals for “restricted emergency use” though there are further caveats to Covaxin, the Bharat Biotech product, which restrict it to be provided only in “clinical trial mode”. SII’s vaccine, Covishield, is based on a chimpanzee adenovirus and developed at the Oxford University. U.K. trials showed a 70.4% efficacy with wide variation across subgroups. Covaxin is a whole inactivated virus, the oldest technology in vaccine development, and current scientific reports suggests that it produced a strong immune response in animals but no data yet suggested its efficacy. According to the permission notices made public on Monday, Covaxin has to finish its Phase-1, Phase-2 and Phase-3 trials, and submit updated safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data. Experts express concern The firms should have a risk management plan in place and must keep providing evidence that their formulations were stable under the required storage conditions. The approvals notwithstanding, scientists and experts have expressed misgivings, with some saying that the lack of efficacy data for Covaxin means it doesn’t pass a key requirement of vaccine approval. The government has justified the approval on the grounds that the vaccine employs a whole inactivated virus and therefore had a better probability of providing protection against mutated strains. However, there is no scientific evidence that a such an approach would confer such wide protection.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/adverse-events-must-be-reported-fortnightly/article33497579.ece
05 January 2021||KOTTAYAM,||Steps on to check spread of avian influenza||As avian influenza (H5N8) has been confirmed among ducks in Kottayam, the district administration has initiated steps on a war-footing to prevent the spread of the disease. According to official estimates, the virus killed 1,700 out of 8,000 ducklings which are around 70 days old, in a farm in the 14th ward of Neendoor grama panchayat till Monday. In view of the development, District Collector M. Anjana, who convened an urgent meeting of the officials concerned on Monday, directed the officials to cull the remaining birds in the farm. Culling “An additional flock of 1,000 ducks within the 1-km radius of the infection hotspot will be culled to prevent the spread of the disease. Eight teams have been formed for culling, which will begin on Tuesday morning. As of now, there is no need to panic as the infected birds are in an isolated area surrounded by water and hence chances for the spread are minimal,” she said. “As per expert opinion, the virus will be transmitted to humans only if it gets mutated,” Ms. Anjana added. Following the death of 600 ducks on December 28, the authorities led by District Animal Husbandry Officer Shaji Panickassery visited the farm the next day and sent samples for testing to the Avian Disease Diagnostics Lab (ADDL) at Thiruvalla and later to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal. Meanwhile, the test result of samples of 20 ducks, which died in a farm in Kudavechoor panchayat, was negative. Awareness campaigns have been started under the leadership of the Health Department to allay the fears of people and ensure preventive action. The Health Department has set up a surveillance system within a 2-km radius of the area where the disease was reported. Further, the district administration has banned the import of ducks or ducklings to the farms and other outlets from outside the district until further notice.  Samples of domesticated birds within a 10-km radius of the epicentre of the disease will be collected and tested. Meanwhile, the Social Forestry Department has been tasked to monitor migratory birds in and around Neendoor. If any migratory birds are found to be dying unnaturally, the Animal Husbandry Department should be informed. Fishing banned Fishing has been banned in the 14th ward and nearby areas of the local body where the disease was reported.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/steps-on-to-check-spread-of-avian-influenza/article33497530.ece
05 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||Kerala on alert after bird flu in two districts||The State was placed on high alert on Monday after an outbreak of bird flu was confirmed in Kottayam and Alappuzha districts. The Animal Husbandry Department has taken adequate steps to contain the spread of infection, Animal Husbandry Minister K. Raju said. The presence of the H5N8 subtype of the Influenza A virus was reported in ducks in Thalavadi, Thakazhy, Pallipad and Karuvatta in Alappuzha district and Neendoor in Kottayam district. Five of eight samples airlifted to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, tested positive for the bird flu virus, the Minister said, adding that the infection has not been reported in human beings so far. Culling of ducks in the infected regions will be undertaken as per Central government guidelines. Disease surveillance and disinfection will be carried out in a time-bound manner, Mr. Raju said. (The Alappuzha district authorities have decided to cull birds within one km radius of the infected areas. The culling will begin on Tuesday. An 18-member rapid response team has been constituted for the purpose. The virus killed 1,700 ducklings in a farm in Neendoor in Kottayam on Monday. Eight teams have been formed for culling, which will begin on Tuesday morning.) While it can prove lethal for birds, the H5N8 strain of avian influenza has a lower likelihood of spreading to humans compared to H5N1, officials of the State Institute for Animal Diseases (SIAD) at Palode said. Source of infection While the source of infection is yet to be pinpointed, the role of migratory birds in passing on the virus is suspected. Following the confirmation of the outbreak from the NIHSAD, the Animal Husbandry Department has tightened vigil in all districts, particularly Alappuzha, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta. In recent years, bird flu (H5N1 strain) outbreaks were reported in Kerala in 2014 and 2020. An H5N8 outbreak was reported in Kuttanad in Alappuzha, in 2016. A high-level meeting was convened at the Animal Husbandry Directorate on Monday to assess the situation. Control rooms were opened at the District Veterinary Centres in Alappuzha and Kottayam. The Joint Director (Poultry) was appointed State-level nodal officer for tackling the emergency. The Additional Director (Planning) will tour the districts to monitor the prevention measures. The Animal Husbandry Department will chart out the future course of action.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bird-flu-outbreak-in-two-districts-state-on-alert/article33497824.ece
05 January 2021||January 05 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Till the majority get immunity, wearing of masks must continue’||Amid the government nod for two COVID-19 vaccines, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) president Srinath Reddy warns that protocols to prevent the disease spread must continue and extend to other areas of environment protection to avoid future events of zoonotic microbes jumping species.  Should the private sector be allowed to vaccinate the general public? The government must mobilise all the resources it has in the public sector to deliver the vaccine to the prioritised groups in the initial stages. These are well delineated on grounds of essentiality of services provided and vulnerability of persons due to age or pre-existing health conditions. Bypassing these priorities by providing early permissions and supplies to the private sector would compromise both the scientific basis of prioritisation and ethical principle of equity in public health. Later, as vaccine supplies increase and other groups in the population are to be covered, the private sector may be drawn upon to support the governmental programme but not in a free market mode. Immunisation in a pandemic is a ‘public good’ in the language of economists and cannot be left vulnerable to the paying capacity of a person. By when would the vaccination be available for the general public? I cannot say at present, as it depends on the number and volume of approved vaccines available in the next few months and the speed of its delivery to the prioritised groups initially. The government is suggesting September this year as the possible time for roll-out to the general population. I regard the situation as fluid and will wait to see what happens in the next three months. Does getting vaccinated mean that we need not follow the COVID-appropriate behaviour? Not at all. One fact that must be clearly communicated to people is that the presently available injectable vaccines have been designed and tested to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 ‘disease’ and not the initial viral infection per se. There is some risk, not quantified at present, that an immunised person can receive the virus into the respiratory tract and harbour it there for some time. During that time, there can be transmission to others. So, till the virus has greatly reduced its presence in the population or the vast majority have acquired natural or vaccine-induced immunity, wearing of masks and other COVID appropriate behaviours must continue. That will also yield collateral benefits like reduced transmission of other respiratory microbes, such as influenza viruses and bacteria causing tuberculosis. Does the introduction of vaccine mean we can go back to the normal way of life? We should hope to progressively return to higher levels of social, economic and scholastic activities over time. That will have to be staged over several months, as the vaccine is not going to confer widespread protection to the population at once. We must also recognise that there are areas of our individual and collective lives that we may want to change from the past ‘normal’. Certainly, we must alter the ecologically destructive developmental patterns that open the highways for zoonotic microbes to jump species and race across the world. Even at the individual level, work environment and travel schedules may change to improve work-life balance without sacrificing efficiency and output. Return to normal would then mean that we can lead lives not as hostages to the virus but exercising our free choices which are shaped by the wisdom that the pandemic has brought to us. Will children (under 14) be vaccinated? The vaccine trials have so far not covered that age group. Some trials are now extending up to 12 years of age. Since children mostly do not develop clinically severe COVID-19 disease, even if infected, they are not a target group for immunisation now. Also, giving two intramuscular injections to very young children may not be justified when the benefits are unclear. Some mucosal vaccines, which are protective against the virus settling into the respiratory tract, may provide an advantage in children as they can be inhaled rather than injected. Such sterilising vaccines, which produce secretory antibodies that overcome the virus even as it enters the respiratory tract, are still under early evaluation. For how long will the effect of the vaccine last? As of now, there is no clarity on that. Studies of persons recovering from natural infection with the virus suggest a decline in antibody levels by three months and cellular immunity lasting till six months. The timelines of immunity conferred by the natural infection vary depending on the viral load of exposure and severity of infection. The variable times of immune protection seen in naturally infected persons could be due to differences in the viral loads that people were exposed to. However, with a stronger standardised antigenic stimulus in a vaccine, the evoked immune is likely to be stronger and last longer. We still do not know how long. Is a below 80% efficacy of vaccine enough? When the vaccine trials started, the internationally set standard of success was demonstrated efficacy of 50% as the observed point estimate and a lower confidence limit around that estimate of no less than 30%. If any vaccine passes that test, it will qualify for approval. It came as a pleasant surprise that some vaccines claimed over 90% efficacy. However, even a 50-70% efficacy rate will confer benefits in a large-scale immunisation programme, especially when it comes to saving lives of vulnerable people.  Immunisation in a pandemic is a ‘public good’ ... and cannot be left vulnerable to one’s paying capacity||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/till-the-majority-get-immunity-wearing-of-masks-must-continue/article33497573.ece
05 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘10 million Covaxin doses are ready’||Krishna Ella, chairman of Bharat Biotech, the company that has made Covaxin and got approval to market the vaccine in ‘clinical trial mode’, said 10 million doses of the vaccine were ready, and efficacy data, showing the vaccine’s ability to protect against COVID-19, would be available by March. In his online media conference, Mr. Ella took exception to his vaccine being considered a “back-up vaccine”, meaning that — as several scientists of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said — it would be useful against mutant strains of the virus if the other vaccines did not work. “I don’t know what is a back-up vaccine. People should be responsible in giving statements such as these. A vaccine’s job is to protect people and there is no question of a so-called back-up.” The efficacy data, Mr. Ella said, could not be immediately provided as the trial was going on in over 20,000 volunteers and the nature of clinical trials did not allow such “unblinding”. However what made Covaxin a suitable candidate, Mr. Ella said, was “excellent” animal challenge (when vaccinated animals are injected with live virus to check protection) and that it produced a “strong” neutralising antibody response. “Immunogenicity is correlated with efficacy. Yes, I agree, we still have to continue testing it. But for the vaccines against Japanese encephalitis, rabies or even the seasonal flu, the practice always has been to examine immunogenicity data.” He underlined that the 2019 Clinical Trials Rules explicitly mentions that in case of an emergency and the existence of an untested drug or vaccine, Phase-2 data that established the safety of a formulation and its immune response were acceptable. “I’m only reading the law as it exists, so why can’t I benefit out of it? We are in an emergency and lives are at stake.” Though the Drug Controller General of India has approved Covaxin in a clinical trial mode, meaning that the ongoing phase 3 trial would continue (where some get the vaccine and some don’t) and it would also be simultaneously given to those outside the trial, Mr. Ella said he hadn’t got clarity from the authorities on how this was to proceed. Mr. Ella also questioned the approval accorded to the SII’s Covishield vaccine, which is based on the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine and almost wholly relied on efficacy data generated in the U.K., though without actually naming the company. “The trials in the U.K. have shown widely varying efficacy. There is no data on its performance in Indians and it’s well known that during the Phase-3 trial some batches got only half the dose. Had that happened to me in India, I would have been shut down. An innovative Indian product must be encouraged but I see that some of our own scientists have been bashing me. This isn’t right.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/10-million-covaxin-doses-ready/article33497580.ece
05 January 2021||New Delhi,||Budget session to be held amid curbs||The budget session of Parliament is expected to be held under similar COVID-19 safety measures and restrictions, including strict physical distancing norms, that were in place for the monsoon session. The Parliament is expected to be convened in the fourth week of January. The Budget as a norm is presented on February 1. “Even if the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine begins, with two doses of vaccine spread out over 2-4 weeks, the members can not be inoculated in time for the budget session,” a senior Lok Sabha official said. For the first time ever, the Members of Parliament are likely to be seated in three different places — the Rajya Sabha chamber, the Lok Sabha chamber and the central hall — for President Ram Nath Kovind’s address at the beginning of the session. Question Hour So far, there is no clarity on whether the Question Hour which was suspended during the monsoon session as part of the COVID-19 restrictions will resume in the budget session. The Opposition parties had criticised the government’s move. The Rajya Sabha chamber can accommodate 60 members, while the Lok Sabha chamber can seat 132. The remaining members will be accommodated in the visitors’ gallery of both the Houses. The Opposition members had expressed inability to successfully participate in the debates, especially from the other chamber. Many members flagged this during the passing of the three controversial farm laws in the Rajya Sabha. The government had cancelled the winter session citing the COVID-19 situation. The two sessions that were held last year — the budget session and the monsoon session — also had to be cut short. The budget session, which was scheduled to have 31 sittings, was brought to a close after 23 sittings.

05 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Students write to CJI on police action||Students of Panjab University have written to the Chief Justice of India to direct an inquiry into the “illegitimate” use of water cannons, tear gas and lathis by the police in Haryana against protesting farmers. In an open letter to the CJI, the students said an “obstinate and callous” government had resorted to violence against the farmers on their way to the borders of the national capital to support the peaceful protests. against the farm laws. “After more than two months of peaceful protests in their home States, served with incompatible gestures of Government of India, farmers (felt marooned) decided to approach the national Capital, Delhi. The peaceful protesters (farmers) were thrashed and walloped. It seems raising voice for the fundamental rights as provided by the Supreme Law of the Nation is a dreadful crime (which it is not),” they wrote. As students who believe in the tenets of human rights, they said they were “very disturbed and disheartened” by the “execrable” manner in which the Centre was dealing with the nation’s farmers. The students, who have annexed photographs of injured farmers, many of whom are senior citizens, said the violence spewed out against them by the police was “macabre”. “We believe the course of action taken by the Government of India is insensitive...Farmers in India, who consider land as their sacrosanct mother, are so much threatened, feared, and fretted that they have no way left out, but peaceful protests to showcase their pathetic vulnerability even amidst a global pandemic,” they wrote. ‘Withdraw cases’ They asked the court to direct the Haryana and Delhi police to withdraw the cases lodged against the farmers. The letter urged the court to “look into the illegal detention of protesters”. “Direct the governments at both Central and State level to ensure safety of all protesters, and provide basic amenities for all, especially women, children and elderly. Mobile toilet vans should be provided at protest places. Issue appropriate guidelines, as the court may deem fit, regarding hygienic conditions at protest sites in the backdrop of COVID-19,” they said. The letter also said action should be taken against media channels who misrepresent the protesting farmers as separatists. “Take action to curb fake news and against media channels, engaged in misrepresentation, polarisation and sensationalisation of the whole issue,” the letter requested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/students-write-to-cji-on-police-action/article33498187.ece
05 January 2021||New Delhi,||No govt. can face the wrath of farmers, warns Congress||The Congress on Monday described the seventh round of talks between the Centre and the farmer unions as a “true test of nationalism”, and warned that “no government can face the wrath of farmers”. Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram quoted Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar to say that “if farmers fold their hands, even a person who has renounced life cannot survive”. “How true it is today. No government can face the wrath of farmers who believe they are being deceived,” Mr. Chidambaram tweeted as the talks got under way. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted a two-minute video of tear gas shells being fired at farmers and claimed that nearly 60 farmers had lost their lives during the agitation because of the “government's arrogance”. ‘Cruel government’ “On the one hand, the government is calling farmers for talks and on the other it is hurling tear gas shells at them in this chilling cold. Around 60 farmers have lost their lives due to this arrogant and cruel behaviour of the government. How can farmers trust this cruel government,” she asked in a tweet in Hindi. “Today is the true test of ‘Nationalism’. Will Modi Government act in ‘National Interest’ or ‘Crony Corporate Interest’,” Congress communication chief Randeep Surjewala tweeted. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, who is out of the country, also tweeted to highlight the plight of the farmers. Sharing some pictures of agitating farmers, he said, “Those sitting under the dripping tents in the winter rains are our own fearless farmers and not strangers. There is nothing more left to be seen as far as the government's brutality on farmers is concerned.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/no-govt-can-face-the-wrath-of-farmers-warns-congress/article33497550.ece

Tirumurti said on Monday. The Ambassador was speaking at a ceremony to install the national flags of countries who will be UNSC members for 2021-22. “India comes into the Security Council as the largest democracy representing one-sixth of humanity and with a strong commitment to reformed multilateralism, rule of law, a fair and equitable international system and to peace, security and development,” Mr. Tirumurti said. He said India would be a voice for the developing world and use its tenure to foster “human-centric and inclusive” solutions to issues of peace and security. “We will not shy away from raising our voice against the common enemies of humanity like terrorism,” Mr. Tirumurti said, highlighting India’s priorities at the Security Council. “Peace-keeping, peace-building, maritime security, women and youth, especially in conflict situations, and technology with a human face, will receive our attention while on the Council,” he said. Mr. Tirumurti quoted Swami Vivekananda and the idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (universal family). “We look forward to our collective pursuit for an ideal where the World is One Family, ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’,” he said.

05 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Cong. to shrug off J-e-I taint||The contentious attempt to overtly court the Jamaat-e-Islami (J-e-I) ahead of the local body polls appeared to be the delineating schism within the Congress as it commenced intraparty consultations on Monday to plot a course to victory in the Assembly elections in May. All India Congress Committee general secretary in charge of Kerala Tariq Anwar chaired the meetings. Leaders considered reorganising party committees from the booth level and upwards to render the organisation fighting fit. Mr. Anwar appeared to indicate that the Congress would discuss expanding the United Democratic Front (UDF). Wooing Kappan His remark came against the background of the report that Mani C. Kappan, Pala MLA of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), had sought a safe harbour in the UDF. Mr. Kappan was allegedly aggrieved over the Left Democratic Front’s alleged move to wrest the Pala seat from him and hand it over to the Jose K. Mani-led Kerala Congress (M). The party discussed steps to reconcile differences with Christian denominations and Hindu social forums in south and central Kerala. Several leaders had expressed scepticism about the Congress “outreach” to the Jamaat-e-Islami and its political arm, the Welfare Party of India. Some Christian and Hindu publications had raised the spectre of a “radicalised” Indian Union Muslim League eclipsing the Congress in the UDF. On a nexus The Congress also felt it had “failed” to expose the CPI(M)’s tacit understanding with the Social Democratic Party of India and BJP to deny the UDF victory in many local bodies. A random data analysis of 1,000 wards by a KPCC general secretary had found that nexus had proven toxic for the Congress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/cong-to-shrug-off-j-e-i-taint/article33497895.ece
05 January 2021||Kolkata,||Tense moments as BJP roadshow makes its way through Kolkata||Supporters of the BJP and the Trinamool Congress on Monday came face to face during a roadshow organised by the former in the city. While there was a flare-up as the supporters waved flags at each other and also some projectiles flew in the air, the large deployment of the police prevented violence. BJP leader Kaliash Vijayvargiya, who participated in the roadshow, said the party supporters exercised restraint in the Wattgunge area when projectiles were thrown at them. He claimed that attempts were made to incite the BJP supporters so that the party could have been blamed for any violence. The Trinamool had set up a stage on the other side of the road on the rally route. BJP vice-president Mukul Roy and MP Arjun Singh participated. The rally, which started in the Alipore area, arrived at the BJP State headquarters in central Kolkata. While Mr. Roy and Mr. Vijayvargiya downplayed the incident, State president Dilip Ghosh said it is for the party leaders to utilise the platform. While the event was touted as a show of strength by the BJP in Kolkata, newly appointed observer to Kolkata zone Sovan Chatterjee was missing from it. So was his aide Baishakhi Banerjee, who has been appointed co-convener. It did not go down well with the party leadership. Late on Sunday night, BJP State committee member Krishnendu Mukherjee alleged that shots were fired at his car. While he alleged that the Trinamool was behind the attack, the ruling party denied the charge.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tense-moments-as-bjp-roadshow-makes-its-way-through-kolkata/article33497565.ece
05 January 2021||LUCKNOW,||Temple work to begin by January-end||Work on the foundation for the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya will start by January-end, said the trust entrusted with its construction on Sunday. It acknowledged that the study of the soil was still not complete even after seven months. From the day the construction starts, the temple would be completed in 36-39 months, said Champat Rai, general secretary of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra. “We had hoped construction would start in June but the study has not been completed [even] after seven months. The results are not matching. There is sand, crumbly sand, under the ground or some old debris lying deep,” said Mr. Rai at a press conference in Kanpur on Sunday. He also said that the Indian Space Research Organisation had sent them pictures of a channel (stream) of the Sarayu river under the site of construction. The first soil testing took place in February 2020. Mr. Rai stressed that the foundation work would take place only after clear results. “If there is any confusion in the results, the tests are done again. This reflects the seriousness about the foundation of the temple,” he said. The trust will start a mass contact and contribution campaign for the temple work from Makar Sankranti. Over four lakh workers of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad have been tasked with collecting the funds, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/temple-work-to-begin-by-january-end/article33497586.ece
05 January 2021||COLOMBO,||Jaishankar to visit Sri Lanka today||In the first high-level visit by a foreign official to Sri Lanka this year, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will be in Colombo from January 5 to 7 and hold bilateral talks with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and his counterpart Dinesh Gunawardena, official statements from both capitals said. The visit assumes significance for strategic and diplomatic reasons as India tries to counter growing Chinese outreach in the region. It also comes at a time when some in the ruling Rajapaksa administration are seeking the abolition of the provincial council system born out of the IndiA-Lanka Accord of 1987. The visit might indicate if New Delhi and Colombo are any closer to sealing the proposed deal on jointly developing the East Container Terminal at the strategically located Colombo port, amid opposition from workers, sections of southern polity and some backers of the Rajapaksa regime. The coveted project has remained contentious from the time Sri Lanka’s former government, India and Japan had signed a tripartite Memorandum of Cooperation in 2019. The persisting opposition is pegged to two major concerns — of “selling national assets” to another country and the likely involvement of the Adani group. A statement from the Ministry of External Affairs said the visit “signifies the priority both countries attach to strengthening their close and cordial relations in all spheres of mutual interest”, and Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: “Both sides are looking forward to strengthen the bilateral relationship in multiple areas of cooperation.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jaishankar-to-visit-sri-lanka-today/article33497591.ece

05 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||90% attendance in colleges on reopening day||Higher education institutions in Kerala buzzed with activity after close to 300 days when they partially reopened on Monday under stringent restrictions in view of the COVID-19 spread. The students’ joy of being able to return to their campuses was visible as it eclipsed the concerns over the possibility of a zero academic year. While offline classes commenced for final-year undergraduate and all postgraduate students, a decision on the remaining batches is likely to be taken only after two weeks. Better interaction Lauding the decision to resume offline classes, Sangeeth, a first year MCom student of the Government Arts College here, said the online sessions did not instil much confidence in many students. “We have been hoping for a return to the conventional classroom environment. Interaction is key to education, but not many students raised doubts through online platforms,” he said. Varsha, a first-year student of MA English at SN College, Chempazhanthy, is relieved that her postgraduation studies will not be confined to her home. Amidst teething issues pertaining to transportation and accommodation, colleges across the State reported above average attendance. Institutions in rural areas witnessed a lower student turnout. Principals’ meet During a videoconference convened by Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel later in the day, many colleges Principals reported a 90% attendance of students and teachers on the first day of college reopening. Over 900 Principals, representing government, aided and unaided colleges, participated in the meeting. Suma S., Associate Professor of Hindi and college union adviser in Government College for Women, Thiruvananthapuram, says several students from districts such as Malappuram and Idukki have chosen not to rejoin since finding accommodation would be a tough task. “For such students, we will persist with online classes. The workload of the faculty is bound to increase. We hope the situation normalises within a few weeks, since the university examinations are round the corner,” she said. Fogging on campuses Local body authorities undertook a fogging drive on campuses and premises were sanitised. Students were subjected to thermal screening and permitted entry after jotting down their contact details on register books maintained at the entrance. College authorities rearranged seating arrangements to ensure only two students sat on a bench.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/90-attendance-in-colleges-on-reopening-day/article33497537.ece
05 January 2021||Kozhikode,||Division now wide open in Kerala NCP||With its State unit caught in a political quagmire, the Central leadership of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is struggling to avoid a split in the minor constituent of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala. Senior NCP leaders, including president Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel, are parleying with rival factions in the State unit to settle their differences even as the break-up is becoming more apparent. Conflict of interest The conflict of interest among the leaders has emerged with Minister A.K. Saseendran staunchly committing to remain within the LDF even as his Cabinet colleague and Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] leader Kadamkampally Surendran suggesting that he join the Congress (S), another minor partner of the front.  The puzzle has got more complex with Congress (S) leader and Minister Kadannappally Ramachandran welcoming Mr. Saseendran into his party whist the Congress-led United Democratic Front is wooing the NCP into its coalition. KC(M) factor The trouble came to the fore in the party after the Jose K. Mani faction of the Kerala Congress (M) soldered its bond with the LDF after its runway success in the recent local body polls. The political entropy thus started for the NCP with the CPI(M) favouring Mr. Mani to contest the Pala segment in the Assembly polls due in four months. NCP legislator Mani C. Kappan, who now represents the segment after winning a byelection in September 2019, has been from the outset opposed to an electoral alliance with the Mani faction. Incidentally Mr. Kappan was defeated by the late K.M. Mani on earlier occasions. Kuttanad seat This tussle between two legislators – Mr. Kappan and Mr. Saseendran – apart, the Kuttanad Assembly segment is another bone of contention within the party. Thomas K. Thomas is keen to contest on the party ticket for the seat which fell vacant upon the demise of his brother Thomas Chandy in December 2019. The talks between the rival leaders and their national leaders in the coming days will give a further dimension within the LDF that witnessed a faction breaking away from its another minor partner, the Janata Dal (Secular) last week. Referring to the Pala segment, NCP State president T.P. Peethambaran is confident that the LDF will stick to its policy to field winners from the sitting seat.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/division-now-wide-open-in-kerala-ncp/article33497894.ece
05 January 2021||KOCHI,||WPI tie-up cost UDF Christian votes: Church||The United Democratic Front’s electoral alliance with the Welfare Party of India (WPI) has resulted in the erosion of secular credentials of the Congress and culminated in the shifting of traditional Christian minority votes against the front in central and northern Kerala, according to an editorial in Sathyadeepam , the mouthpiece of the Syro-Malabar Church. IUML factor  The Church also noted that the shifting of the Jose K. Mani-led Kerala Congress (M) to the Left Democratic Front was instrumental in gravitating the Christian minority votes in favour of the Left alliance. The return of Indian Union Muslim League leader P.K. Kunhalikutty to the State politics and the campaign that the Congress was playing second fiddle to the IUML were also points to be pondered in the electoral context. It cautioned that the ways in which the various political fronts would address the political insecurity of the Christian minorities would be decisive in the Assembly polls. Both the UDF and the LDF will have to take note of the intervention of the Prime Minister in the issues between the Jacobite and Orthodox Christian factions and the distribution of welfare funds for the minorities, the article felt. The political positions of the UDF in the polls came under the scanner as the front suffered a major blow in the civic polls, said Fr. Mathew Kilukkan, who authored the editorial for the latest issue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/wpi-tie-up-cost-udf-christian-votes-church/article33497914.ece
05 January 2021||ALAPPUZHA,||Duck farmers in deep trouble, seek govt. help||The outbreak of avian influenza (H5N8) in Kuttanad is set to push the duck farmers in the region into deep trouble. The duck farmers, who have seen major setbacks in recent years in the form of bird flu outbreaks in 2014 and 2016, floods and recurring bouts of bacterial infections, fear that the latest outbreak would create a lasting damage. According to the Animal Husbandry Department, around 28,000 ducks perished in the district in the last two weeks with another 34,602 birds (most of them ducks) set to be culled in the coming days. Plea for compensation With the pain of the devastation caused by the past bird outbreaks still fresh in the minds of farmers, they have urged the government to initiate immediate steps to provide them with compensation. “Ducks in my farm started to show symptoms of the disease on December 19, 2020. They started to die a day after. I lost 8,670 ducks and incurred a loss of around Rs. 8 lakh,” says Samuel K., a duck farmer from Pallippad. Most rear ducks twice a year, especially on Christmas and Easter. The outbreak is certain to reduce the demand for Kuttanadan duck, which has pride of place on dining tables. B. Rajasekharan, district president, Duck Farmers Association, says the farmers are staring at an uncertain future. “Duck farmers were in distress even before this outbreak. Virus outbreaks, bacterial infections and floods have devastated the sector in recent times. Several duck farmers have moved to other jobs,” he says.  He says there was a delay in confirming the bird flu in ducks. “Although the farmers apprised the authorities soon after the birds started to show symptoms, it took around two weeks to confirm avian influenza. This shows the lackadaisical attitude of the government towards the sector,” says Mr. Rajasekharan. The government failed to compensate the farmers properly for their earlier losses, he said. After the outbreak in 2014, three lakh ducks were culled in Kuttanad. More than seven lakh ducks were culled in Alappuzha and Kottayam districts in 2016. Following the previous bird flu outbreaks, the government had paid Rs. 100 for ducks that were less than two months old and Rs. 200 for those older than two months as compensation to the farmers Santhosh Kumar, District Animal Husbandry Officer, says a decision on providing compensation to the owners of culled birds will be taken at the government level.

In an official statement, RIL said it had moved the High Court through its subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (RJIL). The statement said the facts establish that Reliance had nothing to do with the three farm laws currently debated, and in no way benefited from them. “Reliance Retail Limited (RRL), Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (RJIL), or any other affiliate of our parent company, that is, Reliance Industries Limited, had not done any “corporate” or “contract” farming in the past, and had absolutely no plans to enter this business,” it said. The statement said Reliance Retail sold products of all categories. “It does not purchase any food grains directly from farmers. It has never entered into long-term procurement contracts to gain unfair advantage over farmers,” it added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ril-to-hc-no-plans-to-enter-corporate-farming/article33497532.ece

During the first hour, the ministers listed the benefits of the three laws, saying they would bring more marketing choices for farmers. The union leaders reiterated their demand for repeal, repeating their assertion that the reforms will weaken the system of regulated markets and government procurement at a set price, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by large corporates. “We wanted to have a clause by clause discussion of the laws, but the unions remained stuck on a one point demand for repeal, so no decision could be reached,” said Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar. The unions held the Centre responsible for the lack of progress. “The government does not seem to have the desire to find a solution,” said Abhimanyu Kohar, spokesperson for the Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh.

The PM said that in any progressive society, research was key, and its effects were commercial and social. “We do not want to fill the world with Indian products, but we must win the hearts of every customer of Indian products in every corner of the world.” Quality of services in our country and products, from the public and private sectors, will determine India’s strength in the world. He pointed out that, historically, countries had progressed in direct correlation to their effort to promote science. He termed this “value creation cycle” of science, technology and industry.

05 January 2021||Srinagar,||Relatives seek bodies of youth killed in Srinagar||The family members of three youth killed in an encounter in Srinagar on December 30, protested for the sixth consecutive day on Monday and made a fervent appeal to the J&K administration to return the bodies for burials, claiming them to be “mere civilians and not militants”. Mushtaq Ahmad, father of slain Athar Mushtaq Wani, a Class 11 student, from Pulwama, said he had dug a grave with his own hands. “All I demand is that my innocent son’s body is returned for burial. I am not asking for heaven. He was just killed for a reward. How could they spend such award money on their own children?” he said. Mr. Ahmad said he wanted the police to explain to him how “his son, a student, comes to Srinagar and becomes a hardcore militant supporter overnight”. Meanwhile, the police on Monday released fresh videos of the December 30 encounter, which took place in the Lawaypora area of Srinagar. In the short videos, the security forces were shown offering the surrender option to the trapped “militants”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/relatives-seek-bodies-of-youth-killed-in-srinagar/article33497560.ece
05 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC schedules Goa MLAs’ defection case for February||“Nobody can have a vested right to delay,” Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde, heading a three-judge Bench hearing a plea filed by Goa Congress leader Girish Chodankar, said on Monday. Mr. Chodankar had complained about the delay of over a year and a half by the State Assembly Speaker to decide the disqualification petitions filed against 10 Congress MLAs who defected to the BJP in July 2019. The Supreme Court Bench scheduled the case for hearing in the second week of February. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, for the Congress, and Mr. Chodankar, said a year and a half had passed without the Speaker taking a call. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for the legislators, said a reply had been filed to the plea and the case should be heard on its merits. However, Mr. Sibal said it should be left to the Speaker to decide the disqualification proceedings on merits expeditiously. Mr. Chodankar had also asked the court to restrain the 10 legislators, who include three State Ministers, from participating in the House proceedings. He had alleged that these MLAs, purportedly claiming to form two-thirds of the Congress, “decided to merge the said legislature party with the BJP” and addressed a communication to that effect to the Speaker. Based on the communication, the Speaker was pleased to take note of the alleged merger of the Congress Legislature Party in the Assembly, and allotted 10 seats in the House along with BJP members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-schedules-goa-mlas-defection-case-for-february/article33497563.ece

05 January 2021||Mumbai,||PIL plea seeks safeguards for ICC members||A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed before the Bombay High Court on Monday seeking that officers under the Prevention of Sexual Harassment at the Workplace Act (POSH) should be declared public servants and they should have stability of tenure. The PIL filed by advocate Abha Singh and social worker Janaki Chaudhary said the Act provides for mandatory constitution of internal complaints committees (ICC) by companies and local complaints committees of the State. “These committees  are bestowed with the power of civil courts, and are under obligation as per law to conduct a free and fair inquiry into the alleged incident of sexual harassment and give an impartial recommendation to the employer,” it said. The PIL pointed out that the members of such committees, akin to judges, have not been provided with any safeguards, which will enable them to act without fear and favour. “Thus, an anomalous situation has arisen where ICC members have been conferred with quasi-judicial powers. This creates a highly unjust and iniquitous situation for ICC members as well as the parties to the case. This acts as a barrier to holistically address the issue of sexual harassment,” it said, adding that this anomaly has also been noted in the report of the Justice J.S. Verma Committee. The plea urged the court to declare the service conditions of the ICC members protected by principles of natural justice and that they be declared as public servants and have the same protection. The PIL also sought a direction from the court to set up a commission to review the deficiencies in terms of their rights and protection. It further requested the court to direct all companies to intimate to the National Commission for Women and their respective local complaints committee  about any adverse action taken against any ICC members.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pil-plea-seeks-safeguards-for-icc-members/article33497551.ece

05 January 2021||KOCHI,||HC cancels Thaha’s bail||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Monday reversed the Nationa Investigation Agency (NIA) Special Court order granting bail to Thaha Fazal, second accused in the Pantheerankavu Maoist case, and directed him to surrender before the Special Judge, Ernakulam, forthwith. The Bench comprising Justice A. Hariprasad and Justice K. Haripal also ordered that if Thaha failed to surrender, the special court shall take steps to secure him in custody. Shuhaib to be on bail The court, however, allowed Alan Shuhaib, the first accused in the case, to remain on bail in view of numerous mitigating circumstances favouring him. The court observed that firstly, on the date of detection of the crime, he was only 20 years old. Secondly, he was undergoing treatment for some psychiatric issues. Moreover, materials placed before the court, seized from him, were less serious, compared to the materials seized from the possession of Thaha. The Bench also directed the special court to complete the trial in the case within a year. The court passed the verdict on appeals filed by the National Investigation Agency against the bail order. The court observed that as rightly pointed out by the Assistant Solicitor General appearing for the Union government and the NIA public prosecutor, the Special Judge had oversimplified the matters and watered down the seriousness of the documents seized from the accused or the statements of witnesses spoken against them. Dismissing the contentions of the counsel for the accused, the court said if they, as youngsters, were interested in understanding and assimilating new and novel ideologies, a bunch of materials published by a particular outfit alone would not have been found in their possession and power. Criminal intent “The underlying element of mens rea cannot be overlooked. Therefore, this circumstance alone is sufficient to say, at least at this stage, that they are protagonists of the organisation,” Bench added. The court observed that the special court had considered evidence as if in a trial.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-cancels-thahas-bail/article33497527.ece

05 January 2021||KOCHI,||New prosecutor posted in actor rape case||Former CBI special public prosecutor V. N. Anilkumar will take charge as special prosecutor in the sensational actor rape case in which actor Dileep is an accused. It was following the resignation of A Sureshan, special public prosecutor who stepped down from the post after complaining that the trial court was behaving in a biased manner, that Mr. Anilkumar was appointed. Though the State had moved the Kerala High Court and the Supreme Court seeking a change of court, the plea did not find favour with the courts. Mr. Anilkumar, who was adjudged the best prosecutor in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 2007, was involved in the conduct of the SNC-Lavlin case, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) espionage case and also the Sister Abhaya murder case during its pre-trial stages.

Varghese, Special Judge, who considered the case on Monday, posted it to be considered after four days as the Investigation Officer submitted that the proceedings for appointing the new prosecutor will be completed shortly. The prosecution had earlier examined around 80 witnesses, including prominent movie actors, in the case, which is being conducted as an in-camera proceeding to protect the identity and social standing of the victim. Actor Dileep has been arraigned as the eighth accused in the case. He has been accused of conspiracy in the case.

The primary inference of the doctors who carried out the post-mortem is that the death was caused due to cardiac arrest. Case registered Earlier in the day, the Kayamkulam police had registered a case of unnatural death. The 55-year-old poet had collapsed during a visit to the Mattam Mahadeva temple, near Mavelikara, on Sunday morning.

The Kayamkulam police said he had tested positive for COVID-19. There were also variations in his ECG in one of the hospitals he was taken to on Sunday. The case was registered under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as part of carrying out the post-mortem procedures.

05 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chinese gang procured 2,000 SIM cards with false identities||The Chinese gang that was involved in operating online loan apps had also procured 2,000 SIM cards using fake Indian identity papers, sources said. The sleuths of the Central Crime Branch intensified their probe into the alleged links of the arrested Chinese nationals with Indians. After searching for the suspects for nearly 20 days, the special team busted a call centre run by two Indian nationals in Bengaluru, who claimed to be the directors of the firm. Subsequently, the police arrested two Chinese nationals who were behind the illegal online loan apps which offered cheaper loans and later harassed debtors, demanding payment of exorbitant rates of interest. The prime accused, Hong, was operating from China while the other two — Xioa Yamao and Wu Yuanlun — were staying in Haralur, Bengaluru. Frequent instructions were passed on from China. Sources said the prime accused Hong and others came to India in January, before the onset of the lockdown. They had suffered a setback due to the pandemic. They were operating call centres employing locals as telecallers, and these were registered as non-banking finance firms, which are permitted to work in the micro-financing sector. The firm’s directors were Indians but operations were entirely controlled by the Chinese. The telecallers were given a target to get at least 10 customers. If they failed to do so, they would be sacked. A senior police officer said, “One of the accused has been admitted to a hospital for COVID-19 treatment. We are investigating his whereabouts. So far, we have seized two laptops, six mobile phones, two Chinese passports and ATM cards and incriminating documents. Investigation to identify their Indian contacts and foreign links is on. In the course of our investigation, we also learned that the gang had procured over 2,000 SIM cards for illegal operations.” “On analysing various electronic records, we found that they had cheated and harassed more than 25,000 victims. The estimated value of the money they swindled is Rs. 300 crore. Two bank accounts were frozen and investigation on the money’s ultimate destination is under way.The case will likely be investigated by central agencies, such as the Enforcement Directorate or others, since it has international ramifications,” said sources.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chinese-gang-procured-2000-sim-cards-with-false-identities/article33498157.ece

Had the engineers been able to resolve the issue remotely, there was a good chance that the train would have reached the station. The installation of a new “asset management system” software and its operation in two months will make remote control possible from the Operations Control Centre. Then, minor issues can be fixed in minutes using the software, without technicians having to visit the site. According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL), the software was on trial for several months in all trains running in phase I of the project. At first, a prototype was developed and after testing it several times, the final version was arrived at; this too went through trials. “The idea behind bringing this system is that if a train stops halfway in a viaduct or tunnel and passengers are stuck on the train, we can see what the issue is from the control centre. In most cases, it could be a minor issue and service can be restored sitting at the centre itself,” an official said. The system will display data of trains and send alerts on real time basis. This will then be transmitted to the depot’s maintenance server and can be accessed by trained personnel. “For many months now, as part of the trial run, the trains operated were monitored throughout the day to see if the train and the system are functioning without any glitches. And we have seen if the system has been transmitting data and giving alerts about the technical issues that arise,” another official said. The new software would cover trains that will start running on the Washermanpet-Wimco Nagar stretch in two months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/metro-rail-deploys-new-technology-to-set-right-glitches/article33498151.ece
05 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Cardiac rehabilitation regimen helps man, 52, become fitter and athletic||Nearly 20 months after he suffered a heart attack and underwent angioplasty, 52-year-old R. Satyamurthy completed a 42 km full marathon in the city on Sunday. Cardiac rehabilitation helped the Vellore resident’s life return to normalcy and take up physical activities he had not attempted before. After undergoing angioplasty in April 2019 at the Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore, Mr. Satyamurthy joined the hospital’s cardiac rehabilitation services. “The common assumption is that post-angioplasty, patients may experience difficulty in walking. My friends and relatives said I should not ride a two-wheeler and should not speak much. But it was actually the opposite. I slowly took to walking and running. In fact, prior to this, I wasn’t very athletic. I managed to complete the target activities in seven to eight months,” Mr. Satyamurthy said. Till date, he has taken part in nine to 10 marathon events. In the 2020 Chennai marathon, he was part of the team from the CMC cardiac rehab group and participated in the 21 km category. On Sunday, he took part in the 2021 Chennai marathon and completed a 42 km full marathon, according to a press release. “First of all, cardiac rehabilitation takes away the fear of getting back to normalcy as early as possible. It has also been shown to improve the functioning (ejection fraction) of the heart on a long-term basis. Functional capacity improves with structured rehabilitation programmes,” said Oommen K. George, professor and head, Cardiology, CMC. The cardiac rehabilitation programme was started in December 2017. “Our cardiac rehabilitation is built on new evidence that if we start a physician-supervised exercise programme as early as possible, potential for recovery is very high. In our rehab, we start working with patients within a week after they have their heart attack and start them on exercises for three to six months. There is an increase in the heart’s pumping capacity to near normal to even higher than normal levels,” said Muralidhar Babi, cardiac rehabilitation medicine specialist, CMC. Post rehabilitation, the patients become part of a running club and actively run together on a daily basis, he said. CMC’s cardiac rehabilitation team consists of physicians, physiotherapists, nurses, nutritionists and counsellors. “If there is no such rehabilitation programme, patients usually tend to be sedentary and avoid all kinds of physical activity out of fear. This is rather detrimental to the heart in the long term,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cardiac-rehabilitation-helps-man-52-become-fitter-athletic/article33498155.ece

Of these, 26 transplants were done under the Chief Minister’s Health Insurance Scheme. Hospital authorities said the each patient was evaluated for the urgent need of transplant on an MELD scale (Model for End Stage Liver Disease). A person with an MELD score of over 15 is considered for transplant in normal times. During the pandemic, only those with MELD score of over 25 points were considered. Director of Hepatology and Transplant Hepatology Joy Varghese said of the 38 patients who fulfilled the criteria, 24 were adults and 14 children. “Donors and recipients were discharged hale and healthy in the shortest possible period,” he said. The State government had provided timely support to 26 patients for the transplant through the CMHIS. Mettu Srinivas Reddy, director of Liver Transplant and HPB surgery, said the hospital’s liver transplant team accomplished the goals of not just timely and safe transplant but also ensured the patients’ smooth and rapid recovery. According to Rajanikanth Patcha, clinical head, dedicated operation theatres, intensive care units, doctors and paramedic team handled transplantation. Facilities with advanced technology helped prevent infection. High standards kept Alok Khullar, chief executive officer of GGHC, said the hospital’s liver transplant team took up on itself the challenge to implement standards of infection control. “The multi-disciplinary approach of the hepatology and liver transplant team, in collaboration with the infectious diseases team, enabled us to provide excellent clinical outcomes to patients suffering from end stage liver disease,” he added.

05 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Timely action helped control pandemic, says Harsh Vardhan||The COVID-19 pandemic had derailed years of painstaking efforts, but timely action helped control the disease from spreading, said Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday. Strategic thinking, aggressive campaigns, deep commitment from doctors and other frontline workers were needed in this connection, he added. In his virtual convocation address at Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (SRIHER), the Minister said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been regularly interacting with the Chief Ministers of all the States and the Union Territories, besides stakeholders, for effective management of the pandemic. The Centre had also taken up vaccination programme in a big way, besides promoting telemedicine. As many as 23 States used eSanjeevani, through which 11 lakh teleconsultations had been conducted. He said Ayushman Bharat had been launched to create 1.5 lakh health and wellness centres. Around 10.74 crore underprivileged and vulnerable families had been identified for a health cover of Rs. 5 lakh per family annually for treatment in secondary and tertiary care hospitals, Dr. Vardhan said. The Centre had increased the bed strength from nine to 40 per 10,000. It had also made efforts to improve the doctor-patient ratio by increasing the number of medical colleges, he added. At present, 10% of people in the country were covered under health insurance schemes, he said. As many as 75 district hospitals had been converted into medical colleges and 14 of them in Tamil Nadu alone, he pointed out. The Central government had increased the number of AIIMS from six to 22, he added. Dr. Vardhan lauded SRIHER for allotting a separate block to treat COVID-19 patients and for conducting ICMR vaccine trials, besides serving as a testing centre. Chancellor V.R. Venkataachalam, Pro-Chancellor R.V. Sengutuvan and Vice-Chancellor P.V. Vijayaraghavan distributed 94 gold medals to meritorious students and certificates to 1,266 students. In his report, Dr. Vijayaraghavan said SRIHER had been undertaking clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines with the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech International. The Institute had launched three new courses this year — M.Sc Sports and Exercise Psychology; MPT (Sports) and part-time executive diploma in healthcare management.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pandemic-disrupted-years-of-hard-work-but-timely-actions-helped-harsh-vardhan/article33497745.ece

Thuglak editor S. Gurumurthy told The Hindu that he had requested Mr. Shah to be the chief guest at the event, when Mr. Shah visited Chennai last November. “The discussion at the event will obviously be on politics, just like every year. There is nothing special about it,” he said when asked about the visit, especially when the State is set to go to the polls, in a few months. The event is likely to be held at Kalaivanar Arangam. This will be the Home Minister’s second visit, in two months, to Chennai. Last time, he met office-bearers of the State BJP unit after the conclusion of an official government event.  Seating capacity Mr. Gurumurthy said he was not sure about the seating capacity that would be allowed at the event, as of Monday, as the government had now allowed cinema halls to operate with 100% seating occupancy. “We have to see what the government allows. If they follow the same rule as the cinema halls, we will allow full capacity,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/amit-shah-to-participate-in-thuglak-anniversary-event/article33497710.ece
05 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||BJP’s ‘aggressive work’ no threat to ties with AIADMK, say leaders||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s “intensive work” across the State, in the run-up to the Assembly election, does not pose any threat to its relationship with the ruling All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), according to leaders of the two parties. The BJP has nominated point persons for all the 234 Assembly constituencies. Many of them have already hit the ground, giving the impression that the party would like to contest in the constituency concerned. Dismissing the possibility of this disturbing inter-party ties, V.P. Duraisamy, one of the vice-presidents of the State BJP, said the brief assigned to point persons was to ensure the formation of booth committees, identify “key voters” and establish a rapport with prominent persons in the constituency. “Besides, the point persons highlight the salient features of welfare schemes of the Central government,” said Mr. Duraisamy, who recently joined the party after quitting the DMK. Acknowledging that the AIADMK was the major partner of the alliance in the State, he added that further clarity on the contours of the coalition would be known after January 14 [when Union Minister Amit Shah is expected to be in Chennai]. Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said there was no need to entertain confusion over the matter, as every party carried out similar activities ahead of the Assembly election. “My party is also undertaking all these functions,” he said. When details regarding seat sharing are worked out, everything will be “perfect,” the Minister said. S. Semmalai, veteran legislator and former Minister, said no party would like to confine itself to any particular constituency or district. It will strive for making its presence felt everywhere. It is against this context that the BJP’s functions have to be seen, he said. “In fact, such preparatory work will be beneficial to the front, as a whole, once the alliance is firmed up,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/bjps-aggressive-work-no-threat-to-ties-with-aiadmk-say-leaders/article33497713.ece
05 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Allies up the ante, but DMK continues to be unmoved||With the Assembly election approaching, allies of the DMK have been upping their ante, one by one, in their demand for seats and the right to contest on their own symbols. MDMK general secretary Vaiko and Viduthalai Chiruthaikal Katchi (VCK) president Thol. Thirumavalavan have already expressed their desire to contest on their own symbols. Besides, India Jananayaga Katchi (IJK) president Ravi Patchamuthu has demanded six seats for his party. If denied, he has said that his party would field candidates in all the 234 constituencies. Commenting on the demands, a senior DMK leader said, “There is nothing wrong in a party’s wish to contest on its own symbol. But it is too early to make a decision on the issue and the allocation of seats.” He pointed out that IJK founder Paarivendhar contested and won on the DMK’s ‘Rising sun’ symbol in Perambalur, in the last Lok Sabha polls. “But the demand for six seats in the Assembly is too much. They may have money, but where is the base and votes?” another DMK leader asked. DMK leaders agreed that it was quite normal for parties to air their demands, openly, to keep their supporters in good spirit. “MDMK candidate Ganesamurthy contested on the DMK symbol in the Lok Sabha polls. In the VCK, Ravikumar contested on our symbol. Only Mr. Thirumavalavan opted for his own symbol,” a DMK MP said. ‘Unrealistic demand’ Even assuming that this was just posturing, the IJK’s demand was unrealistic, he said. “If we part the IJK with six seats, we have to give the two Communist parties 15 each and the Congress up to 40. We cannot afford to allot so many seats, as we are particular about the DMK contesting in a good number of them,” he said. In the 2016 Assembly polls, the Congress was re-included in the DMK alliance, and allotted 41 seats, but it won only in eight. The two Communist parties and the MDMK contested as part of the People’s Welfare Front, led by actor Vijayakant’s DMDK. But the alliance came a cropper.  If we part the IJK with six seats, we have to give the two Communist parties 15 each and the Congress up to 40.

05 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Governor administers oath of office to Chief Justice||Governor Banwarilal Purohit on Monday administered the oath of office to Madras High Court’s 42nd Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee at the Raj Bhavan and handed over to him a warrant of appointment issued by President Ram Nath Kovind. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, judges of the Madras High Court, top bureaucrats, police officers and court officials attended the swearing in ceremony held at the Darbar Hall. It was followed by a welcome address by Advocate General Vijay Narayan at the High Court. Introducing the Chief Justice to the Bar, the A-G said that he comes from Kolkata which houses the oldest chartered High Court in the country. The Calcutta High Court was established on July 1, 1862 followed by the Bombay High Court on August 14, 1862 and the Madras High Court on August 15, 1862. “In the 158 years of its existence, Madras High Court has had 41 Chief Justices and Chief Justice Banerjee is the 42nd,” he said. Stating the Chief Justice had an extensive practice in civil, company arbitration and constitutional matters before being elevated as a judge of the Calcutta High Court in June 2006, the A-G said his judgements reflect a strong sense of social justice and deep constitutional values.  Missing girl case Hearing a case related to a missing girl, a Bench led by the Chief Justice had observed: “Criminal cases suffer because of lack of adequate investigation and lack of adequate material being produced. Though maintaining law and order was an important part of police duty, the investigating arm cannot be compromised.” The A-G also recalled the Chief Justice to have banned bursting of firecrackers during Kali Puja, Deepavali, Chhat Puja, Jagadhatri Puja and Guru Nanak birth anniversary celebrations in West Bengal “for the greater good of the citizens” and in larger public interest. In his reply, the Chief Justice expressed happiness over having shifted from a State with a long legacy of intellectual curiosity to a State of equally ancient wisdom. “Tamil Nadu is my State and I am a servant of the State from now on,” he told the gathering. Later in the day, he presided over the first Division Bench of the High Court along with Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy and heard a number of public interest litigation petitions. When a senior counsel urged the court to make certain observations in the court order and said that the words of the Chief Justice carry more weight among bureaucrats, the CJ replied: “I request you, with folded hands, not to make any distinction between the Chief Justice and the High Court. The Chief Justice is one of the servants.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/governor-administers-oath-of-office-to-cj-sanjib-banerjee/article33497688.ece

Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust will plant 4.53 lakh saplings of 108 species along the 30 km stretch from Napier Bridge to Paruthipattu. “We will plant the saplings along 5 m-wide stretch on either side of the river. At least 25 km of the riverbank will get walkways,” says an official. Residents expected nature trails along the river in areas such as College Road, Nungambakkam. For this project, the Bus Route Road Department of the Chennai Corporation had prepared a project report after senior officials visited San Antonio, U.S., 10 years ago. But officials are unlikely to focus on the project now. Instead, saplings will be planted along the entire stretch of the river, tweaking the eco-restoration project to suit the flood preparedness of each residential area, an official said. According to the revised plan, the residents are not likely to be permitted to have a morning walk after the infrastructure is developed. A decision will be made only after the eco-restoration is completed, said an official. Corporation officials said the construction of the wall had resumed after the COVID-19 restrictions were eased.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/45-lakh-saplings-to-be-planted-along-the-cooum/article33498381.ece
05 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Second round of medical counselling begins with 250 additional seats||The second round of counselling for medical and dental seats under the State quota began on Monday. The first day was reserved for students from government schools under the 7.5% special reservation. Although counselling was supposed to begin at 9 a.m., students waited anxiously until 12.30 p.m. with no clear idea of when they would be called. The delay was caused due to the court verdict for three students, officials said. Three girl students, who had attended counselling in the first round, had passed up the opportunity to study in self-financing medical colleges as they could not afford the fees. One of the students who approached the court said: “I did not take seat in a self-financing college as I could not afford it. Two days later, the government announced that it would bear the expenses of government school students. Had they allowed me, then I would have taken a seat,” she said. The three students belong to MBC category and had orders from the court that they should be given priority in counselling, subject to eligibility and availability of seats. The girls were finally accommodated in Sree Muthukumaran Medical College, which was given permission to admit 150 students on Monday. When counselling began finally, there were 12 seats in government medical colleges and 11 seats in self-financing colleges, including five in PSG Medical College and six in Muthukumaran Medical College. There were two seats each in the Government Dental College and Rajah Muthiah Dental College and 20 seats in self-financing dental colleges. PSG Medical College had received approval to add 100 seats after the first round of counselling. Of this, five seats were set aside for government school students, medical education officials said. At the end of the day, all seats under the 7.5% category were filled. 394 attend counselling Selection Secretary G. Selvarajan said that of the 778 candidates called for counselling, 394 attended. While 93 candidates opted to retain their seats, 254 chose to be wait-listed. M. Singaravelu, a casual labourer who had approached the court on behalf of his daughter said, “She has now got a free seat. Even the hostel accommodation is free. It is now up to her to study well.”  At the end of the day, all seats under the 7.5% category were filled||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/second-round-of-medical-counselling-begins/article33497689.ece

This will also be the first session since DMK president M.K. Stalin and other party colleagues presented a representation to the Governor, alleging corruption charges against some AIADMK leaders. Since Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced that the portraits of leaders V.O. Chidambaram Pillai and former Chief Ministers Omandur P. Ramaswamy Reddiar and P.

05 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||White foam seen in Cooum||Since Sunday, visitors to Marina beach saw the waves bring in thick, white foam. The foam, containing bacteria and phosphates, is not to be played in. Sources in the Water Resources Department said such foaming occurred after heavy rain since the run-off would deposit detergents from land into the rivers. A combination of factors, including high winds, rough seas and high level of phosphates, found in detergents, are causing the foaming. The portion of the Cooum, which empties into the sea near Napier Bridge, has been seen filled with thick foam, and the south-ward moving ocean current near the Marina brought this to the beach. This phenomenon can be seen as far as Nochikuppam, near the light house, which is a little over 3 km away. During the past two months, a considerable flow of rainwater in the Cooum had helped dilute pollutants, including sewage, sources said. Pravakar Mishra, scientist, National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR) at Pallikaranai, which has been regularly monitoring the Cooum estuary, said since 2013, there had been seven or eight incidents of high foaming. “We have lifted samples every month. During normal times, the phosphate level will be only 1-3 micromole/litre of water. But during frothing, it would go up to 15-25 micromoles/litre. On one occasion, it even went up to 54 micromoles/litre,” he said. He said proper and complete treatment of sewage produced in the city was the only answer to the problem. Former Member Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board K. Karthikeyan said efforts had to be taken to prevent small and large users from illegally letting out sewage into the waterways and stormwater drains. “Efforts are already being taken under the Cooum Restoration Programme to clean the river. Also, the treated sewage should be discharged beyond the littoral zone to prevent foaming in the tidal zone,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/white-foam-observed-in-cooum-stretch-near-napier-bridge/article33498147.ece
05 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Avoid doing anything adventurous at Veda Nilayam: HC||Justice N. Seshasayee of the Madras High Court on Monday advised the State government to avoid doing anything adventurous such as inaugurating a memorial for former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa at her Poes Garden residence Veda Nilayam until the court decides cases filed by her legal heirs against the acquisition proceedings. When a couple of cases filed by Jayalalithaa’s nephew J. Deepak and niece J. Deepa challenging the acquisition proceedings and the award passed by the acquisition officer were listed for hearing, Special Government Pleader E. Manoharan said the government had filed a counter affidavit in one case and sought two weeks to file the counter in the other case too. Cause for concern On the other hand, Mr. Deepak’s counsel S.L. Sudarsanam referred to a news report regarding the government’s plan to inaugurate a memorial at Veda Nilayam immediately after Pongal and sought interim orders. Finding force in his submissions, the judge asked the SGP to ensure that a status quo was maintained until the disposal of the cases. “Don’t do anything adventurous,” the judge said and agreed to take up the cases for final hearing on January 27 if both sides complete their pleadings by then. Mr. Manoharan requested the judge to desist from passing any adverse interim order and instead grant a short adjournment to facilitate the appearance of Advocate General Vijay Narayan. Accepting his request, Justice Seshasayee adjourned the cases to January 11.  The State government has acquired Veda Nilayam for a public purpose, whereas Mr. Deepak was objecting to this to serve his own interests, Chennai Collector R. Seethalakshmi told the court. Counter affidavit filed Filing a counter affidavit in response to a writ petition preferred by Mr. Deepak against the acquisition proceedings, the Collector said that there was no question of establishing a memorial in an alternative place since Veda Nilayam was closely associated with Jayalalithaa’s life and history. The counter, served on the petitioner’s counsel, read: “The late former Chief Minister would have appreciated and welcomed the steps taken by the government to convert the residence into a memorial to serve as a symbol of motivation.”  Asserting that the residence was being converted into a memorial by following due process, the Collector said that the memorial would promote tourism. Ms. Seethalakshmi also denied the charge of having conducted the acquisition proceedings in haste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/avoid-doing-anything-adventurous-at-veda-nilayam-hc/article33498158.ece

05 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Most theatres may allow full occupancy from Pongal||A majority of theatre owners in Tamil Nadu are expected to allow full occupancy in cinema halls from Pongal adhering to the Standard Operating Procedure laid down by the government. Some of them said they would restrict it to 70%-80%. “We don’t want to take chances [in view of COVID-19 spread]. We will sell only 70% of our tickets,” said a theatre owner in Chennai. “Fans who walk in shout, laugh and they breathe in and out. Considering all these factors we want to be cautious. Like hotels, we don’t want to see another COVID-19 cluster here. And if anything goes wrong then all theatres would be under the scanner necessarily,” he said. Even now, almost 400 theatres have not resumed operations and are in a wait and watch mode. Those who are already operating are yet to bring back their entire workforce. But big screens and multiplexes prefer full occupancy. “Even if [actor Vijay’s] Master is released, we will get crowds for the first four days and maybe the weekends. Post that, the occupancy will hover between 60%-70% so we don’t see much trouble coming in,” said the proprietor of a theatre near Chengalpattu.  Difficult period Udeep B., managing director of Mayajaal, said, “The exhibition industry has been through a very difficult period for the last 10 months and we were the first to close and last to open.” He expressed the confidence that in three to six months, like all other sectors of the economy, the film exhibition sector will also bounce back. GK Cinema’s managing partner Ruban Mathivanan said his theatre would go for 100% occupancy. Currently, there are good footfalls for old movies at his theatre. “We are screening Aayirathil Oruvan and even with 50% occupancy, we are seeing an average of 80% footfalls,” he said. ‘No dearth of films’ R. Paneerselvam, general secretary of the Tamil Nadu Film Exhibitors Association, said that counters at his theatres would sell 100% of the seats. With the government increasing the occupancy to 100%, more films would now start coming in. “There is no dearth of films in the Tamil industry,” he said, adding there were several big and small films waiting for release. A litmus test A theatre owner in Madurai said that the Pongal releases would be a litmus test. “One-third of movie goers will stay away from visiting the theatres. We expect the fans to come on day one. We highly doubt that families would come and take a risk. We need to wait and watch,” he added. Tamil Nadu has 1,213 screens, with over 6.36 lakh seats. According to estimates, a one-day closure of all theatres in the State would lead to an average loss of Rs. 8 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/most-theatres-in-tn-to-allow-full-occupancy-from-pongal/article33497693.ece

05 January 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Winter migrant birds sighted in Coimbatore||Winter migrants Sand Martin ( Riparia riparia) and Ruddy Turnstone (Arenaria interpres) are the new additions to the checklist of birds in Coimbatore district. First time The two birds were sighted and photographed for the first time in the district recently. Birders Gaja Mohanraj and Sharang Satish spotted a Sand Martin, a passerine bird in the Swallow family, at Krishnampathy tank in November. “An individual Sand Martin was sighted along with a group of Barn Swallow and Common House Martin. In December, a Sand Martin was spotted at Pallapalayam tank. The bird migrates to places like India from the Europe and Mediterranean countries,” said Mr. Mohanraj. The two birders also managed to photograph the bird. “Like other Swallows, Sand Martin primarily feeds on insects and flies during flight. It rests on places like the electric lines after feeding,” said Mr. Satish. According to Mr. Mohanraj, his recent sighting of Ruddy Turnstone at Achankulam, near Neelambur, was special as the wading bird is normally sighted on the coastlines. “Sighting of Ruddy Turnstone in inlands is rare as they prefer coastal areas. It could have made a stopover at Achankulam en route to a coastal area,” he said. Ruddy Turnstone gets its name from its typical feeding pattern of turning pebbles, shells, etc., with its bill to find the prey. G. Prakash, of Coimbatore Nature Society, said the birds are listed in the addendum of the second edition of ‘Birds of Coimbatore’, which will be released soon.  ‘A hotspot’ “Achankulam has become a hotspot for waders where more number of Lesser Sand Plover, Pacific Golden Plover and Curlew Sandpiper are sighted. Dabbling duck variety Gadwall was also spotted at Achankulam recently,” added Mr. Mohanraj.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/winter-migrant-birds-sighted-in-coimbatore/article33497753.ece

In a joint petition, the AITUC, Tamil Nadu Annal Ambedkar Sugadhara Thooimai Paniyalar Sangam, and Janasakthi Labour Union, submitted to the administration at the weekly grievance meeting on Monday, said there were thousands of workers working in panchayats, town panchayats and urban local bodies in the district for a paltry pay. Workers engaged for the Coimbatore Corporation get Rs. 375 a day. The workers clung on to their jobs even though they led a hand-to-mouth existence because they hoped for becoming permanent employees some day. Based on a court order that directed equal pay for equal work, the local bodies should pay as much to the contract workers and daily wagers as it paid permanent employees. But that was not the case. Recently, the Erode district administration revised the wages for such workers. And, the order was in implementation since November 2020. Taking a cue from the Erode district administration’s order, the Coimbatore administration should revise upwards the workers’ wages, the petition said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hike-wages-of-contract-workers-daily-wagers/article33498169.ece

A release from Collector C. Kathiravan said that based on the National Green Tribunal order no 435/2018 dated January 22, 2019, the Central and the State governments had banned rearing of the species as it was posing a threat to several local varieties of fish and polluting water bodies. Known as African Mushi, the species was introduced across the globe in 1980 for aquaculture and in India without official sanction. The fish had the ability to survive in shallow mud for a long period of time and had high tolerance to poorly oxygenated water. The release warned that rearing of the banned fish violated the law and action would be taken accordingly.

K. Selvaraj, coordinator of the forum, said many people participated in the protests held at Alanganallur, Sellur, Tamukkam and Perungudi as part of the State-wide protests held for jallikattu in 2017. “Although peaceful protests were held for conducting jallikattu, the police intentionally attacked the protesters and arrested many of them,” he said. It was stated in the petition that when an amendment bill was passed in the State Assembly for conducting jallikattu, the then Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam said that cases filed against the jallikattu protesters would be withdrawn. But the cases were transferred to CB-CID. Till date only inquiries were going on and a chargesheet had been filed against 179 protesters. “All these protesters took part in peaceful protests for conducting the traditional bull taming sport. But, instead of recognising their efforts, the government had been conducting inquiries with them for the past three years. Hence, the government must immediately withdraw the cases filed against them,” said Dileepan Senthil, a member of the forum. Act flayed Condemning the Tamil Nadu Bovine Breeding Act, 2019, the members said that the act was an indirect attempt to destroy indigenous cattle breeds. “One of the main focuses of the jallikattu protests was to save the indigenous bulls. But, in the recent years, very limited number of indigenous bulls are participating in the jallikattu events,” said Mr. Selvaraj.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/withdraw-cases-forum/article33497739.ece

A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi sought a response on the PIL petition filed by advocate G.V. Vairam Santhosh of Madurai. The State had proposed to set up over 2,000 mini clinics and would be recruiting healthcare staff for these clinics. A government order issued in December last had directed the Deputy Directors of Health Services to fill up the posts of 585 multipurpose workers and 1,415 staff nurses through an outsourcing method. A selection process that involved a large number of candidates must be held by adhering to the principles of reservation and communal rotation, and Medical Recruitment Board or employment exchanges must be involved in the process, he said. The petitioner said that the government order takes away the selection process and instead allowed a private agency to appoint the candidates. He sought a direction to the State to make the appointments by following due selection process. Additional Advocate General Sricharan Rangarajan told the court that the appointments were being made on a temporary basis till March this year. He sought time to get instructions in this regard. The case was adjourned till Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-bench-seeks-govts-response-on-recruitment-of-staff-for-mini-clinics/article33497732.ece

Thiagarajan, here on Monday.

A press release from its president N. Jegatheesan thanked the government for clearing the proposal of setting up AIIMS in Madurai. But the government must take steps to complete the project within the next two to three years with timely allotment of funds. Madurai airport must be included as a point of call immediately in the bilateral air services agreement with Malaysia, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. Despite repeated representations, Madurai airport had not yet been included as a point of call for any foreign airlines. Though the foreign airlines were convinced about the potential and viability of operating direct flights to Madurai, the lack of agreement proved to be a restraining factor, he said. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it must be ensured that every citizen was covered under affordable medical insurance and to this effect the government could forge a public-private partnership to bolster the medical infrastructure. Regarding rationalising GST tax rates, Mr. Jegatheesan said higher tax slabs such as 18% and 28% must be scrapped. Tax rates must be limited to three slabs - 5%, 10% and 15%. For luxury goods, 18% tax rate could be fixed. Essential branded food products must be exempted from tax. Apart from essential services, the tax rates for other services must not exceed 15%. Following the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, all drugs had become life-saving. Hence, the government must grant total tax exemption to all medicines. A separate set of rules must be framed for vehicle checking, survey, inspection and raids. Payment in cash for on-the-spot penalty or tax should not be permitted. Representatives of leading trade bodies across the country must be included in the GST Council to understand the requirements of industries, the release added.

05 January 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||‘Premature Covaxin nod will shatter public faith’||The Centre’s approval for Covaxin for carrying out vaccination against COVID-19 based on inference and without crucial third phase of trial would shatter public confidence in Indian research infrastructure, warned Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan. In a statement issued here on Monday, he said there was no second opinion that vaccination was an emergent need, but there was a global definition for the safety of vaccines. The present approval and recognition given to Covaxin did not fit in that definition. “The Centre has not spelt out the guidelines based on which the approval was given,” he said. He warned that if the “half-baked” research of Covaxin led to any adverse impact, it would not end up as a failure of just Covaxin, but would shatter public confidence in the very concept of vaccination. “If the common man starts to ignore vaccines, its impact would be costly,” he said, adding a wrong vaccine should not help the virus become more virulent. The Centre’s claim that Covaxin was 110% efficient against the new mutant virus was making the country’s scientific research laughable. The BJP which was trying to make ‘self-reliant’ and ‘Make-In-India’ ideologies as its political tools had given approval in a hurry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/premature-covaxin-nod-will-shatter-public-confidence-in-research/article33497729.ece

The State government had announced to give Rs. 2500 cash as Pongal gift along with a sugarcane, a kilogram of rice, sugar, cashew and others to every rice cardholder beginning from January 4. The DMK opposed AIADMK men issuing tokens and objected to it. They had insisted on the officials to give away the tokens to the cardholders. Under such circumstances, the AIADMK men had put up huge banners and party flags near the ration shops welcoming the public and thanking the Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and others. Irked, the DMK men led by town secretary Tamilmani objected to the AIADMK's flags and demanded that it be removed first. On information, the AIADMK town secretary Muruganandam arrived. There were wordy altercations between the two sides. As the situation looked like a free for all, the police intervened and held talks. After much persuasion, they made the AIADMK men remove the flags following which the DMK functionaries left the spot. However, when the AIADMK men posed for photographs with some of the beneficiaries at the ration shop, the DMK men too insisted to take photographs with the womenfolk. Though the district administration had claimed that they have issued tokens to 100 persons to collect the Pongal gift in the forenoon and another 100 tokens in the afternoon, long queues revealed that the officials had not issued tokens to every cardholder. An official, however, maintained that people, out of anxiety, turned up before the shops, though it was not their turn. " We will strictly ensure that only those numbers mentioned were present," the official added. Ramanathapuram  In Ramanathapuram, Collector Dinesh Ponraj Oliver visited two of the ration shops in Ramnad Town and at Keelakarai on Monday to oversee the distribution of the Pongal gift. In the presence of the AIADMK MLA Manikandan, the Pongal gift was distributed to the beneficiaries. According to an official, the district had 3,73,325 rice cardholders and a total of Rs. 93.33 crore would be distributed to them along with the rice and sugar in the next week. The officials said that they had issued tokens and with the covid-19 pandemic, the district administration, in coordination with the police and TNCSC officials, had given the guidelines. With the cooperation from the cardholders, the Collector hoped the process would be completed hassle-free. He appealed to the cardholders to be rest assured of the gifts and there need not be any panic or anxiety. Theni In Theni district, an official said that out of 4,08,385 cardholders, on the first day, 64,282 people received the Pongal gift and the hampers. The district administration had instructed the ration shop salesman in all the 517 shops to issue tokens and accordingly give away the gifts. On the first day, 15.72 % of cardholders had collected and the exercise would continue during this week, he added. Sivaganga Khadi and Village Industries Minister G Baskaran distributed the Pongal gifts to the cardholders in the district in the presence of the AIADMK functionaries. Collector P Madhusudhan Reddy presided. According to the officials, till January 13, the distribution of the hampers would go on in all the ration shops. The district has 4,01,218 card holders. The government had earmarked sufficient funds and the hamper kit was also despatched to the shops concerned. The public need not crowd in front of the shops and they repeatedly assured that all the eligible card holders would get the hampers well before the Pongal festival.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-men-object-to-aiadmk-cadres-giving-away-pongal-gift/article33497734.ece
05 January 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||CM submits memorandum to Centre, complains against L-G||Citing 13 instances of the “obstructionist” attitude of Puducherry Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi in ensuring the progress and welfare of people, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, in a memorandum to the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy, said Ms. Bedi’s continuance would “hamper” the growth and development of the Union Territory. Mr. Narayanasamy, in the eight-page memorandum submitted to the Minister during his one-day visit to Puducherry on January 3, said the blame of hampering the growth and development of the Union Territory would be on the Union government. Listing out the instances of the Lt. Governor’s interference, he said Ms. Bedi, in contravention of the Cabinet decision, ordered the closure of public sector mills. Around 800 acres acquired by the Pondicherry Industrial Promotion Development and Investment Corporation was lying unutilised due to the “delaying tactics” of the Lt. Governor, he said. Despite a decision of the Cabinet to delegate powers and specific directions of Centre to redelegate powers to the Chief Minister and Ministers, the Lt. Governor had not taken appropriate action. “The Lt. Governor has grabbed the entire financial powers of grant-in-aid and even for a thousand rupees, she is insisting that the Finance Department send the file to her. The grant-in-aid salary to PSU employees working in PASIC, PAPSCO, Sugar Mill, AFT, SBTML, Spinning Mill was delayed causing hardship to the employees,” the Chief Minister said. Mr. Narayanasamy also cited “arbitrary” verification of decisions of Chief Minister and Ministers by the Lt. Governor. Ms. Bedi also referred all matters to the Centre though the subjects were within the powers of Union Territory. This caused delay in executing projects, he said. The Chief Minister charged the Lt. Governor with writing letters to the Centre urging that funds already sanctioned be stopped, especially in the tourism sector. He accused Ms. Bedi of delaying the recruitment process of police constabulary and posts of VA, VAO, LDC and UDC. Demand for Statehood Reiterating his demand for Statehood, the Chief Minister said, in a democratic system, the real power should vest with the elected government. The Cabinet and elected representatives were accountable to the people through their collective responsibility to the legislature. “As a collective entity, the Council of Ministers owes responsibility to the legislature. The relationship between the Council of Ministers and the titular head of State is governed by the over-arching consideration that real power and substantive accountability is vested in the elected representatives,” the Chief Minister said. The principle of “aid and advice” in a constitutional sense was aimed at strengthening the constitutional value of representative government and of governance accountable and responsive to the electorate. On one hand, grants from Centre had reduced from 100% to 30% because the Union Territory was treated as a State with a legislature. While in other territories, particularly New Delhi, pension dues were borne by the Centre, Puducherry was not given the privilege. Had Puducherry been given Statehood, the government would have been eligible to receive 41 % as States got as per recommendations of the Finance Commission, he said. The memorandum also sought inclusion of Puducherry under the ambit of 15th Finance Commission Recommendations, need for increasing Central assistance and payment of GST compensation.  The blame of hampering the growth and development of the U.T. will be on the Union government||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-submits-memorandum-to-centre-complains-against-l-g/article33498393.ece

05 January 2021||PUDUCHERRY,TAMIL NADU||Congress to resume protest against Bedi||In a repeat of the day-night dharna held in 2019, the ruling Congress will launch an indefinite agitation seeking the recall of Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi in front of Raj Nivas from January 8. Speaking at a gathering near Kalapet on Sunday evening to mobilise support for the agitation, Chief Minister Narayanasamy said leaders and workers of alliance parties would stage the agitation till the Lieutenant Governor was removed. Her style of functioning had hindered the government’s effort to roll out welfare and development work in the Union Territory, he charged. Ratcheting up a long-standing stand-off with the titular head of the Union Territory, the Cabinet members had, in February 2019, launched an indefinite stir in front of Raj Nivas against Ms. Bedi’s style of functioning which attained national prominence and had the Centre providing security cover for Raj Nivas. Though a day after the Chief Minister and Ministers launched the stir, Lt. Governor had left for New Delhi, the week-long agitation ended after Ms. Bedi returned and the government held talks with her at the Raj Nivas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/congress-to-resume-protest-against-bedi/article33498382.ece

Speaking at a ‘Makkal Grama Sabha’ meeting near Gorimedu, he added that Opposition leader M.K. Stalin demanded that the State government offer a cash relief of Rs. 7,500 to help the people tide over COVID-19 difficulties. “Chief Minister Edappadi K.

The State Highways (NH Wing) on Monday began a massive eviction drive to clear encroachments on both sides of the road stretch. The eviction drive, carried out under the supervision of the senior Highways officials and with heavy police protection, is likely to continue on Tuesday too. The National Highways Authority of India had already taken up work on widening and strengthening Tiruchi-Pudukottai-Karaikudi NH beyond Mathur, the State Highways has now taken up work on the city stretch of the highway. The stretch is an arterial road in the city as it leads to the Tiruchi International Airport. According to sources in the Highways, the road stretch is to be widened and made into a four-lane highway at an estimated cost of about Rs. 68 crore. Storm water drains would be built on both sides of the road. Work on the project is expected to begin shortly and hence the Highways Department (NH wing) had taken up the eviction drive. Utility lines such as electricity lines are also to be shifted soon. Already trees on the road have been cut to facilitate widening. A senior official said that the department would plant adequate number of tree saplings, once the road was widened, to compensate for the loss of green cover. He indicated that the project would be completed within the next six to seven months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tiruchi-pudukottai-highway-to-become-four-laned/article33497701.ece
05 January 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Despite good harvest, senkarumbu farmers wary of poor returns||Farmers in Tiruchi and Thanjavur districts have started harvesting ‘ senkarumbu’ also known as ‘panneer karumbu ,’ the edible sugarcane variety that is ubiquitous during Pongal festivities. However, a section of the farmers are complaining of poor returns although the harvest has been good this year. Farmers raise the crop of 10-11 months duration in specific pockets such as Tiruvalarsolai and Thirukattupalli seeking to make a good profit during the season. As was the case last year, there seems to be a glut in production this year too given the availability of water for irrigation. The decision of the State government to supply a full grown cane, instead of a piece (as was the practice earlier) as part of the Pongal gift distributed to ration card holders this year has evoked mixed reactions from the farmers. While some are happy over the increase in quantum of purchase of sugarcane for distribution through various government agencies, many farmers complain that they were not getting good returns as those involved in procuring the sugarcane allegedly take a cut in some places. Some others are also worried that the government move to supply a full grown cane through ration shops may force private traders to scale down their purchase as there may not be much demand in the open market. “We have had a good season this year and I have just started the harvest as the government authorities have started the procurement,” said S.Bala of Thiruvalarsolai near Tiruchi. Mr. Bala says he was offered by Rs. 22 apiece by the government officials as he grows high quality cane which are of seven feet in height. But O. Panneerselvam of Thiruvalarsolai, who had raised sugarcane on an acre, says he was offered Rs. 19 apiece for the 1,000 canes procured from him apparently for distribution through ration shops. However, he was worried that traders have not come to procure sugarcane yet, possibly fearing that there may not be much demand due to the government supply. “I have invested over Rs. 1.20 lakh for raising the crop and only if I get at least Rs. 22-25, I will be able to get a return of Rs. 30,000-40,000,” he said. Some farmers in Thirukattupalli area complained that they were being offered only Rs. 13- 15 a cane this year including by those procuring cane for supply through ration shops. “Farmers are being offered only Rs. 13.50 for government supply and now traders are also bargaining with us seeking cane for the same rate,” said P. Raghu, a farmer of Nadupadugai near Thirukattupalli. Farmers point out that demand for the senkarumbu ends with the Pongal festival and hence they have little bargaining power. Mr. Raghu suggested that procurement of the cane be done through cooperative societies without the involvement of middlemen. This would help farmers get the price offered by the government, he felt. “Only if farmers get Rs. 22-25 a cane, they will be able to make some profit,” he observed.  Govt. move to supply full grown canes through ration shops may force private traders to scale down their purchase||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/despite-good-harvest-senkarumbu-farmers-wary-of-poor-returns/article33497700.ece

Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam on Monday travelled together, in a car, from the Thoothukudi airport to Govindaperi in Tirunelveli, to inaugurate the memorial of former Speaker P.H. Pandian. At Karungulam near Melapalayam, the joint leaders of the AIADMK got down from the car and boarded an open jeep to accept the reception accorded by over 2,000 cadre, led by the party’s Tirunelveli district secretary, Thatchai N. Ganesa Raja. They again boarded the car to continue their journey to Govindaperi, covering a total distance of about 57 km. The Chief Minister inaugurated the memorial Paul Hector Pandian at his native village, Govindaperi, near Cheranmahadevi, on the former Speaker’s first death anniversary. He lauded Pandian’s exemplary courage and confidence while arguing cases in courts. “Only after T.N. Seshan became the Chief Election Commissioner, everyone understood the powers of the EC. Similarly, it was Pandian who demonstrated the powers of the Assembly, thanks to his in-depth knowledge in law,” Mr. Palaniswami said. Over 17,000 acres of government land, under encroachment along the Old Mamallapuram Highway, were retrieved in 1986, thanks to Pandian’s legal battle. He also donated 5 acres of land in Govindaperi for the construction of buildings for the Manonmaniam Sundaranar University’s (MSU) Mano College. Mr. Panneerselvam said the Kannadiyan channel, dug in Cheranmahadevi constituency, had redefined farming operations in the region. He also lauded the contributions of former MSU Vice-Chancellor Cynthia Pandian, wife of Pandian and a Fulbright scholar herself, in the field of education. Thanking the two leaders, Pandian’s son P.H. Manoj Pandian said the cohesiveness prevailing among leaders of the AIADMK and the cadre would reflect in future to ensure a resounding victory for the ruling party. The memorial, established on 20 cents of land, has Pandian’s two-ft tall marble statue, in a sitting posture, in the ornamental chair of the Speaker of the Assembly. Earlier, when the Chief Minister’s convoy was crossing Vallanaadu, one of the vehicles in the convoy hit a cow that strayed onto the highway. The driver applied the brake immediately. Fortunately, the following vehicle’s driver swerved to the right to avoid a pile-up. The two leaders also visited Ambasamudram MLA R. Murugiah Pandian, who is unwell, at his residence in Paapaankulam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-dy-cm-come-together-to-inaugurate-pandians-memorial/article33497715.ece

Addressing a ‘makkal gram sabha’, held by the DMK in Alivalanallur of Valangaiman taluk, Mr. Stalin said not all those sporting a green towel could claim to be farmers. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and his Cabinet colleagues had not done anything for the upliftment of the farmers, he said. While the erstwhile DMK regime implemented several schemes to usher in prosperity for farmers, the present government had ruined their lives, he said. “Even now, the Chief Minister and his Ministers are trying to swindle the exchequer, in the last four months of their rule,” he said. The DMK leader also pointed to the malpractices in the procurement of paddy and listed out what he termed as the “corrupt practices” of Food Minister R. Kamaraj. Mr. Stalin said the presence of women, in large numbers, at the meeting, had infused confidence in him that the DMK will romp home with a massive victory in the Assembly election. Mr. Kamaraj, when asked for his response, cautioned Mr. Stalin against making wild allegations against Ministers and giving them unsavoury epithets. ‘Failed farmers, youth’ Later, addressing an MGS in Padirikuppam panchayat in Cuddalore, Mr. Stalin said that farmers and youth were in a sad predicament, with the State government not creating any specific schemes for them. “I do not question the Chief Minister and the Ministers’ visits abroad, but I want to know what the purpose of these were. The Chief Minister had said that the State had attracted investment to the tune of Rs. 1,90,000 crore, in the last 10 years. But the fact is that the State has attracted investment only to the tune of Rs. 16,088 crore,” he said. [The government has denied this.]   He reiterated his charge that the Local Administration Department, headed by Minister S.P. Velumani, was steeped in corruption. “Wait for four more months and the DMK government, after the Assembly polls, will relieve the people of grievances,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/exchequer-being-swindled-stalin/article33497719.ece

05 January 2021||January 05 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||Government permits theatres to open with full capacity||But big screens and multiplexes prefer full occupancy. “Even if [actor Vijay’s] Master is released, we will get crowds for the first four days and maybe the weekends. After that, the occupancy will hover between 60%-70%. So we do not see much trouble coming in,” said the proprietor of a cinema hall near Chengalpattu. Difficult period Udeep B., managing director of Mayajaal, said, “The exhibition industry has been through a very difficult period for the last 10 months and we were the first to close and last to open.” He expressed the confidence that in three to six months, like all other sectors of the economy, the film exhibition sector will also bounce back. GK Cinema’s managing partner Ruban Mathivanan said his theatre would go for 100% occupancy. Currently, there are good footfalls for old movies at his theatre. “We are screening Aayirathil Oruvan and even with 50% occupancy, we are seeing an average of 80% footfalls,” Mr. Mathivanan added. ‘No dearth of films’ R. Paneerselvam, general secretary of the Tamil Nadu Film Exhibitors’ Association, said that counters at his theatres would sell tickets for 100% of the seats. With the government increasing the occupancy to 100%, more films would now start coming in. “There is no dearth of films in the Tamil industry,” he said, adding there were several big and small films waiting for release. A theatre owner in Madurai said that the Pongal releases would be a litmus test. “One-third of movie goers will stay away from visiting the theatres. We expect the fans to come on day one. We highly doubt that families would come and take a risk. We need to wait and watch,” he added. Tamil Nadu has 1,213 screens, with over 6.36 lakh seats. According to estimates, a one-day closure of all theatres in the State would lead to an average loss of Rs. 8 crore.

05 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Citizens, KIA employees thrilled as train service begins||The excitement was palpable as the long wait for a train service to the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) ended with trains chugging in on Monday. The SWR operated five pairs of trains from the city to Kempegowda International Airport on the inaugural day. On the train that originated from Yelahanka, which caters to people living in the northern parts of the city, this reporter boarded the train that left at 7 a.m. after buying a ticket for Rs. 10. There were a few passengers on the train, most of who were railway officials and police personnel. Railway staff were seen discussing how one can travel from the city to the airport for just Rs. 10. They were also watching live telecast of the news of the train services. The first experience was unlike the one in other modes of transport; there were no signs of the usual traffic chaos, and one could spot major landmarks located close to the track, starting with the Yelahanka lake and the 105-year-old Doddajala station. The Chickballapur to Yelahanka line was opened in 1918. After crossing Bettahalasur and Doddajala stations, the train reached the newly built halt station at KIA at 7.22 a.m. Road travel from Yelahanka could have cost around Rs. 500 and would have taken at least 40 minutes. At the halt station, the feeder bus was waiting to take passengers to the airport.  The train service comes as a huge relief for passengers and close to 25,000 people working at the airport. Noorulla, who has been working at the airport for eight years, boarded the Bangarpet to Yeshwantpur train. He said: “Thousands of people are working at the airport in various divisions. Introduction of train services will help them in a big way. I bought a ticket for just Rs. 10 to travel from the airport to Yeshwantpur. Train services are economical compared to other modes of transport, and saves time. Employees have already started circulating the train schedules on social media and more people will travel in the coming days.” “A taxi ride could cost anywhere between Rs. 700 and Rs. 800, but here one can travel for just Rs. 10. There is no traffic issue and no paying toll,” said an employee. Sanjeev Dyammanavar, who has been advocating for a robust suburban train network in the city, said: “For a decade, people have been demanding for a train service to the airport. We must thank the railways and BIAL for facilitating the infrastructure to provide the services. The halt station has several amenities. Increased patronage will help the SWR to run trains with increased frequency.” Rajkumar Dugar of Citizens for Citizens, who travelled in the train from Cantonment, said: “We are happy, finally. It was a joyful experience to travel in the first train to the airport. In addition to people heading to the airport, there is a need to promote the service among local villagers. Building a road network from the station to the National Highway will help a large number of people and also increase patronage for the trains.” The BIAL has reportedly closed the existing road that links the halt station with the National Highway for security reasons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/citizens-kia-employees-thrilled-as-train-service-begins/article33498133.ece
05 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Error in data on U.K. returnees rectified||While the threat of the U.K. strain of COVID-19 virus looms large, there has been much confusion over the number of U.K. returnees to the State, those not traceable, and those tested so far. Till Sunday, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar and health officials had been giving out different sets of numbers on these. The discrepancy was, however, rectified on Monday, after The Hindu pointed it out. The daily media bulletin issued by the Health Department till Sunday stated that 2,127 international passengers had arrived in the State from the United Kingdom. However, Mr. Sudhakar had been saying that a total of 5,068 passengers had landed here from the U.K. from November 25 onwards. Of these, as many as 4,238 passengers had arrived in the State starting from December 9. “Out of 5,068 people, 4,238 have come since December 9 and 810 were transit passengers travelling to other States. Information regarding those 810 passengers has been shared with the respective States,” the Minister said. Interestingly, the media bulletin till Sunday stated that 2,173 U.K. returnees had been tested through RT-PCR and other methods so far. This number was higher than the total arrivals of 2,127 mentioned in the bulletin. A similar confusion prevailed over the number of U.K. returnees yet to be traced. While both Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) authorities said 50 persons were yet to be traced, the Minister put the number at 75, including 72 from Bengaluru. Attributing these differing versions to a lack of coordination in the Health Department, sources said transparency and consistency in data was vital, especially during a pandemic. However, on Monday, the numbers were aligned with the Minister’s version. Still not traceable Meanwhile, 13 days after all flights to the country from the U.K. were stopped, Karnataka is still struggling to trace the 75 returnees. Sources said this was a matter of serious concern as even if one among the missing returnees is a carrier of the new strain, there is a possibility of a spike. The new strain has a high rate of transmission. However, experts said there was no need to panic as no cluster infections have been reported so far. “We will have to wait and watch for cluster infections and initiate immediate measures to ensure there is no further spread,” said V. Ravi, nodal officer for genetic confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka and a member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). The Health Minister reiterated on Monday that the Home Department and the BBMP have been trying to trace the missing returnees. “Tracinghas been delayed as the 75 include some foreign nationals who may not have local contact numbers and addresses. Their details have been collected from immigration department. The Home Department has assured us that everyone will be traced soon so that they can be tested,” he said.

05 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Yatnal, CM face off at legislators’ meet||Vijayapura MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal is learnt to have faced off with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa at a closed door meeting with Bombay-Karnataka BJP legislators in Bengaluru on Monday. Senior MLAs had to intervene and calm the two down, party sources said. This comes just a day after BJP national general secretary Arun Singh castigated Mr. Yatnal for consistently speaking on leadership change in public and directed the State unit to submit a report on the statements Mr. Yatnal has recently made. Mr. Singh had said Mr. Yatnal could raise any issue only on the party forum. ‘Step-motherly treatment’ Mr. Yatnal, reportedly first took objection to alleged “disparity and step-motherly treatment” to some constituencies including his and several others in North Karnataka, but soon dragged in the name of Chief Minister’s son B.Y. Vijayendra. Mr. Yediyurappa strongly objected to this, sources in the meeting said. “M.P. Renukacharya, who stood up to counter Mr. Yatnal, was snubbed by him,” a party leader in the know said. Mr. Yatnal reportedly took objection to the Chief Minister’s son running a “parallel administration” and asked Mr. Yediyurappa as to why a senior leader like him should meet Mr. Vijayendra who had no Constitutional role in the State’s administration. The Chief Minister is learnt to have shot back saying his doors were always open and MLAs could walk in any time and meet him at ‘Krishna’ and ‘Cauvery’, his home office and residence.  Not content with that, Mr. Yatnal reportedly launched a full-throttle attack and made allegations of corruption, misgovernance and accused the Chief Minister of “compromising the ideals” and “damaging the party.” An angry Chief Minister is learnt to have shot back that it was Mr. Yatnal who was damaging the party and the government with constant outbursts. Soon, senior MLA Umesh Katti and Ministers like B. Sriramulu intervened and calmed them down, sources in the meeting said. Mr. Katti reportedly said senior MLAs could not be expected to come to the capital for every small work and asked the Chief Minister to be accessible over telephone as well.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/yatnal-cm-face-off-at-legislators-meet/article33497959.ece

05 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||‘Students mingling outside the premises a cause for concern’||While teachers and school managements are attempting to be strict in enforcing physical distancing in classrooms, they are finding it difficult to ensure that students follow the same norm after class hours, before they return home. Many private school managements have sent advisories to parents to instruct them to maintain distance outside the school premises as well. Hanging out D. Shashi Kumar, General Secretary, Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka (KAMS), said that schools have spotted many Class X students hanging out at eateries or cafés near the school. “We make sure that our students maintain distance and wear masks all the time when they are inside the school. But once they get out of the school they are found to be interacting in close proximity with each other, without masks. This is worrying as we do not want students to pass on the infection to others,” he said. He said that schools are currently conducting three-hour classes and letting students off before lunch so that they avoid eating lunch together. P.M. Sathyanarayana, Secretary, Lal Bahadur Shastri Memorial High School, said that they have even started sending messages to parents 10 minutes before their classes end. “We ask the parents to check if they have returned home on time as we do not want them to mingle with each other outside school,” he said. He added that they were forced to do this as they did not want school managements to be blamed for any unforeseen events. Mr. Satyanarayana said that they take great care to ensure that the schools and classrooms are sanitised every day and also have stringent mechanisms in place to ensure that physical distancing is maintained. Parents on vigil Sushant S., a parent whose son studies in Class X in a private school in Bengaluru, said, “On Saturday, my son came back home very late as he spent time with his friends after classes. So from today I have decided that I will drop and pick him up from school so that he does not mingle with other students after classes.” Schools across Karnataka reopened on January 1 after nine-and-a-half months for II P.U. and Class 10 students. Based on the feedback and response for Class X students, the State government will take a call on whether other classes can be opened in a phased manner from January 15.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/students-mingling-outside-the-premises-a-cause-for-concern/article33497814.ece
05 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||MLAs pour out their woes to Yediyurappa||The region-wise BJP legislators’ meetings that Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa chaired on Monday turned into a platform for MLAs to pour out their woes. Their complaints ranged from lack of funds for development works and district Ministers ignoring them to MLAs not having a say even in transfers within their constituencies. Meetings of BJP MLAs from Kalyana Karnataka, Bombay Karnataka and coastal districts were held on Monday, and the rest will meet on Tuesday. Sources claimed that MLAs, by and large, were happy with the meeting particularly since the Chief Minister issued directions to Ministers over concerns raised by MLAs. They have demanded similar meetings be held every quarter and Mr. Yediyurappa is learnt to have assured the MLAs that he would meet once every three months. The meetings, an attempt by the Chief Minister to reach out to MLAs, come in the backdrop of speculations over leadership change in the State and reported discontent among MLAs over inaccessibility of the Chief Minister and lack of development funds. At all the three meetings, Mr. Yediyurappa, in his initial remarks, explained how floods in 2019 and the pandemic in 2020 had put enormous strain on the State’s finances and also altered its priorities. He promised to cater to demands of party MLAs in the upcoming State budget to the “best of his abilities”, but also cautioned that the pandemic will cast a long shadow on 2021 as well. The Chief Minister with almost a full Cabinet in tow fielded the brewing discontent among the MLAs, often pulling up Ministers concerned over delay in sanctioned works. He also reviewed the performance of MLAs with the recent gram panchayat poll results as a measure, sources said. On the complaint against district in-charge Ministers undermining MLAs, he is learnt to have suggested that they meet him directly. “I will ensure your works are done,” the Chief Minister is learnt to have told MLAs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mlas-pour-out-their-woes-to-yediyurappa/article33497960.ece
05 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Crimes against women: Safe City Project dogged by delays, fresh controversy||Eight years after the chilling gang rape in New Delhi that spurned a slew of measures to be initiated for women’s safety, including instituting the Nirbhaya Fund for women safety in metro cities by the then UPA-II government, Bengaluru is still struggling to implement measures under the fund. The proposal for the Safe City Project, which has been in the thick of controversy resulting in the two sparring IPS officers being transferred recently, was made by the city police in 2013. But it was approved by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs only in 2018. The State government, which will share 40% of the Rs. 667 crore project cost, took another year to approve the same and finalised it in October 2019. Since then, tenders have been cancelled twice, while the third call is under way and under the lens. While the first call was cancelled in January 2020 over failure of participants to pass pre-qualification criteria, the second call was cancelled in July 2020 with one of the bidders pitching products from Chinese firm Huawei and the State government banning procurement of Chinese make/origin products in the light of the Galwan Valley clash. Meanwhile, D. Roopa, until recently secretary-PCAS, accused of unauthorised intervention in the tender process over which the government instituted an enquiry, has alleged “bias, violation of norms” in the present tender as well. The city will be equipped with 7,500 cameras and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning-powered video monitoring systems, among a host of other measures for women’s safety under the project. Activist K.S. Vimala came down heavily on the delay in implementation of the project. “The inordinate delay by the Union government and later by the State government exposes the hypocrisy of lip service paid to women safety by the political class,” she said. The project has also come under criticism for the measures it envisages. “It relies heavily on surveillance cameras, which may help the police crack crimes after they happen, but its capacity to prevent crimes is questionable,” Ms. Vimala said, arguing there are other priorities like victim rehabilitation that have completely been given a go by. However, an officer associated with the project, said cameras were only a small part of the project. “Key addition to the city’s policing infrastructure is a live monitoring facility of feeds from all the cameras – at a centralised control room and at every police station. Video monitoring and analysis systems will be powered by AI and machine learning which can carry out face, form, and colour recognition apart from automated number plate recognition,” he said. The project also includes establishing 50 safety islands at isolated spots across the city, where any woman can press a buzzer to get into a telephone booth like island and help will rush immediately. A new integrated women’s helpline number, a distress centre, and a counselling centre are part of the project. Bengaluru city Police Commissioner Kamal Pant, also a member of the State level apex committee monitoring the ongoing tender, said the government was keen on completing the present tender. “The ongoing tender has not been compromised. Though there was an unauthorised attempt to access the ‘Request for Proposal’ before it was published, it was unsuccessful. The last date for submission of bids is January 8 and we will ensure this time it goes through,” he said.  The last date for submission of bids is January 8 and we will ensure this time it goes through.

05 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||No fee, no online class: Parents stage protest||Parents staged a protest outside the premises of a private school in the city urging the management not to block online classes over non-payment of fees. Many schools were resorting to this practice to get parents to pay fees. Parents, on the other hand, said many had lost jobs or faced paycuts and were unable to pay fees amidst the pandemic. A parent, who ran his own business, said he was unable to pay as he was not making profit. “But, my business will pick up in a few months and I will be able to pay the fees. I want my daughter to continue in the same school and attend online classes. I just need a few months to pay the fees,” said the parent who protested on Monday. The school management was unavailable for comment.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-fee-no-online-class-parents-stage-protest/article33498134.ece

05 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC notice on regularising illegal constructions||The High Court of Karnataka on Monday ordered issue of notice to the State government on a PIL petition, which has contended that the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) cannot regularise illegal constructions put up in layouts formed by BDA, after the layouts were transferred to the Bruhat Bangalore Manahagara Palike (BBMP). A Division Bench passed the order on the petition filed by K.B. Vijayakumar, a city-based advocate. “The action of regularising illegal possession of lands acquired by the BDA and illegally constructed structures amounts to encouraging illegal possession of government lands and penalising honest citizen who paid exorbitant prices for purchase a piece of land from the open market or from the through allotment by waiting for years,” the petitioner claimed. Pointing out that people have been applying for years and years for allotment of a site in BDA formed layouts, the petitioner contended that allowing somebody illegally squatting on lands acquired by the BDA violates the basic right of equity before the law guaranteed under the Constitution. “When the land itself is an illegal holding, trying to regularise the building on it is not acceptable especially when the power for sanctioning/approving building plans lies with the BBMP and not BDA,” the petitioner contended, while questioning the legality of amendment made to the BDA Act by inserting Section 38D to enable regularisation of unauthorised occupation and illegal constructions on lands acquired by the BDA in the city.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-notice-on-regularising-illegal-constructions/article33498123.ece

Chairing a review meeting on the summary revision of electoral roll in Dharwad on Monday, Ms. Maddineni said that the district returning officer, assistant voters registration officers and booth level officials should verify the applications at various levels. If there were any applications from non-resident Indians, they should check the stage of clearance, she said. She said that the booth level officials should visit houses of the applicants to verify their claims and applications submitted to block level officials should be verified and included in the electoral roll and steps should be taken to issue Elector’s Photo Identity Cards (EPIC) to them. She also asked the officials to take steps to verify applications of eligible voters above the age of 18 submitted in the district before December 17 and take steps to distribute Elector’s Photo Identity Cards to eligible voters on National Voters Day on January 25. Ms. Maddineni asked the officials to identify 20 polling stations where the maximum number of voters had been included and also 20 polling stations where the maximum number of voters had been dropped or deleted from the voter list. And, in such polling stations, work on addition and deletion should be put to scrutiny so as to ascertain the quality of revision, she said. She also told the officials not to delete names from voter list on their own and do so only if there were any applications seeking such modification. “It is the responsibility of the officials to ensure that migrant workers are not put to hardships. They should also ensure that there is no duplication of voters in the constituencies sharing borders with other districts and, this needs to be tested through required software tools. Also, create adequate awareness about the whole process,” she said. Additional Deputy Commissioner Shivanand Karale told the meeting that from November 18, 2020 to January 2, 2021, they had received 10,449 applications seeking addition to electoral roll, 6,123 applications for deletion, 2,421 applications for correction and 993 applications for transfer.

None is perfect. I want to make the maximum contribution to the development of the university. First, the digital library, which was started with assistance from Sudha Murthy of Infosys Foundation, needs to be developed further. I am ready to provide Rs. 1 crore from my society for it,” he said. “Second, we are planning to start coaching classes for aspirants of UPSC examinations. If Gulbarga University offers to be a partner with us, we will start the classes on the university campus itself. Third, we are keen on establishing a heritage museum that would showcase the cultural heritage of the Kalyana Karnataka region. If Gulbarga University provides 5 acres on its campus, we will establish it here itself and bear all the costs,” Mr. Sedam said. He made the offer after inaugurating the 41st foundation day ceremony on university campus here on Monday. Gulbarga University Vice-Chancellor (Acting) Chandrakant M. Yatanoor and event convenor and the head of Mathematics Department N.B. Naduvinamani and other senior faculty members participated.

He made this comment after Kannada Department head H.T. Pote, while briefing about the university’s achievements in the last one year, mentioned the number of patents applied from the university scholars for their research. “This patent regime is influenced by the West and its market-oriented approach. The market economy sees everything as a commodity and fixes a price for it. We are stuck in this approach. Knowledge should not be patented. It should not be the property of any one person or entity. It should be the property of society and everybody in society should be free to use it,” he said.

Yediyurappa to hold a meeting to review the progress of various development works in Bidar district during his visit to lay the foundation stone for the Anubhava Mantapa scheduled on Wednesday. Addressing presspersons here on Sunday, Mr. Khandre said that Mr. Yediyurappa would be laying the foundation stone for the Anubhava Mantapa in Basavakalyan town in Bidar district. The Chief Minister should convene a review meeting either at Basavakalyan or in Bidar to discuss the problems of stubble burning. Referring to the Anubhava Mantapa, Mr. Khandre said that a seven-member technical committee headed by scholar G.R. Channabasappa was constituted by the Basavakalyan Development Board. The committee had recommended to the then Siddaramaiah-led Congress government to construct the Anubhava Mantapa at an estimated cost of Rs. 650 crore. In 2018, Mr. Siddaramaiah had made an allocation of Rs. 650 crore for the construction of the Anubhava Mantap at Basavakalyan and also had announced that Rs. 100 crore would be released immediately, he added. Mr. Khandre said that a detailed project report for the Anubhava Mantapa was prepared and technical approval was given during the Congress government, and now the BJP-led government is trying to hoodwink the people by laying the foundation stone for the project. The foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Anubhava Mantapa scheduled on Wednesday is aimed at influencing byelections to the Basavakalyan Assembly Constituency, Mr. Khandre said and added that the BJP leaders were trying to derive political mileage by organising the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Anubhava Mantapa. Mr. Khandre, however, welcomed the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Anubhava Mantapa, the parliament of the 12th-century social reformer Basaveshwara, which had given representation to women and all sections of society. He said that the messages given by the 12th-century sharanas through their vachanas are relevant even today.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/khandre-welcomes-foundation-stone-for-anubhava-mantapa-but-says-it-is-aimed-at-influencing-bypolls/article33497789.ece
05 January 2021||KALABURAGI,KARNATAKA||2020 was a black year, says Ugrappa||Congress leader and former Lok Sabha member from Ballari V.S. Ugrappa termed 2020 a black year marked by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government misrule in the country. Addressing a media conference at the Ballari Press Club on Sunday, he said that the Union government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had completely failed to safeguard the interests of the people and secure national boundaries. “Under the Modi government, the country’s economy is destroyed. Growth became a mirage. Unemployment attained a historic low. The country’s territories, especially along the borders of China and Pakistan, are at stake,” Mr. Ugrappa said. Sharply targeting the Prime Minister, the KPCC spokesperson said that Mr. Modi did not come out of the national capital when people were in trouble but he did come out when the elections were declared to different States to reach out to voters. “You must remember that the Union government had announced a special package of Rs. 21 lakh crore when COVID-19 struck the country. But, nobody knows how much money reached the people in need. Under Mr. Modi, the country’s economy is unprecedentedly devastated. All the toiling masses, especially farmers and workers, are facing the worst crisis. The enactment of three farm-related laws, against which farmers are protesting, was like rubbing salt into their wounds,” Mr. Ugrappa said. On the BJP-led State government, he criticised Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa for spending most of his time in elections and Cabinet expansion exercise. “The government is so bankrupt that it is not able to pay compensation to rape victims. The flood victims who lost their houses and means of livelihood are still waiting for compensation. The government has no money to pay widow pension, old age pension and scholarships to students,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/2020-was-a-black-year-says-ugrappa/article33497792.ece

05 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Kambala likely to start this month-end||Amid uncertainties over organising Kambala (slush track buffalo races) in the coastal region due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Kambala Committee of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Kasaragod in Kerala has tentatively decided to conduct some Kambala events starting from this month-end. Commencement of Kambala events, usually from November, have been delayed due to COVID-19 factors. The committee which met in Moodbidri in Dakshina Kannada on Saturday decided not to organise the events during night, according to Barkuru Shantharama Shetty, honorary president of the committee. He told The Hindu that the committee members will soon meet the Deputy Commissioners of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi in connection with organising the events. Mr. Shetty said that the committee decided that seven Kambala events can be organised each for two consecutive days during the daytime. The first Kambala will be at Hokkadigoli in Bantwal taluk of Dakshina Kannada on January 30 and January 31. It will be followed by Aikala Bava Kambala at Aikala on February 6 and 7, at Vamanjoor-Tiruvail on Februray 13 and 14, at Moodbidri on February 20 and 21. All these will be in Dakshina Kannada. The Karkala Miyar Kambala in Udupi district will be held on February 27 and 28. The Bangra Kuluru Kambala in Mangaluru city will be organised on March 6 and March 7. A week thereafter, the Venur Permuda Kambala, all in Dakshina Kannada, will be conducted on March 20 and 21. All the events have been scheduled on Saturdays and Sundays, he said. He said that Kambala organisers, under the committee, in Puttur, Uppinangady and Bangadi Kolli, near Belthangady, may organise the events during the season. But at present they have not been scheduled. Mr. Shetty said that the Katpady and Nandikur Kambala events in Udupi district have also not been scheduled for the current season and two more Kambala events regularly held in Kasaragod district of Kerala have also not been scheduled now. All these years, about 18 to 20 Kambala events were being held under the auspices of the committee between November and March. Some Kambala events had to be dropped this year due to COVID-19 restrictions. Mr. Shetty said that about 150 pairs of buffaloes are expected to run during the two days of each Kambala event this time. Controlling the crowd will be a challenge for the committee. He said that about 30 to 35 Sampradayika Kambala events have already been conducted in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts this year between November 15 and December 15.

Talking to reporters, Mr. Ahmed said that the party has booth level units and it now was moving towards forming panchayat level committees with each committee comprising about 25 members. “By doing this, we are bringing more people into the party fold. We are moving from a mass party to a cadre-based party,” Mr. Ahmed said. All the district units have been asked to complete the process of forming panchayat level committees by January 25. These committees will be broad based and the members will be trained in the party’s philosophy and ideals. “After panchayat level committees, we will form committees at booth level,” he said and added that these committees will be a strong base for the party’s victory in the forthcoming taluk pachayat, zilla panchayat and Assembly elections. The formation of these committees has nothing to do with the performance of candidates supported by the party in the just concluded gram panchayat elections, he said.  Meeting The first of the four divisional level party workers meet will be held in Bantwal on January 6. This will be followed by meetings in Bengaluru Rural on January 8, in Hubballi on January 11 and in Kalaburagi on January 18. As many as 677 party leaders, including State Congress president D.K. Shivakumar and the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, have been invited for the meeting at Bantwal. District Congress presidents from Mysuru division and from Shivamogga district will attend. Expressing regrets over the death of Deputy Chairman of the Legislative Council S.L. Dharme Gowda, Mr. Ahmed, who served in the Council for two six-year terms, blamed the State government for his death. “The State government hastily asked Mr. Dharme Gowda to sit on the Chairman’s seat. Shutting the door on the Chairman and the unsavoury incidents that followed in the Council should not have happened, and these have caused a lot of damage,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/congress-to-form-committees-at-gram-panchayat-level/article33498332.ece
05 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||‘Develop Farangipet into a full-fledged railway station’||Railway activists and passenger associations have urged South Western Railway to develop Farangipet Railway Station on the outskirts of Mangaluru into a full-fledged station to ensure overall railway infrastructure development in the region. The railway station is located to the north of National Highway 75 at Farangipet between Mangaluru and BC Road and is about 12 km from the city. Because of its close proximity to the highway, the railway station was easily accessible to people unlike the next nearest railway station at Padil. Sudarshan Puttur, convener of Kukke Shree Subrahmanya Railway Balakedarara Hitharakshana Vedike, Puttur, has, in a memorandum to Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and others, said that Farangipet was functioning as a passenger station when the meter gauge was in operation. After gauge conversion and handing over of the section to South Western Railway from Southern Railway, the former closed down the station citing meagre revenue, he said. With terminal constraints at Mangaluru Central and Mangaluru Junction railway stations to receive and dispatch new trains under Southern Railway, Farangipet was the most suitable station for development. The Railways has over 30 acres of land around Farangipet that could be exploited to its full potential by constructing a station building with three lines and maintenance facilities enabling train crossing, receiving and dispatching, he said. Mr. Puttur noted that direct trains between Bengaluru and north coastal Karnataka, including Bengaluru-Karwar-Bengaluru Express, that take the Padil bypass without entering Mangaluru Junction could be given halt at Farangipet for the benefit of passengers from Mangaluru. Padil, though, has a station, could not be developed into a full-fledged passenger station because of the hilly terrain and lack of access roads to the highway, he pointed out. He also noted that South Western Railway had during 2018 cleared encroachment by fish vendors who had illegally been operating out of its land in Farangipet. South Western Railway had also ordered survey of land around Farangipet, Yedamangala and Kaniyur stations for their development in 2019, he said. Mr. Puttur also noted that development of Farangipet Railway Station would also boost the demand for a railway division for Mangaluru.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/develop-farangipet-into-a-full-fledged-railway-station/article33498326.ece

05 January 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||‘Ambari’ rollout seems imminent as CESC shifts power supply lines||The Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation’s new tourist attraction – double-decker open-top bus tours – that faced hurdles over the COVID-19 situation last year may soon hit the roads here. With the Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation (CESC) relocating the overhead electricity lines that were obstructing the free movement of the bus on the designated route, the rollout appears imminent. The KSTDC had requested the CESC to shift the transmission lines besides urging the Forest Department and the Mysuru City Corporation to prune tree branches along the route to facilitate unhindered movement. CESC Superintendent Engineer Muni Gopala Raju on Monday said the overhead HT and LT transmission lines on the route had been removed and laid underground to facilitate the movement of ‘Ambari’. ‘Ambari’ is a specially-built double-decker bus. The launch was planned in March last year but was put off indefinitely in view of the pandemic. The KSTDC was keen on ferrying tourists on the designated route to help them experience the beauty of Mysuru’s rich heritage during Dasara last year. However, the launch was hit since the overhead electricity lines had not been cleared by then for the smooth movement of the 16-ft. tall bus. The 40-seater bus, with lower and upper decks, was built in Bengaluru. One such bus that arrived here from Bengaluru for the launch had to be parked in the KSTDC office premises awaiting the run for many months before it was moved out. Besides four ‘Ambari’ buses for Mysuru, the KSTDC plans to operate two buses in Hampi, the UNESCO world heritage site, as well. Ambari is a hop-on, hop-off initiative for tourists to experience the palaces and heritage buildings of Mysuru. Tourists will get an audio guide the moment the bus reaches the tourist sites identified on the route. The audio will be available in two languages in the beginning — Kannada and English. The KSTDC plans to add foreign languages subsequently. The body wrapping of Ambari had been done based on the State’s art forms, culture and diversity, wildlife, and tourist destinations, according to the KSTDC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ambari-rollout-seems-imminent-as-cesc-shifts-power-supply-lines/article33497943.ece

Ms. Joy told the Departments of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, Public Works, and other engineering divisions in the district to submit the details to the Additional Deputy Commissioner without further delay. The Panchayat Raj Department was released a sum of Rs. 28 crore. “However, even today, it has not submitted the outgoings.” She told the departments to update henceforth the progress made in the works every week.

Roads, bridges, lakes, government buildings, water supply networks, electricity transmission lines, transformers and other basic amenities had suffered damages following heavy to very heavy rains. The special grant brought relief to the people who had been facing calamities since last three years. In the grant, the Department of Panchayat Raj got a lion’s share for carrying out the works - Rs. 29.26 crore had been released to the department and about Rs. 13.08 crore had been granted to the Department of Energy since the floods and landslides had badly affected the electricity transmission with many electric poles and distribution lines damaged, causing losses to the supply corporation. School buildings In addition, school buildings in Kodagu had been damaged in the heavy rains and the Department of Public Instruction got Rs. 2.06 crore for carrying out repairs.

Manjunath, director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, Bengaluru, has not ruled out a “sudden surge” in cases. He recalled that the first wave of COVID-19 began in Europe about four or five months before it hit India. Though the numbers subsequently declined in European countries, a sudden surge was witnessed after a gap of 60 to 75 days. India, and Karnataka, is presently witnessing a “flattening of the curve”, Dr. Manjunath said, adding that a second wave remained a possibility by end of February or early March. Herd immunity However, he said about 40% of the population in the country may have already been exposed to the virus and “some sort of herd immunity” may have set in. Also, the introduction of a vaccine would break the chain of spread and prove to be a roadblock to a rapid increase in the number of cases, he said. However, Dr. Manjunath sought to caution people against complacency. “We can’t afford to let our guard down. The next two or three months will be crucial. We should take adequate precautionary measures such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/manjunath-cautions-of-sudden-surge-in-cases/article33497810.ece
05 January 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Cong. questions MCC action on debris clearance||The Congress has questioned the Mysuru City Corporation’s (MCC) decision to entrust the work on processing Construction and Demolition debris of Mysuru to an agency without following the due process of law. Addressing a press conference here on Monday, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) spokesperson M. Lakshmana contended that the private trust selected for establishing a plant to process the debris does not have prior experience in the field. He questioned how the MCC could select the trust and hand over 8 acres of government land to set up the processing plant. He alleged that the MCC had thrown all established norms to the wind. The trust had not even participated in the Expression of Interest (EoI) called for by the MCC on December 15, 2020. If the trust had prior experience in manufacturing pavement blocks or stabilised mud blocks from the Construction and Demolition waste as claimed, Mr. Lakshamana said the MCC should have led a team of corporators to its premises for a spot inspection. Also, the MCC should have obtained technical approval from experts and floated tenders and invited other agencies having experience in the area to bid. Hence, he has urged the MCC to put on hold its decision to entrust the work to the agency till it provides evidence of its experience and capability in the field of processing construction and demolition waste.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cong-questions-mcc-action-on-debris-clearance/article33497944.ece

Regional Transport Officer (Kasaragod) A.K. Radhakrishnan said preliminary investigation had revealed that the vehicle had no mechanical problems. Its tyres were in good condition and brakes were intact. However, the driver seems to have driven down the slope in top gear, when it was supposed to be brought to a lower gear, he added. Meanwhile, the bus, which turned turtle, could not be removed from the spot using the cranes on Monday. Following the rains overnight, the vehicle, which got stuck further in the earth, may need the support of an earthmover to be shifted from the spot. Further investigation is on, and a report will be submitted, Mr. Radhakrishnan added. Seven persons, including two children, were killed in the accident. The bodies were handed over to relatives after post-mortem at the District Hospital, Kanhangad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/drivers-negligence-caused-accident-rto/article33497830.ece
05 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Scooters steal the show as public transport loses sheen||The steep fall in patronage for buses, metro rail, autorickshaws, online cabs, and ferries due to the pandemic situation has in turn led to an unprecedented boom in sale of new and used scooters, and to a lesser extent for motor bikes. So much so that dealers in used two-wheelers say that they often run out of stock of popular models of gearless scooters, since women and families prefer them for convenience and affordability during the uncertain period. “Demand is maximum for used scooters priced at Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 20,000, with models priced up to Rs. 30,000 coming next. The increase in reliance on private vehicles due to the pandemic situation and the rise in prices of new two-wheelers by a few thousand rupees owing to the Bharat Stage-VI norms are reasons for the demand for used vehicles. Moreover, the number of women looking for used scooters too is seeing an increase,” said Saneesh C.S. of Easy Deal, a dealer in used two-wheelers at Palarivattom. Ernakulam Regional Transport Officer (RTO) Babu John concurred with the view, saying there was a phenomenal increase in the number of applications seeking transfer of ownership of two-wheelers and cars in 2020, as compared to 2019. “In the same time span, the Ernakulam Regional Transport Office alone registered a total of 9,446 new two-wheelers in 2020, as compared to 14,708 in 2019. The decline in the number of new vehicles has been attributed to the almost nil registrations from mid-March to August when registration resumed, owing to COVID-19 curbs,” he said. Even as registration of new and used private vehicles brings in revenue to the government, officials of the traffic police and the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) expressed caution, since it has worsened traffic snarls and instances of obstructive parking in the city and even NH corridors. “Depending on private vehicles for daily commute will bleed different modes of public transport,” Mr. John said. The Kerala head of a prominent two-wheeler manufacturer said the sale of his brand increased 32% in the State in 2020. Customers are making a beeline for scooter models which are popular with both men and women. Contrary to the situation over a decade ago, scooters have stolen the show over motor bikes, making for 65% of two-wheeler sales, he said. “We recorded around 10% increase in sale in 2020 for scooters. Our used vehicle outlets too reported increase in sales,” said a senior official of another popular two-wheeler manufacturer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/scooters-steal-the-show-as-public-transport-loses-sheen/article33498279.ece
05 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Colleges reopen amid concerns about crowd control||A mixed turnout was witnessed across campuses in Ernakulam on Monday, as colleges reopened partially amid concerns about how to avoid crowding and ensure physical distancing norms in the coming days. Mahatma Gandhi University had instructed college managements to ensure that only 50% of the total strength turned up on campuses on the first day. The authorities had given permission to start final semester undergraduate and postgraduate classes in the first phase of reopening. “We had a good turnout of students in various courses as per the guidelines prescribed by the varsity. Students were found in a cheerful mood, especially after remaining at their homes following the pandemic crisis,” said Sunish K.S., member of the governing council and faculty member of the department of zoology at Maharaja’s College, Ernakulam. Fr. Prashant Palakkapillil, principal of Sacred Heart College, Thevara, said only first year postgraduate students were present on the campus on the first day of reopening, as others had study leave ahead of exams. “The challenge is to avoid crowding of students. Teachers have been told to ensure compliance with safety guidelines and protocol. We have also posted additional security personnel as part of the enhanced monitoring,” he said. Students, teachers, and non-teaching staff were found wearing masks. Colleges had set up additional facilities for washing hands, and sanitisers were kept at these points. However, recording of body temperature using thermal scanners was not fully complied with, as the college authorities cited practical difficulties and logistical hurdles on the first day. At hostels Hostels of various colleges had already started functioning in view of exams for various batches. The intake in each room has been reduced in keeping with the physical distancing norms. Canteens also started functioning after a long gap. Teachers at a few colleges said attendance was only 30% for postgraduate batches, as students staying in faraway places could not make it to colleges on the first day. Several parents were also concerned about their children using the public transport system, they said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/colleges-reopen-amid-concerns-about-crowd-control/article33498295.ece

Limited facilities Even though the Directorate of Collegiate Education has suggested making videos of the offline classes, teachers remain doubtful about how it can be done with the limited facilities available in most campuses. However, the audio recording of the sessions could be ensured using mobile phones, they said. Classes for each scheme have to be offered for each batch as per the latest guidelines. Teachers should not handle classes for more than one such batch daily. Faculty members or students having medical ailments should not turn up on the campus. Work-from-home option But arrangements have to be made to ensure that students who cannot attend classroom sessions access it through the online mode. The work-from-home option may be given to teachers and non-teaching staff having medical issues. Those permitted to work from home need to submit COVID-19-negative certificate before joining duty. Sanitation spot Each college has to set up a sanitation spot, where sanitisers, thermometer, masks, gloves, and dustbin are to be provided as part of the safety protocol. Students should be permitted to enter campuses only after recording body temperature. COVID-19 cell An eight-member COVID-19 cell should be formed in each college. A faculty member should be be placed in charge of the cell, in addition to the principal.

Over 50% of our room occupancy during weekends is by the corporate crowd and IT professionals who opt for staycation. Most of them drive down from nearby districts, accompanied by their family members,” said Chinnu Jimmy, senior marketing manager, Marriot, Kochi. “This has resulted in room occupancy improving substantially. Occupancy during weekdays too has improved and is definitely better than during much of 2020 when the pandemic kept people indoors. We have rolled out unique packages like a Rs. 1,000 complimentary voucher which can be redeemed at Lulu Mall, apart from room tariff which includes high tea at evening and dinner. With renewed focus on innovation and speed and as a source of alternative revenue, we sold a record 8,500 cakes and 650 cake hampers during the Christmas season,” she added. Many star hotels which offered lucrative tariff (from around Rs. 1 lakh) to host wedding reception for 50 people, including a couple of days stay for the couple, are continuing with their packages. Most star hotels that ventured into home delivery of items in their menu to reach out to customers and to keep their machinery running during the lockdown period too are continuing the practice. “We opened pop-up restaurants in gated communities during the lockdown, and they continue in many places, although our buffet restaurant has reopened,” said Dinesh Rai, general manager of Four Points by Sheraton, a 218-room hotel at Infopark. “With fear of air conditioned spaces looming large, we have begun hosting a street food fest every Friday at the lawns, where chaats, grilled items, kebabs, and Punjabi delicacies are cooked,” he said. Food and beverages The pandemic has resulted in most hotels banking on revenue from sale of food and beverages than from room occupancy, said Tejus Jose, general manager, Le Meridien, Kochi. “There is good response to our newly-launched Sunday brunch and the special barbecue dinner buffet on Saturdays. We also sold cakes and Christmas hampers in substantial numbers. Patronage for rooms is picking up, especially since tariff has almost halved, and we launched a club membership package,” Mr. Jose said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/star-hotels-innovate-to-take-on-lull-in-demand/article33498289.ece

The service was popular, and the Kochi-London flights were almost filled to capacity, airport sources said. The direct London services were introduced from Kochi along with cities like Bengaluru, Chennai, and Delhi, and the service from Kochi was in huge demand, they added. Of the 250 seats, bookings were in the range of 220 seats. However, the services were suspended following detection of the new COVID-19 variant in the United Kingdom. Though the Civil Aviation Ministry has permitted relaunch of the services from three cities by January 8, Kochi was not included in the list, the sources said. The popularity of the Kochi-London service had resulted in Air India increasing the number of flights from twice weekly to thrice in October. Domestic traffic Meanwhile, CIAL expects to have normal domestic traffic by the end of January. The pre-COVID days had seen domestic passenger movement to the tune of 15,000 per day. Around 60% of the level has been achieved now, and by the end of the month, passenger traffic is likely move up further. The passenger level is around 8,000 to 8,500 per day now. The number of flight operations used to be 100 to 110 per day, and the level has now reached around 70 operations, almost equally divided between arrivals and departures. The airport had handled 1,426 arrival relief flights during the six phases of the Vande Bharat Mission evacuating 1,97,997 passengers till the end of October.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/london-flight-suspension-a-setback-for-kochi-airport/article33498290.ece

The situation continued to be grim in places such as Thanthonni Thuruth, Maradu, Njarakkal, Kumbalanghi, Kadamakudy and Edavanakkad. The worst affected areas include Maradu and Thanthonni Thuruth. On the island of Thanthonni Thuruth, around 90% of the 65 houses were flooded on Sunday morning, said V.V. Praveen councillor from Thattazham. He said the situation had not improved on Monday. Maradu municipality chairman Antony Ashanparambil said the municipal council members visited the low-lying areas that were flooded and a report was being prepared by the Revenue Department. Kumbalanghi panchayat president Lija Thomas said dozens of homes had been affected by flooding and that the situation had become worse on Monday. Areas close to the backwaters both on the eastern and western fringes of the village have been affected. The worst hit areas included the eastern side of the Malattu bus stop and near the Pazhangad church, she added. Njarakkal panchayat president T.T. Francis said areas along the coast of the panchayat had been seriously affected by flooding over the last four days. The situation looked grim even on Monday, he said. A team of officials from the panchayat and council members visited the coastal areas as well as areas in the eastern fringes of the village such as Valiayavattam, Manjanikkad and Cheriyamanjaniikad. Kadamakudy panchayat president Mary Vincent said several houses lying close to the backwaters in Wards 1 and 13 of the panchayat had been affected. Water had entered the compounds of most houses in the wards, she said and pointed to silt deposit in the backwaters as one of the major reasons for the flooding during high tide. On island A. Priyanka, a resident of Thanthonni Thuruth, said flooding had been unprecedented and the situation had remained grim even on Monday. Mr. Praveen said flooding of houses was a common occurrence on the island but the situation had worsened week. He said he had brought the issue to the attention of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on December 30 and that the Chief Minister had issued instructions to the District Collector to prepare a report. The building of an outer bund has been one of the demands raised by the islanders. However, no step had been taken so far to prevent the flooding of houses, he said.

Justice Ashok Menon granted him bail observing that there was no reason to detain him in jail further in the three cases as most of the documents were seized by the Crime Branch and the accused was subjected to custodial interrogation. The court also took into consideration his health condition. The court also pointed out that that he was not involved in any other crime apart from the series of cases registered in connection with the gold jewellery fraud. The fact that the first accused T.K Pookoya Thangal, managing director of the jewellery company, was not yet arrested could not be a reason f or denying him bail. 82 other cases In fact, the accused cannot come out of the prison as he has been remanded in 82 other cases registered in several other police stations. As part of the bail condition, the court directed Mr. Kamaruddin not to enter the Kasaragod police station limits where the three cases were registered and not to influence or contact the witnesses.

In a letter, Mr. Chennithala pointed out that the varsity Syndicate had taken an unauthorised decision despite a clear rule that only the Governor, as Chancellor of the institution, had the authority to withdraw the certificates once awarded. ‘Done intentionally’ This, according to the Congress leader, was done intentionally to help the students approach court later and obtain a favourable verdict. He sought immediate intervention of the Governor in the issue and urged him to initiate stern action by exercising the powers vested in him as Chancellor to uphold the values, sanctity and excellence of university examinations. A decision to give special moderation of five marks to the BTech students who had failed in any one of the 56 subjects altogether in the course was taken at a meeting of the Syndicate on April 30, 2019. Sharp criticisms The move, however, drew sharp criticism following allegations of the Higher Education Minister’s intervention. Following this, the Mahatma Gandhi University withdrew the decision so as ‘to avoid people casting suspicion on the university and the academic community.’ Accordingly, a list of 16 students who passed the course with special moderation was published and an order was issued to cancel their degree certificates. Order set aside The order, however, was set aside by the high court citing that it had been issued without proper thought and based merely ‘on public objections.’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/chennithala-sees-foul-play-in-mg-university-move/article33497904.ece

Kappan, MLA, appears to have reignited the long-simmering factional dispute within the Kottayam district unit of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). According to NCP sources, the issue has now taken the party to the brink of an irrevocable split with a rebel faction under party State general secretary Subash Punchakottil deciding not to leave the coalition at any cost. With the infighting soon set to touch a tipping point, both sides have launched parallel moves to secure majority support within the party. Memorial event Setting the stage for this latest episode of infighting will be an event commemorating the late Congress leader C.H. Haridas, planned by the A.K. Saseendran faction of the NCP. The event, to be inaugurated by CPI(M) district secretary V.N. Vasavan at the Kottayam Press Club on January 9, is regarded as an apparent response to the official faction led by Mr. Kappan, which recently organised a similar programme to remember the late NCP leader Thomas Chandy. The programme, held at the same venue on December 20 and inaugurated by senior Congress leader Oommen Chandy, also triggered speculations of a political realignment. The official faction regards the upcoming event as an attempt by the rebels to set up an own platform ahead of a scheduled interaction of the party State president with the workers in Kottayam. “The event, being organised in line with the remembrance meet of Thomas Chandy, is a clear attempt to mobilise the majority support within the party. Otherwise, why should they be holding an event that had never been held here before,” asked Saju M. Philip, NCP district president. The rebels, however, sought to counter the argument by pointing out that all leaders of the NCP, including Mr. Kappan and Mr. Philip, have been invited to the event. Crucial role “It is important for the party to remember the contributions of a leader who had played a crucial role in developing the movement that later became the NCP in Kerala,” said TV Baby, a former district president of the NCP and leader of the rebel group. Despite assertions by the LDF leadership that the discussions over Pala were yet to begin, the NCP district unit regard its sidelining in the constituency during the recent local body elections coupled with the superfluous treatment of the KC(M) as ominous signs for the Assembly elections.

According to sources in the National Health Mission, the only functioning FLTCs in the public sector are those at the Lakshadweep Guest House and Government Homoeopathic Medical College, Karaparamba. In the private sector, Aster MIMS too runs an FLTC. Earlier, there were 21 FLTCs in Kozhikode district. NHM sources said that equipment and articles being used at these places had been relocated to nearby government hospitals. Equipmentwas purchased in the name of these hospitals, they said. Some other equipment had been temporarily shifted to a facility at the Sarovaram Biopark. They could be transported to the public health institutions, schools or colleges, if there is any emergency. Big halls, hostel buildings and auditoriums in schools and colleges were taken over to set up the facility earlier when the number of infections surged here. However, there has been a steady decline in the number of new cases in the past two months. Along with this, the government actively promoted home isolation too. The decision to partially reopen educational institutions were taken, and some of the FLTCs working there had to be closed down. A case in point was the facility at the National Institute of Technology-Calicut, which housed a mega FLTC. Asked if there would be any need to start new FLTCs, a senior NHM official said that beds were vacant in government hospitals and patients could make use of the Karunya Arogya Suraksha Padhati as well. “More people are now preferring home isolation as well. If there are patients who do not include in these categories, the existing FLTCs can accommodate them,” the official added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/number-of-fltcs-comes-down-to-three-in-kozhikode-district/article33497848.ece

Among them are paintings that were born during the lockdown period. The exhibition is only the second one being hosted at the art gallery after it reopened post-lockdown. The show is being held in keeping with the COVID-19 protocol. The art gallery will hence be open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., quite different from its normal timing, and will remain closed on Sundays. The exhibition will conclude on January 9.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/painting-exhibition-begins-in-kozhikode/article33497829.ece

There are now different types of adventure rides available on an experimental basis for beach goers and tourists. “We are getting ready for a formal launch of our service offering over 40 special adventure activities in the sea. Now, banana ride, jet skiing, scuba diving, ringo ride and parachute flying are available on an experimental basis,” says Haroon Eroth, owner of one of such adventure sports companies in Kozhikode. He says his team has been carrying out trial operations of various rides for over four years and the formal launch of activities will be held soon in Kozhikode and Ernakulam. The plan is to convert the coastal area of Kozhikode into a favourite destination for mini cruise boats, board skiing, snorkelling, dolphin ride, beach parasailing, winch parasailing and fly board rides. At present, domestic tourists have no such choices in Kozhikode and many of them explore such activities outside the State. Other than just the sea cruise, the plan of the Tourism Department is to popularise various entertainment water sports activities in the sea at affordable rates for local people. The decision to promote water rides comes after the successful launch and operation of Cleopatra luxury cruise from Beypore. Tourists from many parts of the State now come to Beypore to enjoy the luxury cruise and explore it even as part of various corporate events. In the Chaliyar, kayaking training and rides are also in full swing, attracting many domestic and international tourists. The motto of river conservation has also been integrated with such water tourism promotion campaigns for global exposure. In Kozhikode district, the Chalippuzha and Pulikkayam are the most sought after rural water sports destinations for kayaking.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/coastal-area-emerges-adventure-water-sports-destination-in-kozhikode/article33497843.ece

Krishnadas has sought the resignation of Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala “for pandering to the political whims of the CPI(M).” Inaugurating a State-level workshop here on Monday, Mr. Krishnadas said the United Democratic Front (UDF) should be dissolved if the coalition supported Mr. Chennithala’s view that the UDF and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) would join to defeat the BJP. The UDF has already lost its significance in the political sphere, he said. Mr. Krishnadas alleged that the two fronts had forged an unholy alliance only to keep the BJP from coming to power. The electoral alliance the UDF had with the Welfare Party of India and the tacit understanding of the LDF with the Social Democratic Party of India were dangerous for the country, the BJP leader observed. Mr. Krishnadas said both the fronts would replicate their strategy in the coming Assembly polls as well. “The LDF achieved a disgraceful victory in the local body polls through vote-trading,” he alleged. He also said that the LDF government through lies and deceit claimed to have implemented welfare schemes conceived by the Centre. This also had led to the temporary achievement of the front in the elections, Mr. Krishnadas said. He said that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) had already emerged as an alternative to both the coalitions.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/bjp-slams-chennithalas-stand-seeks-his-resignation/article33497838.ece

Ramakrishnan on Monday handed over the key to a newly constructed house to a flood-hit family at Thiruvallur in Kozhikode Rural police district limit. The house was constructed with the financial support of the Kerala Police Association (KPA). Project coordinators said the KPA with the cooperation of the Kerala Police Officers Association (KPOA) mobilised about Rs. 8 lakh for building the dream home of the poor family in the village. Though it was a small home, it was completed with all the required amenities, they said. KPA functionaries said there were many similar houses constructed in the limits of Payyoli, Koyilandy and Thamarassery police station limits for poor families. Apart from the support of KPA and KPOA, the Police Cooperative Society had undertaken similar activities and built over 23 such houses across the State, they said. A KPA leader said the latest project was also a reply to those who used to criticise the force for ‘heartless’ actions. District Police Chief (Kozhikode Rural) A. Sreenivas and district-level office-bearers of both the KPA and KPOA were present at the key handing over ceremony. The project was completed in six months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/minister-hands-over-house-to-flood-hit-family/article33497845.ece

The second edition of the International Conference on Gender Equality (ICGE), a flagship event of the Gender Park, is being held here in association with UN Women. The Gender Park, an independent body under the Department of Social Justice, had created much hype before it was inaugurated by then President Pranab Mukherjee in 2016. A pet project of MLAs M.K. Muneer and A. Pradeep Kumar, the Gender Park is spread over a 15,000-square feet plot with an ancient building that had been renovated for it. The renovation, and the construction of a modern building behind it cost around Rs. 30 crore. Though meant to be a premier convergence point of gender-related activities, the facility has been gathering dust all these years. A Gender Fest in Kozhikode and the first ICGE in Thiruvananthapuram were the only events organised by the Gender Park, though none in its own premises in Kozhikode. The ‘She Taxi’ service initiated under the Gender Park had turned out to be a burden for women drivers who had jumped into the project expecting a bright future, and is now nearly non-existent. The three day ICGE-II that begins on February 11 will be in a partially digital (hybrid) format, due to COVID-related restrictions. The focal theme is ‘Gender in Sustainable Entrepreneurship and Social Business: The mediating role of empowerment’ and plans to throw light on critical linkages between entrepreneurship, economic growth and poverty reduction. This is also the beginning of a long-standing association between the Gender Park and UN Women that plans to scale the park as a South Asian hub for gender equality, besides institutionalising a Gender Data Centre within the International Institute for Gender and Development on the park premises.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/5-years-after-its-launch-gender-park-to-come-alive-for-global-meet/article33497846.ece

Report to HC In his report to the Kerala High Court, M. Manoj, Sabarimala Special Commissioner and District Judge, submitted that the pilgrims have to be prevented from overstaying to prevent a super-spread of COVID-19. Pointing to the likelihood of devotees overstaying at Sabarimnala, Nilackal, Pampa and Sannidhanam by constructing sheds at vantage points from January 10 onward, the official also requested for directions to the Kerala Police, Kerala Forest Department, Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) and other stakeholders to take adequate steps to prevent overstay and cooking of food. “As a precautionary measure for preventing a super-spread of COVID-19 pandemic, overcrowding has to be avoided at all places and pilgrims have to prevented from staying in Parnashalas (sheds) well in advance of the Makaravilakku day on January 14. Due to the minimum number of pilgrims, there is danger of wildlife attacking them, if Parnashalas (sheds) are constructed in isolated places in the forest,” read the report. In spite of stringent regulatory measures and strict adherence to COVID-19 safety protocol, as many as 360 officials on Sabarimala duty have tested positive for the disease till January 3, the report ot the Kerala High Court added. According to the official, the regulation of 5,000 pilgrims per day is highly necessary this year to prevent the virus spread. Booking slots The TDB has already stated that only those booking slots through the virtual queue would be allowed darshan at the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple on the Makaravialakku day. According to N. Vasu, TDB president, no person without advance bookings in the virtual queue will be permitted to remain in and around the Sabarimala Sannidhanam during the day.

05 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Cinemas unlikely to reopen today||Even though the State government has allowed cinemas to reopen with 50% capacity from Tuesday onwards, a majority of them will remain closed, as exhibitors are waiting for a response from the government regarding the demands they put forward. Cleansing the cinema theatres, carrying out maintenance work and making them ready to welcome viewers on a short notice is also a tall order for many of them. Tax waiver One of the major issues raised by the exhibitors is with regard to the reduction of the Goods and Services Tax on the tickets as well as exemption from entertainment tax for a fixed period. They have also demanded that the monthly fixed electricity charge of more than Rs. 50,000 be waived, as the cinemas had remained closed for the past nine months. “Since we were unsure of when we would be allowed to open the theatres, we had not renewed our annual licences. A lot of maintenance work also has to be carried out. Also, we have to arrive at an understanding with the distributors on the films to be screened. Everything depends on the stand that the government would take regarding our demands” says M.C. Bobby, general secretary of the Film Exhibitors' United Organisation of Kerala (FEUoK). The government had allowed reopening of the theatres with 50% occupancy, but the exhibitors have been demanding that at least 80% occupancy be allowed, with which physical distancing between two viewers might not be possible.  The Tamil Nadu government on Monday allowed theatres to open with 100% occupancy, ahead of the Pongal release of the Vijay-starrer Master . In Kerala too, exhibitors as well as distributors are hoping to iron out the issues before the next weekend, in time for the Vijay film’s release. On Tuesday, the exhibitors are meeting to discuss these issues, while on Wednesday, the representatives of the exhibitors as well as the Kerala Film Distributors’ Association and the Kerala Film Producers’ Association will participate in a meeting convened by the Kerala Film chamber, in which a decision on the way forward will be taken. The distributors are also not keen to provide films until the theatre owners pay the pending amount of around Rs. 23 crores. ‘Impractical’ “Immediate opening of cinemas is impractical. A lot of work, including updating the sound system, maintenance work and cleaning, has to be completed. The cleaning and maintenance expense itself would come to more than Rs. 1 lakh. We have a fixed charge of Rs. 50,000 per month, although our usage charge is only around Rs. 5,000, for the weekly trial run of the projectors. The government has to waive these fixed charges as well as the building and other taxes which we have been paying all these months, when the theatres remained closed. Else, it is hard for many to survive in this sector,” says Gireesh, who runs the Sree Padmanabha theatre in Thiruvananthapuram.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cinemas-unlikely-to-open-today/article33497898.ece

Of the 29 samples sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for genomic analysis to check for the presence of the virus variant, 11 samples tested negative. More results are awaited from the NIV. Ms. Shylaja appealed to the people to voluntarily report if they have had any recent travel history to the U.K. Meanwhile, a dip in testing resulted in a steep fall in the number of new cases reported in the State on Monday. Test positivity rate remained steady at 9.02%, indicating that there was not much change in disease transmission levels.  New cases Kerala reported 3,021 new cases when 33,508 samples were tested in the past 24 hours, taking the cumulative case burden to 7,78,873 cases. The active caseload now stands at 63,135.

The 16-km Kollam-Kottapuram stretch of the 633-km West Coast Canal, the main arterial waterway traversing through 11 districts, developed as National Waterway III with Class III norms, is already navigable. The corridor from Kollam to Kottapuram can facilitate the movement of cargo vessels of 350 to 500 tonnes. Final works on Final works are on the Vallakadavu-Kollam and Kottapuram-Chavakkad corridors to open the rejuvenated waterway. Earlier, it was decided to open the Akkulam-Kollam stretch in two phases and it has now been extended further south up to Vallakadavu. The stretch from Akkulam to Kollam will have a width of 10-15 m, depth of 1.2-1.5 m and will enable the movement of the 24-seater indigenously manufactured solar boat procured by the Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) and currently undergoing trial runs in Kochi. The solar boat can cruise with ease with a depth of one metre.  Final works on Finishing works are on by the Kerala Waterways and Infrastructure Ltd. (KWIL), the special purpose vehicle created by the government for the rejuvenation of the inland waterways, and the Inland Navigation Department. The 722-metre Sivagiri tunnel completed in 1880 and the 350-metre Chilakoor tunnel, the major challenges in the Akkulam-Kollam stretch, have been made navigable. Boats can move along the Sivagiri and Chilakoor tunnels as they have a diameter of 4.7 m. Beyond Chavakkad, six low-level bridges and the Kuttai regulator in the Ponnani-Kozhikode corridor of the waterway are the hurdles. The Mannittampara and Veliyamcode locks are to be replaced by the Inland Waterways Authority of India. In Kuttai, navigation locks are needed at least in one span for the hassle-free movement of the vessels. Other challenges Works on the Kozhikode-Vadakara, Vadakara-Mahe and 26-km Mahi-Valapattanam stretches are the other challenges. In the Mahi-Valapattanam stretch, creation of three artificial canals and creation of a new 6-km canal from Vallapattanam to Bekal are necessary. Official sources said the priority was to make the waterway from north to south navigable by 2022 and then attain the NW III standards of 32 m bottom width, 40 m top width and depth of 2.2 m by 2025.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/306-km-waterway-will-be-navigable-from-feb/article33497916.ece

Deserving consumers, however, will be given more time to clear their dues, said KSEB officials on Monday. Cinema halls, for instance, have been given time till January 31 to clear the arrears as they have remained shut on account of COVID-10. According to the KSEB, arrears had mounted to approximately Rs. 700 crore during the pandemic-induced lockdown period. As part of COVID-19-related concessions, the KSEB had announced a rebate of 25% on fixed charges applicable to industrial/commercial consumers during March, April, and May 2020. Case-by-case basis For paying the balance 75% of the three months, the utility had given the consumers time till December 31. The KSEB had also announced that no interest would be levied on the amount. “We do understand that consumers are still facing difficulties due to the pandemic. We are not against providing deserving consumers more time or the opportunity to clear the arrears in instalments. This will be decided on a case-by-case basis,” a KSEB official said. Limited choice for KSEB Moreover, the KSEB is not in a position to extend the deadlines any further, the official said. In May 2020, the Centre had increased the borrowing limit of States by an additional 2% of the GSDP in view of the pandemic. This, however, is subject to certain conditions which also include power sector reforms such as reducing aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses and also the gap between average cost of supply (ACS) and aggregate revenue realised (ARR). These targets would not be met if the KSEB were to further delay the recovery of arrears.

Addressing Principals of government, aided and unaided colleges on the first day of resumption of offline classes through videoconference on Monday, Dr. Jaleel called for priority in completing crucial theory portions and practical classes within the remaining time. In a rather stern response to the objections raised by a section of teachers towards the work pattern proposed for the rest of the academic year, Dr. Jaleel said students’ welfare must remain their prime responsibility. Teachers must adopt a proactive stance in overcoming the crisis by maximising the number of class hours, rather than citing inconvenience. Such tendencies cannot be tolerated, he added. For six hours He said the faculty would not be required to remain in colleges beyond six hours. Teachers have been directed to remain in colleges for six hours for six days a week. The Minister also directed Vice Chancellors and Principals to ensure examinations were conducted without delay and that results were declared in a time-bound manner. Meanwhile, the Directorate of Collegiate Education has suggested that teachers record the offline sessions for delivering it online for students who cannot attend the classes for various reasons.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/strive-to-cover-portions-jaleel-tells-teachers/article33497921.ece

05 January 2021||ANANTAPUR,ANDHRA PRADESH||BJP hits out at Jagan for ‘guerrilla warfare’ comment||Taking strong exception to the comments made by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy that the opposition parties were running a ‘guerrilla warfare’ on the temple in the State, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) questioned as to what the government was doing to check such incidents. “The police force and the State government have failed in curbing such incidents (desecration of idols). The Chief Minister must answer as to why no arrest has been made yet in the incidents related to attacks on Hindu places of worship if the government has such definitive information,” BJP State general secretary S. Vishnuvardhan Reddy told the media here on Monday evening. He took exception to the ‘Poorna Kumbham’ welcome to Endowments Minister Vellampalli Srinivas and his Municipal Administration counterpart Botcha Satyanarayana and at a time when an idol was desecrated at the Ramateertham temple. “The Endowments Minister should take the moral responsibility of the desecration of idols and quit his post. The money donated to the Hindu temples is being diverted by the YSRCP government for other schemes just like the precious TDP government did during its tenure,” he said. The BJP leader said Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy in 2008 wrote a full-page apology letter for an attack on a church. “Will he do so for the attacks on the Hindu palces of worship?” he asked.  Mr. Vishnuvardhan Reddy said the ‘Navaratnalu’ scheme was only ‘stickering of the Central welfare schemes’. “The Chief Minister has done nothing new for the development of the State, and there is a non-existent Home Minister, who does not visit the places where the incidents took place,” he said. The BJP leader further said that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had only said that the government had written to the CBI about the Antharvedi chariot burning case, but at the same time people who allegedly pelted stones at a church were arrested within no time. “Why is he not showing a similar alacrity on booking cases against those responsible in the desecration of idols?” Mr. Vishnuvardhan asked. Dharma yatra today BJP State president Somu Veerraju and Jana Sena Party chief Pawan Kalyan will take out a ‘Chalo Ramateertham Dharma Yatra’ on Tuesday, seeking protection to the Hindu palces of worship.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-hits-out-at-jagan-for-guerrilla-warfare-comment/article33498350.ece

05 January 2021||CHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||27 held for organising cockfights||With a week left for the festivities of Sankranti to begin, the police have detected the prohibited activity of organising cockfights in the rural areas of Chittoor, particularly in the western mandals. The Rompicharla police on Sunday night arrested 13 persons belonging to various mandals of Chittoor district and Kadapa in connection with organizing cockfights at a village tank near Bommayyagaripalle panchayat, 100 km from here, and seized four roosters and Rs. 10,000 from their possession. Similarly, the Piler urban police took 14 persons into custody and seized 14 two-wheelers and six roosters at Jandla, a village abutting a forest location adjacent to Seshachalam ranges. Beginning in the month of November, the activity can be seen being organised in the forest-fringe villages and picks up pace as Sankranti draws near, with punters coming from the neighbouring areas and other districts in the State and also from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The eastern mandals of Varadaiahpalem and BN Kandriga are also known for organizing roosterfights. There are clientele who come from not only the neighbouring districts, like Nellore, but also from places as far as Gummidipoondi in Tamil Nadu. ‘The activity has lost its sheen’ A 72-year-old man from Piler, who has been seeing and organising the event for the last five decades, observed that during the last one decade, the prohibited sport had lost its sheen with many youth getting educated and leaving for Chennai, Bengaluru and other cities in search of jobs, while the rest of the younger generation turned busy with agriculture activities and petty trades. “Only a very few people are still interested in this sport. Those training the roosters are also few. Most trained birds are not really capable of enlivening the mood at the venues,” he said. Sub-Inspector (Rompicharla) Hari Prasad said that the police had stepped up vigil at the forest-fringe hamlets which are famous for hosting the event. “We don’t find the sport being organised at an extensive scale these days. But, still there are cases that come to our notice once in a while from the western mandals,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/27-held-for-organising-cockfights-in-chittoor/article33497638.ece

Narayana. Mr. Narayana drove a tractor at the rally taken out by the party here on Monday to express solidarity to the farmers’ agitation. “The drama being enacted by the ruling and opposition parties is aimed at keep the public attention away from the farmers’ protest. It a joint ploy to protect their vote bank,” he said. The CPI leader accused Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, and the Leader of Opposition and TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu of being ‘hand in glove with the BJP regime at the Centre to save themselves from the corruption cases.’ “The two leaders have merely expressed solidarity to the cause, but I demand them to come out in public and participate in the dharna if they are really serious about it,” dared Mr. Narayana. The farmers would continue to protest until the ‘black laws’ were revoked, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/idols-drama-a-ploy-to-divert-attention-from-farmers-stir-cpi/article33498357.ece

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy's talk of handing over the investigation of the Ramateertham temple incident does not appear to be reflected in deeds, Mr. Veerraju stated in a press release on the eve of ‘Chalo Ramateertham’ being organised by the BJP-Jana Sena combine. He insisted that the sentiments of Hindus were badly hurt as the head of the idol of Lord Rama at Ramateertham temple was broken by miscreants but no concrete steps have so far been taken towards apprehending the culprits. ‘No improvement’ There was not much improvement in the situation after the chariot of Antarvedi temple was burnt and idols of Hindu gods and goddesses were desecrated at Pithapuram in East Godavari district. The BJP leader said the government would have rebuilt the temples that were demolished during the TDP regime, if it was really committed to protecting the Hindu 'dharma' .  If the government continued to be lenient to the attacks on Hindu temples, the BJP would organise a Statewide agitation, Mr. Veerraju warned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-is-insensitive-to-damage-of-idols-somu/article33498361.ece

Swarna also said that recruitment of tribals in the Visakha agency was drying out and people were questioning the Maoists for opposing development activity such as building roads, hospitals, schools and cell tower connectivity.

Vyavasaya Karmika Sangham district assistant secretary E. Chiranjeevi, Sadhana Committee district honorary president K. Govinda Rao and Girijana Sangham president Singarapu Valasayya and secretary Tokala Appa Rao were among those who led the protest. “A Surveyor was sent from Paderu for conduct of the survey in the ‘gap’ areas in the forests as per our demand. An amount of Rs. 2 crore was received from the mining companies towards the District Mineral Fund but the same was not used for the development of the affected tribal areas,” Mr. Govinda Rao told said on Monday evening. There is both revenue and forest land and there are some ‘gap’ areas in between the revenue and forest land on the hill. The villagers of Dolavanipalem, Ramannadorapalem, K. Gadavapalem, Kotnabilli and K. Kotnabilli have been cultivating cashew gardens on 198 acres of land on hills for over three decades.

Although normalcy was restored at the temple premises on Monday, tense situation is anticipated as BJP and Jana Sena decided to go ahead with their yatra to be led by BJP State president Somu Veerraju.

The aggrieved villagers staged a dharna at the canal and made an abortive attempt to stop the water supply to the KTPS demanding jobs for the local youths in the KTPS and redressal of their long pending grievances, sources said. The police rushed to the spot and tried to pacify the agitators. The protesters relented only after a senior official from the KTPS assured to represent their demand and grievances to the higher authorities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/tribals-oppose-supply-of-kinnerasani-water-to-ktps/article33498276.ece
05 January 2021||CHINTOOR (EAST GODAVARI),TELANGANA||Salwa Judum-Maoist conflict still haunts them||During the winter in 2005, a Koya tribe, Madivi Appa (name changed), and three other families from Sukma district in Chhattisgarh managed to walk through the Dandakaranya region to survive in a settlement inhabited by a single-tribal man in the Chintoor forest cover in the undivided Andhra Pradesh. “One day during the period, Maoists killed my 32-year-old cousin in front of the villagers, suspecting that our family was in touch with the government representatives. Being Patel of our village, everyone from the government used to meet us but we never planned to join the Salwa Judum, a State-groomed outfit, or their base camp,” says Appa. “Our family offered the cattle, harvest of crops and everything to Maoists to spare my cousin but our appeal had gone unheeded. The killing itself was a warning for the villagers not to join the Salwa Judum or shift to the base camps,” he says. Leaving the harvested sesame, house, cattle, the village, and 20 acres of land under their family’s possession in the Dandakaranya, Appa's family fled the region to Chintoor forests by walking for nearly 40 km as their future was uncertain due to conflict between the Salwa Judum and Maoists in Chhattisgarh, in which 173 Special Police Officers (Koya commandos) of the Salwa Judum were killed by Maoists between 2005-11. In July 2011, the Supreme Court declared Salwa Judum as unconstitutional, directing the Chhattisgarh State to ban it with immediate effect. By then, above 6,660 tribals from the Dandakaranya region -- Sukma, Dantewarda and Bijapur districts -- settled in East and West Godavari districts (Andhra Pradesh) and a majority of them fled their areas during the conflict between 2005-11, fearing violence both by Maoists and the Salwa Judum. In the Chintoor reserve forest cover, the first batch of four families, including that of Appa's, from the Dandakaranya region came to the area that was inhabited by a single man in 2015. Now, the settlement with ‘Internally Displaced Persons (IDP)’ comprises 19 families, a majority of them from the conflict zone in Chhattisgarh for their survival. New trouble 20-year-old Koya tribal youth from Sukma district, who lives in the same settlement, told The Hindu : “Now, there is a new issue in our native villages. Those who did not leave the villages during the conflict (2005-11) refuse to accept our return. Their claim is that they faced the conflict whereas we fled the place to the safe zones.” “Our lives hang by a thread as any move to return to our village may land us in new tussle with our own tribe over the land and properties. Such move may even cost our lives too,” adds the youth. The activists working on the IDPs have said there is an immediate need of enactment of a policy to decide the future of the IDPs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/salwa-judum-maoist-conflict-still-haunts-them/article33498400.ece
05 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Firefighters saved 988 lives last year||Telangana State Disaster Response Force & Fire Services (TSDRFS) had an unusual 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, as it had to reorient itself towards safeguarding citizens from the virus, ensure hospitals treating the patients adhered to fire safety protocols and stand by the other uniformed personnel for any emergencies. One fire service personnel fell prey to the novel coronavirus, while 251 recovered from the infection during the period as the department went about spraying sodium hypochloride inside government offices and places of public congregation, although it was later stated that spraying disinfectants in the open was of no help in fighting the virus. But its personnel did take up public awareness campaign on social distancing, wearing masks and personal hygiene through posters and short films. “We took up 223 surprise inspections and conducted over 1,000 mock drills during the time to ensure fire safety,” said Regional Fire Officer-Central Region V. Papaiah on Monday. The heavy rains in October, which left several parts of the twin cities inundated for days together, presented another challenge as the fire personnel joined forces with GHMC’s enforcement directorate and disaster management department, police and other volunteers and rushed to the rescue of the citizens in flooded areas, shifting them to safer places. Emergency complaints The department attended to more than 7,000 emergency complaints and among them 508 were related to calls for rescue. The rest were with regard to responding to fires, both big and small. There have been no major cases of arson from anywhere across Telangana during congregations for religious purposes or otherwise, the RFO explained. “We saved 988 lives last year either due to rains or fire mishaps and the property damage averted during the period amounts to about Rs. 828.29 crore,” said Mr. Papaiah. The department claims to have reduced fires due to careless smoking, short circuits, open fires, spontaneous combustion, sparks, furnaces etc., considerably between 13-60% due to the prevention control measures. NOCs, clearances Since it is a fire prevention regulatory authority, the department processed 5,394 applications for no-objection certificates (NOCs) and issued 612 provisional clearances and 266 occupancy certificates. NOC renewal was given to 200 applicants. About 21 industrial applications were processed under the TS-iPASS and 14 provisional and seven occupancy clearances were given. Overall, revenue of Rs. 23.47 crore was collected. Cases were also filed against seven fire safety violators and notices were issued in five cases, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/firefighters-saved-988-lives-last-year/article33498231.ece
05 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Loan App: Freeze on Rs. 100 cr. in 27 accounts, one more held||Continuing their probe into the alleged financial irregularities by the app-based instant loan companies, Hyderabad Cyber Crime police arrested a woman who headed a recovery call centre in Bengaluru. The accused, 31-year-old Keerthi of ANNIU Technology Private Limited, had employed over 200 telecallers for recovery of loan amount, the police said. With this the total number of people arrested by the Hyderabad police in connection with loan app cases rose to 17, which include a 27-year-old Chinese national Zhu Wei alias Lambo from Jiangxi. They have also identified that the firm was routing the money earned in India to China through designated bank accounts in Indonesia. In December last week, the investigators arrested one K. Eswar, who worked in the administrative section of ANNIU. “Last time Keerthi managed to slip from our clutches. We had information about her role in the firm,” an officer associated with the investigation of the case said. Rs. 100 crore in banks  The police have now identified 55 app-based loan companies operating countrywide, from mere four in the last fortnight, and had put on freeze Rs. 100 crore in 27 different bank accounts. Unfolding the maze of loan apps, Hyderabad Additional Commissioner of Police (Crimes and SIT) Shikha Goel said on a preliminary investigation it was found that a couple of people, including those arrested, were seen acting as directors in multiple companies. Speaking to The Hindu , she said that they have also identified links between online gaming apps and the loan apps. “One of the loan companies in question is registered with the same address on which a gaming firm is also registered at the Registrar of Companies,” the officer said. According to her, a Chinese national Yuan Yuan alias Sissi alias Jennifer was the person who had set up operations in India and is presently abroad. “Yuan has left India long back. She is the mastermind behind the entire network in Hyderabad and elsewhere in the country.” Google asked Further, Ms. Goel said that they have identified 280 loan applications on Google Playstore and asked Alphabet Inc., which owns Google, to take down these apps as the companies operating them were found harassing and defaming the borrowers. “Initially, the number of applications which we had asked to block were 69, now it has increased 280. As and when such apps come to our notice, we will inform Google,” the officer said. Local Translators Meanwhile, the investigators are also trying to trace the local translators of Wei and Yuan, who accompanied them for their meetings in India. They had different translators in Hyderabad, Gurugram and Bengaluru. “As of now we came to know that one Indrajeet was the interpreter for Wei in Delhi. We are trying to approach him as his statement can be of value in the case,” an officer said, adding that Wei cannot speak English and understands very little English.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/loan-app-freeze-on-rs-100-cr-in-27-accounts-one-more-held/article33498244.ece
05 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Discoms await govt. nod to file ARRs with tariff revision proposal||With the time running out fast for the filing of annual aggregate revenue requirement (ARR) for the 2021-22 tariff year, the two power distribution companies in the State are awaiting the government go-ahead for taking up the statutory exercise with hope for nod to tariff revision. The two power utilities in the distribution business – Southern Discom and Northern Discom – have already done their home work and have proposed revision of the tariff to reduce the burden of losses and to meet the increasing costs of variables. It was for 2018-19, the Discoms have filed their ARRs formally last time and the regulatory commission has issued tariff order before the commencement of the tariff year. Since then, there has been no formal filing of ARRs for 2019-20 and 2020-21 due to various reasons – because of elections to the Assembly, Lok Sabha and local body elections in 2018 and 2019 first and due to the COVID-19 pandemic later in 2020. Refusing to divulge the details of the extent of revision proposed, a senior official of a power utility said: “We are waiting with our fingers crossed to get the government nod for increase in tariff, which is unchanged for the domestic and commercial consumers since 2016-17 and for a few other other categories since 2018-19.” The official, however, admitted that the revision proposed by them was more than the average increase of 7.5% effected in the 2016-17 tariff. The senior executive explained that it is inevitable to revise the tariff in the wake of increase of all costs linked to power generation, transmission and distribution over the last four years. “Besides, 2021-22 tariff year is the only window available before the government to allow the Discoms to hike tariff to some extent or the other as it may not take the revision call for the tariff year 2022-23 with Assembly elections due before December 2023, although the tariff year ends with March 31 that year,” the executive pointed out. Further, tariff revision is also unavoidable, irrespective of it being passed on to the consumer, as the Discoms continue to remain in the red owing to operational losses in spite of their debt burden being taken over by the State government under the provisions of the Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY), the official felt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/discoms-await-govt-nod-to-file-arrs-with-tariff-revision-proposal/article33498252.ece
05 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||TRS has put higher education in reverse gear: BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday has accused the TRS government of totally neglecting the higher education sector by not appointing vice-chancellors and failing to fill up the vacant teaching posts in the last six years, which is directly affecting the prospects of the disadvantaged sections who cannot afford fee in private colleges. “The TRS government has taken the higher education in a reverse gear. Save for health sciences and agriculture universities, none of the other varsities have had a full fledged vice-chancellor for years. There have been no meetings of the executive councils or budgetary approvals taken. If access to education is the game changer for the future, Telangana is looking into a dark one,” charged senior party leader P. Muralidhar Rao at a press conference. “Osmania University is a classic example of being the most important institution and also the most ignored with the in-charge Vice-Chancellor and Municipal Administration Secretary Arvind Kumar converting it into a municipality. It has 848 vacancies in teaching posts alone, what kind of university is it without teachers?,” he questioned. Contesting the government claim, Mr. Rao asserted that all the recruitments were done before the State was formed and there are no court cases preventing the government from filling up hundreds of vacancies in the universities in different levels. “Is this a sign of good governance? Is it not dereliction of responsibilities by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao? I challenge the government to appoint an audit committee and we are ready to prove the failures in higher education,” he said. The BJP leader claimed a government-appointed committee had earlier called for filling up of vacancies in two stages but this has been put on the back-burner for the last couple of years. Yet, the government is now putting up a pretence of going for recruitment drives only with the MLC elections round the corner but no one is ready to trust it any more, he said. Union leaders faulted “The TRS government days are numbered. Every single day in power only means a backstep for the State. Already employees and youth have become the soldiers of change, unlike the union leaders, who have become cheerleaders for the government driven by selfish interests,” he said. Mr. Rao swore that it is only the BJP which can bring back the past glory to the universities, take up mass recruitment of lecturers and solve the issues of contract teachers when it comes to power. He also gave a list of vacant teachers and non-teaching posts in the universities across the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-has-put-higher-education-in-reverse-gear-bjp/article33498254.ece
05 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||High Court bids adieu to CJ Chauhan||A Full Court meeting was held here on Monday to bid adieu to Telangana High Court Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan who has been transferred to Uttarakhand HC. Describing the outgoing CJ as a man of good heart, Advocate General B.S. Prasad said the CJ had given immense confidence to junior members of the Bar with his encouragement. The CJ’s contribution in sharpening skills of the next generation of the HC was unforgettable. The CJ had a distinct style of writing a judgment. Mr. Prasad recalled that in one of the verdicts the CJ had stated that “the principles of natural justice are like a clear sunshine which pervade and permeate into the deepest dark corners, and kill the germs of injustice”. In another judgment, he had observed that not only the three branches of the State but the State itself rests and progresses on the faith of its people, the AG shared. Lauding the CJ’s efforts in upholding the natural rights of a citizen, the AG cited a recent verdict. A businessman accused of defaulting on loan repayments approached the HC challenging classification of his bank as fraud account. The CJ said that the principle of ‘audi alteram partem’ (let the other side be heard as well) should be heard into the Master Directions on Fraud and the businessman should have been given an opportunity to explain his case. In a case of rape and murder of a nine-month-old in Warangal, the CJ commuted the death sentence awarded to the convict. He observed that choosing a middle path of punishment permits the courts to balance twin aspects of limiting the personal liberty of the convict without depriving him of his life, the AG said. Delivering verdict in a plea challenging government’s decision to demolish Irrum Manzil, the bench led by the CJ restrained the government from doing so. The CJ noted in the verdict that while it is important to plan for the future, it is equally important to protect, preserve, and promote the past, the AG said. The outgoing CJ thanked all Justices of Telangana HC, members of the Bar, AG and staff members of the HC for the cooperation they had extended in smooth functioning of the courts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/high-court-bids-adieu-to-cj-chauhan/article33498226.ece
05 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||State govt. to set up textile park in Warangal district||The State government has decided to set up a mini textile park at Kodakandla in Warangal district in the interests of weavers in the area. The decision comes in the light of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s decision to establish textile parks in areas where there is potential, Industries Minister K.T. Rama Rao said. Kodakandla has been selected in view of the availability of human resources and other positive aspects for setting up the textile park. “Scores of skilled weavers are available in the area and they migrated to other States due to absence of employment opportunities,” he said adding the decision follows a request made by Minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao who made a strong pitch for the textile park in view of the resources available there. Mr. Rama Rao said a major section of these weavers were keen to return to the State following the proactive policies adopted by the TRS government since it came to power in the State. Setting up of mini textile park at Kodakandla would ensure employment opportunities to close to 20,000 weavers’ families. The Minister assured that the ongoing welfare schemes for weavers would continue uninterrupted as also the distribution of Bathukamma sarees which was conceived in the interests of thousands of powerloom weavers. The Cheyutha scheme launched for weavers helped them overcome the difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic and the relaxations to the tune of Rs. 95 crore extended under the scheme assisted close to 25,000 families. Several representations were received seeking the continuation of the scheme and the matter would be taken to the notice of the government. Mr. Rama Rao directed the officials concerned to complete the report for allocations that were needed for handloom and textile sector in the next budget at the earliest.  Scores of skilled weavers are available Kodakandla and they migrated to other States due to absence of employment opportunities. K.T.

05 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Rare migratory bird spotted in Vikarabad||For 33-year-old entrepreneur Manoj Kumar Vittapu, his recent outing in the Vikarabad forest was truly memorable. For, he sighted the rare blue-and-white flycatcher, a migratory songbird. “Historically, it has very sporadic records in India. This is the first time it has been sighted in Telangana and in the eastern part of the country,” says the city-based youth, who has been into birding and wildlife photography since 2016. Bird Day today “Sighting the species ahead of the National Bird Day on January 5 gives us extra joy. It is a rare winter visitor, also known as Japanese Flycatcher,” adds Manoj. According to him, one of the interesting facts about bird watching is the element of surprise. “You never know what you may find while being out in nature,” he says, recollecting his encounter with the bird in the company of another well-known face in the field of birding — Sudeshna Dey, an MBA graduate from IIM-Ahmedabad. “The most important aspect of this sighting is that typically this flycatcher has been found only in the Western ghats until now. It can only be seen in Japan in late spring, summer and early autumn. It nests and feeds in natural habitats, preferably open woodland with lots of good perch sites,” says the avid bird watcher. The species can also be seen in gardens and parks. As autumn draws closer, the birds leave Japan, preferring to spend the winter in the warmer climes of Southeast Asia, Manoj explains.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/rare-migratory-bird-spotted-in-vikarabad/article33498234.ece
05 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Telecallers suggested top-ups to loan app borrowers||The unwary borrowers from online loan apps have fallen into an inextricable debt trap as a result of inducements of the telecallers. When a loan account turns into default (seven days after taking the loan), the recovery telecallers phone the borrower and remind the outstanding liability and also scare them. The call centres in Hyderabad were used for sending out gentle reminders, while telecallers in Gurugram were abusive and defaming till the loan amount was paid. However, when a distressed customer expresses his or her inability to repay the loan amount, the caller opens up a raft of options which include where he or she could borrow top-up loans to repay the existing loan. “While probing how the victims ended up taking multiple loans to clear one, we came to know that it was telecallers who suggested to the borrowers to obtain money from another app and pay off the existing loan and avoid public humiliation,” Hyderabad Additional Commissioner of Police (Crimes and SIT) Shikha Goel told The Hindu . This is how the hapless victim gets into a debt trap, she said. According to her, the ‘abusive’ telecallers were motivated to make more calls per day to recover the loan amount. Targets and special incentives and rewards were given to callers who achieved maximum number of calls. “If recovery calls were converted into receiving payments, then the telecallers were rewarded with extra incentives. This reward system had made the telecallers go the extra mile and effect recovery,” Ms. Goel said.  Performance incentives The high performers in the staffing system were rewarded from top to bottom based on their team performances. In effect, the entire workforce is on high adrenaline and performance of each employee was meticulously recorded. Each telecaller had a target of 45 % recovery. For instance one telecaller was provided with the details of 10 defaulters, he or she has to get money back from at least four or five borrowers to be eligible for an incentive, and if one gets more than the given target he or she would get greater incentive, and even if they get 1% less, they were ineligible, the officer explained. “Probably the extra money was the reason behind the changing behaviour of the telecallers after stage-I and further became more abusive,” the Hyderabad Additional Commissioner of Police said adding that whether it was telecallers, team leader or assistant manager everyone’s incentives were linked to performance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/telecallers-suggested-top-ups-to-loan-app-borrowers/article33498243.ece
05 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Kodandaram plans Million March-type protest||The Telangana Jana Samiti is planning to organise a massive demonstration on the lines of Million March conducted as part of separate Statehood agitation to mount pressure on the State government to resolve the acute hardships faced by unemployed youth, farmers and other sections of the society. TJS president M. Kodandaram exhorted the party cadre and supporters to draw inspirations from the ongoing farmers’ stir in New Delhi and wage a united struggle in the interests of the unemployed youth and farmers. He stressed the need for a united struggle as it is the only way to achieve the justified demands by different sections of the society. The TJS would give a call for Chalo Hyderabad in this direction, Prof. Kodandaram said while addressing the participants after calling off his two-day protest at the party office here on Monday. The TJS would conduct awareness meetings at the district-level for intensification of the struggle against the government till January 20 before finalising the next course of action. He expressed concern that the State is facing an unprecedented situation at present with little scope for earning livelihood. Youth, farmers and private teachers lost their jobs in the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic, but the government turned cold shoulder towards their plight. The TJS had therefore resolved to intensify its struggle for the cause of these sections, he said. He recalled that the protest was planned at the Dharna Chowk near Indira Park, but the government did not give permission to the peaceful protest on the pretext that there was scope for violence. He criticized the government for not initiating any steps for taking up recruitment to vacant posts, except for rendering “lip service”. In addition, the government hasd done away with the procurement process by closing down the procurement centres, he said. He accused Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of entrusting vast tracts of land and works to corporates and big contractors in lure of commissions. The struggle for separate statehood was founded on the basis of jobs, but the government did not take up the process in that direction, he said. He questioned the government as to why it failed to release a calendar for recruitments and why there is no action into the assurance of payment of unemployment allowance to youth. “It is better for the government to step down, if it is not in a position to redress the grievances of the people,” he said, alleging that “just one single family is being benefited all these six years” while the interests and aspirations of all the deserving and the needy are being set aside.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/kodandaram-plans-million-march-type-protest/article33498256.ece
05 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Govt. wants banks to help oilpalm cultivation in Telangana||The State Government has asked the State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) to extend necessary credit facility to farmers for cultivation of oilpalm in about 8.14 lakh acres over the next four years. In a meeting with the bankers held here on Monday, Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy also requested the bankers to evolve guidelines in line with the Central Government’s programme to increase production of oil crops by following the scale of finance decided by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). Also ordered for setting up a committee to finalise the unit cost for oilpalm cultivation in the State to finalise the subsidy component. He explained that the unit cost was decided based on the cost of cultivation per acre or hectare and the cost of cultivation of the crop in one acre for the first four years was estimated to be about Rs. 1,38,680 including the cost of micro irrigation facility and out of it Rs. 31,382 would be government subsidy. He stated that against the requirement of 22 million tonnes of edible oils every year, the indigenous production was only 7 million tonnes and the remaining 15 million tonnes was being imported incurring huge expenditure. Requirement of palm oil for Telangana was 3.66 lakh tonnes but the production was only 38,000 tonnes and to overcome the shortage cultivation of the plantation is required in another 2.5 lakh acres. Irrigation facilities On the current scenario of oilpalm cultivation in the country, he stated that it was being raised in 8.25 lakh acres with production of 16.85 lakh tonnes of oilpalm fruit bunches and raw oil extraction of 2.81 lakh tonnes. Keeping in view the increased irrigation facilities, the Centre had identified 25 districts as suitable for oilpalm cultivation and sanctioned its cultivation in 8.14 lakh acres over the next four years. He explained that the plantation crop would give an income of Rs. 1.2 lakh per acre to Rs. 1.5 lakh per acre ever year for a period of 25 to 30 years with average production of 10 to 12 tonnes of oilpalm fruit bunches per acre. It would also save on foreign exchange spend to the country. Secretary (Agriculture) B. Janardhan Reddy, Vice-Chancellor of Agriculture University V. Praveen Rao, Registrar of Horticulture University R. Bhagawan, SLBC Convenor Krishna Sharma, DGM of NABARD G. Santhanam and representatives about 20 banks participated in the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/govt-wants-banks-to-help-oilpalm-cultivation/article33498264.ece
05 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Leaving a lasting impression||A High Court Chief Justice addressing a lawyer as ‘sir’ during court proceedings is uncommon. Referring to a junior advocate as ‘sir’ is equally rare. With such polite gestures, Telangana High Court Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan took the dignity and decorum of judicial proceedings to a higher level. This is one of the lasting impressions that CJ Chauhan, who was transferred to Uttarakhand High Court, has left on the legal fraternity here. The practice was not started when he became Acting CJ on April 3, 2019, or when he was made permanent CJ on June 22, 2019. From the beginning itself, he made it a point to address a lawyer as ‘sir’ during the hearings. The practice continued till the last day of his office as CJ of Telangana HC on Monday. He was transferred as Uttarakhand HC Chief Justice and would be assuming charge soon. Another interesting practice he introduced in the court halls was making it compulsory for the lawyers to use the mike in the court hall while presenting arguments or making submissions, stating that it would make the lawyer’s voice audible and clear. Other lawyers and people present in his court halls would never miss even a single point or word spoken by the counsels of the petitioners or respondents, he insisted. During his tenure, CJ Chauhan gave enormous importance to PIL pleas. Issues having direct or indirect impact on general public were given priority and heard at length before being adjudicated. At the same time, he did not allow anyone to use PIL petitions for taking advantage in any manner. He once took to task a lawyer who had filed two PIL pleas on the same matter. “The CJ will also be remembered for giving lot of time in the morning to lawyers to make mentions about urgent matters,” advocates said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/leaving-a-lasting-impression/article33498227.ece

President of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Employees Union Udhari Gopal drew blood from his veins to write a letter to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao urging him to cancel the agreement with REEL, the concessionaire partner for Solid Waste Management in the city. In the letter, Mr. Gopal said the transportation cost mere Rs. 160 crore when it was being done using GHMC’s own vehicles, which now has grown to cost Rs. 600 crore. Seeking a CBI inquiry into the irregularities in garbage transport, the union leader demanded cancellation of agreement with Ramky and also of privatisation of sanitation in commercial areas. He also demanded regularisation of employment of contract and outsourced workers, besides super speciality hospitals, one in each zone, for sanitation and entomology workers. About 200 sanitation workers participated in the demonstration.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ghmc-asked-to-withdraw-agreement-with-reel/article33498248.ece
05 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Clarify stand on ‘anti-people’ policies of Centre, CPI(M) tells TRS||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) demanded the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti to clarify its stand vis-a-vis the “anti-people” policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi led central government. The CPI (M) alleged that the TRS had adopted “wavering stance” towards the central government’s policies which are harmful to the interests of the common man in general and farmers in particular. The manner in which the TRS changed its stance on the demonetisation and new farm laws enacted by the Centre reflect the party’s indecision on the issues, it said. “It is unfortunate and atrocious that the TRS which supported the farmers cause changed its stance,” CPI (M) Polit Bureau member B.V. Raghavulu said asking the ruling party to rethink on its stand as it would do immense harm to farmers of the State. Mr. Raghavulu was here in connection with the party’s two-day State committee meeting which concluded here on Monday. He alleged that the BJP-led central government is attacking the federal systems of the country in a systematic manner and this calls for a need for the regional parties to join forces in countering these attacks. The Centre is trying to mount pressure on the States to toe its line in the name of inquiries by the CBI, NIA and other central agencies, he said. “The entire effort is to unleash a dictatorial and centralised administration in the country,” he said. The denial of funds to the States to tackle COVID-19 pandemic and the Centre’s directions to the States to mobilise their own funds are reflective of its attitude towards the States. There were several pre-conditions imposed on the States for release of funds, including changes in the crucial sectors like agriculture and power which form part of the Concurrent List, he said. “The TRS being a regional party should clarify its stand on these attacks on the federal systems by the Narendra Modi government,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/clarify-stand-on-anti-people-policies-of-centre-cpim-tells-trs/article33498257.ece
05 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Innovations galore by students of govt. schools||Government school students are second to none. What the determined youngsters need is encouragement, right mentoring and support to showcase their talent, and that was amply evident at the Telangana School Innovation Challenge 2020 grand finale here on Monday. From the frugal hydraulic lifting and rotating wheelchair, whose idea the young innovator got seeing her father battle paralysis; a system that stops tap supply once the container below is removed thus helping conserving precious water; to a wearable multipurpose agriculture bag that reduces the burden of farmhands, a number of such innovations and the students behind them won the hearts of visitors. Making it to the grand finale were 25 ideas and the students behind them were from government schools from different parts of the State. Reaching there was no easy task given that 4,041 schools from across the 33 districts of Telangana had registered. A total of 8,750 students and 7,093 teams submitted their ideas after completing the online course on design thinking. Industries and IT Minister K.T.Rama Rao, accompanied by Education Minister Sabitha Indra Reddy and Special Chief Secretary Education Chitra Ramachandran, went round the stalls featuring the students’ innovation and was generous in his praise for the youngsters. On learning that the wheelchair innovator’s father, bedridden for months after paralysis, was the lone breadwinner and that the family stayed in a rented house, the Minister instructed the officials to explore the possibility of providing assistance. The top honour at the finale went to the all-girls’ team from ZPHS Mulkalapally, Yadadri district, for the Organic-Zero Waste Sthree Raksha Pads they had devised. They bagged the first prize of Rs. 75,000. The second position was bagged by all-boys’ team behind the wearable multipurpose agriculture bag from ZPHS Danthalapally, Mahabubabad, and the third prize by the team of students from Adilabad behind the organic chalk. While enquiring with the students about their innovation, showing keen interest in their work and appreciating their confidence levels, the Minister also praised the school teachers and others. The 25 ideas that made it to the finale were selected after several rounds of evaluation. The innovation challenge was organised by Telangana State Innovation Cell in collaboration with UNICEF India, the Education Department and Inqui-Lab Foundation in Hyderabad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/innovations-galore-by-students-of-govt-schools/article33498240.ece

Jaganmohan Reddy break his silence and speak up on the spree of incidents of temple idols being desecrated in the last few days across the State. Even while stating that his AP counterpart Som Veeraju has been in the forefront of protests against the vandalism, the BJP leader warned that the patience of the majority community should not be tested and the government there will have to face severe consequences if it does not act promptly. “In both Telugu States, Chief Ministers are playing with the sentiments of the majority community. We are not against any community but will not sit quiet if our beliefs are being trampled upon. Andhra Pradesh people will show their mettle in the forthcoming by-elections to the Tirupati Lok Sabha polls just like TS people did during the Dubbak and GHMC polls,” he said and also demanded total revamp of the Endowments department there. With regard to Telangana affairs, Mr. Sanjay Kumar charged the TRS government with totally ignoring the “true” fighters for the separate Telangana cause and instead handing over power to turncoats who were against the bifurcation.

A high-level review meeting presided by Principal Secretary, Municipal Administration & Urban Development, Arvind Kumar at GHMC headquarters, decided to prepare zone-wise action plan to be implemented before the next monsoons towards this direction. Mr. Arvind Kumar compared the inundation on October 17 last year, to the floods in 1908, and said it poured 300 millimetres within six hours, causing heavy flooding. Several basements were flooded, putting people to untold hardships. He asked officials to take appropriate measures to de-water the cellars. He also asked them to clear encroachments from the lakes, water bodies, and storm water drains immediately, especially in low lying areas, according utmost priority to people’s safety. Director, Municipal Administration, Satyanarayana said a total of 315 localities have been inundated in 26 municipalities within the ORR during the October rains. Post the floods, a total of 573 encroachments into storm water drains were discovered, apart from 4,606 illegal structures in 247 locations within the lake beds. GHMC Commissioner D. S.

A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of the joint action committee comprising the STF, the Telangana State United Teachers Federation (TSUTF), the Telangana Private Teachers Federation (TPTF), the Progressive Democratic Students Union (PDSU), the Students' Federation of India (SFI), the All India Students' Federation (AISF) and various other organisations held here on Monday. Speaking on the occasion, the School Teachers’ Federation (STF) State general secretary D Saidulu said the imperative need for resuming the classroom instruction in the schools to protect the academic future of students was discussed threadbare at the JAC meeting. An overwhelming number of students, mainly hailing from poor families, are facing uncertainty due to the prolonged closure of the schools and difficulties in attending the online classes, he said, urging the State government to prepare a 100-day academic schedule to restart the classes in the regular mode in all schools by following due precautions against the COVID-19. Keeping students engaged in academic pursuits is of paramount importance to ensure that education continues for uninterrupted learning, he noted. Other speakers expressed their concern over the problems being faced by rural students to follow the online classes properly owing to lack of access to gadgets like smartphones and poor Internet connectivity. They contended that the virtual mode of teaching and learning was not an alternative to the formal classroom instruction. Some other participants highlighted the plight of children of daily wage labourers, who are deprived of midday meals due to the closure of schools. They deplored that the private teachers were reeling under the ripple effects of the pandemic crisis and living in dire straits. The representatives of some private school managements also attended the meeting.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/resumption-of-classroom-instruction-sought/article33498275.ece

05 January 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Startup develops AI system to repair electric vehicle battery||The IIT Hyderabad-incubated startup PURE EV has developed an artificial intelligence-driven hardware that automates identification and repair of defects in lithium-ion batteries of electric vehicles. This next-generation technology completely does away with the requirement for customers to visit service centres to address battery defects. PURE EV researchers have designed Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based algorithms for the system called ‘BaTRics Faraday’, which identify the defects in various series in the battery and auto heal them to the best of the electro-chemistry potential of the cells. This process is fully automated by the hardware and no manual intervention is required all the way till complete capacity restitution.  Extensive field testing of BaTRics Faraday has already been completed. This system can be used for all of the five two-wheeler models launched by PURE EV (Epluto 7g, Etrance Neo, Etrance, Egnite and Etron+). This system will be rolled out in the first quarter of 2021. “Lithium batteries are the most critical component of electric vehicles. They contain multiple lithium cells welded together in series and parallel arrangements to meet the desired voltage and ampere-hour (Ah) capacity. In case of any defects coming to batteries in any of the cell series, it leads to significant downtime to the EV owners. Additionally, the usage behaviour pattern and Indian environmental conditions put more load on the batteries. It is, indeed, a very difficult task for battery OEM to get the defects rectified through diagnosis and replacement of defective series of cells,” said PURE EV founder Nishanth Dongari, who is also an associate professor, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, IIT-Hyderabad..  “The need of the hour is to develop an intelligent hardware device which resolves battery defects through an external healing process. PURE EV has developed AI-driven hardware which carries out the diagnosis and resolution of defects in the battery through an externally-connected device to the battery. This saves precious man-hours otherwise spent in replacement of series of cells, and reduces the battery ‘turn around time’,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/startup-develops-ai-system-to-repair-electric-vehicle-battery/article33498235.ece

05 January 2021||SIDDIPET,TELANGANA||Song of sorrow of displaced villagers||Leaving home or native place is very difficult as most people have a physical and emotional attachment to their homes. The attachment is stronger and more visible in rural areas than in urban environment. The emotional bonds are not only with the place but also with the fellow residents who address each other as kin — Anna or Tammudu (brother), Bava or Bavamaridi (brother-in-law), Mama (uncle), Tata or Maama (grandparents) — and the exceptions being the occasional visitors who maybe called by their name. When it is very difficult and heart breaking for an individual to leave such relationships and leave the village is heart breaking, how can it be easy when the entire village has to be evacuated. No one knows where the other person would be and where they will settle down. The bigger question that haunts everyone is employment, there is no assurance of even getting labour work. Pouring out the sorrow and angst of the villagers being displaced by the natives of Erravalli village in Kondapaka mandal, which would be totally submerged under the Mallannasagar, a song video was captured by a resident of the village Bhaskar Perla. Incidentally the village falls in Gajwel constituency represented by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. “I have grown up in the village and lived in it all along. Now my heart become heavy while leaving the village. The tank in our neighbourhood and the dappu (a traditional percussion instrument) in the hand of a villager are asking me how I am vacating the village. The village loves us very much like our mother and father and showers the same affection. Even the animals in our village treat us fondly. We are filled with joy when swimming in agriculture well, going to fields and plucking fruits without informing mother. I forget all my problems when I return to the village from any place,” go the lyrics of the 12.11 minute song ‘Mana Village Erravally’ written by P. Nagaraju. In the video produced by Vinay Kumar the entire village was covered and the team made sure that they did not miss any nook or cranny. “Our village is totally disturbed and going to submerge in Mallannasagar. The house we have built, the walls and the path we walked are coming to mind and my heart becomes heavy. The land has been acquired forcibly and we are being sent away from our village. Can not the Chief Minister speak with those losing their lands and do justice?” asks the singer and music composer Indrajit. The team that produced the video is from Siddipet and surrounding areas and Bhaskar is from Erravalli village. The song had more than 200 views within 15 hours of being uploaded and can be accessed at https://youtu.be/fiB9JRqwjy0||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/song-of-sorrow-of-displaced-villagers/article33498272.ece

She also visited the Tikri border (Delhi) to extend support to the farmers. She said the BJP government was trying to take away the rights of farmers through the laws. “More than 50 farmers have so far sacrificed their lives, but the government is still unmoved. The Central government should provide a compensation of Rs. 1 crore and government job to the families of the deceased,” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cong-to-give-rs-2-lakh-each-to-families-of-farmers-who-lost-lives-says-hooda/article33498213.ece

05 January 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi’s R-Day tableau to feature redeveloped Chandni Chowk||The city’s Republic Day tableau – showcasing the Chandni Chowk Redevelopment Project – has been accorded approval by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), according to Delhi government sources. Marking the Capital’s return to the festivities on Rajpath via a float proposed by it after three years, the tableau, Delhi government officials associated with it said, will be special in more ways than one. Not only will it be the only other “live” tableau apart from the Ram Temple-themed Uttar Pradesh float, Delhi’s tableau, featuring mini contingents of four cyclists each riding along on either side of it in a symbolic bid to promote it as a means of commuting in a megacity, according to government sources, will possibly be the first time bicycles will run on Rajpath as part of a State float. “The tableau itself will seek to send a message of religious and cultural harmony – portraying the pedestrianised route along two temples, a gurdwara, a church and a mosque located along the 1.3 km to 1.5 km-long-route being redeveloped in Chandni Chowk – but there is another message,” said a government official. “The cyclists riding along will symbolise a sustainable future for megacities where cycling and walking on safe streets are significant means of commuting,” the official also said. As reported by The Hindu on December 31, 2020, the city’s proposed tableau for Republic Day celebrations this year is based on the Chandni Chowk Redevelopment Project – undertaken at a cost of Rs. 90 crore and part of a larger redevelopment plan for the Walled City of Shahjahanabad which is on the brink of being inaugurated – showcasing a Delhi government accomplishment after three years. Though a Delhi tableau was also part of the celebrations last year – depicting Mahatma Gandhi’s 720-day stay in the city between 1915 and 1948 – it was part of a contingent of 22 others depicting different facets from the life of the Father of the Nation as per a ‘Gandhi connect’ theme to commemorate his 150th birth anniversary pre-decided by the Ministry of Defence. In 2017, the Delhi tableau illustrated a ‘Model Government School’ referencing the State government’s initiatives in the education sector and the betterment of the conditions of schools administered by it. Before 2017, the Delhi tableau was a no-show for three consecutive years. Prior to this, a float seeking to showcase the diverse culture of those constituting its population and the traditional practices native to them, including fine art, was part of Republic Day celebrations in the year 2013. Finishing touches are being given to the 1.3-km stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhis-r-day-tableau-to-feature-redeveloped-chandni-chowk/article33497661.ece
05 January 2021||New Delhi,||Accommodate new temple at Chandni Chowk: BJP||The BJP on Monday demanded that the Delhi government redesign the ongoing redevelopment at Chandni Chowk to accommodate a new temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman that was demolished here over the weekend. On its part, AAP accused the BJP and the civic bodies it rules for the “heinous crime” of demolishing the ancient temple while “people were asleep” and attempting to pass the blame onto the AAP-led Delhi government later. “Kejriwal portrays himself as a Hanuman devotee, but when his turn came to save the Prachin Hanuman temple he stepped back,” Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta alleged. “The religious committee under the State government had the right to take a stand in the court saying that the demolition would hurt the faith of the people, but the government did not do that,” Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, alleged. Mr. Gupta and Mr. Bidhuri said the BJP would take the matter to L-G Anil Baijal. AAP MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak accused the BJP of diverting the people’s attention and fabricating facts. “Adesh Gupta is well-aware of the fact that this demolition is being done by the North civic body with the help of Delhi Police,” Mr. Pathak said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/accommodate-new-temple-at-chandni-chowk-bjp/article33497651.ece
05 January 2021||New Delhi,||Delhi HC allows plea on pregnancy termination||The Delhi High Court on Monday allowed a woman’s plea for medical termination of her 25-week pregnancy, taking note of a report by AIIMS that survival of the foetus, suffering from serious abnormalities, was unlikely. Justice Navin Chawla said, “I see no reason to deny permission for medical termination of pregnancy. The petition is therefore allowed.” In late December, the High Court had directed the Medical Superintendent of AIIMS to constitute a medical board to examine the condition of the 25-week pregnant woman and the possibility of the foetus not surviving the term of the pregnancy. Pursuant to the High Court’s order, AIIMS medical board examined the pregnant woman and came to the conclusion that “survival of foetus is unlikely”. In India, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act stipulates a ceiling of 20 weeks, for termination of pregnancy, beyond which abortion of a foetus is statutorily impermissible. The woman, in her plea, said that during an ultrasonography, conducted on her at the gestational age of 25 weeks, it was discovered that the foetus suffered from Bilateral Renal Agenesis (both kidneys absent), thereby making it incompatible with life. Since pregnancy had crossed the 20-week mark and medical termination of pregnancy now prohibited, the woman approached the High Court. The woman’s counsel had argued that the foetus would not survive till the child’s birth as both the kidneys have not developed as yet. The counsel had said in the circumstances it would be futile to compel the woman to undergo the full terms of pregnancy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/delhi-hc-allows-plea-on-pregnancy-termination/article33497649.ece

Akbar on Monday told a court here that journalist Priya Ramani called him ‘media’s biggest sexual predator’ without any investigation or basis. Mr. Akbar made the submission through senior advocate Geeta Luthra during the final hearing in a criminal defamation complaint filed by him against Ms. Ramani for allegedly defaming him by accusing him of sexual misconduct 20 years ago. Ms. Ramani had made allegation of sexual misconduct against Mr. Akbar in the wake of #MeToo movement in 2018. Ms. Luthra referred to Ms. Ramani’s tweet which accused Mr. Akbar of being media’s biggest sexual predator. “If we look at what has been said, a conclusion is drawn that this is a predator. On what basis? All these averments [in the article] are based without any investigation or basis,” she submitted before Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Kumar. The senior advocate further accused Ms. Ramani of not telling the truth before the court. “She says her defence is truth but she knows it is not the truth. Only in cross-examination, she says it was not the truth. It shows her credibility as a witness,” Ms. Luthra said. “A blatantly false, incorrect statement was made to court and a blatantly false defence was taken,” she said. The court will further resume the hearing on January 7.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ramani-called-me-medias-biggest-predator-without-basis-says-akbar/article33497654.ece
05 January 2021||New Delhi,||Riots accused should get chargesheets timely: court||Taking note of delays in trial of north-east Delhi riots cases, a court here directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) to issue directions to investigating officers to supply copies of the chargesheets to the accused well within time. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Dinesh Kumar passed the directions after several accused in at least three riots cases submitted that they have not received the chargesheet despite the court's orders. The court also issued notice to the investigating officers (IOs) concerned to explain as to why the copies of the chargesheets were not supplied to the accused through jail superintendent as directed. It said the reply should be forwarded by the ACP. “It has been noticed that the IOs of various cases are not supplying the copies to the accused persons despite directions of the court within time which is resulting in delay in committal of various cases to the Sessions court for further proceedings in the matter,” the court said. In another development, the court dismissed an application by JNU student and Pinjra Tod member Natasha Narwal for preserving mobile numbers, customer application forms and call detail records (CDRs) of witnesses, including police officers, in the conspiracy case related to the riots. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat said Ms. Narwal seemed to be doing a “fishing and roving” enquiry as she has sought “a wholesome CDRs” of the witnesses, including protected witnesses for a period of many months and it was not for a specific instance or a date and with certainty. The court said privacy was also an issue. ‘Perfunctory’ probe Meanwhile, three persons were granted bail in another riots case, with the court saying the probe carried out was “perfunctory” and the chargesheet was filed in a “lackadaisical manner”. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat granted the relief to Osama, Aatir and Gulfam on furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 with one surety of like amount each in the case related to looting and burning of a fruits godown during the riots in Jafrabad in February last year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/riots-accused-should-get-chargesheets-timely-court/article33497655.ece
05 January 2021||New Delhi,||Govt. told to reply to plea on undertrial prisoners||The Delhi High Court on Monday asked the city government to reply to a petition to release on bail those undertrial prisoners (UTPs) who have served more than half of the maximum sentence, which would be awarded to them if convicted for the lesser of the multiple offences they are facing trial. A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan asked the Delhi government to give its stand on the plea by a trust, India Undertrial Prisoner Support Forum, which has contended that granting bail to such UTPs would be a long term solution for decongesting the jails. The trust argued that the Supreme Court had in 2015 and 2016 ordered setting up of a Undertrial Review Committee (UTRC) to consider cases of UTPs who were entitled to benefit of CrPC Section 436A which provides the maximum period for which a UTP can be detained. Section 436A of CrPC provides for release on bail of the person who has undergone detention for a period extending up to one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment. The plea said that the holding capacity of the 16 jails in Delhi at Tihar, Mandoli and Rohini together was 10,026 prisoners, but they were housing 17,440 inmates out of which 14,355 were UTPs.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/govt-told-to-reply-to-plea-on-undertrial-prisoners/article33497650.ece

05 January 2021||Pune,||Veteran Congressman and former minister Vilas Patil Undalkar dead||Veteran Congressman and former Maharashtra minister Vilas Patil Undalkar, a seven-time MLA from Karad, passed away following a brief illness in Satara on Monday morning. He was 82. Sources said that Undalkar, whose health had steadily deteriorated over the last two weeks, had been undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Satara city. Undalkar, affectionately known as ‘Vilaskaka’, had held the Cooperation and Law and Justice portfolios in erstwhile State Cabinets and was notable for his strong hold over the cooperative sector besides having deep grassroots connect. A charismatic regional leader, he represented the Karad South Assembly constituency for a record 35 consecutive years from 1980 to 2014 before being supplanted by his long-standing rival, former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan. At the time of the 2014 Assembly poll, Undalkar, embittered over Mr. Chavan’s decision to step into the poll arena and contest from Karad South, had filed his nomination as an Independent, paving the way from a Congress versus Congress fight. Despite Undalkar being touted as the favourite, it was Mr. Chavan who triumphed a stiff three-way contest to win the Karad South seat. However, despite his defeat and intense personal differences with Mr. Chavan, Undalkar never deviated from the Congress ideology nor switched his political colours. Recently, at a public function, the stalwart Congressman, mellowed after years of feuding, had patched up his differences with Mr. Chavan. He was a close associate of former Maharashtra Chief Minister Shankarrao Chavan, the father of another erstwhile Chief Minister and the current State Public Works Department Minister Ashok Chavan. “With ‘Vilaskaka’’s passing, the Congress has lost a true proponent of the party’s inclusive ideology. His death has created a void in the Congress in western Maharashtra, and especially in social and cooperative sectors,” said Mr. Ashok Chavan, expressing grief over his demise. He said that he served the people with “the idea of Congress” throughout his life. “He maintained his principles and values even in the face of adversity. He was a popular leader with an inimitable grassroots appeal. He contributed a lot to Satara district as an MLA for 35 consecutive years and for Maharashtra as Cooperation Minister,” Mr. Ashok Chavan said. Tributes poured in from across the political spectrum. Deputy Chief Minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar said that ‘Vilaskaka’ would always be remembered as a leader who made a vital contribution to the development of rural Maharashtra. “He will always be remembered for his strong organisational and management skills as a member of several local political and educational establishments be it the Satara zilla parishad, or as a member of the Shivaji University senate, as director of the Satara District Central Bank or as the State Minister for Cooperation. Especially unique was the work done by ‘Vilaskaka’ in the field of water conservation through the river confluence project where he had the vision to realise the concept of the hill development,” Mr. Pawar said. After current NCP chief Sharad Pawar split the Congress in 1999, it was Undalkar who held the fort for the Congress in that part of western Maharashtra, winning the crucial Karad South Assembly seat for the next three elections. Undalkar’s last rites are to be performed at his ancestral village Undale in Karad later in the day.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/veteran-congressman-and-former-minister-vilas-patil-undalkar-dead/article33497893.ece

05 January 2021||Washington,||Trump pressed official to alter poll results||President Donald Trump pressured Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State to “find” enough votes to overturn Joe Biden’s win in the state’s presidential election, repeatedly citing unproven claims of fraud and raising the prospect of a “criminal offence” if officials did not change the vote count, according to a recording of the conversation. Unprecedented move The phone call with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Saturday was the latest step in an unprecedented effort by a sitting president to press a state official to reverse the outcome of a free and fair election that he lost. The President, who has refused to accept his loss to Democratic president-elect Biden, repeatedly argued that Mr. Raffensperger could change the certified results. “All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have,” Mr. Trump said. “Because we won the state.” Georgia counted its votes three times before certifying Mr. Biden’s win by a 11,779 margin, Mr. Raffensperger noted. “President Trump, we’ve had several lawsuits, and we’ve had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions,” he said on the call. We don’t agree that you have won.” Audio snippets of the conversation were first posted online by The Washington Post . The Associated Press obtained the full audio of Mr. Trump’s conversation with Georgia officials from a person on the call. The AP plans to post the full audio as it annotates a transcript with fact check material. Mr. Trump’s renewed intervention and the persistent and unfounded claims of fraud come nearly two weeks before he leaves office and two days before twin runoff elections in Georgia that will determine political control of the U.S. Senate. The President used the hour-long conversation to tick through a list of claims about the election in Georgia, including that hundreds of thousands of ballots mysteriously appeared in Fulton County, which includes Atlanta. Officials have said there is no evidence of that happening. The Georgia officials on the call are heard pushing back against the President’s assertions, telling him that he’s relying on debunked theories and, in one case, selectively edited video. “It was pretty obvious pretty early on that we’d debunked every one of those theories early on,” Mr. Raffensperger told ABC’s Good Morning America on Monday, “but President Trump continues to believe them.” Threatening tone At another point, Mr. Trump appeared to threaten Raffensperger and Ryan Germany, the Secretary of State’s legal counsel, by suggesting both could be criminally liable if they failed to find that thousands of ballots in Fulton County had been illegally destroyed. There is no evidence to support Mr. Trump’s claim. “That’s a criminal offence,” said Mr. Trump. “And you can’t let that happen.” Others on the call included Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, and attorneys assisting Mr. Trump, including Washington lawyer Cleta Mitchell. Democrats and a few Republicans condemned Mr. Trump’s actions.Legal experts said Mr. Trump’s behaviour raised questions about possible election law violations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/trump-pressed-official-to-alter-poll-results/article33497520.ece
05 January 2021||January 05 2021 00:00 IST,||All eyes on Georgia run-offs||The State of Georgia is holding run-off (re-race) elections on January 5 for its two seats in the U.S. Senate, a day after the 117th Congress was sworn in. The two seats were contested on Election Day, November 3, 2020, but no candidate won more than the required 50% of the vote needed to win an election as per State law. Who is running? One of the run-offs is between former businessman (and Reebok CEO) Republican David Perdue, who began his term in 2015 and 33-year-old Jewish documentary filmmaker Jon Ossoff. The other is between businesswoman and co-owner of a women’s basketball team Kelly Loeffler — who was appointed to the Senate by Georgia’s Governor in January last year (after her predecessor stepped down due to ill health) — and her Democratic challenger Raphael Warnock, an African American pastor who preaches at the same church where Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. once preached. What is at stake? The Georgia elections are especially significant this year as the outcome determines which party will control the U.S. Congress for the next two years. If Democrats win both races, they will control the Senate, because it will be split 50-50 and Democrats will also have (future) Vice President Kamala Harris’s deciding vote. Since Democrats already control the House of Representatives, winning the Senate will make it significantly easier for the Biden administration to advance its policies. Republicans just need to win one race to retain the Senate. Georgia is also important to both parties as it is integral to longer term shifts in voting based on changing demographics across the country. The southern State has been Republican for almost two decades, but in November Democratic candidate Joe Biden won it on the back of support from Georgia’s diverse and populous metros (Mr. Biden is scheduled to campaign in Atlanta on Monday and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris campaigned in Savannah over the weekend). Campaign themes Some 2.8 million people have voted early or used mail-in voting (a total of 5 million cast their vote in November). Democrats typically vote early. Republicans, concerned by the early turnout among black voters (at 33% of all early votes), are counting on turnout on January 5. The elections have attracted a lot of money — Democrats have broken fundraising records, with each candidate raising over $100 million by the end of December (their opponents had each raised between $60 and $70 million). As for campaign themes, Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Perdue have characterised their opponents as radical liberals pushing “socialism” and sought to use this to motivate the Republican base, i.e., U.S. President Donald Trump’s supporters. Interestingly, both candidates support Mr. Trump’s $2,000 cheques to Americans in coronavirus reliefs — a proposal supported by Democrats. The Democrat candidates have run on healthcare, jobs and racial justice themes. What is Trump’s role? Mr. Trump will campaign with Ms. Loeffler (Mr. Perdue is isolating due to exposure to the coronavirus) in Northern Georgia on Monday. However, the focus of Mr. Trump’s concern is not the run-off but trying to overturn the results of the presidential election in the State, which has already been reconfirmed with a recount in November. On Saturday, he had an hour-long call with Georgia’s (Republican) Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, where he appeared to threaten him and his official lawyer saying a “criminal offence” had been committed in delivering these results. “... I just want to find 11,780 votes …,” Mr. Trump said at one point in the call. Mr. Trump called the runoffs “illegal and invalid” in a tweet last Friday, potentially demotivating Republicans from voting on Tuesday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/all-eyes-on-georgia-run-offs/article33497511.ece
05 January 2021||Dubai,||Iran steps up uranium enrichment, seizes tanker||Iran on Monday began enriching uranium up to 20% at an underground facility and seized a South Korean-flagged oil tanker in the crucial Strait of Hormuz, further escalating tensions in West Asia between Tehran and the West. The announcement of enrichment at Fordo came as Iran’s Revolutionary Guards seized MT Hankuk Chemi, alleging the vessel’s “oil pollution” sparked the move. However, hours earlier, Tehran said a South Korean diplomat was expected to visit in the coming days to negotiate the release of billions of dollars in its assets now frozen in Seoul. The dual incidents come amid heightened tensions between Iran and the U.S. in the waning days of President Donald Trump’s term in office. During Mr. Trump’s tenure, the U.S. leader unilaterally withdrew from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018 and set off months of tense episodes that increasingly strained relations between the countries. Iranian state television quoted spokesman Ali Rabiei as saying that President Hassan Rouhani had given the order for the move at the Fordo facility. Iran’s decision to begin enriching to 20% purity a decade ago nearly triggered an Israeli strike targeting its nuclear facilities, tensions that only abated with the 2015 atomic deal. A resumption of 20% enrichment could see that brinksmanship return as that level of purity is only a technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu criticised Iran’s enrichment decision.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/iran-steps-up-uranium-enrichment-seizes-tanker/article33497518.ece

The charge comes as the Afghan government and Taliban are due Tuesday to resume peace talks in Qatar, as both sides seek an end to the long-running conflict. “The Taliban’s campaign of unclaimed attacks and targeted killings of government officials, civil society leaders & journalists must... cease for peace to succeed,” Colonel Sonny Leggett, spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said on Twitter. The Deputy Governor of Kabul province, five journalists, and a prominent election activist have been among those assassinated since November. Afghan officials blame the Taliban for the killings, but the hardline group has denied the charge, while the rival Islamic State group says its fighters were responsible for some of them. Col. Leggett’s statement comes as the Taliban accused U.S. forces of carrying out air strikes against insurgents in Kandahar, Nangarhar and Helmand provinces in recent days. The Taliban said the strikes violated an agreement signed in February that paved the way for the withdrawal of all foreign forces by May 2021. Col. Leggett said the U.S. would continue to defend Afghan forces against Taliban attacks. Violence has surged across Afghanistan, with the Taliban and government forces fighting daily across swathes of rural areas. The Taliban carried out more than 18,000 attacks in 2020, Afghanistan’s spy chief Ahmad Zia Siraj told lawmakers on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/taliban-to-blame-for-spate-of-assassinations-us-military/article33497523.ece

More than 73,000 people in the Chinese capital have received the first dose of the vaccine over the last couple of days, state media reported Sunday, including community workers and bus drivers. Health authorities on New Year’s Eve granted “conditional” approval to a vaccine candidate made by Chinese pharma giant Sinopharm, which the company said had a 79% efficacy rate. An AFP journalist saw people being bussed into a temporary vaccine centre at a central park, after being instructed to fill in electronic forms about their health status and any allergies at an outside gate. Some were wearing two layers of face masks. One man surnamed Gu, a catering worker in his 30s, said his employer had booked him a vaccine appointment at the centre, and that he wanted the jab “for peace of mind.” “I believe any adverse effects will be controllable,” he said. Footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed queues outside local hospitals and community health centres as people waited to read consent forms and have their temperatures taken before getting the jab. China plans to vaccinate millions this winter in the run-up to Lunar New Year in mid-February.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/thousands-vaccinated-in-beijing-against-covid-19/article33497514.ece

05 January 2021||January 05 2021 00:00 IST,||A nod to recognising the value of housework||In the context of the forthcoming State Assembly election in Tamil Nadu, the Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM), led by veteran actor Kamal Haasan, has made an eye-catching election promise that is evidently targeted at a large constituency of voters — women who are full-time homemakers. The party has promised to recognise housework as a salaried profession by paying homemakers ‘hitherto unrecognized and unmonetized’ for their work at home. A recent political entrant in the electoral fray, the MNM’s promise to directly pay women a monthly amount may be viewed as a strategy to grab attention in an over-crowded, highly competitive electoral landscape. Nonetheless, the promise bears close examination as it flags off an important issue and one that has had an interesting, if chequered significance in the history of women’s movements. Origins of the demand The demand for ‘wages for housework’ arose in the context of struggle and consciousness-raising associated with the Second Wave of the women’s movement in North America and Europe. Alongside other demands for social and political equality, women’s rights campaigners made visible and also politicised women’s everyday experience of housework and child care in the ‘private’ realm of the household. In doing this, they challenged the assumption that a ‘natural’ affinity for housework was rooted in the essential nature of women who were performing a ‘labour of love’. For leading women’s rights activists of the 1960s and 1970s, it was important to bust the myth that women’s work at home was a personal service with no links to capitalist production. In a concrete sense, this meant linking the exploitation of the worker in the factory to women’s work at home. As Mariarosa Dalla Costa and Selma James wrote in their seminal piece in 1972 (https://bit.ly/2X6cU3B), the woman working at home produced ‘the living human being — the labourer himself.’ From the nine-month period of gestation in the womb, women’s daily chores of cooking, cleaning, washing, ironing clothes, preparing lunch boxes and so on produced the labour power that was daily consumed in the shop-floor or the assembly line and had to be reproduced afresh every day. By providing free services in the home,women made possible the survival of working-class households at subsistence-level wages, with obvious benefits for industry and capital. Despite the links between the ‘housewife’ and the factory worker, the unwaged status of the former accounted for crucial differences between them. As feminist scholar and writer Silvia Federici wrote (in 1975), in “Wages against housework”, it was possible for wage-earners to bargain around the terms of their paid work and the quantity of the wage. ‘But exploited as you might be, you are not that work’, she pointed out (https://bit.ly/38UShNm). Housework, on the other hand, had come to define the very nature of a woman. This disallowed women from seeing it as ‘real work’ or as a social contract. And,therefore, the women who sought to negotiate housework with their partners were seen as ‘nagging b******’ and not as workers in struggle’. For the advocates of ‘wages for housework’, the wage that the state ought to pay women would make them autonomous of the men on whom they were dependent. More fundamentally, the very demand for a wage was a repudiation of housework as an expression of women’s nature. It was a revolt against the assigned social role of women. Therein lay the radical nature of the demand for wages, not in the money itself. An unresolved issue There was disagreement among the women ideologues of the Second Wave on what payment of a wage would actually mean for women. The sociologist, Ann Oakley, who studied the history of housework in her path-breaking books published in the 1970s, was among those who believed that ‘wages for housework’ would only imprison women further within the household, increase their social isolation and dissuade men from sharing housework. Others too argued that the goal of the women’s movement must be, to not ask for wages, but to free women from the daily drudgery of routine domestic chores and enable them to participate fully in all spheres of social life, including paid employment outside the household. The debate around monetary remuneration for housework remained unresolved within the women’s movement, even as the tools to measure the value that women’s unpaid work adds to national economies have grown more sophisticated. However, the underlying issue, which is the disproportionate share of women’s responsibility for the work that sustains human life and reproduces labour power, remains as pressing as ever. A report published by the International Labour Organization in 2018 (https://bit.ly/2Xbiim1) shows that, globally, women perform 76.2% of total hours of unpaid care work, more than three times as much as men. In Asia and the Pacific, this figure rises to 80%. Defining this constituency To return to the MNM’s election promise, would the payment of a wage by the state to homemakers redress the situation? This raises the tricky question of how this constituency is to be defined. Is it to be only women who are full-time homemakers? Many women earning a wage outside the home also perform the bulk of household work. On what ground are they to be excluded? What about women workers who earn an income from home by stitching clothes, selling cooked meals or are engaged in petty trade? They often self-identify as ‘housewives’ given the meagre and variable wages they earn and periods of seasonal unemployment. These are issues that cannot be easily resolved. It would be better to strengthen the demand for a universal basic income for income-poor households and make sure that the cash transfer to the family reaches women directly, whether or not they combine household work with paid work. Struggle for legislation However, the demand that the state recognise housework is significant and its radical core must not be missed, as the historical experience of the women’s movement shows us. In this context, it is worth mentioning that an important campaign on the question of household labour has been taking place in India. This is the ongoing struggle for national legislation for domestic workers. These are predominantly women who perform ‘women’s work’ but in other people’s homes. They are, therefore, uniquely positioned to make this work visible and demand that its conditions be regulated, minimum wages guaranteed, and the workers’ status and rights protected. The question of how to measure and account for the value of housework has been seriously addressed by women domestic workers and their trade unions in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere. Their demands include an hourly minimum wage, a weekly day-off, an annual bonus and the protection of their bodily autonomy in the workspace. This is an agenda that all parties, and not just the MNM, could incorporate in their election manifestos, should they take seriously the mandate of ‘recognizing and monetizing’ housework. If domestic workers emerge as a strong force that succeeds in asserting the dignity of housework and making it a visible and valued form of labour, this can only be a good thing for all women performing housework in the long run.

05 January 2021||January 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Hasty approval, no transparency||The two COVID-19 vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin — tested and manufactured in India by the Pune-based Serum Institute and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, respectively, could have played a vital role in ending the pandemic in the country. However, the regulator’s haste and lack of transparency in approving the vaccines for “restricted” use do not inspire confidence. The regulator did not wait for sufficient safety and efficacy data to be collected and did not share information about the clinical trials before granting approval. Transparency is vital for gaining people’s trust so that they don’t hesitate to take the vaccine. However, the conduct of the Indian regulator in no way helps in building trust in vaccines. If there is already some degree of apprehension about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, given the rushed manner in which the trials have been conducted, the opaque nature of the approval process has done little to mitigate such concerns. Contrast this with the manner in which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.K. regulator approved COVID-19 vaccines. The FDA had a live telecast of the advisory committee’s examination of Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccine data before granting emergency use authorisation (EUA). It also made the detailed briefing document of the clinical trial of each vaccine and its assessment public. The U.K. regulator also made the assessment of the two vaccines — by Pfizer and AstraZeneca — publicly available. No efficacy data The phase-2/3 trial of Covishield was carried out on 1,600 participants and was intended to study only safety and immunogenicity, as the details available on the clinical trial registry indicate. According to the informed consent document made available to trial participants, safety was to be tested on 1,200 participants and immunogenicity on 400 individuals. The trial did not study the efficacy of the vaccine. Approving Covishield based on safety and immunogenicity data from the trial in India and efficacy data from the U.K. might be sufficient for emergency use. But it is imperative that Serum Institute collects efficacy data from the Indian trial before seeking full approval. Though no published data are available, the U.K. regulator has found some evidence that efficacy improves when the second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine is delayed. Accordingly, it has recommended that the second dose be administered 4-12 weeks after the first. Serum Institute has wasted an opportunity to test the protection offered by the first dose and determine the efficacy of a delayed second dose and the best time to administer it. It is now for the government to decide, without evidence, the timing of the second dose. In the case of Covaxin, the phase-3 trial began in mid-November 2020. Since the second dose is administered 28 days after the first, the median follow-up after the second dose would have been just a few days and that too from a very small number of participants. In short, the approval for “restricted” use granted to Covaxin was not based on any efficacy data. What level of protection is offered by the vaccine and whether it protects against severe disease and prevents infection and transmission are all not known. By giving approval to Covaxin without data on its efficacy, the Indian regulator has joined the ranks of China and Russia. When the Chinese regulator approved CanSino Biologics’s vaccine that had not undergone a phase-3 trial, it at least limited its use for the military. In mid-November, three months after approval, Russia’s claim of 92% efficacy for Sputnik V was based on a review of just 20 COVID-19 cases. Also, the assertion that Covaxin will protect people against the new variant of the virus is not backed by evidence. No efficacy data against any SARS-CoV-2 virus strain are currently available. What makes the approval for Covaxin all the more galling is the explicit permission to administer the vaccine in a “clinical trial mode”. This is nothing but a large-scale phase-3 clinical trial carried out on people belonging to the four priority groups consenting to receive the vaccine. The following remain unknown: how informed the informed consent will be, who is going to inform the recipients about the intricacies of the “trial”, how well the “participants” are going to be monitored, and how the efficacy will be determined in the absence of a control arm. Nine global vaccine manufacturers issued a joint pledge last September that they would not seek premature approval from regulatory authorities. Bharat Biotech’s haste in seeking approval stands in contrast. The Indian regulator had earlier stipulated that at least 50% efficacy is necessary to grant EUA. Compare this with the manner in which the FDA upheld the sanctity of the approval process. Despite pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to make vaccines available before election day, the FDA made it clear that it would require phase-3 data with a “median follow-up duration of at least two months after completion of the full vaccination regimen to assess a vaccine’s benefit-risk profile”. The FDA also said EUA would be granted only “based on data from a phase-3 trial that demonstrates the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in a clear and compelling manner”. A lost opportunity While daily fresh cases and deaths have been increasing sharply in the U.S., the new variant that has been spreading rapidly in the U.K. has been causing havoc. In India, on the other hand, the number of daily fresh cases and deaths has been steadily dropping since mid-September. The companies and the regulator should therefore have taken advantage of the situation here to ensure that EUA is backed by data. Not only has India squandered a great opportunity to collect robust data and build trust in COVID-19 vaccines but has also set the stage to potentially reverse decades of hard work in building vaccine confidence. In 2019, a single mistake in preparing the measles, mumps, and rubella injection that led to the deaths of two infants in Samoa led to a sharp drop in vaccine uptake and a measles outbreak there. In India, a December 2018 study in 121 districts that have higher rates of unimmunised children found that 24% of children did not get vaccinated due to apprehension about adverse effects. If there is vaccine hesitancy among the four high-risk groups which will get vaccinated on priority, the companies and the regulator have themselves to blame. prasad.ravindranath@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/hasty-approval-no-transparency/article33497509.ece
05 January 2021||January 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Quality gigs, a solution to urban unemployment||With the Indian economy gradually finding its feet after a historic contraction of negative 23.9% in the April-June quarter, economic commentators have busied themselves with debating the need for fiscal expansion and the viability of a “V-shaped recovery”. These debates, however, have shifted focus away from the employment question, considered resolved after a sharp rally following the collapse in employment numbers in April. More recent data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (https://bit.ly/3hEnl7Z), however, point to a gradual slowdown in employment recovery from the month of July, with the latest numbers pointing to a sharp rise in the national unemployment rate from 6.51% in November to 9.06% for the month of December. NREGA outlay For labour flocking back to rural India, employment support came in the form of an increased outlay for the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGA), which witnessed a 243% increase in person workdays. This increased dependency on NREGA, has seen the Rural Development Ministry spend nearly 90% of its increased Rs. 86,4000 crore allocation by the month of November, while still being unable to fulfil demands for nearly 13% of the 75 million households that demanded work. In several Indian cities however, shuttered businesses have meant that millions of workers have either had to leave or have had to take up new forms of work, with some finding the burgeoning gig economy to be their only source of employment. It is here that the Fairwork Foundation’s annual review of platform labour gains prominence. The metrics used The report (https://bit.ly/2X5nZSu) evaluates the well-being of gig workers on 11 digital platforms and does so by evaluating them on five metrics of Fair Pay, Fair Conditions, Fair Contracts, Fair Management and Fair Representation. In its findings however, only two firms (Urban Company and Flipkart) score greater than five (out of a maximum of 10) while seven score only 2 or less. Most concerning perhaps, is the fact that the bottom of the rankings are rounded off by India’s four largest platform giants, namely, Uber, Ola, Swiggy and Zomato. With no urban equivalent to the NREGA on the horizon, there must be an increased impetus on evaluating, regulating and supporting new forms of employment that may currently be serving as an informal safety net for those desperately in search of work. The first and most critical task at hand remains evaluation. Our current understanding of gig work and workers remains constrained to the limited disclosures made by the platforms themselves. Furthermore, with very few independent studies evaluating the scale and impact of these platforms, most regulators continue to remain in the dark on basic questions surrounding platform labour. As of now there exists no authoritative estimate on the total number of gig workers in India, though the centralised nature of the platforms, and the larger platform labour market should make the collating of this data relatively straightforward for the Labour Ministry. Issue of regulation The next step is significantly more sensitive and involves regulation. The reason for the sensitivity primarily revolves around the varied nature of gig work. While some workers use these platforms as a “side hustle”, for others it continues to serve as a primary source of employment. This dynamic is further complicated by the risk of a one-size-fits-all regulatory strategy unintentionally hurting the similar, yet distinct, market for highly skilled (and highly paid) freelancers, that continues its rapid growth due to pandemic related full-time staff layoffs. Perhaps a more viable strategy then would involve conditional government partnerships with platforms under some of its flagship schemes. Here, the successful pilot (https://bit.ly/3pMNggC) of Swiggy’s Street Food Vendors programme under the PM SVANidhi, or PM Street Vendor’s Atma Nirbhar Nidhi scheme, may prove to be an illustrative example. While Swiggy has announced the onboarding of 36,000 street food vendors onto the platform under the scheme this month, it has also looked to ensure that each vendor is registered and certified by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. The simultaneous creation of jobs, alongside the voluntary adoption of quality standards is an example of a mutually beneficial partnership between the state and a platform that creates jobs while incentivising greater levels of compliance. Urban employment Similar collaborations on urban employment, that require labour platforms to comply with disclosure norms and worker compensation standards to access government support, could be one way for the government to kill two birds with one stone. Current proposals for an Urban Employment Guarantee peg daily worker wages at approximately Rs. 300 (https://bit.ly/2Mt1moR), at a cost of Rs. 1-lakh crore to the exchequer. Collaborating with platforms to employ workers, would not only bring down costs significantly (for both the state and their partners) but it would also create an environment where firms would be more likely to cooperate with the state, as opposed to adopting an antagonistic position in what could prove to be a long-winded legal battle. Symbiotic ties As the new year rolls in, and India looks to convince the world that it has turned the corner on its economic woes, it must look to step outside the box to tackle the challenge of urban unemployment. Limited fiscal space and a growing need to fuel the country’s consumption base, must push the government to build symbiotic relationships with new partners. With Industry 4.0 platforms absorbing increasing numbers of the urban workforce, evaluation, collaboration, and regulation must be the government mantra. As the pandemic forces India to define its own understanding of the future of work, it falls upon the state to ensure that this future is defined not only by the quantity of jobs it creates but also by the quality of livelihoods they provide for .

05 January 2021||January 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Care is the standard of a vaccine trial||Last year, a study participant sent Serum Institute of India a legal notice after experiencing neurological impairment following administration of Covishield, the COVID-19 vaccine being produced by the company in partnership with AstraZeneca. In response, the company, the largest producer of vaccines in the world, hit back with a threat to counter-sue the study participant in excess of Rs. 100 crore, calling the allegations “malicious and misconceived”. While the recent results of successful vaccine trials are a cause for celebration, these successes ought to be coupled with transparency in information and communication for vaccine production to translate into vaccination. The legal counterclaim and lack of transparency by Serum Institute coupled with silence from AstraZeneca and other stakeholders in this deal fuels the notion that facts are being suppressed. Considering the difficulty of implementing effective non-pharmaceutical interventions, primarily physical distancing and mask use, finding a silver bullet remains the most attractive option to combat COVID-19. However, despite the major contribution of vaccines in eliminating the infectious scourge of our age, the anti-vaccine undercurrent still runs strong. This particular incident only furthers these sentiments. What clinical trials do Clinical trials employ various scientific methodologies to test novel drugs and vaccines on human participants and ascertain whether such drugs are safe and effective against a particular disease. They are probably the most important inventions that help us develop drugs and vaccines against diseases. Furthermore, it is the human subjects who are at the heart of these trials more than the trial investigators or sponsors. It is because of clinical trials that we know now that hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma do not reduce mortality due to COVID-19, and that steroids save the lives of COVID-19 patients. More than being a scientific methodology, clinical trials are a method of human cooperation. The sanctity of this cooperation rests on a tacit understanding of trust; integrity; agreed upon ethical and moral norms; and, most importantly, care and respect for, consent of, and fair compensation to the participants. It is this cooperation that allows trials across countries and ensures that the results of a study in one part of the world can be reasonably applied to other countries. The coercive attempt to falsify a study participant’s claims and intimidate him or her violates the agreed upon rules of clinical trials, jeopardises the whole process, and puts a question mark on the validity of the particular trial. In order to protect human subjects from harm in clinical trials, multiple checks and balances are put in place such as the formation of a data and safety monitoring board, institutional ethics committees, and regulatory bodies for clinical trials such as the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation in India. These same regulatory bodies had failed to protect the rights of HPV vaccine study participants in India in 2007, leading to the death of seven girls in the HPV vaccine study. Maintaining silence While the study sponsor, Serum Institute, which has financial interest in the COVID-19 vaccine, has made multiple statements about the neurological injury to the study participant, these regulatory bodies and committees have remained silent. By doing so, they give the impression that they are not independent and are failing in their duty of ensuring the safety of research participants. It is not only the bodies in India which have maintained a silence, but also other important international stakeholders. AstraZeneca, which has promised not to profit from the vaccine during the pandemic, is the original developer of the vaccine in association with Oxford University. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, leading advocates for all major vaccines across the globe, which had the vision of increasing both accessibility and availability of Covishield by funding and encouraging the U.K. group to set up an advance collaboration with Serum Institute, failed to make a statement. Likewise, it seems Gavi, the vaccine alliance, and the World Health Organization have also chosen to remain silent publicly. The science of vaccines Vaccination as a science has come a long way. We have been able to eradicate smallpox and we are close to eradicating polio simply due to the effective use of vaccines. Millions of lives are saved by the simple act of timely vaccination. However, vaccine hesitancy is on the rise, and diseases like measles and whooping cough are coming back in epidemic proportions as vaccination rates drop. The claims and counterclaims and lack of transparency around Covishield threaten public faith in a life-saving, simple, cost-effective intervention. The reputation or fiscal health of one institution is not worth a setback to the idea of immunisation even if the institution in question is one of the largest suppliers of vaccines across the globe. The very act of developing and testing a vaccine in less than a year since the emergence of COVID-19, a novel viral pathogen, is revolutionary. This has changed the way we look at vaccine science, timelines, and policies. As responsible healthcare providers, we want a vaccine, we want this pandemic to end, and we want to return to a normal life but not at the cost of the safety of study participants. We want a vaccine which is rooted in integrity, transparency, respect for study participants, and agreed upon ethical standards. We urge the regulatory bodies, ethics committees and international stakeholders to not overlook this as a singular event. Ignoring this one event is a slippery slope which may set us back in our fight against COVID-19.

05 January 2021||January 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Embracing energy efficiency||The Power Minister, R.K. Singh, recently announced the Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020. The rules lay down uniform performance standards for power distribution companies (discoms) and make them liable to compensate consumers in case of violations. The well-intentioned rules come at a time when Indian discoms are struggling to manage their finances. This is partly linked to drop in payment rates, as consumers are struggling to pay their bills amid rising consumption and tight finances. The Indian government has sanctioned liquidity relief to help discoms tide over this crisis, but these are just short-term fixes. India’s residential electricity consumption is expected to at least double by 2030. As households buy more electric appliances to satisfy their domestic needs, concerns about the ability of discoms to provide reliable supply at affordable rates will also rise. Embracing energy efficiency can be a win-win solution as this can bring down household energy bills and reduce discoms’ financial stress. Tryst with energy efficiency In recent years, India has seen significant adoption of energy-efficient appliances, especially those covered under the mandatory labelling programme, according to the India Residential Energy Survey conducted by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water and the Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy. The survey, covering nearly 15,000 households across 21 States, found that more than 75% of air-conditioners and 60% of refrigerators used in Indian homes were star-labelled. Further, nearly 90% of Indian homes used LED lamps or tubes. However, there has been limited uptake of energy-efficient ceiling fans and televisions. While 90% of homes use fans, only 3% have efficient fans. Similarly, 60% of our television stock comprises the big old energy-guzzling CRT (cathode ray tube) models. Desert coolers, used by 15% homes, are not even covered under the labelling programme. Significant efficiency gains are also possible for other appliances like water pumps and induction cook stoves. The way forward First, we need to improve the availability and affordability of energy-efficient appliances. For instance, despite a voluntary labelling scheme since 2009, less than 5% of ceiling fans produced in India are star-rated. While the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) plans to bring ceiling fans under mandatory labelling from 2022, the high upfront cost will be another barrier. At present, the most efficient fans cost more than double the price of conventional models. We need innovative business models that can attract manufacturers to produce efficient technology at scale and bring it within purchasing capacity. Second, India needs a nationwide consumer awareness campaign on energy efficiency. Only a fourth of Indian households are currently aware of BEE’s star labels. While awareness levels are high among residents of metros and tier-1 cities, the majority in small towns and rural areas remain unaware. To bridge this divide, we need a decentralised and consumer-centric engagement strategy. State governments, discoms and retailers need to be at the forefront of our renewed efforts to create mass awareness about energy efficiency. Finally, we need to monitor supply quality and changing consumption pattern on a real-time basis. As discoms in India deploy smart meters, these must be used to measure actual savings and demonstrate the benefits of energy-efficient devices to build consumer confidence. The smart metering network would also be crucial for enforcing consumer rights rules. India has tasted success in recent years by embracing energy efficiency. The government’s UJALA scheme transformed the market for LED bulbs, while also helping India reduce its annual carbon emissions by nearly 82 million tonnes. A similar focus towards other energy-efficient appliances would allow India to ensure 24x7 power for all.

05 January 2021||January 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Black and grey||The timing of Pakistan’s arrest of Zaki Ur Rahman Lakhvi, the LeT operations commander, and linked to the 2008 Mumbai attacks, just ahead of the next meet of global watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), has been greeted with scepticism in India. Whenever Pakistan has faced a decision on its “grey list” status, it has carried out similar actions that appear to be aimed more at ensuring a better outcome for itself at the FATF. Its arrest and conviction of Hafiz Saeed and other LeT leaders in terror-financing cases, the passing of anti-terrorism and money laundering laws in the Pakistan Assembly to bring them in line with FATF-mandated international norms, and the publication of new lists of terrorists at various times, all timed before FATF reviews of Pakistan’s status, have been cited as more of the same. The FATF’s Asia Pacific Joint Group is to meet in January to prepare recommendations for a final decision on Pakistan’s status to be presented to the FATF plenary session in February. Pakistan was brought back onto the grey list in June 2018, and given a 27-point action plan list to be completed by October 2019. Since then, it received at least four reprieves, and was judged at last count to have completed 21 of 27 points, with six outstanding. The plenary session can choose one of three options therefore, in keeping Pakistan on the grey list, where it is subject to some financial restrictions, to downgrade it to the black list, where it will face stringent sanctions, or close the review and let Pakistan off the lists altogether. Pakistan will now hope that its progress in the action plan and having key terror figures in prison earn it a reprieve. The fear for India is that if Pakistan earns that reprieve, it can reverse all its actions. India has watched the arrests of all these men and other terrorists on India’s “most wanted” lists in the past, only to find that they are released on bail, or let off over prosecutorial lapses once the world’s gaze is averted. Last month, a Pakistan court’s decision to overturn the conviction of al Qaeda leader Ahmed Omar Sheikh Saeed, a terrorist India was forced to release during the 1999 IC-814 hijacking, for the 2002 murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl, shows how Pakistan’s investigating agencies and judicial system treat terrorism. Hafiz Saeed has been convicted only of terror financing charges and faces concurrent sentencing of about six years at the most, as would Lakhvi, who faces similar charges, despite a long record in transnational terror attacks. Others like Masood Azhar continue to evade any kind of prosecution despite UN sanctions. For India and its battle to have Pakistan’s establishment held accountable on this issue, the FATF grey listing (from 2012-2015 and 2018-now) is a necessary lever to keep that process going.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/black-and-grey/article33497493.ece
05 January 2021||January 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Maximum Governor||The misuse of the Governor’s office to undermine duly elected State governments is a particularly mischievous disruption of federalism. Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan’s frequent use of his powerful oratory to defend the Centre and question the State on sensitive topics makes him partisan and undermines democratic processes. His refusal to convene a special session of the Kerala Assembly on December 23, as initially requested by the government, yet again proved this. He questioned the urgency of the special session, and thought the Assembly lacked “the jurisdiction to offer a solution” to the farmers’ protest, an issue which the Assembly wanted to discuss. This is an encroachment upon the powers of the legislature and the elected government and an abuse of his authority as a nominal head under the Constitution. His conduct was comparable to that of his counterpart in Rajasthan who refused to convene a session of the Assembly in July last year as demanded by the Chief Minister. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to Mr. Khan stating the Governor had no discretionary powers in the matter and that his actions were unconstitutional. This position was supported by the Opposition too. Thankfully, the government made an amended request for convening the session and the Governor accepted it. Mr. Khan had earlier questioned a resolution passed by the Kerala Assembly on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, besides making public statements supporting the CAA and the farm laws. To assume that an Assembly is acting unconstitutionally if it disagrees with Parliament is disingenuous. By lending himself and his office to such partisan conflicts, Mr. Khan is also besmirching his personal reputation as a fiercely fair-minded public figure. Such conduct by a Governor can weaken federalism. In the event, the controversy overshadowed the one-day session on December 31, which sought the repeal of the central laws that are at the heart of the ongoing farmer agitation. A resolution passed with the support of the ruling LDF and the opposition UDF, and unopposed by the lone BJP member, raised procedural and substantive questions related to these laws. The resolution pointed out that agriculture was a State subject and “as a matter that seriously affects the States, the Bills should have been discussed in a meeting of the inter-State council”. The Bills were passed in haste without even referring them to the Standing Committee of the Parliament, which the Assembly termed “a serious matter.” It has become habitual for the Centre to overlook regional concerns, and the making of the farm laws without consulting States was in line with this trend. The Council of States (Rajya Sabha) has been systematically undermined by arbitrarily labelling bills as money bills. The use of central agencies to browbeat Opposition-ruled States is yet another strain on federalism.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/maximum-governor/article33497494.ece

The question referred to a money-lender. “It creates on me,” said the Lord Chief Justice, “an unpleasant impression that it was not in the appellant’s favour that it was put.” Sir Ernest Wild: - I did not intend to be insulting to Jews generally, but Your Lordship knows there are Jews just as there are Christians. Some Jew money-lenders are not people one would care to deal with if possible. The Lord Chief Justice: - My experience is that that remark applies to all money-lenders. (Laughter.) Mr. Justice Darling: - Only the other day in a case I was trying counsel asked a man whether he was not a Scotsman, obviously with the intention of discrediting him. (Laughter.) I took occasion to help him by saying, “Well so am I! (Laughter.)  The Lord Chief Justice: - I don’t think that question was understood in the same way as the question I am referring to. To ask a man if he is a Scotsman does not reflect on him, but there are people who imagine that when the question is asked, “Are you a Jew” it is intended to be prejudicial.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/jews-and-scotsmen/article33497501.ece

Mr. Giri, who was inaugurating the Commonwealth conference of Chief Justices, meeting in India for the first time, referred in particular to the Indian Constitution and said: “A constitution is not intended to be a static document.

05 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Manufacturing sector activity strengthened in December||India’s manufacturing sector activity strengthened in December, with manufacturers stepping up production and input buying amid efforts to rebuild their inventories following business closures earlier in the year, a monthly survey said on Monday. The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’’ Index (PMI) was at 56.4 in December, a tick higher than November’s reading of 56.3. A print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction. “The latest PMI results for the Indian manufacturing sector continued to point to an economy on the mend, as a supportive demand environment and firms’ efforts to rebuild safety stocks underpinned another sharp rise in production,” said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit. “It’s important to emphasise the broad-based nature of the recovery, with marked expansions in both sales and output noted across each of the three monitored sub-sectors,” she said. International demand for Indian goods rose in December, but the growth was hampered by the pandemic. As a result, new export orders rose at the slowest pace in the current four-month sequence of expansion. Output growth also eased to a four-month low, but remained strong. Employment fell again, stretching the current sequence of job shedding to nine months. Input cost inflation accelerated to a 26-month high, with panellists noting increased prices for chemicals, metals, plastics and textiles. Output charges were lifted in response to rising cost burdens.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/manufacturing-sector-activity-strengthened-in-december/article33497490.ece
05 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Faceless tax scheme delivers 24,000 final orders: Pandey||The government’s faceless tax assessment scheme, an attempt to remove individual tax officials’ discretion and potential harassment for income tax payers, has managed to deliver about 24,000 final orders since its introduction in August 2020, Finance Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said. Indicating that the scheme was up and running robustly, Mr. Pandey said that as many as 800 cases have also concluded the faceless appeals process since it was implemented on September 25, 2020. “The system has now stabilised. Even though the last date for passing orders in scrutiny cases is March 31, we have already passed final orders more than 24,000 cases. The faceless appeals systems are now in place and after hearing parties, more than 800 cases have seen orders being passed through the faceless manner,” he said. Responding to concerns of some tax experts that an entirely faceless process for tax assessments and appeals may make it difficult at times to explain nuances of the concerned transactions, the Finance Secretary said that the scheme allows for hearings in certain situations. “The scheme allows for appropriate cases where a certain hearing is necessary, so then after following protocols, a hearing is given. The very fact that more than 24,000 final orders have been passed through the faceless system demonstrates that the system has stabilised,” Mr. Pandey asserted. ‘May miss nuances’ “In the faceless regime, the main objective is to remove physical interaction as much as possible, and hence, the taxpayers may not have the opportunity to explain (in person) business-related complexities and explain various positions they have taken while filing their income-tax returns. These facilities are available in the existing system,” PwC India had noted last month in a report titled ‘Faceless Interface — a paradigm shift in administration of the income tax law’. “A limited facility of video conferencing and telephony is being made available after extensive written submissions are filed with the Income-tax department,” it added, advising taxpayers to ensure that appropriate documents with factual matrix are available and filed, and their written submissions are comprehensive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/faceless-tax-scheme-delivers-24000-final-orders-pandey/article33497485.ece

City manager Pep Guardiola had six players unavailable after positive tests but his team responded in scintillating fashion with goals by Ilkay Gundogan, Phil Foden and Kevin De Bruyne dismantling Chelsea in 16 first-half minutes. After that it felt like damage limitation for a subdued Chelsea side whose season is unravelling alarmingly after a strong start, although substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi did grab a stoppage-time consolation. City’s vintage display lifted it to fifth in the table with 29 points, four behind joint leaders Liverpool and Manchester United having played one game less. Barcelona edged LaLiga’s basement club Huesca 1-0 on Sunday courtesy of a Frenkie de Jong goal made by Lionel Messi in the Argentine’s 500th league appearance for the club. Dutch midfielder De Jong arrived at the far post to meet a Messi cross and score on the volley in the 27th minute to deservedly give the visitors the lead after a rampant start.

Boasting quality Indian players in its ranks, it was HFC’s Halicharan Narzary who sealed the fate of CFC with a brace. The dominant performance also ended HFC’s string of three defeats and helped it jump two places to sixth with a tally of 12 points from nine matches. CFC slipped down a spot to eighth. Swinging into action It was Hyderabad which stamped its authority in the first half, though it had no goals to show for it. However, returning from the break, it found the target twice in quick succession. The first goal was a gift from Chennaiyin. A confusion between defender Eli Sabia and goalkeeper Vishal Kaith saw both rush out to clear a chip by Aridane Santana. Sabia’s poor clearance saw the ball hit the back of Joel Chianese and as it rolled towards the goal, the Australian provided the finishing touch. For the second, Halicharan drilled one onto the crossbar and into the net with a powerful strike after Santana’s shot was saved by Vishal. Thapa strikes Anirudh Thapa provided a ray of hope for Chennaiyin when he cashed in off a blunder by Hyderabad ‘keeper Laxmikant Kattimani. Mohammad Yasir, who was brilliant in midfield, squared the ball to Joao Victor whose side-footed strike from the edge of the box gave no chance to Vishal. Halicharan widened the margin with a solo effort after receiving a through ball from Fran Sandaza near the halfway line.  The result:   Chennaiyin FC 1 (Thapa 67) lost to Hyderabad 4 (Halicharan 53 & 79, Joel 50, Victor 74).

05 January 2021||Chennai,||A left-armer adds teeth and variety to the attack||The Indian team-management has been seeking a left-arm paceman as an option in Test cricket for quite some time now. It called Rajasthan’s Aniket Chowdhary to bowl at the Indian team nets. Aniket was sharp, held promise but was derailed by injuries. Another Rajasthan left-arm pacer Khaleel Ahmed made the Indian limited-over team but lacked the extra pace and sharpness off the pitch to make the transition to Test cricket. The inclusion of T. Natarajan in the Indian Test squad down under is an extension of India’s quest for a left-arm seamer that would make its attack complete. A left-armer adds variety to the line-up. To start with, batsmen seeing the deliveries coming into them from a different angle, find it tougher to settle down.  A left-arm seamer to a right-hand batsman from over the wicket is always a threat. He can angle the ball across the batsman or bring it back into him. Natarajan does possess the ability to shape the sphere into the right-hander to castle him or win a leg-before decision. The point to note here is that when a left-arm seamer releases the ball from over the wicket, he does so from a lot closer to the stumps than the right-arm paceman from round the wicket, exploring the same angle.  This means the left-armer has a very good chance of pitching the ball in line to win leg-before decisions against the right-hander. In contrast, the right-arm paceman operating from round the wicket, tends to land the sphere outside the leg stump, so a leg-before decision could go right out of the window. And a left-arm paceman could be very useful against a southpaw — David Warner is likely to be back for the Sydney Test — since he can get the ball to straighten or move it away a tad from over the wicket or slant it across from round the wicket.  Also, a left-arm paceman operating from round the wicket poses problems to the right-hander since he releases the ball from a wider angle and can angle the ball in to the batsman. And the short-pitched balls from that angle tend to follow the batsman. Natarajan fits the bill. He has 64 wickets from 20 First Class matches and has been the pick of the seamers for Tamil Nadu. He has improved this season, filling out nicely and bowling with greater pace and venom. His yorkers could surprise and consume batsmen even in Tests. And crucially, he would be creating the rough for off-spinner R. Ashwin, who has become a major factor in the series, to exploit. Natarajan does tick the boxes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/a-left-armer-adds-teeth-and-variety-to-the-attack/article33497611.ece
05 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Financial aid from Gopi’s mother||G. Maheshwari, who has been selected for the senior National camp in 3000m steeplechase, was given Rs. 10,000 as pocket allowance by Mrs. Subbaravamma, mother of chief National badminton coach P. Gopi Chand, here on Monday. The amount was disbursed as part of the Gopi Chand Myth Foundation Athletics Project. Maheshwari had set a National record of 10:34.10 in the 35th National junior athletics championships at Guntur last November in the under-20 3,000m steeplechase. SAI athletics coach N. Ramesh, who has been training her, felt that this will serve as a morale-booster for the athlete. “She has the talent, grit, determination and the willingness to keep improving each day,” said Ramesh. “Born in a farmer’s family and hailing from a relatively unknown village (Unikecherla, Mahabubnagar district), Maheshwari has truly come a long way.” It was also revealed that Ramesh will be part of the coaching staff at NIS Patiala for the 4x100m relay squad.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/financial-aid-from-gopis-mother/article33498215.ece
05 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Chess Kerala’s kind gesture||Chess Kerala gifted a computer to differently-abled player K.N. Rajan as part of its initiative to help players and trainers in distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Chess Association Idukki president P.D. Thomas presented it to Rajan at a function held in Kattappana on Monday. Rajan, a FIDE-rated player, had won numerous prizes in various tournaments held in the State, and was one of the players who was hit badly by the pandemic. Chess Kerala president Anilkumar said that former State player K.P. Mohanan from Kannur will be second beneficiary of its benevolent scheme. “There are many players and trainers who are in distress due to the pandemic. But, we selected wo players who were the worst affected during this period. We will be shortly finalising the list of those who will get benefits from our benevolent scheme.” Chess Kerala conducted a series of seven Grand Prix tournaments and a mega final in December 2020 to collect corpus funds for the scheme. Former State player M.B. Muralidhran won the mega final and donated his prize money for the cause.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/chess-keralas-kind-gesture/article33497819.ece

05 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Karnataka hopes to showcase its bench strength||Defending champion Karnataka enters the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy on the back foot, with three key batsmen — Manish Pandey, K.L. Rahul and Mayank Agarwal — missing in action. While regular skipper Pandey is out due to an injury, Rahul and Mayank are away with the India Test team. This puts the onus on the younger players to step up and be counted. The likes of middle-order batsman K.V. Siddharth must share the load — a task he is happy to accept. “It is a lot of responsibility, but their absence is a huge opportunity for us to showcase Karnataka's bench strength,” Siddharth said in a media interaction here. Siddharth is yet to make a mark in the shortest format, having represented Karnataka in only two Twenty20s. The 28-year-old is raring to go, having made a full recovery from a shoulder surgery performed in May last year. “Personally, the lockdown proved to be a blessing in disguise. The break gave me time to do the surgery, rehab and regain my fitness,” Siddharth said. The Karnataka players are currently in a seven-day quarantine ahead of the start of the tournament at Alur grounds here on January 10. “Seven days is a lot of time. We have a program designed — we are following it, and we are being monitored online. That helps us keep in shape. It also gives us time to do some shadow practice and watch videos of our previous matches,” Siddharth said. The side, however, is not short on match practice, having competed in two KSCA inter-club limited overs tournaments in the last couple of months. “I think we are the only state in the country to conduct two tournaments in such a short span of time. “ We must hand it to KSCA for doing such a wonderful job in such testing circumstances. “How much ever we practice, nothing compares to going out there and competing in a match. Since most of us played these tournaments, it has helped us to get into the competition frame of mine ahead of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s. “Most of the IPL players too came back and played the league tournament. The more games we play, the more advantageous it is for us,” Siddharth said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/karnataka-hopes-to-showcase-its-bench-strength/article33497934.ece
05 January 2021||CHENNAI,||Team hotel identified as COVID cluster||A week before the scheduled return of domestic cricket with the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, one of the city hotels where three teams from the Plate Group are staying has been identified as a cluster for COVID-19 by the City Corporation after 20 staff members tested positive. The teams — Manipur, Mizoram and Meghalaya — have been staying at the Leela Palace since Saturday. Crowne Plaza and Novotel are the other two hotels playing hosts for the tournament.  However, despite the cases, things are largely under control and the teams have no plans of changing hotels as of now. Quarantined It is understood that the staff in charge of dealing with the teams and match officials (10 umpires and five match referees) had been quarantined since December 25, before entering the bio-secure bubble. These staff members have already undergone three tests and the teams are staying at a separate wing in the hotel which is inaccessible to the general public. The players and support staff were tested on arrival and underwent another test on Monday, the results of which are awaited. The bio-bubble rules are similar to those in force during the IPL, with only one person occupying a room. The players and support staff will have another test on Thursday before being allowed to train together over the weekend. Chennai is host to eight teams from the Plate Group and the matches will be played at four venues in the city from January 11.  We are monitoring the situation and there is no reason to panic.

05 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||AICF elections: Chauhan faction unseats Raja||Bringing an end to an imbroglio lasting over a year and a half in the All India Chess Federation (AICF), Bharat Singh Chauhan and his supporters trounced outgoing president P. R. Venketrama Raja’s panel 12-3 in the online elections held on Monday. Madras High Court-appointed returning officer K. Kannan announced the results and brought the curtain down on the bitter, closely contested elections. Chauhan gained another term as the secretary by beating his old-time companion Ravindra Dongre 34-29. Narrow win Sanjay Kapoor, who entered the fray for the post of the president at the last minute after switching sides, defeated Raja by the narrowest of margins, 33-31, after all 64 votes were polled. For the post of the treasurer, Naresh Sharma received 34 votes to dethrone Kishor M. Bandekar, who got 30. Riding on the solidarity shown by the North-Eastern states, among other factors, the Chauhan faction won five out of the six posts for vice presidents and four out of the six for joint secretaries. Significantly, in response to an appeal made by Chauhan, on Monday morning, Kannan ensured the voters got an on-screen confirmation of the choices made by them. As a result, the voter can retain the image of the on-screen confirmation for future reference, if needed. Now the results will be submitted by the returning officer to the Madras High Court.  Final results:   President: Sanjay Kapoor.   Vice-presidents: D.P. Anantha, Bhavesh Patel, Vipnesh Bharadwaj, Ajay Ajmera, P.C. Lalianthanga and Niapung Konia.   Secretary: Bharat Singh Chauhan.

05 January 2021||Los Angeles,||Wizards edge Nets by a point in dramatic finish||Thomas Bryant stuffed the go-ahead dunk with 14.9 seconds left and Washington Wizards held on for a 123-122 NBA victory over Brooklyn Nets on Sunday. Bradley Beal led the Wizards with 27 points and 10 rebounds and assisted on Bryant’s decisive basket — which stood up as Nets stars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant both missed on the final possession of the contest. It was a drama-filled finish in Brooklyn, where Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot put Brooklyn ahead 122-121 with a wide-open lay-up with 28.2 seconds remaining. After a time-out, a double-teamed Beal managed to find Bryant under the basket. Irving, who led all scorers with 30 points, missed a three-pointer with less than six seconds remaining. Brooklyn corralled the rebound, but Durant’s last-gasp effort also missed. Bryant scored 21 points and grabbed 14 rebounds for Wizards, who have won two straight after a 0-5 start to the season. In Memphis, reigning champion Los Angeles Lakers notched up its third straight road win, LeBron James scoring 13 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter of a 108-94 victory over Memphis Grizzlies.

05 January 2021||KOLKATA,||Ganguly to be discharged in a day or two||BCCI president and former India captain Sourav Ganguly may be discharged from the hospital in the next one or two days, doctors treating him said on Monday. Ganguly had undergone an angioplasty, following a mild heart attack, on Saturday. Rupali Basu, MD and CEO of Woodland Hospital, said the medical team will sit again, and if Ganguly “is found all right, he may be discharged not tomorrow but day after tomorrow”. Earlier in the day, a board of nine doctors met at the hospital and sought the opinion of experts and cardiac surgeons such as Devi Shetty, R.K. Panda, Samuel Mathew and Aswin Mehta from different cities in India and Shamin K. Sharma from Mount Sinai, New York. BCCI secretary Jay Shah, treasurer Arun Dhumal and former BCCI president Anurag Thakur visited Ganguly on Monday “He has defeated a lot of opponents and seen a lot of highs and lows on the cricket field…he will soon be completely healthy and start his work for cricket through BCCI and CAB,” said Thakur. The members of the board and the experts also had a discussion on whether the two other coronary blockages need to be treated by angioplasty. “The consensus of the board was that deferring the angioplasty for now is deemed to be a safer option since Mr. Ganguly is stable, without any chest pain and is on optimal medical management,” said a statement.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ganguly-to-be-discharged-in-a-day-or-two/article33497609.ece

05 January 2021||January 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Tales of devotion||Sekkizhar, who was inspired to chronicle the lives and times of the 63 Saivite saints known as Nayanmars, had called this monumental Tamil devotional and literary classic “the Tiru Tondar Puranam.” But owing to its inherent grand and great features, this invaluable work that was composed by the grace of the Lord came to be known as Periyapuranam, and this title has come to stay, pointed out Sri R, Narayanan in a discourse. Being an important work of Saiva siddhanta, it was later included as the Twelfth Tirumurai. Sekkizhar lived in the twelfth century and was the minister in the court of the Kulothunga Chozha. He had before him two excellent brief accounts of the 63 Nayanmars. The first was the Tiru Tondar Thogai of Sundara Murthy Nayanar, who had lived around the eighth century and it is held that it was composed on the Lord’s command. It is a concise exposition of the devotion of various mystics, saints, and devotees, from earlier ages up to his time and forms part of the seventh Tirumurai. In the eleventh century, Nambi Andar Nambi elaborated on Sundarar’s hymn and composed the Tiru Tondar Tiruvandadi, a poem of 89 stanzas. Sekkizhar also collected details from available evidence and then composed this exhaustive work on the Saivite saints that is more than mere hagiography. It throbs with the many shades and varieties of Bhakti rasa and with the spirit of service. They hailed from various classes and eked their livelihood in simple ways. But they were true devotees with unshakable faith in Siva, always chanting His name, praying for the welfare of all. They were not attached to worldly attractions and Siva graced each one of them in thrilling ways. These tales of devotion represent the soul’s search for salvation and also inspire the noble values of life.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/tales-of-devotion/article33497596.ece

05 January 2021||January 05 2021 00:00 IST,||It’s showtime||Telugu cinema is hoping to lure the audience back into cinema halls with a bouquet of films for Sankranti in mid-January 2021. The line-up includes Krack, Alludu Adhurs, Red and Bangaru Bullodu . The first few months of 2021 are likely to witness a partially virtual and partially real-time engagement in theatres for movie buffs, depending on whether the pandemic shows signs of ebbing and, of course, the impending vaccination. The spectacle films led by big stars will continue to be around. But also in the works are projects helmed by promising and emerging directors who got noticed for their storytelling methods. A look at what some of these directors are now working on: Sashi Kiran Tikka The director has joined hands again with his Goodachari actor-writer Adivi Sesh for the Hindi-Telugu bilingual Major , to narrate the story of Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan who saved as many lives as he could during the 2008 26/11 attacks. Co-produced by G Mahesh Babu Entertainment (GMB), Sony Pictures and A+S Movies, it is the first non-Mahesh Babu starrer from GMB. Gowtam Tinnanuri He made an impressive debut with Malli Raava (2017) and further established himself with Jersey (2019). Gowtam has now wrapped up the Hindi remake of Jersey , which stars Shahid Kapoor. The story of an ageing cricketer making a last ditch attempt to secure a place in the national team, and thereby fulfil a promise made to his son, hopes to appeal to the national audience this year. Venu Udugula A period drama that’s set in the backdrop of naxalism, Virata Parvam has evoked curiosity. Venu Udugula’s film stars Rana Daggubati, Sai Pallavi, Nandita Das and Priyamani. Udugula will also be producing a web series through which the Telugu literary work, Maidanam by Chalam, will be adapted to the screen. Venkatesh Maha After Care of Kancharapalem and Uma Maheshwara Ugra Roopasya , Venkatesh Maha announced a project titled Su Mathi . But prior to that, Maha is working on another project and is keen to break the pattern of the small town, rural setting of his previous films. Vivek Athreya  Mental Madhilo (2017) and Brochevarevarura (2019)established him as one of the exciting emerging directors in Telugu cinema. His next film is Ante Sundaraniki with Nani and Nazriya. Nag Ashwin The Yevade Subramaniam (2013) and Mahanati (2018) director is working on an ambitious project starring Prabhas and Deepika Padukone. That aside, look out for Jaathi Ratnalu produced by Vyjayanthi Movies and directed by debutant Anudeep, starring Naveen Polishetty, Rahul Ramakrishna and Priyadarshi.

Prasanth Varma The genre bender Awe (2018) and Kalki (2019) later, Prasanth Varma has completed filming Zombie Reddy , which is being projected as Telugu cinema’s first zombie film.

05 January 2021||January 05 2021 00:00 IST,||Before the ‘Great Before’||The story of music teacher Joe Gardner tumbling into the ‘Great Before’ is one that could have gone in any direction. But Soul directors Peter Docter and Kemp Powers have audiences look inward as they accompany Joe on his journey as a blue blob of soul coach 22 about what life’s purpose can mean. Early trademark Disney films featured a formula of a protagonist versus a villain, followed by a fairy tale ending. But Disney Pixar films such as Coco (2017), Onward (2020) and, of course, Soul — streaming now on Disney+ — have switched it up over the years. Is this existential take of storytelling a growing trend for animated films in general? Ahead of Soul ’s global release on Disney+, story supervisor Kristen Lester and story artists Michael Yates and Aphton Corbin tell MetroPlus about the changing appeal of storytelling. “I enjoy stories where the main characters are their worst enemy. To me that’s true to life, in that we are both the heroes and the villains in our own stories,” insists Corbin. Lester adds, as story artists, the key is to always look for something different to do. “When you are making a story about the meaning of life, you don’t necessarily think a villain applies here. At Pixar, we come up with the idea first and see where that takes us. The existential crisis itself was enough for this film!” Power of Kemp Lester, Yates and Corbin reveal that working with co-director Kemp Powers offered a world of nuance in bringing black culture to the screen. “Working with Kemp was a dream; he’s one of my favourite writers, given he’s so easy to talk to and relatable,” says Yates, “He brought so much to the film because he is so similar to Joe. We would talk a lot of music and particularly jazz, which I didn’t know much about. Throughout this film, I learned more through the research process and through having conversations with Kemp. I also learned a lot about the specifics of living in New York.” Corbin adds, “Kemp, when he first came on, did this amazing presentation on jazz from his perspective and experiences. He was a music critic and wrote a lot, and it was great to see what jazz meant to him and I’m grateful he brought that to Soul .” Lester smilingly looks back on having an immediate connection with Powers. “Having a black artiste come in and see a couple of pages of the script he wrote was so cool. It felt like it was all becoming real and made our movie take on a new breath and light. He was easy to collaborate with.” Forming a connection Story artists have a tough job in conceptualising the story in its bare-bone stages. It often entails a lot of back and forth, and stressful brainstorming, so that other departments have something tangible and real to work with moving forward. Naturally, this intimate and under-discussed process of storytelling sees story artists bonding with the characters and their arcs. Lester looks back on Soul with pride, “We are one of the first departments to wrap off the film. Then the movie goes into a whole other life without you as it grows, changes and evolves. In fact, when I was already off the film, I remember watching a scene of Joe walking down the street before falling down the manhole — and it was animated, lit and John Baptiste had composed this amazing music. I was watching this scene and just [makes sobbing noises]. It was so emotional for me!” Corbin adds, “The process of ‘story’ finishes early; it’s strange. It’s like your kids are growing up and you say to everyone else, ‘please take care of them!’ and you’re moving onto something. Then, it’s interesting, out of the corner of your eye, to see clips of the film come to life here and there and you think ‘oh, that’s how that scene looks like!’” Yates concludes, with a laugh, “I agree! We do wonder, ‘Did we teach the kids how to do laundry? Are they going to be okay?’ But then we see the final scenes and say ‘Yes, they are going to be okay!’”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/before-the-great-before/article33497863.ece
05 January 2021||January 05 2021 00:00 IST,||An anthem for equality||Melody meets rap in the new single, ‘One Under the Sun’ which brings together two acclaimed voices in Malayalam indie music — James Thakara, founder of the band Thakara, and Vedan (Hirandas Murali), the Malayalam rapper who shot to fame with his song, ‘Voice of Voiceless’. The song, which was shot in Vathuruthu and Mattancherry in Kochi, addresses discrimination and prejudices in society and reminds that the world belongs to all of us. Besides hitting out at the faults in our system and the injustices that prevail, the verses also talk about the third gender. It calls for the need to change our thoughts so as to progress. Thrissur-based indie singer-composer Akhil Ramachandran has written and composed the song. Akhil, who directed Vedan’s ‘Voice of Voiceless’, says that he always brings his ideology into the songs. Last year, the indie musician released ‘Road Song’, which highlighted the pathetic condition of our roads. Another project was ‘Justice or Just It’ with Vedan, dedicated to two minor siblings from Walayar in Kerala who were allegedly raped and murdered. Akhil says that he wrote the melody portion of ‘One Under the Sun’ after Madhu, a tribal youth, was lynched to death by a mob in Wayanad district of Kerala in February 2018. “The LGBTQ+ community came into the picture once I learnt about their struggles. In fact, until I finished graduation, I couldn’t accept them as part of our society. But after I started travelling and saw a few films about them, my mindset changed,” says Akhil. It was a conscious move to blend melody and rap, he adds. “I felt that melody alone won’t do justice to the idea I want to convey and that’s how rap was incorporated. Vedan has been my childhood friend and I know his music. And ever since I listened to James chettan , it has been a dream to work with him. The fact that they both admire each other’s works made it smooth for me to work on the composition,” he adds. James says that when Akhil contacted him he was excited about combining two styles of music. “Vedan is just terrific. His energy is infectious. I was feeling quite low because of the uncertainty around. But when I met him he just charged me up,” says James.  ‘One Under the Sun’ is available on YouTube.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/an-anthem-for-equality/article33497855.ece
05 January 2021||REWARI,||NH-48 hit as police try to block farmers||More than a 30-km-long stretch of the Delhi-Jaipur Highway (NH-48) passing through Rewari has been left out of bounds for traffic with the Gurugram police setting up barricades at Kapdiwas Chowk here on Monday, a day after the clash between the farmers and the police. Hundreds of big commercial vehicles, including container trucks, are stuck between Kapdiwas and Masani barrage in Rewari for almost 24 hours, though private and light commercial vehicles headed towards Jaipur are being diverted by the Gurugram police towards Bhiwadi at Kapdiwas Chowk. The families staying in Dharuhera Sector 1 are also partially hit because of the blockades. The traffic headed towards Gurugram is forced to travel through villages and take Pataudi Road to reach its destination. Ramesh Kumar, a truck driver at Kapdiwas Chowk, said he had been stuck since Sunday evening and didn’t know how long it might take before the blockade was lifted. Vipin Ojha, another truck driver, said he was not aware of the fresh trouble on the highway and was on his way to Rewari for a repair work in the morning when he hit the blockade at the Kapdiwas Chowk. “At least the police should have warned the heavy commercial vehicles headed towards Jaipur. Many truck drivers were caught unawares,” said Mr. Ojha. Though both carriageways of the Delhi-Jaipur Highway were left blocked at Shahjahanpur border over a week ago, the Rewari Police parked containers and put barricades near Masani barrage in Dharuhera on Sunday evening to prevent around 600 Rajasthan farmers from marching towards Delhi. The supply of essential commodities such as vegetables and milk was also partially hit for thousands of families staying in group housing societies, a housing board colony and along Nandrampur Bass Road in Sector 1 Dharuhera, situated between Kapdiwas Chowk and Masani barrage. Vipul Gardens RWA president Kanwar Singh Yadav said the supply of vegetables and milk to the society shops was affected due to the blockade. “We also had difficulty in garbage disposal. The situation will worsen if the blockade continues,” said Mr. Yadav. He claimed that around 10,000 families in the area were likely to be impacted.  ‘Forced to take leave’ Naresh Kumar, manager, Vatika Developers, said he had to take leave from work since he could not reach his Manesar office. “A large majority of the people staying in this society work at Manesar and Bawal and most of them were forced to take leave. It is even worse then the lockdown. In fact, there is no space even for the emergency vehicles, such as ambulances, to ply,” said Mr. Kumar, a resident of Vipul Gardens. Abhishek Jorwal, Superintendent of Police, Rewari, said the local administration could do little in the present situation, except diverting the traffic.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/nh-48-hit-as-police-try-to-block-farmers/article33497879.ece
05 January 2021||Bhubaneswar,||‘Track social media to check pangolin poaching’||The Odisha Forest department has stressed the need for stricter monitoring of social media platforms to check pangolin poaching and trading. During past few years, instances of pangolin poaching have been reported at regular intervals from different parts of Odisha. The Athagarh Forest Division in Odisha’s Cuttack district had tasted success in pinning down the active gang of pangolin smugglers during November 2019 and subsequently arrested more than 30 members of the organised network from different parts of the State. “Investigations revealed that the accused were trading pangolin and scales online by forming WhatsApp groups in which videos and photos were shared with potential customers, often based outside the country, and details communicated in codes to conceal the transactions,” said Sasmita Lenka, former Divisional Forest Officer of Athagarh, who played a key role in detection of poachers’ networks. Ms. Lenka said “trafficking of live pangolin and its scales is a highly lucrative business for organised mafia, who exploit poor and vulnerable forest dwelling communities for their criminal interests.” She said this was pushing the endangered species into extinction and simultaneously placing these communities at high risk. “While personal contacts and networks of grassroots markets run by middlemen used to facilitate wildlife trade, the cyber revolution has enabled widespread access to digital platforms since the 2000s, and consequently a sizeable chunk of wildlife trade started taking place through social media,” said the senior forest officer.  Videos and pictures Athagarh forest personnel found that it was fairly easy to find videos and pictures of threatened and protected species of animals online. Ms. Lenka blamed chronic field-level manpower shortage for poaching incidents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/track-social-media-to-check-pangolin-poaching/article33497877.ece
05 January 2021||Ghaziabad,||Three held in crematorium case||Three persons were arrested on Monday morning in connection with the crematorium roof collapse case in Ghaziabad’s Muradnagar area. Twenty-five people died and at least 15 were injured when the roof of a gallery at the crematorium collapsed on Sunday. Iraj Raja, Superintendent of Police (Rural), said the Ghaziabad police had arrested the executive officer of the municipality, Niharika Singh, along with junior engineer Chandrapal and supervisor Ashish. He said, contractor Ajay Tyagi was absconding and police teams were conducting raids to nab him. The officials were booked under relevant sections of IPC, including 304 for causing death by negligence on Sunday evening on the complaint of the son of a deceased. Mr. Tyagi was given the contract to renovate the crematorium a year back for Rs. 55 lakh by the Muradnagar municipality through e-tender. The work on the gallery whose roof collapsed on Sunday was completed last month and was inaugurated by the chairman of the municipality Vikas Tewatia only a few days back. CM seeks report Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has asked for a report from divisional commissioner Meerut and ADG Meerut Zone on the incident. Local sources alleged that Mr. Tyagi was part of a bureaucrat-contractor nexus. He lives in the posh Raj Nagar area of the city and was also the president of the Contractor Welfare Association of Ghaziabad. Sources in the administration said Mr. Tyagi’s firms could be blacklisted. Mr. Raja said looking into the alleged nexus is part of the investigation. The Ghaziabad SSP has declared a reward of Rs. 25,000 for providing information about the contractor. On Monday, families of six of the deceased blocked the Delhi-Meerut Highway by putting the bodies on the road leading to massive traffic jams in the area. They were demanding an increase in the compensation amount, a job for the kin and strict action against the guilty. After six hours, Divisional Commissioner and I-G of Meerut reached the spot and agreed to increase the compensation to Rs. 10 lakh. Meanwhile, Samajwadi party chief Akhilesh Yadav criticised the State government for indulging in corrupt practices in construction of even a crematorium.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/three-held-in-crematorium-case/article33497880.ece
05 January 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Hand over sacrilege case diaries to Punjab Police, HC tells CBI||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to hand over all case diaries and papers related to cases of the 2015 sacrilege incidents to the Punjab Police within a month. The High Court’s directions came during a hearing on the plea of one of the accused in the 2015 Faridkot sacrilege incidents, Sukhjinder Singh, challenging the investigation being undertaken by a SIT of the Punjab Police on the ground that the CBI is already seized of the investigation. The High Court rejected Mr. Sukhjinder’s plea and asked the CBI to hand over all relevant documents and material in the sacrilege cases to the Punjab Police. It further directed the Punjab Police to consider the material handed over by the CBI and file a supplementary challan in the case, for consideration by the trial court. The trial court may then send notice to the accused, if thought fit, the court further said. Terming the High Court directions as an endorsement of the State government’s stand on the issue, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said it was high time the CBI listened to the courts and handed the case files back to the State so that the perpetrators of the crimes could be brought to justice. The Chief Minister said his government had been fighting the CBI’s high-handedness for than 2 years, but the agency had failed to heed the various directions and orders of the courts in this time. Asserting his commitment to bring the cases to their logical conclusion, the Chief Minister said the central agency should respect the verdict of the judiciary and stop overreaching the courts at the behest of its political masters. He said the CBI has been scuttling the SIT probe since the State government withdrew its consent for the probe by the Central agency in 2018. The CBI has been persistently refusing to hand the case files back to State, and in September 2019, went so far as to constitute a new investigative team in a clear bid to obstruct the SIT investigation, after having earlier filed a closure report.  Widespread discontent The incidents of sacrilege occurred between June to October 2015 following theft of the sacred Guru Granth Sahib from a Gurudwara in Burj Jawaharsinghwala, Faridkot and discovery of torn pages from the holy book in Bargari and Faridkot. They caused widespread discontent and outrage amongst members of the Sikh community.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hand-over-sacrilege-case-diaries-to-punjab-police-hc-tells-cbi/article33497882.ece
05 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Hunger strike by two protesters at Singhu border enters Day 22||Hunger strike by two protesters entered Day 22 on Monday at the Singhu border. Mahant Jasbir Das Singh, 39, a resident of Mohali, said he has been on a hunger strike since December 13 — his birthday. Mr. Jasbir claimed he has not had a drop of water for over a week and no food for over three weeks, adding that he is regularly checked upon by local health care volunteers at the protest site. Sitting beside him is Randhir Singh, an 85-year-old farmer from Haryana’s Jind who worked as a driver for former Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal. He observes the hunger strike from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and is also being monitored by volunteers. “I have lived my age. I am doing this for my children,” he said. Mr. Jasbir said his father Mahant Sewa Dass Singh had gone on a hunger strike for 44 days in 1973 to demand rights for Punjab following division of Haryana and Punjab. “My Guru Shaheed Darshan Singh Pheruman was on hunger strike for 84 days for the same reason,” he said, adding that the ability to sustain without food or water was in his “blood”. Mr. Jasbir said he drank sips of water for the first 10 days but stopped after Kisan Diwas on December 23. “I am doing this for my farmer brothers and for the country. The government will either repeal the laws or I am ready to become a martyr,” he said, adding that his wife Bhavneet is with him and his mother has sent him here to be a part of the farmers’ struggle. “My Guru and my father had started this. I am only continuing it.” Mr. Jasbir claimed to have lost 16 kg in the last 22 days, and his blood pressure and sugar levels are low. “Doctors from a government hospital came once. Volunteers here have been checking on me daily,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/hunger-strike-by-two-protesters-at-singhu-border-enters-day-22/article33498197.ece
05 January 2021||New Delhi,||Breather for city as rain washes away pollutants||After days of ‘severe’ and ‘very poor’ air quality, Delhi and Noida improved to the ‘moderate’ category and Gurugram to ‘satisfactory’ level on Monday, as rains washed away pollutants, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. The national capital received light rain for the second consecutive day on Monday. Cloud cover The Safdarjung Observatory recorded a minimum temperature of 11.4 degrees Celsius, four notches above normal and the highest in the last 22 days. The maximum temperature settled at 22.6 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. The IMD said moderate rain and thunderstorm are likely on Tuesday too. Earlier in the day, fog lowered visibility to 50 metres at Safdarjung and 150 metres at Palam around 7.30 a.m. “The Air Quality Index (AQI) is likely to improve marginally and stay in the ‘moderate’ to ‘satisfactory’ category on January 5. The AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate and be in the ‘moderate’ to ‘poor category’ on January 6 and 7,” said a statement by the government-run monitoring agency SAFAR. The last time the national capital’s AQI was in the ‘moderate’ category was on December 14. “Rain lashed many places over Delhi region leading to a clean environment. Under the influence of an active western disturbance, a wet spell with widespread precipitation is likely to continue on Tuesday and Wednesday,” SAFAR said. Also, the effect of stubble burning on the city’s air quality remained low on Monday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/breather-for-city-as-rain-washes-away-pollutants/article33498191.ece
05 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Education Minister lays foundation stone for two new schools in JNU||Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Monday laid the foundation stone of Jawaharlal Nehru University’s new School of Engineering and Atal Bihari Vajpayee School of Management and Entrepreneurship. Mr. Pokhriyal at a virtual ceremony said the two new schools will help realise the dream of an “atmanirbhar Bharat”. He added that the introduction of the schools was in accordance with the National Education Policy, 2020, which aims to establish multidisciplinary universities. Only due to HEFA: V-C The university hopes to complete the construction of the academic complex in 18 to 20 months. Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar said the establishment of the two new schools and the construction of the academic complex was possible due to the Higher Education Funding Agency loan. Mr. Kumar said the aim is to take the existing strength that JNU has in the field of social sciences and develop the programmes at the two schools so that they may be different from other MBA and engineering institutes across the country. He added that JNU was looking towards incubating more startups within the campus and applying for more patents.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/education-minister-lays-foundation-stone-for-two-new-schools-in-jnu/article33498201.ece

05 January 2021||Chandigarh,||Cong. hits out at Haryana govt. over pension issue||Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala on Monday accused the BJP-JJP government in Haryana of withholding the annual increase in social security pension for the elderly, widows and destitute, terming it “gross betrayal”. Mr. Surjewala alleged that the State government was denying the increase in January, which would badly hit around 28,87,000 elderly and widow pensioners. He said as per the government figures, there are 17.38 lakh elderly ‘samman’ allowance, 7.40 lakh widow and 1.74 lakh disability pensioners.“We demand that the government should effect an increase of Rs. 500 without any delay,” the Congress leader said. He said the same political parties, who are part of this government, had promised to enhance the pension to Rs. 5,100 in their election manifesto. But the moment they came to power, they started breaching them. “Now they promise an increase of a mere Rs. 250 and that too seems to have been put in the cold storage. An annual increase of Rs. 250 is not acceptable because with this increase the total pension will be only Rs. 3,250 by the end of the term of the present government, which is much below the amount of pension they had promised in their manifesto,” Mr. Surjewala said. He said the economic condition of the people has crumbled due to the wrong policies of the BJP government. “During the pandemic, the people are already compelled to live under economic distress, price rise and ever-rising unemployment,” Mr. Surjewala said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/cong-hits-out-at-haryana-govt-over-pension-issue/article33497875.ece

Mechanical sweeping “It was very shocking that the municipal commissioners of Delhi have no clue regarding the length of roads meant to sweep mechanically under their jurisdiction; how will they ensure a dust-free Delhi?” said Ms. Atishi. The committee has asked all the three municipal corporations to submit action plans for reducing dust pollution. Also, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), under the Delhi government, has been asked to take strict action against individual officers responsible for dust pollution in the city.  “The corporations highlighted that the contracts [for mechanical road sweepers] were based on shifts basis rather than the total area covered by them daily. The committee in this regard was surprised and showed displeasure for not adding length/areas covered as a clause for the contact. It further questioned the lack of a mechanism for checks and balances to achieve efficient output levels,” an official statement said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/civic-commissioners-pulled-up-for-pollution/article33498193.ece
