06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC clears Centre’s plan to build a three times bigger Parliament||The Supreme Court, in a majority judgment, on Tuesday, gave its go-ahead to the multi-crore Central Vista redevelopment project, which proposes to build a new Parliament three times bigger than the existing 93-year-old heritage building and modify the use of 86.1 acres of land, home to India’s power corridor in the national capital. In their majority opinion, Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari said the court cannot order the government to desist from spending money on one project and use it for something else. They said the government did not act against public trust. They brushed aside allegations that the government committed foul play and illegally carved out the Parliament project from the Central Vista project. The majority opinion said the project did not involve any “radical” change in land use. The proposed change in landscape would not limit “recreational spaces” for the public. It dismissed notions that the project was “sui generis” (unique) and deserved a “heightened judicial review”. “The right to development is a basic human right and no organ of the state is expected to become an impediment in the process of development as long as the government proceeds in accordance with law,” Justice Khanwilkar wrote. Justice Sanjeev Khanna, in a separate dissent, upheld the project bid notice, award of consultancy and the order of the Delhi Urban Arts Commission, but concluded that the Centre did not take the public into confidence about the changes proposed for Central Vista, an area, which in post-Independent India, “inspires and connects common people to the citadels of our democracy”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/sc-clears-centres-plan-to-build-a-three-times-bigger-parliament/article33505891.ece
06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Pune hub to track vaccine chain across 41 key cities||A command and control centre set up at the Centre’s aviation cargo wing, AAICLAS, will monitor the movement of COVID-19 vaccines across a network of 41 airports, with Pune — where vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India is located — as the hub. The 41 airports or cities where transportation efforts will be focused include Karnal, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata, each of which has a Government Medical Stores Depot (GMSD) of the Central government’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Once vaccines dispatched by the manufacturers arrive at these four big depots, they will be further distributed across 37 State depots. Thereafter, they will be sent to district depots and finally to the primary health care centres, Secretary of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Rajesh Bhushan, said at a press event on Tuesday. Each of these centres has a temperature tracker, which will upload temperature data on a central server for real time monitoring. The AAICLAS — the Airports Authority of India Cargo Logistics and Allied Services Company Limited — will be the nodal body for co-ordinating air transportation of the vaccines among various stakeholders in the aviation sector. It is in the process of finalising a standard operating protocol “to ensure co-ordination among different supply chain stakeholders for maximising shipping capabilities,” CEO Keku Bomi Gazder told The Hindu . The SOPs focus on ensuring temperature sensitivity and seamless movement of vaccines within the airport.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pune-hub-to-track-vaccine-chain-across-41-key-cities/article33505886.ece
06 January 2021||Madurai,||‘Check adulteration in palm jaggery and palm candy’||The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has sought a response from the State in a public interest litigation petition filed by the president of a Palm Jaggery and Palm Candy Producers Association who has sought a direction to the State to check the adulteration of palm jaggery and palm candy and take necessary action. A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and S. Ananthi ordered notice to the State and sought a response to petition filed by G.T. Chandrasekaran of Udangudi in Thoothukudi district, who sought a direction to the State to check production of palm jaggery and palm candy and ensure that there is no adulteration in the production process. In his petition, he said that some people in Udangudi produce palm jaggery (panakarupatti) and palm candy or misri (panakarkandu) illegally and it has slowly spread out to the entire district. Palm jaggery and palm candy could be produced from April to July every year. However, they produce them throughout the year. Sugarcane products and similar products were mixed in the production. This was taking place at a time when people were preferring traditional and healthy food, he said. There must be a check on such production and check on adulteration, he said. He said that palm tree was the State tree and every part of the tree was useful to the public. The gift of nature should not be allowed to be adulterated, he said. The case was adjourned for further hearing.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/check-adulteration-in-palm-jaggery-and-palm-candy/article33506558.ece

06 January 2021||VIZIANAGARAM/SRIKAKULAM,||Police foil Veerraju’s ‘Ramateertha Yatra’||Bharatiya Janata Party State unit president Somu Veerraju’s arrest at Ramateertham temple in Vizianagaram district on Tuesday led to tension in several parts of Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts. Party activists staged protests at Ranasthalam, Vizianagaram, Gurla, Nellimarla and other places. Many police stations, including Vizianagaram and Gurla, were packed with the arrest of many prominent leaders and activists of the party. BJP State vice-president Pydi Venugopalam, BJP State executive committee members Nadukuditi Eswara Rao, Teegala Harinath, the party senior leaders Attada Ravi Babji, Duppala Ravindrababu, Birlangi Umamaheswara Rao and others were taken into custody for violating Section 30, which was imposed to prevent agitations with regard to the Ramateertham incident. The party leaders raised slogans such as “Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan down down, police down down” and entered into a heated argument with the police personnel over their arrest while allowing TDP and YSRCP leaders to visit Ramateertham hill, where Lord Rama’s idol was desecrated eight days ago. High drama continued in the morning on Tuesday when Mr. Veerraju was scheduled to visit the Ramateertham. With the imposing of Section 30, the police kept almost all leaders under house arrest to foil their bid to proceed on “Ramateertha Yatra”. In spite of curbs and deployment of police forces, Mr. Veerraju reached Ramateertham village, where he was arrested and sent to a private guest house in K.L. Puram of Vizianagaram. In the evening, he was released and made to return to Visakhapatnam amid tight security. Speaking to media at both places, he alleged that the district administration was responsible for the tension since it had allowed visit of former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and Rajya Sabha MP Vijaya Sai Reddy at the same time a couple of days ago. “We planned a peaceful yatra, but the police created many hurdles. It is absolutely unethical since the government allowed TDP and YSRCP leaders to take up yatras. How can it stop us from visiting the temple?” he questioned.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/police-foil-veerrajus-ramateertha-yatra/article33505877.ece
06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||States on alert as fear of bird flu grows||Several States on Tuesday sounded an alert to contain the H5N8 strain of avian influenza, while Kerala began culling of thousands of chickens and ducks. Nearly 2,000 migratory birds were found dead in Himachal Pradesh, while Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh reported deaths of several hundred birds. In Haryana, the “unusual” deaths of four lakh poultry birds have been reported in the past 10 days, but there is no confirmation on whether they died of avian influenza. Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, both neighbouring Kerala, put their Animal Husbandry and Forest Departments on alert as fears of the bird flu spreading grew. In Kerala, after H5N8 was detected among ducks in the Kuttanad region, authorities on Tuesday began culling birds within a 1 km radius of the infected areas. Officials said that rapid response teams had culled more than 21,000 birds, mostly ducks, at Nedumudi, Thakazhi, Pallippad and Karuvatta in Alappuzha district and Neendoor in Kottayam district. Both the districts have been put on alert. Five of the eight samples sent to the National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, following the mass death of ducks last month, tested positive for bird flu. Around 28,000 ducks have perished in the past two weeks in Alappuzha and another 1,700 in Kottayam. The Tamil Nadu government has activated all check posts to prevent the entry of poultry from Kerala into the State. Personnel from the Animal Husbandry Department have been deployed at the border at Puliyarai to stop vehicles carrying chicken, ducks and eggs. The department has advised poultry farms in Namakkal, a major poultry hub, to take precautionary measures. Rajasthan The Rajasthan government sounded an alert and established a State-level control room in Jaipur to monitor the situation after the H5N8 strain of avian influenza was identified by Bhopal’s animal disease laboratory in the samples sent from Jhalawar, Kota and Baran districts. Crows comprised the majority of about 600 birds that have died in the State so far, while other birds included heron and baya weaver, Principal Secretary (Animal Husbandry) Kunji Lal Meena said on Tuesday. Fifteen districts have reported the disease. Himachal Pradesh In Himachal Pradesh, close to 2,000 migratory birds, including endangered species, have died at the Pong dam lake in Kangra district. Confirming the deaths, Kangra Deputy Commissioner Rakesh Prajapati ordered a complete lockdown in the four sub-divisions to check the spread of the disease. Punjab Health Minister B.S. Sidhu said though no case had been reported so far in the State, officials had been put on alert. Madhya Pradesh A total of 155 dead crows in Indore in Madhya Pradesh have been found with the virus, an official said.

06 January 2021||CHENNAI,||Shutters of Chembarambakkam, Red Hills reservoirs opened||With moderate rain set to continue over the city, the shutters of the Chembarambakkam and Red Hills reservoirs were opened on Tuesday to let out surplus water. This marked a rare instance: the floodgates of four reservoirs were opened in January. The Water Resources Department (WRD) initially released 500 cusecs (cubic feet per second) of water from the Chembarambakkam and Red Hills reservoirs that have started receiving floodwater running off their catchment areas.  The discharge went up from the three reservoirs, including Poondi, by the evening as the inflow doubled due to heavy rain. The Chembarambakkam reservoir recorded the highest rainfall of 12 cm until 4 p.m. Those at Poondi and Red Hills received 4 cm and 5 cm respectively. The Cholavaram lake recorded 6 cm. WRD officials said that the level in the Chembarambakkam lake had reached 23.37 ft against the full level of 24 ft. Nearly 3,200 cusecs was let into Adyar river. “The four lakes, including Cholavaram, already have 94% of water against their capacity, and surplus water had to be let out... A flood warning has been issued in areas downstream of the lake and along the Adyar, including Kavanur, Kundrathur and Tiruneermalai. The Adyar may carry up to 6,000 cusecs. This is minimal, compared with its capacity,” said an official. The level had almost touched the full 21.2 feet at the Red Hills lake, and the inflow doubled to 3,082 cusecs by the evening. “We released 1,500 cusecs around 4 p.m. into the surplus course because the reservoir has 3,273 million cubic feet (mcft) against its capacity of 3,300 mcft. A flood warning was issued at Vadakarai, Puzhal, Kosapur and Manali,” the official said. For the first time since 2011, the shutters of the Cholavaram lake were opened to release 350 cusecs as the level was just a foot short of the full level of 18.86 feet. The surplus water from this lake joins the Kosasthalaiyar. Officials said the flood gates of the Poondi reservoir had been opened for two days now as it got water from the catchments upstream. About 2,970 cusecs was discharged into the Kosasthalaiyar, and the quantum was doubled at night owing to a heavy inflow. The waterbody also received Krishna water from Andhra Pradesh. Besides the good monsoon rain, Krishna water was the major reason for the lakes to be full to the brim this year. They had a combined storage of 10,986 mcft, against the total 11,757 mcft, as on Tuesday. On the same day last year, they had just half the present storage, officials noted. “We released 1,500 cusecs around 4 p.m. into the surplus course because the reservoir has 3,273 million cubic feet (mcft) against its capacity of 3,300 mcft.

He alleged that the right wing group members forced them to chant “Jai Shri Ram” and insult Christ. “They said if we don’t say it, they would kill us and started hitting us. Then they called the police,” he said. Women injured At least one of the women, Neha, suffered a fracture in the arm, while Naina, 14, was injured in the leg. Mr. David and four others were handed over to the police. A case was lodged against the five under Sections 3 and 5(1) of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, at the Kotwali police station on the complaint of Ram Lakhan Verma, a city convener of the Bajrang Dal.

06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||India’s recovery bucks global trend: FinMin||While the global economic recovery has been hit by second waves of infections and more stringent lockdowns in several countries, India’s economy is “riding against the COVID-19 wave” with persistent improvements in economic indicators showing a V-shaped recovery, the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday. “The new year has dawned with the approval of long-awaited COVID-19 vaccine and initiation of vaccination drives in various countries. This gives strength to the optimism on both health and economic fronts despite continuing surge in global cases and the potential challenge of a mutant strain,” the Department of Economic Affairs said in its monthly economy review for December. “In the global economy, rise in lockdown stringency following second waves has slowed down recovery, as seen in tapering Purchasing Managers’ Index estimates, decline in port traffic activity, and stagnating commercial flight activity…,” the review noted, contrasting that trend with India’s recovery path. “The effective management of COVID-19 spread despite the festive season and onset of winter season, combined with sustained improvement in high frequency indicators and V-shaped recovery along with easing of lockdown restrictions distinguish Indian economy as one riding against the COVID-wave,” the Ministry said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/indias-recovery-bucks-global-trend-finmin/article33505892.ece

Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy made the observation while hearing a public interest litigation petition which sought for removal of encroachments from a two-acre swamp at Arehalla in Ithalar, a village in the Nilgiris. A government counsel, on instructions, conceded that there were indeed encroachments on the swamp and sought six weeks’ time to remove them. The judges accepted the request and ordered that a compliance report should be filed in court. In his affidavit, K. Ramesh Kumar, the petitioner said Ithalar had about 150 houses.  The residents were basically an agricultural community and a majority of them were small tea growers dependant on natural streams for water supply. After repeated representation to the government authorities, the swamp was identified for fulfilling the water needs of the residents by erecting a well and a pump house. However, now some of the adjacent land owners had encroached upon the swamp, he complained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/ensure-zero-tolerance-towards-encroachment-of-water-bodies-hc/article33506441.ece

06 January 2021||MANGALURU,||PM: LNG pipeline will improve ease of living||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the Kochi–Koottanad–Mangaluru natural gas pipeline would improve the ease of living of people in Karnataka and Kerala. After inaugurating the newly laid pipeline by GAIL India Ltd., through videoconferencing, Mr. Modi said the day marked an important milestone for the two States not just because they were being connected through the pipeline, but also because the exponential changes it could bring about in the normal life of people. Mr. Modi said, “Dedication of the Kochi–Mangaluru natural gas pipeline of GAIL is part of our journey to move towards ‘One nation, one gas grid’. Clean energy is important for a better future. This pipeline will help improve clean energy access.” He said rapid expansion of gas-based economy was a must to achieve self-reliant India and cited this as the reason behind the government’s push for ‘One nation, one gas grid’. Impact on environment Mr. Modi said the pipeline would reduce the expenses of the poor, middle class, and entrepreneurs. He said the pipeline would become the base of the gas distribution system and form the base of the CNG-based transport system in many cities en route. All these would have a direct impact on environment akin to planting of millions of trees, he said. In return, people’s health would improve and their spends on healthcare would reduce, the Prime Minister said. The pipeline construction had created 1.2 million man-days of work and it would continue to generate more and more employment in different sectors, including power, fertilizer, and petrochemical. Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said nearly four lakh houses would get piped natural gas supply for domestic cooking while several industries and the automobiles would get clean fuel through the pipeline. Bengaluru too was getting natural gas after the completion of the Dhabol–Bengaluru pipeline, he said. Stating that his government had kept the electoral promise of ensuring pipeline’s completion, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan added that GAIL had to stop the work in September 2014 following several obstacles. The government ensured all those issues were sorted out, he said. Northern Kerala would witness exponential development with the pipeline, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/pm-lng-pipeline-will-help-improve-ease-of-living/article33506034.ece

During the weekly review on Spandana, a grievance redress programme, on Tuesday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy instructed the police to give a clear message by taking stern action against the accused in these cases. The District Collectors, the Superintendents of Police, and senior officials took part in the programme.  “We are witnessing a new trend of politics in the State. We are seeing ‘guerilla warfare’ on a scale never witnessed in the past. The police usually maintain vigil on anti-social elements, but some anti-social elements are bent on creating religious discord and desecrating idols in temples. The following day, certain media channels start airing the incidents in a big way. The police should act sternly against the accused and instil a sense of fear in those trying to create law and order disturbances in the State. We should also encourage those advocating harmony,” said Mr. Reddy. Stating that such instances were taking place whenever the government launched welfare programmes on a massive scale, he said the Opposition was unable to digest the way in which the government had successfully grounded many welfare schemes. CCTV cameras installed Stating that anti-social elements had gone to the extent of destroying idols in temples, the Chief Minister said, “Now, we will begin to monitor such incidents closely.

06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||U.K. PM Boris Johnson calls off India visit||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has cancelled his visit to India in the last week of January, when he was to be the chief guest at the Republic Day parade. The U.K. Foreign Office said the decision was taken in view of the escalation in the COVID-19 situation. “The Prime Minister spoke to Prime Minister Modi to express his regret that he will be unable to visit India later this month as planned,” a statement from 10 Downing Street said “In light of the national lockdown announced last night and the speed at which the new coronavirus variant is spreading, the Prime Minister said it was important for him to remain in the U.K. so he can focus on the domestic response to the virus,” the statement added. A statement from the Ministry of External Affairs said the two Prime Ministers reviewed the ongoing cooperation between the two countries, especially with regard to countering the pandemic. “Prime Minister expressed his understanding of the exceptional situation in the U.K., and conveyed his best wishes for the quick control of the pandemic spread,” the release stated. U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab had confirmed the visit during a joint press interaction here with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in December. The visit was portrayed as one of the biggest post-Brexit outreach by Mr. Johnson. Both sides had also undertaken preparatory steps for the same. The Foreign Office announced that Alex Ellis, who served till recently as the Deputy National Security Adviser to the Johnson government, would be the new High Commissioner to India.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/amid-rising-infections-in-uk-boris-johnson-cancels-india-visit/article33505888.ece

Mr. Mondal was among a host of other TMC leaders who joined the BJP at Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s rally on December 19. TMC parliamentary party leader Sudip Bandhopadhyay, in a letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla invoked the provisions of para 2 (1) (a) of the 10th schedule of the Constitution and said that Mr. Mondal has voluntarily given up TMC membership. The letter said, “Although, no express resignation has been received from the said respondent, yet the conduct of the respondent in acting and participating in the rally is prejudicial and harmful to the interests of the AITC and it is evident that the respondent has given up membership of AITC.” Mr. Banerjee pointed out that Mr Mondal’s act makes it clear that he is “liable to be disqualified from the membership of Lok Sabha...” This is the first occasion that the State’s ruling party has sought for a disqualification of a party lawmaker. Over half a dozen MLAs of the party have joined the BJP in the past few months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/disqualify-mp-who-joined-bjp-tmc-urges-speaker/article33506125.ece

Inaugurating the 450-km Kochi-Koottanad-Mangaluru LNG (liquified natural gas) pipeline through video conferencing on Tuesday, Mr. Modi said the facility was part of his government’s “one nation-one gas grid” policy. The government has a concrete plan to move towards a gas-based economy that would be cheaper, convenient and environment-friendly, he said. The Prime Minister said the government would make substantial investments in coal and gas sectors. The plan was to increase the share of natural gas in the energy sector from the present 6% to 15% by 2030. Mr. Modi said the government had definite plans for the future to make the country energy-sufficient and reduce expenditure on foreign exchange through diversification of energy requirement. Focus was being given to increase ethanol production so as to increase ethanol content in petrol to 20% from the present 5%. The world’s largest hybrid energy plant (wind and solar) was coming up in Gujarat. The electric mobility sector too was being encouraged. Through these, alternative, cheap and pollution-free fuel and energy would be made available to people, he said. New CNG stations Giving out statistics on efforts to boost alternative energy sector, Mr. Modi said while 15,000 km of LNG pipeline was laid between 1978 (when the first inter-State pipeline was commissioned) and 2014, work on 16,000 km of new pipeline that started in 2014 would be completed in the next four years. As against 900 CNG stations between 1992 and 2014, 1,500 new stations were built thereafter and the numbers would increase to 10,000 soon. As against 25 lakh PNG connections till 2014, 72 lakh PNG connections were given till date. The Kochi-Mangaluru pipeline would provide another 21 lakh PNG connections. Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan, in his introductory address, said the new pipeline would have international importance, wherein the carbon footprint would get substantially reduced. Stating it was a classic example of cooperative federalism, Mr. Pradhan congratulated the Kerala and Karnataka governments for their support. Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, Union Minister for Coal and Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi, Minister of State for External Affairs V.

06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC says ‘no’ to intense judicial review||The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to treat the Central Vista project as a unique one requiring greater or “heightened” judicial review. A majority view of the Supreme Court said the government was “entitled to commit errors or achieve successes” in policy matters without the court’s interference as long as it follows constitutional principles. “Government may examine advantages or disadvantages of a policy at its own end, it may or may not achieve the desired objective. It is not the court’s concern to enquire into the priorities of an elected government. Judicial review is never meant to venture into the mind of the government and thereby examine validity of a decision,” the majority opinion by Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari said. The majority judgment said there was absolutely no legal basis to “heighten” the judicial review by applying a yardstick beyond the statutory scheme, especially when the government itself had accorded no special status to the project. The court said the government had gone through the ordinary route of development projects under law in the Central Vista proposal too. It was up to the government to decide whether or not to accord a unique, or sui generis , status to a project. “Once the government decides to construct a new space for its sitting or to construct a highway or water dam or school or university and follows the procedure prescribed under law commensurate with the nature of project, then the court cannot act as a multiplier of regulations and add its own notion as to what ought to be additional essential procedure for going ahead with a particular project,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-discounts-intense-judicial-review/article33505835.ece
06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘After govt. nod, vaccine can be rolled out in days’||Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on Tuesday that the Ministry was prepared to roll out the vaccine for COVID-19 within 10 days of emergency use authorisation clearance and subject to final approval by the Union government. The announcement comes just days after the Drugs Controller General of India approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech’s indigenous Covaxin for restricted emergency use. Stating that there is no ban on the export of Indian-manufactured COVID-19 vaccines, Mr. Bhushan told presspersons that the CoWIN app, which allows people to register themselves for the vaccine, already had the data of riority groups. He noted that CoWIN offers Aadhaar authentication and SMS services in 12 languages. “This technology is also available for any other country in the world that wants to use it,” he said. Mr. Bhushan said India had four primary vaccine stores called the government medical store depots, under the Medical Stores Organisation, in Karnal, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata and 37 State vaccine stores that branched into district vaccine stores, which were monitored in real time. “The facility is monitored for the number of vaccines stored, and temperature is tracked and updated. We have this facility for over a decade in the country,” he said. Also speaking at the press conference, NITI Aayog member (health) V.K. Paul said that India was trying to get sufficient doses of vaccine to cover its priority group by July. “Work is also on to specify the criteria for vaccinating beneficiaries with co-morbidities. Right now, the idea is to provide maximum coverage and in that case India is lucky that it has several promising vaccine candidates in the pipeline,” he said. Mr. Bhushan said that, at present, 44% of active COVID-19 cases were recovering in hospitals as they had moderate or severe symptoms, while 56% of cases were very mild or asymptomatic and in home isolation. “The number of active cases in the country is less than 2.5 lakh and continues to decline. The positivity rate is at 1.97%,” he said.  The idea is to provide maximum coverage and India is lucky that it has several promising vaccine candidates V.K.

06 January 2021||New Delhi,||Union Budget set to be presented on Feb. 1||The Budget session of Parliament is expected to begin on January 29, government sources said, with the Budget being presented as per schedule on February 1. The decision was taken by the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs or CCPA, but an official announcement has not been made so far. As is the norm, the Budget session will be conducted in two parts. The first phase, beginning on January 29, will conclude on February 15. The second part will run from March 8 to April 8, sources said. Sources have said that at least for part one of the Budget session, all the precautions that were in place during the monsoon session will continue. These restrictions would also mean that the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha will meet alternatively. During the monsoon session, the Rajya Sabha met for four hours in the morning, and post lunch, the same chambers were used for the Lok Sabha, which met for another four hours till the evening. The same arrangement is likely to continue for the Budget session too. The government had cancelled the winter session of Parliament citing a rising number of COVID-19 cases. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi had said in a letter to the Congress’s Lok Sabha leader that all political parties were in favour of scrapping the session to arrest the spread of COVID positive cases. Though Congress Rajya Sabha chief whip Jairam Ramesh and Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien both said the government did not discuss with any Opposition parties before making this decision. The only two sessions of Parliament that have been held during the pandemic — Budget session in March last year and the monsoon session — had to be cut short. The Budget session which was scheduled to have 31 sittings was brought to a close after 23 sittings. The monsoon session which was to have 18 sittings could manage to have only 10 sittings.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/union-budget-set-to-be-presented-on-feb-1/article33505829.ece
06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Pfizer skipped meeting with expert panel thrice, says Health Ministry||Pfizer Inc, whose RNA-based vaccine has been approved in the U.S. and the U.K. and who has applied for approval to market the product in India, has npt yet appeared for a presentation, Rajesh Bhushan, Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, said on Tuesday. “Pfizer has been given three opportunities, but they have not appeared before the subject expert committee, which is willing to listen to their presentation,” he said at the weekly COVID-19 briefing. Pfizer’s vaccine has also been pre-qualified by the World Health Organization and is being made available in several other countries. It employs a technology platform in which a small part of the SARS-CoV-2, called the messenger RNA, that normally gives instructions to cells to make protein, can instruct the body’s cells to make viral proteins that can then trigger an immune response. This can reduce instances of adverse side effects without compromising on the immune system’s ability to launch a protective response that can protect against infection. Like a vaccine made by Moderna, m-rna vaccines have long been a novel technology but there have been challenges in keeping the m-rna stable. “Moderna and Pfizer have shown that this can be done and that’s a great advance,” G. Padmanabhan, molecular biologist and chairman of DBT’s vaccine committtee, told The Hindu . The technology also allows such vaccines to be made relatively quickly compared to the current approaches of culturing virus strain in chicken eggs. However, a relative drawback is it requires extreme sub-zero degree refrigeration that is not available in most of the world, including India. A text message sent to a Pfizer spokesperson elicited no response.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/pfizer-skipped-meeting-with-expert-panel-thrice-says-health-ministry/article33505854.ece
06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Vaccine firms bury the hatchet||Stating the important task in front of them is saving the lives and livelihoods in India and the world, Adar Poonawala, chief executive officer of Serum Institute of India, and Bharat Biotech chairman Krishna Ella on Tuesday issued a joint statement on behalf of the two companies communicating their combined intent to develop, manufacture and supply the COVID-19 vaccines for India and globally. The statement that follows a series of cross-statements made by them in the past two days said: “Vaccines are a global public health good and have the power to save lives and accelerate the return to economic normalcy at the earliest.” They said now that the two vaccines had been issued EUA (emergency use authorisation) in India, the focus was on manufacturing, supply and distribution so that populations that needed them the most received high quality, safe and efficacious vaccines. “Both our companies are fully engaged in this activity and consider it our duty to the nation and the world at large to ensure a smooth roll-out of vaccines. Each of our companies continue their COVID-19 vaccines development activities as planned,” the statement said. They said they are fully aware of the importance of the vaccines for people and countries alike. “We hereby communicate our joint pledge to provide global access for our COVID-19 vaccines.” The joint statement follows a tweet by Mr. Poonawala on Tuesday afternoon: “I would like to clarify two matters; as there is confusion in the public domain, exports of vaccines are permitted to all countries and a joint public statement clearing up any recent miscommunication with regards to Bharat Biotech will be made.” Mr. Ella on Monday lashed out at those criticising the fast-track emergency use authorisation to Covaxin and statements made by other manufacturers in India. The Progressive Medicos and Scientists Forum, a national association of doctors and scientists, on Tuesday said they suspected that clearance granted to the vaccines by the DCGI shows that profit and political gains had taken precedence over science. In a statement, the group said India was quick to criticise China and Russia for emergency approvals without efficacy data but failed to exercise diligence when its turn arrived.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vaccine-firms-bury-the-hatchet/article33505858.ece
06 January 2021||Kochi,||NIA chargesheets 20 in gold smuggling case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday submitted the chargesheet before the NIA Special Court, Kochi, in the diplomatic channel gold smuggling case, leaving out Sandeep Nair from the list of accused. Sandeep Nair is the fourth accused in the case. The chargesheet lists 20 persons, including P.S. Sarith, Swapna Suresh and K.T. Ramees, as accused. Sandeep may have turned approver in the case. The NIA has invoked Sections 16, 17, 18, and 20 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) against the accused. While Section 16 deals with punishment for terrorist activities, Section 17 deals with punishment for raising funds for terrorist act and Section 18, punishment for conspiracy. Section 20 deals with the punishment for being a member of a terrorist organisation. Terror activities Earlier, the agency had contended that the accused might have used the proceeds of gold smuggling for terrorist activities or funding terrorism. It had also stated before the NIA court that some of the accused might have established links with underworld gangs operating from Tanzania and illegally brought gold from there to India. The agency also submitted before the court that it suspected that some of the accused had ties with the criminal gang led by Dawood Ibrahim. It was on July 10 last year that the NIA booked the case against Sarith, Swapna, Faisal Fareed, Sandeep Nair and others following the seizure of around 30 kg of gold by Customs officials at the Thiruvananthapuram international airport. The case was that gold was smuggled into the country as diplomatic cargo addressed to the Charge D’Affairs at the Consulate General of the United Arab Emirates, Thiruvananthapuram. The agency has arraigned 31 persons who, it said, “conspired and financed gold smuggling besides facilitating the disposal of the contraband and transferring the proceeds thereof to the UAE through hawala channels, for purchasing and smuggling more gold, with the intention of threatening the economic security of India.” Eight persons are absconding. The NIA case is that the accused had knowingly conspired, raised funds and smuggled 167 kg of gold from the UAE through import cargo addressed to diplomats at the Consulate General of the UAE in Thiruvananthapuram. It also contends that the key accused had planned to smuggle more gold from countries such as Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/nia-chargesheets-20-in-gold-smuggling-case/article33505809.ece
06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Mutation threat swung it for Covaxin?||The threat from a ‘mutated’ coronavirus appears to have overnight helped the Bharat Biotech secure an emergency use permission for Covaxin, a perusal of meeting records show. From December 30 to January 2 that saw three marathon meetings, the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the Drug Controller General of India, that evaluates applications by vaccine companies for approval, changed its stance from insisting on efficacy data — that establishes proof of protection of the Covaxin — to approving it for emergency use under “clinical trial mode”, without the data it had been insisting on at least since December 9. The minutes of the meeting of the SEC, made public on Tuesday, show that the committee had on December 30 directed the company to provide updated “safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data” from its ongoing Phase-3 trial. It was scheduled as a placebo-controlled trial involving about 25,800 volunteers across the country where some get the actual vaccine and some don’t. The next meeting on Thursday, when the SEC approved the Serum Institute’s Covishield vaccine, the committee does not appear to have considered additional data. It relied on safety and immunogenicity data as well as data on “severe adverse events” from the ongoing Phase 3 (without specifying how many). This data was furnished on December 30 too, and again the committee recommended that the Bharat Biotech “expedite the recruitment and perform an interim efficacy analysis for further consideration of restricted emergency use approval”. Just a day later, at another meeting of the committee on January 2, the company presented “further updated data [it isn’t mentioned what] and requested that their proposal be considered in the “wake of incidence of new mutated coronavirus infection”. Trial mode Here the committee accorded its approval, though specifying that this be done only in clinical trial mode. Balram Bhargava, Director General, ICMR — a partner in the Covaxin project — said at a press briefing on Tuesday the clinical trial mode implied that there would be no placebo shots. Everyone eligible would be given the actual vaccine and would be followed up for reports on adverse events, like in a trial. The All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN) said in a statement, “We are perplexed at the abrupt change in thinking of the SEC from the first two meetings to the third day on which approval was recommended while apparently discounting the need for efficacy data.” Krishna Ella, chairman, Bharat Biotech, said on Monday the Phase-3 trial would continue and efficacy data would be available in March. He said a scientific publication from his company was coming within a week on the Covaxin strain’s response to mutated SARS CoV-2. ICMR scientist Samiran Panda had told The Hindu earlier that a whole inactivated virus was likely to confer protection against a wider range of strains as more parts of its were exposed to the immune system likely making it more sensitive. However, other scientists say in the absence of efficacy data there was no evidence to believe that this was the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mutation-threat-swung-it-for-covaxin/article33505852.ece
06 January 2021||New Delhi,||Tractor rally around Delhi put off due to bad weather||Protesting farmer unions have decided to postpone their tractor rally on the outskirts of Delhi to January 7, when thousands will march along the eastern and western expressways surrounding the capital. The rally was initially scheduled to be held on Wednesday, but has been deferred due to a poor weather forecast. Delhi has been lashed with rain several times over the last few days. “The tractor rally will take place in all the four corners of Delhi. This will be the trailer for the tractor parade planned for Republic Day within Delhi,” said Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav, addressing a press conference after consultations between the Punjab farm unions and the wider coordination team of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha. He explained that the rally, beginning at 11 a.m, would touch all the major protest sites, at Singhu, Tikri, Shahjahanpur, Palwal and Ghazipur.

06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||U.S., India cooperated on LAC action, says Juster||The U.S. has cooperated with India to counter “aggressive” Chinese actions at the Line of Actual Control, its Ambassador, Kenneth Juster, confirmed on Tuesday, saying it was for the Indian government to give details of the nature of military cooperation during the ongoing eight-month stand-off between the Indian Army and the People’s Liberation Army. “Our close coordination has been important as India confronts, perhaps on a sustained basis, aggressive Chinese activity on its border,” said Mr. Juster in a farewell address at the end of his tenure in Delhi to an audience including diplomats and journalists, at an event organised by think tank ORF. Mr. Juster said the Government of India would decide whether to release the details of the cooperation. Data assistance While this is the first time an official is confirming the cooperation over the stand-off, The Hindu had reported earlier that over the past few months, the U.S. has assisted India with geospatial data, satellite maps and emergency procurement of extreme weather clothing. Officially, India has maintained that it is resolving the situation with China “bilaterally and diplomatically”. The U.S. Ambassador refused to comment on a specific question on whether the U.S. had alerted India to China amassing troops along the border earlier this year, when the PLA is believed to have transgressed over the LAC and claimed Indian territory. “I appreciate the question and the interest in the internal discussions on China, but it’s not really something I’m at liberty to get into here. If the Government of India wants to comment on that, that’s for the Government of India. Suffice it to say that we have cooperated,” Mr. Juster said. In an hour-long talk titled “Ambition and achievement in the U.S.-India partnership” detailing developments in the bilateral relationship from 2017, Mr. Juster said “no bilateral relationship in the world is as broad, complex and rich in substance as that of the United States and India”. He said bilateral defence and strategic cooperation had been particularly focused on the Indo-Pacific region during the Trump administration, where the U.S. military renamed its Pacific command Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) and the Ministry of External Affairs established a new Indo-Pacific Division. Shared vision “We both share a vision of the Indo-Pacific region that provides opportunities for all countries to grow and prosper, but also wants to avoid incursions of any type, intimidations, predatory financing and when there is a situation that is indicative along those lines, we’ve cooperated to try to resist that,” he said, in a veiled reference to Chinese actions at the LAC, the South China Sea and debt from Belt and Road Initiative projects. While he declined to comment on whether the U.S. would proceed with CAATSA sanctions against India for its purchase of the Russian S-400 missile systems, the U.S. Ambassador said India should consider the impact of such purchases that constrain “technology transfers” and other defence cooperation between India and the U.S.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/us-india-cooperated-on-lac-action-says-juster/article33505848.ece
06 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||Airborne transmission of coronavirus possible indoors, says study||Airborne COVID-19 infection is definitely possible under certain conditions. Chances of picking up SARS-CoV-2 or the novel coronavirus from air is directly related to the number of positive cases in the room, their symptomatic status and duration of the exposure as proved in closed-room experiments conducted in three hospitals each in Hyderabad and Mohali (Punjab) by CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) and CSIR-Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTech). In closed-room experiments, where one or more COVID-19 patients spent a short duration of time, one sample — collected immediately after the departure of three symptomatic patients from the room — was positive. The study, published in the preprint server medRxiv ( yet to be peer reviewed), recommends demarcation of hospital areas into COVID and non-COVID areas to prevent cross infections. But for asymptomatic cases, they showed the virus does not spread farther from them when they are seated in a room without perceived air flow due to a fan or AC. An air sampler was used to collect the virus particles, and then looked for their presence using RT-PCR. “We have analysed 64 air samples collected from COVID and non-COVID areas of various hospitals and 17 samples from closed rooms occupied by COVID patients. Four samples from COVID care areas were positive for SARS-CoV-2 with no obvious predilection towards ICU/non-ICU areas,” informed CCMB Director Rakesh Mishra on Tuesday. The study shows early detection and isolation of positive individuals helps in preventing infection of other family members in a home setting too. Viral particles could be detected in air especially in closed rooms where COVID-positive individuals had spent longer periods, even after two hours of their exit from the room and at distances greater than two meters as well. Social vaccines key “Till vaccines are available, social vaccine like wearing mask is the best prevention,” said IMTech director Sanjeev Khosla. “These findings show the coronavirus can stay in air for some time. But they also strengthen the importance of preventive guidelines like regular handwashing, using masks effectively and preventing symptomatic people from public mixing. Then, we can start getting back to normalcy more comfortably,” said Dr. Mishra. Considering the increased public mobility and interactions, wearing a mask in public should be made mandatory as it significantly decreases the viral load released by an infected individual. Spread of the pandemic, to a large extent, has been due to people having unprotected verbal interaction from close quarters with asymptomatic COVID-positive individuals. Risk of transmission is very low if both the affected and unaffected persons wear masks, he pointed out. Social distancing is a must, and a distance of three feet at least, if not six feet, should be maintained. Spending more time in closed spaces can be risky even if social distancing is maintained as the virus can stay longer in poorly-ventilated rooms. Hence, it is also advisable to avoid going to others’ homes considering that the risk of contracting the disease in home environments is likely to be higher. His advice is to conduct larger gatherings in open and well-ventilated spaces as it carries less risk of infection. Exposure to a COVID-positive individual for a short duration (less than 30 minutes) when adequate precautions are being taken does not significantly increase the risk of contracting the disease. Short travel safer The institute advisory is that short duration travel in metros/ local trains or buses is likely to be safe and for longer travel, the journey may be broken into parts to mitigate the risk. Masks should be used when using public toilets as flushing has potential to generate aerosols which can stay longer in air and the virus is known to be excreted in stool. If possible, the toilet should be reused only after half an hour or more of last usage while hand hygiene is a must. Within offices, texting and e-mailing should be encouraged even if sitting next to each other in the same room instead of face-to-face interactions.  The findings also strengthen the importance of preventive guidelines like regular handwashing, using masks effectively and preventing symptomatic people from public mixing.

06 January 2021||LUCKNOW,||5 booked for U.P. prayer event||David, a pastor from Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu, recalls with horror January 3, when Bajrang Dal workers allegedly stormed the premises of a marriage lawn in Shahjahanpur where he and a small group of local people, including women and children, were holding a prayer service to mark the first Sunday of the New Year. “They beat us with lathis while dragging us on the street, where they also made us squat in the murga (rooster) position [corporal stress position in which a person holds their ears through the legs],” Mr. David told The Hindu . Mr. David alleged that the right-wing group members forced them to chant “Jai Shri Ram” and insult Jesus. “They said if we don’t say it, they would kill us and started hitting us. And then they called the police,” he said. At least one of the women, Neha, suffered a fracture in the arm, while Naina, 14, was injured in the leg. Mr. David and four others were handed over to the police. A case was then lodged against the five under Sections 3 and 5 (1) of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, at the Kotwali police station on the complaint of Ram Lakhan Verma, a city convener of the Bajrang Dal. In his complaint, Mr. Verma said that on January 3, at 10 a.m. when he reached the premises he found that 10-15 persons, including women and children, were attending a satsang (prayer meeting ) . Apart from Mr. David, who is from Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu, his associate Jagan, who had come to visit him from Kanniyakumari, and three local persons — Rajat and Ajay, who are Dalits, and Shyamji Gupta, on whose property in a residential colony the event was going on — were named in the FIR. However, talking to The Hindu , Mr. Verma alleged that the group led by Mr. David had been holding programmes for religious conversion for the past two years, and he attended at least four such events to “expose” them.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/5-booked-for-up-prayer-event/article33505837.ece
06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||‘Army well poised to counter PLA’||Unilateral and provocative actions by the Chinese to change the status quo by force, in more than one area on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), were responded to by the Army “in a firm and non-escalatory way,” ensuring the sanctity of our claims in Eastern Ladakh, the Defence Ministry has said. The Army, it stated, was “well-entrenched” to counter any “misadventure” by the Chinese forces. “Indian Army has maintained all protocols and agreements between the two countries while the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) escalated the situation by utilisation of unorthodox weapons and amassing large number of troops,” the Ministry said in its annual report. “India categorically conveyed to China that any attempt to unilaterally alter the status quo at the border is unacceptable and that India is determined to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” it stated. Winter preparations The report said Advance Winter Stocking (AWS) and winter preparations for the enhanced strength had been completed and troops were “well entrenched to counter any misadventure” by the Chinese forces. “While the Indian Army is prepared for any eventuality, talks are also progressing to resolve the issue in an amicable manner,” it stated. On the Army’s response, the report said that the Army, with assistance from the Indian Air Force (IAF), mobilised troops, including “accretionary forces”, in a very short duration including heavy equipment like guns and tanks, as also ammunition, rations and clothing. Galwan clash On the violent clash in Galwan which saw the first combat fatalities in over five decades, the Ministry said 20 soldiers lost their lives while preventing PLA troops from ingressing into Indian territory. “The Chinese also suffered significant casualties,” it said. Later, on August 28 and 29 last year, Indian troops, in a “precautionary deployment, pre-empted Chinese expansionist designs and occupied heights” along the southern bank of Pangong Tso, the report said adding, “Braving inclement weather, own troops continue to be deployed on these heights.” Eight rounds of Corps Commander level talks, in addition to diplomatic talks, have so far failed to reach any breakthrough in disengagement and de-escalation along the LAC.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/army-well-poised-to-counter-pla/article33505850.ece
06 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Why were over 700 U.K. passengers not tested for COVID-19, asks HC||The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday asked the State government to clarify why over 700 of the total 3,062 passengers who arrived to the State from the United Kingdom were not subjected to an RT-PCR test for COVID-19. The court sought this clarification as the government’s data on passengers who arrived from the U.K. since December 7 showed that only 2,292 were subjected to RT-PCT test, while 3,062 had landed here. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar passed the order in this regard while hearing PIL petitions related to issues that have cropped up owing to the lockdown and COVID-19 health management. The government data also showed that 75 passengers who arrived from the U.K. were yet to be traced. Also, the data showed that 19 of the returnees and 14 of their primary contacts had tested positive for COVID-19. Nine passengers and one of their primary contacts have tested positive for the new strain of the virus. Fined The government also told the court that a total fine of Rs. 29,520 had been imposed on seven private laboratories for delayed uploading of RT-PCR test results on the Indian Council of Medical Research portal, in violation of the guideline stipulating the declaration of test results within 24 to 48 hours. Also, the government informed the court that 25% of the reimbursement amount — about Rs. 9 crore — claimed by private laboratories had been withheld following discrepancies in the maintenance of records. The government also stated that in 24 instances of excess billing, action had been initiated against private hospitals designated for treating COVID-19 patients.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/why-were-over-700-uk-passengers-not-tested-for-covid-19-asks-hc/article33505803.ece
06 January 2021||Hyderabad,||Rs. 8,000 crore estimated to have been circulated through loan apps||Investigation into unearthing the money trail in app-based loan companies has revealed that Rs. 8,000 crore was circulated through these apps. A leading Chinese web hosting company, owned by an e-commerce pioneer, appears to have provided hosting services to app-based loan companies, which are in the eye of the storm, following at least five persons in Telanganna being pushed to end their life. The financial experts and data analysts who were poring through 1.40 crore transactions involving nearly Rs. 21,000 crore have estimated that the actually circulated amount was Rs. 8,000 crore. “This could be much higher if all the companies behind the loan apps were tracked, a task which is underway,” said a police officer associated with the investigation of the case. He said that multiple transactions involving the same loan account were squared off. The police are also probing if these transactions were meant only for loan disbursement and repayment or if there were any other reasons, including money circulation or hawala. “This is just the volume of transactions provided by the Razorpay gateway pertaining to only a few firms. We have asked Paytm and other e-wallet companies to provide the transactions through their gateway,” the investigator said. Further he said that the recovery call centres in Hyderabad, Gurugram, Bengaluru, Pune and other places in the country used the Voice-over Internet Protocols (VoIP) instead of a regular phone line to call or threaten the borrowers. The companies made spoofing calls to the borrowers to deliberately send false information to change the caller ID. “At a call centre in Bengaluru, we found call routing boxes with prepaid SIM cards loaded, which was used to call the customers and harass them for recovery,” the officer said, adding that the centre heads used WeChat and other applications to communicate with their ‘Chinese bosses’. Lambo erased data Arrested Chinese national, Zhu Wei alias Lambo, who headed the overall operations of the four loan app firms in India, is reported to have deleted all the data pertaining the companies operations stored in his personal laptop. However, the Hyderabad Cyber Crime police seized his laptop and have retrieved the entire data and mirrored it. So far, they have seized over 1,600 laptops and desktops in connection with the cases. “We will lift the corporate veil,” the officer said, adding that efforts are on to unmask the real promoters.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/rs-8000-crore-estimated-to-have-been-circulated-through-loan-apps/article33506505.ece

Despite objections from within the BJP and Opposition Congress, the full funds allocated to four major departments by the Social Welfare Department this financial year may end up being utilised for this purpose. A sum of Rs. 5,170 crore was sought to be diverted to works other than SC/ST welfare citing a “deemed expenditure” clause. From its allocation of Rs. 26,614.69 crore in the 2020-21 budget, the Social Welfare Department has sub allocated Rs. 5,170 crore for welfare of SCs/STs in these four departments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bid-to-dip-into-scst-sub-plan-fund-to-pay-bills/article33506181.ece
06 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Mullappally was aware of tactical alliance: WPI||The Welfare Party of India (WPI) on Tuesday appeared to wade into the swirl of post-local poll factional politics in the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC). WPI State president Hameed Vaniyambalam said he had kept KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran in the loop about the WPI-Congress electoral understanding in the local body elections contrary to his denials. The WPI is the political arm of the Jamaat-e-Islami. United Democratic Front (UDF) convener M.M. Hassan had allegedly found himself increasingly isolated within the Congress for the tie-up. Several leaders felt that the optics of Mr. Hassan huddled up with the Jamaat-e-Islami Amir M.I. Abdul Aziz during the campaign phase had driven Hindu and Christian voters away from the UDF in South and Central Kerala. Mr. Vaniyambalam appeared to defend Mr. Hassan by stating that the tactical alliance had helped the UDF wrest 35 wards from the Left Democratic Front. Mr. Ramachandran was aware that the WPI-Congress understanding that extended to more than 100 constituencies.  The Congress’s lacklustre performance at the hustings was more due to Mr. Ramachandran’s leadership failure than because of the electoral pact with the WPI. After the UDF’s dismal performance in the local body polls, Sathyadeepam , a leading Catholic weekly published by the Archdiocese of Ernakulam-Angamaly, said the alliance with WPI was ultimately self-defeating. Soon, Yoganadam , the mouthpiece of the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam, echoed a similar sentiment. The issue had prompted the All India Congress Committee (AICC) to send emissaries to speak to Christian leaders and Hindu social organisations to make amends in the run-up to the Assembly elections in May. AICC general secretary in charge of Kerala, Tariq Anwar, met Mar Baselios Cleemis, Major Archbishop of the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, at the party’s behest. More such meetings with other community leaders were in the offing. CPI(M) flayed Mr. Vaniyambalam said the CPI(M) had attempted to demonise the WPI to polarise the electorate into rival religious factions. The party had forgotten it had benefited from the alliance with the WPI in the local body polls in 2015. Now, the CPI(M) sought to vilify the WPI to stir up prejudice against Muslims. Its averments seemed to embellish the Islamophobic political narrative of the BJP, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mullappally-was-aware-of-tactical-alliance-wpi/article33506184.ece
06 January 2021||Bengaluru,||Ordinance on cow slaughter promulgated||The Karnataka government on Tuesday promulgated the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Ordinance, 2020, to ban slaughter of cows. It also bans slaughter of bulls of all ages and buffaloes aged below 13. The Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, 2020, was passed in the Assembly during the winter session, but was not cleared in the Legislative Council. Therefore, the government issued a gazette notification promulgating the Ordinance. The new law will not stop slaughter of buffaloes aged above 13. Hence, slaughterhouses could continue to operate, and there will not be a blanket ban on beef. The new law makes provisions for stricter implementation of rules regarding transportation of cattle, seizure of vehicles and imposition of penalty, and operation of slaughterhouses. Under new the law, no person can transport any cattle from any place within the State or outside the State for slaughter. Only after obtaining permission from competent authority, can cattle be allowed for transportation for agricultural or animal husbandry purposes. As per the new law, for which Governor Vajubhai R. Vala has given his assent, slaughter of cows would be a cognisable offence and would attract three to seven years of imprisonment and a fine ranging from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 5 lakh. Repeat offenders will have to pay a fine of up to Rs. 10 lakh and face a jail term of seven years. The law envisages establishment of ‘Gau Shala’ for the protection and preservation of cattle, registered with the Department of Animal Husbandry and Fisheries under the State or Central law.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ordinance-banning-cow-slaughter-promulgated/article33506032.ece

He said the Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT) and the petrochemicals complex coming up close to the Kochi refinery of the BPCL would benefit from the availability of natural gas. He was addressing the gathering on the dedication of the 450-km natural gas pipeline to the nation via teleconferencing. The gas pipeline has been in the making for a long time. The project had come almost to a standstill in September 2014. Since then the government had made all efforts to reactivate the project through concerted efforts and through the participation of the people, Mr. Vijayan said. Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan, in his address, congratulated and thanked the Chief Minister for the support in the completion of the project through Kerala. He called the completion of the pipeline project an example of cooperative federalism. The gas pipeline, starting at the LNG terminal in Kochi, goes through Ernakulam district (16 km), Thrissur (78 km), Palakkad (105 km), Malappuram (58 km), Kozhikode (80 km), Kannur (83 km), and Kasaragod (83 km) before reaching Mangaluru. The gas pipeline project has been progressing in different phases. The domestic gas supply in Kochi and surrounding areas has been active since 2013 when the nearly 50-km pipeline was completed for supply of gas to industrial units such as FACT.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/it-will-give-an-impetus-to-industrialisation-pinarayi/article33505810.ece

He quashed the land change notification and referred the project back to the Heritage Conservation Committee to ensure better public participation. He said the “access of the common people to the green and other areas in the Central Vista would be curtailed/restricted”. Justice Khanna also disagreed with the majority view and set aside the environmental clearance given by the Ministry to the Parliament building project. “The public should be provided not only with information about the draft scheme but also an outline of realistic alternatives and indication of main reasons for the authority’s adoption of the draft scheme,” Justice Khanna noted. Justice Khanwilkar, however, maintained there was nothing “clandestine” about the project. He said a personal communication was sent to all the 1,292 objectors. The proposal was placed before the parliamentary committee, chaired by the Lok Sabha Speaker and constituting MPs of major national political parties, at the inception stage itself. The Lok Sabha Secretariat had approved the budget estimate and concept plan. The various facets of the project under challenge in court included the change in land use in the Central Vista under the Delhi Development Act, 1957, the permissions and approvals granted by the Central Vista Committee, the Delhi Urban Arts Commission (DUAC) and the clearance/no-objection under the Environment Protection Act, 1986.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-clears-centres-plan-for-a-bigger-parliament/article33505815.ece

As part of the fifth-phase of the ‘Unlock’ strategy that came into effect on Tuesday, traditional (artistic) performances will be permitted as part of religious festivals with restricted participation. Cultural programmes and artistic performances will be permitted in both indoor and outdoor venues with participation restricted to those with passes or tickets. However, small-scale artistic performances such as street plays can be permitted without passes or tickets. Nonetheless, COVID-19 protocols must be strictly adhered to during such programmes. The maximum number of people who can be permitted for religious festivals, cultural programmes and artistic performances will be restricted to 100 persons for indoor venues and 200 persons for outdoor venues. The functioning of movie theatres will be permitted with up to 50% occupancy based on tickets or passes. To enforce physical distancing, alternate seats must be ensured as vacant by physical marking to ensure no two persons sat on adjoining seats. Exhibition halls will be permitted to function only for business-to-business purposes and not for the public. Swimming pools Training of sports persons in swimming pools can be resumed, provided those concerned disinfected the facilities regularly to avoid a possible spread of infection. Hostels meant for students belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes will also be permitted to function in view of the resumption of classes for students of Classes 10 and 12.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/curbs-on-recreational-events-eased-in-kerala/article33505819.ece

In his dissent of 179 pages, Justice Khanna said the “indirect participation of the citizens is critical to democracy”. Unlike the majority opinion by Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari, which berated the petitioners’ enthusiasm to question policy matters through public interest petitions, Justice Khanna said contesting a government decision in a constitutional court is also one form of “public participation”. But litigation post the decision is not as efficacious as a full-fledged public participation before the decision-making stage. “Citizens approach elected representatives and through them express their views both in favour and against proposed legislations and policy measures... Vested interests can be checked. Difficult, yet beneficial, decisions can be implemented,” Justice Khanna wrote. Justice Khanna said it is just not right to ignore government's failure to provide “intelligible and adequate disclosure to fulfil the requirement of public participation” in the decision-making process for the Central Vista project. “The historic and iconic nature of the Central Vista is too apparent to even consider any counter argument,” Justice Khanna observed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/objections-to-project-not-considered-by-govt/article33505822.ece

06 January 2021||GUWAHATI,||AGP says Cong., AIUDF ruined community bonds||A month after sounding its poll bugle from areas inhabited by indigenous communities in eastern Assam, the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) on Tuesday took its ‘national unity conclave’ to the minority-dominated Barpeta district. The AGP, one of the two allies of the BJP in Assam, tore into the Congress and the minority-based All-India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) for driving a wedge between different communities in the State. “Barpeta is Assam’s Satra Nagari [town of Vaishnav monastery] and it has a history. People from various faiths have always shared a bond of love and friendship here, but the divisive Congress and AIUDF are trying to destroy it for political mileage,” AGP president Atul Bora said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/agp-says-cong-aiudf-ruined-community-bonds/article33505856.ece

06 January 2021||Ghaziabad,||Custody of alleged PFI members extended||A Mathura court on Monday extended the judicial custody of four alleged members of Popular Front of India (PFI) who were arrested on October 5, 2019, when they were on their way to meet the Hathras gang rape and murder victim. Atiq ur Rehman, Masood Ahmed, Alam and Siddique Kappan were booked under several sections of the IPC, including of sedition, sections 17, 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, and 65/72 of the IT Act. Rejecting their default bail application under section 167 (2) of CrPC on their completing 90 days in custody, Additional District and Sessions Judge Anil Kumar Pandey accepted the plea of the prosecution lawyer and extended the investigation period from 90 to 180 days. Citing the application of U.P. Special Task Force, Mr. Pandey said the prosecution wanted more time to deliberate on the sensitive material found in the laptop and mobiles of the accused and to question them on their links with members of SIMI and PFI. He said if the court was satisfied with the report of the public prosecutor, the period of the investigation could be increased from 90 to 180 days under section 43D (2) of UAPA, 1967. The STF said it would also interrogate Campus Front of India secretary K.A. Rauf Sherif who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case and is lodged in Kakkanad district jail. The information gathered from him would be verified with the four men. ‘Not satisfied’ Defence lawyer Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi told The Hindu they were not satisfied with the order as “our objections on jurisdiction of court, empowerment of STF and legal position of prosecutor have not been discussed therein. Neither is the compelling necessity to extend the limit mentioned in it”. He said they would challenge the order in the Allahabad High Court. “The entire proceeding is going beyond the law,” he argued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/custody-of-alleged-pfi-members-extended/article33506465.ece
06 January 2021||Kochi,||Don’t treat first-time offender as criminal: Kerala HC||The Kerala High Court on Tuesday observed that a first-time offender in a theft case need not be sent to jail in all situations in view of the provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure(Cr.PC), but society should change the first-time offenders by reforming them. Justice P.V. Kunhikrishnan, while setting aside the conviction of Abdul Rahoof of Majeri who stabbed two persons for calling him thief, took exception to the last line of the famous poem Moshanam by the late K. Ayyappa Paniker that exhorted for changing the law which brands a person who “steal something good” as thief. The judge observed that the court did not want to contradict the great poet because poetry was the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings. It took its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity. “But with great respect to the poet, I have to say” that the concluding portion of the poem is not entirely correct in the light of Section 360(3) of the Cr.PC (court’s power to release an offender involved in trivial offences after admonition) and Section 3 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958. The court observed that “the criminal justice delivery system can attain its ultimate aim only with the help of society. To err is human. If a person committed some small mistakes, Section 360 of the Cr.PC and Section 3 of the Probation of Offenders Act will protect that person. But society should also protect him by not treating him as a criminal or thief”. The court noted that the prosecution case was that the persons whom he attacked had blamed the accused by spreading a rumour that he was a thief. The accused wanted to remove the label of thief from his name. He met them for clearing this nickname. But instead of discussing the issue, they provoked the accused by characterising him as a thief. In that situation, the incident in this case happened. The court while setting aside the sentence of three-year imprisonment awarded by the Manjeri Additional Sessions Court observed that the accused was entitled to the benefit of doubt.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dont-treat-first-time-offender-as-criminal-kerala-hc/article33506182.ece

06 January 2021||Kolkata,||West Bengal Minister quits Trinamool||West Bengal Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports and former Indian cricketer Laxmi Ratan Shukla on Tuesday resigned from the Trinamool Congress. Mr. Shukla, the Howrah North MLA, wrote to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee about his decision. The former Indian cricketer will remain an MLA till the term of the Assembly expires. Ms. Banerjee, who accepted the resignation, said the Minister wanted to retire from politics to concentrate on his sports activities. “Laxmi is a good boy. He has written in his letter that he wants to retire from politics to concentrate on his sports...I want him to do well and we wish him well. There is no misunderstanding on the matter,” she said speaking to journalists. The Chief Minister said she has urged Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to accept the resignation. Later, Mr. Dhankhar in a press statement said he had accepted the resignation and Aroop Biswas would be in charge of departments held by Mr. Shukla. The development comes as yet another set back and major embarrassment for the Trinamool Congress which is grappling with a series of defections and the resignation of Minister Suvendu Adhikari who joined BJP last month. In a cricketing analogy, the State BJP leadership said that with elections approaching, the Trinamool Congress was losing its wickets at regular intervals and added the party was willing to provide Mr. Shukla a platform if he wants to continue with politics.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/west-bengal-minister-quits-trinamool/article33505839.ece

06 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Several areas inundated in city||The Greater Chennai Corporation has identified 24 locations with severe water stagnation in 15 zones of the city after heavy rain on Tuesday. Civic officials visited the localities to drain out water and assess the situation in each of the 24 locations. Residents started sharing photos on social media about inundation of houses in areas such as AGS Colony Fifth Main Road. “South Regional Deputy Commissioner Alby John Varghese and engineers visited ward 177 and ward 178 after residents of 24 streets in AGS Colony in Velachery reported water stagnation. Water level was 2 to 3 ft high,” said Geetha Ganesh, secretary of the AGS Colony Residents' Welfare Association (ACRWA)-Velachery West. “Corporation zonal-level and stormwater drain officials had to start pumping out water but because of high levels in Veerangal Odai, it is time GCC takes this into account and diverts water for easy and faster flow,” said Ms. Ganesh. Residents of Andal Nagar Extension First Street and Sabari Nagar reported water stagnation. After reaching home in the evening on Tuesday, many complained that water had not drained. “It seems the present Corporation efforts for flood mitigation are just not enough. I have been living in Velachery since 2003 but the situation has worsened in the past seven to 10 years,” said Anand Mishra, a resident. Traffic hit Traffic near Ripon Buildings was disrupted in the evening because of water stagnation on Poonamallee High Road, near Vepery. Frequent reports of complaints from residents were received from roads such as Prakasam Salai and Davidson Street in Royapuram zone. There were reports of water stagnation in north Chennai areas such as Kargil Nagar and Kathivakkam High Road.

06 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Student battles for provisional certificate||For more than a year, a student who completed M.A. (Economics) from the Madurai Kamaraj University was not issued course completion certificate and provisional certificate by the authorities despite finishing all formalities. After repeated attempts to get the certificates failed, the student, Pawan Kumar of Kaithal district in Haryana, filed a petition under the Right to Information Act, 2005, seeking copies of the course completion certificate and the provisional certificate. Not satisfied with the replies of the Public Information Officer/Assistant Registrar and the First Appellate Authority, the petitioner filed an appeal to the Tamil Nadu Information Commission. While the contention of the PIO was that the certificates were not issued since the applicant had not paid the prescribed fee, the student said that he paid the fee through Demand Draft (DD).  Mysterious transaction Though the DD was accepted by the authorities, the amount was not credited in the account of the university. This was not communicated to the petitioner despite his petitions under the RTI Act. When the appeal was taken up via telephonic enquiry, in view of the COVID-19 safety protocol, the PIO stated that he had sent a letter to the petitioner regarding the issue and asked him to send the credit details of the DD. “It is impossible for the petitioner to get the details because the said transaction was made from one bank to another bank. Hence, the letter sent to the petitioner, after one year of RTI petition, by the Public Authority is irrelevant,” State Information Commissioner S. Muthuraj said. Directing the student to pay the fee once again to get his certificate immediately, the SIC said the Commission had the power to direct the university to award compensation to the petitioner under Section 19(8)(b) of the RTI Act, 2005, for the loss suffered by him. Mr. Muthuraj also directed the PIO of the Directorate of Distance Education, Madurai Kamaraj University, to send an explanation within 15 days as to why disciplinary action should not be recommended under Section 20(2) of the RTI Act, 2005, against him for not providing information to the petitioner.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/student-battles-for-provisional-certificate/article33505982.ece

06 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai records highest rain for a day in Jan.||The sudden downpour on Tuesday left many roads inundated in Chennai and brought significant inflows into waterbodies. The city recorded the highest quantum of rainfall on a single day in January since 1915. While the northeast monsoon extending to January is not uncommon in Chennai, what came as a surprise was the intensity of rain lashing the city and neighbouring districts since Monday night. Officials of the India Meteorological Department attributed it to an easterly trough over north Tamil Nadu. Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam recorded 6 cm and 5 cm of rainfall respectively for 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday. However, by 6.30 p.m., the two stations had recorded 8 cm and 10 cm rain respectively. Many other places, such as Taramani, received 12 cm, West Tambaram 10 cm and Poonamallee 7 cm. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said the slow-moving easterly trough, which is laden with moisture, could bring such heavy rain during January too. Chennai received 21 cm of rain on January 15, 1915. “We have instances when Chennai (Nungambakkam) recorded close to 7 cm of rain in one day like in 1955, 1986 and 1995. Tuesday’s rain could surpass those records and could be second highest in the century,” Mr. Balachandran said. However, rain over Chennai could begin to decrease from Wednesday and moderate showers may occur in some areas. Wet weather over the State may continue till January 12, he said. The Meteorological Department has forecast that heavy rain may continue in one or two places in districts including the Nilgiris, Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, Mayiladuthurai and Villupuram on Wednesday and some parts of southern districts on January 9. Many interior areas are likely to have light to moderate rain on Wednesday. Senior meteorologist Y.E.A. Raj said there had been instances of good rain over Chennai in January associated with the spilling over of the northeast monsoon. “But we are getting a heavy rain spell after a long gap since 2004. Nungambakkkam recorded cumulative rain of 5 cm on January 27 and 28, 2004. In January 1995, the weather station received 17 cm between January 13 and January 18. The weather station in Meenambakkam saw such heavy rain previously during January in 2002 and 2008 with 8 cm of rain,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-records-highest-rain-for-a-day-in-january/article33505974.ece
06 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Cardiac rehabilitation helps man become fitter||Nearly 20 months after he suffered a heart attack and underwent angioplasty, 52-year-old R. Satyamurthy completed a 42 km full marathon in the city on Sunday. Cardiac rehabilitation helped the Vellore resident’s life return to normalcy and take up physical activities he had not attempted before. After undergoing angioplasty in April 2019 at the Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore, Mr. Satyamurthy joined the hospital’s cardiac rehabilitation services. “The common assumption is that post-angioplasty, patients may experience difficulty in walking. My friends and relatives said I should not ride a two-wheeler and should not speak much. But it was actually the opposite. I slowly took to walking and running. In fact, prior to this, I wasn’t very athletic. I managed to complete the target activities in seven to eight months,” Mr. Satyamurthy said. Till date, he has taken part in nine to 10 marathon events. In the 2020 Chennai marathon, he was part of the team from the CMC cardiac rehab group and participated in the 21 km category. On Sunday, he took part in the 2021 Chennai marathon and completed a 42 km full marathon, according to a press release. “First of all, cardiac rehabilitation takes away the fear of getting back to normalcy as early as possible. It has also been shown to improve the functioning (ejection fraction) of the heart on a long-term basis. Functional capacity improves with structured rehabilitation programmes,” said Oommen K. George, professor and head, Cardiology, CMC. The cardiac rehabilitation programme was started in December 2017. “Our cardiac rehabilitation is built on new evidence that if we start a physician-supervised exercise programme as early as possible, potential for recovery is very high,” said Muralidhar Babi, cardiac rehabilitation medicine specialist, CMC. Post rehabilitation, the patients become part of a running club and actively run together on a daily basis, he said. CMC’s cardiac rehabilitation team consists of physicians, physiotherapists, nurses, nutritionists and counsellors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cardiac-rehabilitation-helps-man-become-fitter/article33505972.ece

Though he spent his entire life in Thiruvananthapuram and studied Malayalam in school, Mr. Madhavan came under the influence of the Dravidian movement and his stories were published in the Pongal special issues of magazines run by leaders of the movement. “In those days, senior leaders including Anna, Kalaignar, Kannadasan and Nedunchezhian wrote in Murasoli . My name also figured without fail,” he had said in an interview. Mr. Madhavan was attracted to social reformist ideas of the Dravidian movement. He told The Hindu on the occasion of winning the award that he would have joined politics if he were in Tamil Nadu. He was a voracious reader even though he had to quit school because of his family’s financial condition and was forced to work in a shop. “It was the last phase of Second World War. After collecting hot ‘katti choru’ (rice packets) from a temple in Valiya Salai, I would rush to school. By the time the first period would have been over. My class teacher Viswanatha Iyer would ask jocularly and with concern about the number of ‘kattis’ I had received,” Mr. Madhavan had recalled his school days in his interview to writer Jeyamohan. His literary career began as a translator. He translated works of great writers across the world and in India. “My translations were enough to publish a volume,” he had said. Mr. Madhavan ran a small shop, Selvi Stores, in Salai in Thiruvananthapuram and the life incidents played out on the street found expression in his writings. “Few writers have captured the darker side of human beings as Madhavan did. He would shock his readers with the portrayal of lust, lying in the subconscious mind of humans,” said Vasanthakumar of Tamizhini , who had published the works of Madhavan. The Sahitya Akademi conferred the award for his collected prose writings Ilakkiya Chuvadukal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sahitya-akademi-winner-a-madhavan-passes-away/article33506439.ece
06 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Timely action helped control pandemic, says Harsh Vardhan||The COVID-19 pandemic had derailed years of painstaking efforts, but timely action helped control the disease from spreading, said Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday. Strategic thinking, aggressive campaigns, deep commitment from doctors and other frontline workers were needed in this connection, he added. In his virtual convocation address at Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (SRIHER), the Minister said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been regularly interacting with the Chief Ministers of all the States and the Union Territories, besides stakeholders, for effective management of the pandemic. The Centre had also taken up vaccination programme in a big way, besides promoting telemedicine. As many as 23 States used eSanjeevani, through which 11 lakh teleconsultations had been conducted. He said Ayushman Bharat had been launched to create 1.5 lakh health and wellness centres. Around 10.74 crore underprivileged and vulnerable families had been identified for a health cover of Rs. 5 lakh per family annually for treatment in secondary and tertiary care hospitals, Dr. Vardhan said. The Centre had increased the bed strength from nine to 40 per 10,000. It had also made efforts to improve the doctor-patient ratio by increasing the number of medical colleges, he added. At present, 10% of people in the country were covered under health insurance schemes, he said. As many as 75 district hospitals had been converted into medical colleges and 14 of them in Tamil Nadu alone, he pointed out. The Central government had increased the number of AIIMS from six to 22, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/timely-action-helped-control-pandemic-says-harsh-vardhan/article33506559.ece
06 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Govt. orders full verification of vaccination points||Like the dry run for COVID-19 vaccination that was held at 17 sites in five districts, all Collectors have been asked to form teams for inspection of vaccination points to assess the requirements and deficiencies, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said on Tuesday. “Through officials of the Health Department, an inspection of vaccination points — whether it is a mini-clinic or primary health centre or separate building — should be conducted. The facility should have three rooms. We have ordered 100% verification, similar to that of polling booths. The Collectors have formed teams...,” he told reporters after an inspection of the State Vaccine Centre’s cold storage facility here. There are 2,880 secondary cold storage points, which should be checked for their cold storage capacity and availability of generators. Cold storage boxes to take the vaccine to remote areas should be readied, he said. Mr. Radhakrishnan said the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine was taking urgent measures for the vaccination. “Our role is that of planning and preparation. The State Vaccine Centre’s cold storage facility has a capacity of 1.17 crore doses. Apart from this, we have readied 51 cold chain points through the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation to preserve more than 2.5 crore doses,” he said. The State has an adequate stock of syringes and needles. The Health Secretary said the report of the dry run was submitted to the Centre. Healthcare workers would receive the vaccine in the first phase, and the number of front-line workers would be more as the category included employees of local bodies and the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and also teachers in places like Chennai. On the COVID-19 clusters detected at hotels, he said there was no need to panic. “Among the persons whom we screened, the positivity rate is less than 2.7%. We have tested 8,449 samples since December 15. Till now, we have received the results of 4,611 samples. A total of 166 persons have tested positive since December 15. Today, we have five to six positive patients,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/govt-orders-full-verification-of-vaccination-points/article33505908.ece
06 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||DMK moves HC again over Pongal gift issue||The DMK on Tuesday complained to the Madras High Court that AIADMK functionaries had put up flex boards and other publicity materials at ration shops to create an impression that the government’s Pongal cash gift of Rs. 2,500 to all rice cardholders was being distributed at their behest. Appearing before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, senior counsel P. Wilson, representing the DMK, said the AIADMK cadre were actually soliciting votes in favour of their party by utilising the cash gift given to people from the public exchequer. He said the party had already filed a case seeking distribution of the cash gifts after ensuring that the tokens do not contain the AIADMK flag’s colours and photographs of the Chief Minister, the Deputy Chief Minister, other Ministers and party office-bearers. Thereafter, the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation and the Registrar of Cooperative Societies issued circulars directing ration shop employees to accept only official tokens. Hence, the court disposed of the writ petition on Monday. Now, the ruling party cadre had come up with ‘ingenious’ methods of overcoming the circulars. This had led to a fresh cause of action, he said and sought permission to move a fresh writ petition. The Bench accepted his plea and asked him to put the government pleader on advance notice.  AIADMK publicity materials are displayed in and around ration shops||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/dmk-moves-hc-again/article33505970.ece
06 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chennai eye hospital continues relief work||Even as the daily tally of COVID-19 positive cases in the State continues to drop, some organisations that started outreach services during the pandemic have not yet wound up their work. Rajan Eye Care Hospital and Chennai Vision Charitable Trust continues to reach out to poor and less privileged families across the State, in a bid to enable them to tide over the pandemic-induced crises. The organisations initiated a Covid Slum Relief Project in May last year and provided relief material to slum dwellers in and around Chennai. In November and December, the organisation covered around 25,000 families in 95 slums in the city. The areas covered include Mambalam, Kodambakkam, Taramani, Besant Nagar, Avadi, Thiruporur, K.K. Nagar, Thoraipakkam, Kotturpuram, Iyyapanthangal, Alandur, Guindy, Velachery and Teynampet. Mohan Rajan, chairman of Rajan Eye Care, said the project had won appreciation from all. The organisations distributed goggles, sanitisers, N-95 masks and face shields to 2,000 police personnel. Masks, including N-95 variety, and sanitisers were distributed at the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology and Government Eye Hospital, besides the Institute of Child Health and Corporation dispensaries. As many as 4,000 nitrile gloves were distributed at the government hospital in Namakkal. Rice, wheat and bread were distributed to sanitary workers. “The project is supported by donors and well-wishers. We plan to cover 300 slums in the next couple of months, covering 75,000 families,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chennai-eye-hospital-continues-relief-work/article33506428.ece
06 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Chinese gang procured 2,000 SIM cards with false identities||The Chinese gang that was involved in operating online loan apps had also procured 2,000 SIM cards using fake Indian identity papers, sources said. The sleuths of the Central Crime Branch intensified their probe into the alleged links of the arrested Chinese nationals with Indians. After searching for the suspects for nearly 20 days, the special team busted a call centre run by two Indian nationals in Bengaluru, who claimed to be the directors of the firm. Subsequently, the police arrested two Chinese nationals who were behind the illegal online loan apps which offered cheaper loans and later harassed debtors, demanding payment of exorbitant rates of interest. The prime accused, Hong, was operating from China while the other two — Xioa Yamao and Wu Yuanlun — were staying in Haralur, Bengaluru. Frequent instructions were passed on from China. The prime accused Hong and others came to India in January, before the onset of the lockdown. They had suffered a setback due to the pandemic. They were operating call centres employing locals as telecallers, and these were registered as non-banking finance firms, which are permitted to work in the micro-financing sector. The firm’s directors were Indians but operations were entirely controlled by the Chinese. The telecallers were given a target to get at least 10 customers. If they failed to do so, they would be sacked. A senior police officer said, “One of the accused has been admitted to a hospital for COVID-19 treatment. We are investigating his whereabouts. So far, we have seized two laptops, six mobile phones, two Chinese passports and ATM cards and incriminating documents. Investigation to identify their Indian contacts and foreign links is on. In the course of our investigation, we also learned that the gang had procured over 2,000 SIM cards for illegal operations.” “On analysing various electronic records, we found that they had cheated and harassed more than 25,000 victims. The estimated value of the money they swindled is Rs. 300 crore. Two bank accounts were frozen and investigation on the money’s ultimate destination is under way. After establishing the role of accused, we may take the next course of action to pursue the accused who were behind this by sending a letter rogatory. The case will likely be investigated by central agencies, such as the Enforcement Directorate or others, since it has international ramifications,” said sources.  They had cheated and harassed more than 25,000 victims and the estimated value of the money they swindled is Rs. 300 crore Police official||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/chinese-gang-procured-2000-sim-cards-with-false-identities/article33505973.ece

The first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said it would not be in public interest to pass an interim order. They, however, agreed to take up all the cases for final hearing after four weeks and directed the counsel concerned to complete their pleadings by then. The Bench pointed out that the vires of the Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Courses in Medicine, Dentistry, Indian Medicine and Homeopathy on Preferential basis to Students of Government Schools Act of 2020 had been challenged by a batch of writ petitioners on entirely different grounds.

06 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Teen who killed attempted rapist set free by police||A 19-year-old teen who killed a man who attempted to rape her walked free after being released by the Tiruvallur district police on grounds of self defence. A similar case was reported from Oomachikulam in Madurai in 2012 where a woman, who killed her husband after he attacked her in an inebriated state and also attempted to rape their daughter, was released by the police on similar grounds. In Tiruvallur district The incident of the 19-year-old teenager took place in Sholavaram in Tiruvallur district on Saturday night. A resident of Tiruvallur, the girl, had been staying in her aunt's house in Sholavaram for the past year. In the evening, she went to answer nature’s call in a secluded place near the house when her relative S. Ajithkumar, 24, followed her and attempted to rape her at knife point. The girl first pushed him away and after he fell, she took his knife and allegedly stabbed him on the neck and face. She then told her relatives about the attack, who informed the Sholavaram police. Ajithkumar’s body was sent to the Government Stanley Hospital for post-mortem examination. “We released the girl under Section 100, clause 3, of the IPC. This means that the right of private defence of the body extends to the voluntary causing of death or any other harm to the assailant if the offence that occasions the exercise of the right is an assault with the intention of committing rape,” said P. Aravindhan, Superintendent of Police, Tiruvallur. Mr. Aravindan said the girl had been housed in a home to protect her from relatives and friends of the victim.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/teen-who-killed-attempted-rapist-set-free-by-police/article33505975.ece

06 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Healthcare professionals and experts oppose decision to allow full occupancy in cinema halls||The Tamil Nadu government’s decision to allow full occupancy at theatres has not gone down well with healthcare professionals and public health experts. A cross-section said that this amounts to running a risk when COVID-19 cases are going down, and could nullify the efforts made till now. Official sources said full occupancy at theatres was not discussed at the meeting of the panel of health experts with the Chief Minister last week. Open letter On Tuesday, the Facebook post of Aravinth Srinivas, resident doctor, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER) in Puducherry, went viral. It was an open letter to actors Vijay and Silambarasan, who had met the Chief Minister with the request to allow full occupancy at theatres, in view of the release of their upcoming films and to the Tamil Nadu government from “a poor, tired resident doctor”. He said thousands of doctors like him, healthcare workers, police officials and sanitary workers were tired. “We have worked so hard at the ground level to make sure the damage done is kept to as low as possible amidst an unprecedented pandemic,” he wrote, objecting to full occupancy in the theatres. Prabhdeep Kaur, Deputy Director of the National Institute of Epidemiology (ICMR), Chennai, wrote on Twitter on Monday, “Closed spaces without social distancing are a perfect setting for explosive spread of COVID-19. Request public to avoid such settings.” For government doctors who have been involved in COVID-19 patient care since March, the decision has come as a disappointment. K. Senthil, president of the Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association, said, “Theatres will draw big crowds, and this is 100% not advisable...” C.N. Raja, national vice-president of the Indian Medical Association, said that allowing 100% occupancy in a closed environment would be a risk. “In open spaces with good ventilation, the infection rate is low. Full occupancy is not advisable in closed spaces with no ventilation or fresh air. Theatres such as multiplexes cannot run without air-conditioners and cannot keep the doors open,” he said. Arvindh, a resident doctor in Chennai, who was posted on nearly 10 COVID-19 duties and tested positive for the infection, said, “It simply means the budget and ego of movie producers and consumers are more important than the amount of money, time, energy and lives we have given away in the past year to COVID-19.” Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan told reporters that the Standard Operating Procedures had been released for all places where the public converged. “The Revenue and Disaster Management Department has issued a government order. We will look into the details and respond,” he said. P. Kuganantham, former City Health Officer of the Chennai Corporation, said, “It is surprising that the government has given the go-ahead for 100% occupancy. It is not wise to allow more than 50% occupancy in such places. They are designed essentially as air-conditioned closed units, which are conducive to the spread of the virus, and that cannot be changed.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/healthcare-professionals-oppose-allowing-full-occupancy-in-cinemas/article33505904.ece
06 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||‘HC won’t let legislators drag criminal cases’||The Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, Sanjib Banerjee, on Tuesday said he wants to send a message “loud and clear” to all past and present legislators facing criminal charges that the court would not let them drag these cases and every effort would be made to dispose of them at the earliest, as per the Supreme Court’s directions. Presiding over the first Division Bench along with Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, the Chief Justice said a comprehensive roadmap would be charted out, taking into account the litigative resourcefulness of the legislators who might file multifarious petitions to delay trial, and implemented in letter and spirit. He also stressed that the judges presiding over special courts, constituted for hearing cases against past and present Members of the Parliament as well as the Legislative Assembly, should treat all cases alike without giving room for complaints of cases against one political dispensation being given priority over others. The observations were made during the hearing of a suo motu writ petition, taken up at the instance of the Supreme Court, for monitoring progress made by the special courts. Special courts Advocate General Vijay Narayan said one Magisterial and one Sessions court in every judicial district had been designated as special courts to hear cases against legislators. Since these judicial officers were already burdened with regular criminal cases, they could not make much progress in cases against legislators. Even in Chennai where special courts had been constituted exclusively for trying offences against the legislators, one of those courts had been without a judge since September 18, the A-G told the Bench. On his part, advocate B. Vijay, representing the High Court Registry, filed a detailed report listing out the progress made by various courts in disposing of cases against the legislators. He said Justice N. Sathish Kumar had recently disposed of a number of petitions filed by past and present legislators to quash the criminal defamation cases pending against them. After hearing all of them, the Chief Justice said he would want to give top priority to the issue and come up with a concrete plan by January 11. He said the State could be divided into different regions — North, Central and South — and special courts could be constituted over there for exclusive trial of cases against legislators. He asked the A-G to ensure that the State government augments the resources required for expediting the trial in such cases.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/high-court-wont-let-legislators-drag-criminal-cases/article33505971.ece

Forest Department officials said that the tusker aged about 20 years died of electrocution from a fence erected around the paddy field that was powered illegally. The paddy field belonging to a farmer named Durai alias Aruchamy is situated approximately 2 km away from a reserve forest area of Mullangadu beat, said officials with the Department. After being alerted by villagers around 6.30 a.m., frontline staff of the Department, who were involved in driving out another tusker near Mullangadu forest check post, rushed to the spot. Electricity Department officials were immediately called to the location. “During the inspection by a forest range officer and Electricity Department officials, it was revealed that a steel wire fence had been erected around the farm field and that electricity had been stolen from the main location by wire to the steel wire fence,” said a statement issued by the Forest Department. The owner of the farm, Durai, was in the paddy field at night according to a farmer of a nearby farm. “As soon as the elephant died, the owner of the paddy field removed the wires used to supply electricity to the steel wire fence and escaped. A wildlife offence report (WLOR) has been registered against him,” the statement said. The Department has made arrangements for the autopsy of the elephant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tusker-electrocuted-in-paddy-field/article33505994.ece

06 January 2021||Dharmapuri,TAMIL NADU||MNM’s primary alliance is with people: Kamal||When the existing alliances implode and personas change, Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) will announce its alliance, said its founder Kamal Haasan here on Tuesday, as part his campaign tour. But, MNM’s primary alliance was with the people and the people are showing the way to him, said the actor-turned politician. Alluding to the latent factionalism in the AIADMK under its leaders Edappadi K. Palaniswami and O. Paneerselvam, Mr. Kamal Hassan said the ‘twin leaves’ of the party was intended to be nurtured as a banyan tree by the MGR. “But today, two men were sitting and eating off the two leaves, fighting for power. They are going to break the chair pulling it from either side.” Hinting that the existing alliances will implode, the MNM leader said, his party’s alliance will be decided then. “Some nests will break, and personas will change. That day I will tell who we align with. Our alliance is only with the people and it is already showing in every district as people come in waves to show their support.” On some of the AIADMK Ministers’ exclusive claim to MGR ‘s legacy, Mr. Kamal Hassan said, he staked claim to the political stage as someone, who was lucky to have been nurtured by MGR as a child. “In that sense, any good man can stake claim to MGR’s name and it was not patented for use by any single man or party.” “Those who mocked us when we declared salary for housewives are now approaching us to ask how much would we pay. Today, intellectuals have lauded our promise of equal pay for housewives for their work done at home”, said Mr. Kamal Hassan. MNM had released a seven- point governance and economic agenda last month, wherein, the party has promised salary for housework done by women as homemakers. His party had also announced free computers for each household. Dismissing the criticism that he was indulging in “freebies”, Mr. Haasan said computer was an essential human resource investment for any government and would strike at the heart of corruption induced by long queues for government services. Speaking of a prosperity line as opposed to the poverty line, the MNM leader, said for over half a century, rulers spoke of the poverty line and failed to pull up people over that line. “We have come here to help you rise over to the prosperity line to the extent that, even you slip down, you still won’t fall below the poverty line.” On his party’s idea of governance, Mr. Haasan said, “I don’t believe in heaven and hell, but I believe, where living conditions are better, that place is heaven.” The MNM leader positioned himself as a “tool” of the people and not as a leader. According to him, the people should decide what is good for them and the rulers cannot decide for them. “Under MNM, services will a public right and not any government’s charity.” Reacting to the rousing reception given by a massive crowd in Dharmapuri, the actor-turned politician said, this was a crowd that had gathered to support him for change, and not for currency. Referring to the start of the women’s SHG movement in 1989 in Dharmapuri, Mr. Haasan said, the district was a social laboratory enabling a successful social experiment of SHGs. Similarly, under the MNM, the district will be part of many such social experiments. Earlier, Mr. Kamal Haasan met 87-year- old Sivakami Amma, a freedom fighter, who was part of the Indian National Army of Subhash Chandra Bose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/mnms-primary-alliance-is-with-people-kamal/article33505992.ece
06 January 2021||KARAIKUDI,TAMIL NADU||Expedite underground drainage work, says Karti Chidambaram||Sivaganga MP Karti Chidambaram has written to Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami demanding action against officials for delay in completion of the underground drainage works in Karaikudi municipality and demanded inquiry into allegations of sub-standard roads being laid, which may have incurred huge losses to the public exchequer. He said that the State government had proposed to carry out the UGD work through the TWAD Board at a cost of Rs. 112.53 crore, covering 526 streets, which included installing sewage lines, construction of manholes, setting up treatment plant at Devakottai Rastha and connections to individual houses. Though the project was announced in 2017 and it was assured that it would be completed by March 2020, not even 60% of the works had been completed. The residents were put to much hardship because of the tardy pace of work. Roads had been dug up but there were no caution boards. As a result, many freak accidents had occurred. Repeated pleas with the local authorities by the residents’ welfare associations had not fetched any desired results. When this was the case, officials claim to have completed major part of the works and even laid roads - all to the tune of Rs. 67 crore. In the recent rains, the newly-laid roads had already been damaged badly. Demanding an inquiry against the erring officials, Mr. Karthi also wanted to blacklist the contractor for laying substandard roads.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/expedite-underground-drainage-work-says-karti-chidambaram/article33505981.ece
06 January 2021||Madurai,TAMIL NADU||Farmers want crushing to be started early at sugar mills||Farmers affiliated to Tamil Nadu Cane Growers Association staged a “waiting protest” by making gruel on the premises of National Cooperative Sugar Mills at Alanganallur on Tuesday seeking early commencement of crushing at the factory. Led by its State president, N. Palaniswami, they complained that they were not willing for diversion of cane to mills in other districts. “Last year, when 40,000 tonnes of cane was diverted to three different government and cooperative mills, payment to the tune of Rs. 1.5 crore was not made to the farmers till date,” he complained. Practical problems Besides, the farmers had faced practical problems in transporting canes to far off places. “Canes transported from fields are immediately unloaded at the factory in local areas whereas it took at least five days for unloading at other factories,” they complained. Farmers there insisted that priority should be given to the local produce and not to those brought from Madurai. It had complicated the issue in more than one ways. Loss of weight Firstly, farmers faced loss of weight in their produce as the cane gets dry during the waiting period. Secondly, trucks are unnecessarily detained on the factory premises for days together and they demand rent for those detained days too. When that is denied, out of frustration, trucks do not come back to the fields here for transportation. “Farmers here had to destroy cane grown on 2,000 acres,” Mr. Palaniswami claimed. While the crushing season begins during January-end, an official said that availability of a meagre 30,000 tonnes of cane in the cane area of Alanganallur mills – covering Madurai and parts of Virudhunagar and Dindigul districts – will subject mills to huge loss. The official expressed the hope that crushing can be started in January 2022 if at least 70,000 tonnes of sugarcane are available. The mill has a capacity to crush 5 lakh tonnes in a season. With release of first instalment of Rs. 5.93 crore for settling dues to farmers, the association sought that the payment should be made through cheques to the farmers to enable them start plantation. “With the government having made huge investment on co-generation on the mill premises, commencing crushing earlier here will be the best decision for all,” Mr. Palaniswami said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-want-crushing-to-be-started-early-at-sugar-mills/article33505977.ece

The protesters said that 33 sub-health centres functioning in the then rural areas came under the Corporation limits after the expansion of the city with 28 additional wards. “We were receiving the salary from the Department of Health though we were working for the Corporation. However, in July our parent department decided to take us back,” said a VHN and district coordinator of the committee, Chinna Ponnu. Since then, the nurses have been asking the Corporation authorities to relieve them. However, as no order has been issued to relieve them, the members decided to stage a “waiting” protest. However, after the intervention of the police, the authorities promised to take up their case soon following which they dispersed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/relieve-us-from-corporation-nurses/article33506563.ece

A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi allowed the appeal preferred by Mr. Aneesh Sekhar against the single judge’s order of 2019 and set aside the sentence.

06 January 2021||NAMAKKAL/COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Namakkal poultry farms told to take precautionary measures||The Animal Husbandry Department has advised poultry farms in Namakkal to take precautionary measures following reports of cases of bird flu in Kerala. Namakkal is a major hub of poultry goods in the country, and Kerala is one of the important business places for the farms here. The Department has advised the farms in Namakkal to follow bio-safety norms strictly to prevent an outbreak of the disease. Officials said all trucks carrying poultry goods entering and leaving the State were being disinfected on the State borders and on the farms. Officials have advised that shifting of labourers between the farms be avoided as avian flu is a zoonotic disease. ‘Free from avian flu’ certificate has been mandated for all trucks leaving with goods from here, though it is already in practice. The farms have been advised to prevent the entry of wild birds as they could be carriers of the flu. According to officials, the veterinary treatment centres in the district have been instructed to alert the poultry disease diagnostic laboratory here in case of any untoward incident. Coimbatore and Tiruppur districts are the major producers of broiler birds in the State. R. Lakshmanan, chairman of Broiler Co-ordination Committee, said that just about 10% of the broiler birds produced in Tamil Nadu were sold in Kerala. Broiler production in Kerala had increased over the years. “We do not get raw materials or other items from Kerala. Hence, there is no immediate impact.” Compared with layer birds, the impact was very less on the broiler sector, he said. ‘Steps being taken’ With Kerala, Haryana and Rajasthan reporting cases of bird flu, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan has warned that though the disease affects livestock, it could be transmitted to humans. “As a precautionary measure, the Animal Husbandry Department has started monitoring six districts close to Kerala — Kanniyakumari, Tenkasi, Theni, Tiruppur, Coimbatore and the Nilgiris. It is monitoring the incoming and outgoing livestock and eggs at 26 checkpoints. The Health Department is taking up disinfection measures. We are working with a veterinary doctor and a joint director to ensure that there is no spread of infection from other States to Tamil Nadu,” he said. “Next, with rain, dengue will be an issue. As far as the Health Department is concerned, we have challenges throughout the year. The number of dengue cases is nearly five times less, and we are seeing only sporadic cases,” he noted.

The nine-year-old twins, V. Nithin and V. Nithish, who studied in class 3 in a government school, extended timely assistance to Subbulakshmi, as she lay on the ground on her way to the ration shop in the village. Subbulakshmi, a widow, lived with her unmarried daughter, who was said to be slightly mentally ill. She move around with the aid of a walking stick after sustaining injury in a fall a couple of years ago, said V. Vanitha, mother of the twins. On Tuesday, it took her nearly two hours just to cover half the distance to the ration shop. “Finding it extremely difficult to walk any further, the aged woman lay on the ground under a tree in front of our house,” said Vanitha. Subbalakshmi told her that she was on her way to the ration shop, situated nearly a km away, to receive the Pongal gift pack. “She could not be taken on a two-wheeler to the shop as she had hip problem. That was when I thought of transporting her in our push cart,” she added. Nithin and Nitish immediately volunteered to transport her in the push cart to the ration shop and drop her home. Subbalakshmi was lifted and placed on the push cart and the boys brought her to the shop. Locals standing in a queue at the ration shop helped to lift her and collect the gift pack. They then made her lie down on the cart again. The twin brothers safely dropped Subbalakshmi in her home. “The aged woman was at a loss of words to thank my sons for their deed,” said the proud mother. Nithin and Nithish were happy to have helped an elderly woman who was like their grandmother.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/aged-woman-gets-pongal-gift-hamper-thanks-to-good-samaritan-twins/article33505961.ece

Arjunan, who runs a tea shop here on Monday. A scuffle between Arjunan, 46, and the representatives led to spilling of hot water over Arjunan’s daughter Srivardhini. The minor girl has been admitted to the Government Hospital for burn injuries on her head and face. According to Arjunan’s wife, Kalaimathi, 37, she had been prompt in repayment of loan till lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic led to closure of the tea shop in March. “Like all other borrowers, I also did not repay the loan in the intervening period as per the government moratorium on repayment.,” she said. After the lenders kept calling, Kalaimathi had given Rs. 1,300 to her elder daughter to hand over to an employee of the finance company. “After taking the money, they had threatened my daughter of action if the balance Rs. 650 was not immediately paid,” she said. Even after payment of due for December, they insisted that the borrower should immediately pay the instalment for January. “When my husband questioned them for threatening my daughter, five of them came to the shop and started abusing us. They also assaulted him,” she said. Alleging that in the scuffle, they pushed the boiling water and it splashed on the girl’s face. “Even as she was screaming with burns, they were keen on taking on my husband,” she complained. Functionaries from All India Democractic Women’s Association, Mythili and Mary, met them on Tuesday.

06 January 2021||RAMANATHAPURAM,TAMIL NADU||‘Stop collecting toll on incomplete highway’||It was very unfair on the part of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to collect toll from vehicle users on the Madurai-Ramanathapuram four-lane highway when the road has been laid only up to Paramakudi, said K. Balabharathi, former MLA of the Communist party of India (Marxist) and State executive committee member. So Demanding the NHAI to immediately stop collection of toll, cadres of Left parties, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Congress and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) staged a protest at the Bogalur toll plaza near Chathirakudi in Ramanathapuram district on Tuesday. Speaking to media persons, Ms. Balabharathi said as per established norms, toll could be collected only when the work was completed. But, in this case, road had been laid only on one side of the four-lane highway. Every day, hundreds of fishermen, farmers and people from the middle class travelled to Rameswaram. The four-lane highway was functional only up to Paramakudi on the Madurai-Ramanathapuram stretch. Beyond Paramakudi, the works were under way. Under such circumstances, collecting toll from these people was very unfair. At a time when Opposition parties were demanding the Centre to stop collection of toll in toll plazas which had completed the contractual period, the NHAI had allowed collection even before the road was ready. The people, in a democratic way, would be forced to close the toll plaza, Ms. Balabharathi said. She also took a dig at Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami for his claims as a farmer. When the plight of farmers was pathetic, the CM should have at least taken steps to close down the toll plaza which was functioning against norms and taxing farmers and fishermen who transported their produce from Rameswaram to other towns, she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stop-collecting-toll-from-vehicle-users-on-incomplete-highway/article33505987.ece

06 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Wildlife officials told to keep tabs on migratory birds’ health||The Forest Department is monitoring the health of migratory birds in sanctuaries after a large number of birds died in Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and other States owing to bird flu. The Wildlife Division of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has sent out an alert to the Chief Wildlife Wardens of the States and the Union Territories. It points to reports of the death of a large number of birds in Himachal Pradesh and other States. The exact reason is being ascertained, but preliminary reports indicate that they may have died due to avian influenza. Hence, surveillance must be stepped up to prevent the transmission of diseases among animals and birds and the mortality of the wildlife must be checked out, it notes. Large numbers Citing the arrival of a large number of migratory birds in various parts of the country, the communication has asked officials to monitor the wintering habitats of the migratory birds for mortality or a disease outbreak. According to a rough estimate, about two lakh migratory birds have been camping in the sanctuaries at Point Calimere in Nagapattinam district, Vaduvoor and Vijayamardhandam in Tiruvarur district and Karaivetti in Ariyalur district. They are expected to stay there until February. The field officials have been asked to monitor the health of these birds. ‘No death so far’ S. Ramasubramanian, Chief Conservator of Forest (in-charge), Tiruchi, told The Hindu that there had been no report of death of migratory birds in the sanctuaries, wetlands, lagoons, mudflats, lakes and other waterbodies in the region this season. However, officials had been asked to monitor them. “Death of birds, if any, will be immediately taken to the notice of the Animal Husbandry Department to ascertain the cause. If samples test positive for avian influenza virus, steps will be taken to contain its spread by following the Standard Operating Procedure,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wildlife-officials-told-to-keep-tabs-on-migratory-birds-health/article33505916.ece
06 January 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||2020 saw dip in fatal accidents in Tiruchi city||There has been a decline in fatal accident cases and casualty figures in Tiruchi City Police limits in 2020 in comparison to the previous year. The drop was also noticeable in respect of non-fatal accidents which, however, was more than the fatal cases. Recurring accidents in certain areas had prompted the City Police authorities to identify accident-prone hotspots to put in place corrective measures. Police sources said 87 fatal accidents with an equal number of casualties were reported from January to December 2020. The fatal cases and casualty figures dropped in 2020 as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year (2019) when 104 deaths were reported in 102 fatal accident cases. Two-wheelers accounted for nearly 50 % to 60 % of the total accident cases reported within the city police limits, says Commissioner of Police J. Loganathan. Enforcement steps, initiating corrective measures at accident-prone hotspots and the initial stages of the total lockdown when movement of vehicles were prohibited were all factors which resulted in a decline in fatal accidents in 2020, Mr. Loganathan further said. Analysis done by the City Police revealed that most accidents were reported between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. followed by the timings between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. within the city limits. The City Police authorities had also analysed the age group of persons involved in accidents. It was found during analysis that those in the 30-44 age group were the ones who were involved in most accidents for various reasons. This was followed by those in the 45-59 years age group. Concerned over the recurring instances of accidents, the law enforcers identified 18 potential hotspots. These hotspots include Mannarpuram roundabout, 'Y' road junction on the city's outskirts, Old Palpannai Junction and E. Pudur bypass junction. The city has seen a steep rise in vehicle density over the years putting pressure on the existing road space. Parking of vehicles along roadsides often shrinks the existing road space causing huge problems for motorists and forcing pedestrians to walk on the road in the absence of dedicated pedestrian pathways at many places thereby making them vulnerable to be hit by a speeding vehicle, said M. Sekaran, president of Air, Rail and Road Travellers Federation. Non-adherence to prescribed speed limits by several motorists within the city limits, rash driving and violations committed by commercial vehicles could all be attributed to recurring accidents within Tiruchi. Although the speed limits to be adhered by motorists within the city limits has been clearly stipulated by the official machinery, several motorists could be found not following this directive which could lead to accidents, said Mr. Sekaran. A senior police officer said sudden turn by some motorists either towards the right or left direction without any indication was also one of the reasons for accidents in the city. Notwithstanding periodic drives by the law enforcers, around 3,000 drunk driving and about 2,000 cases of over-speeding were booked last year. The officer said the city police were booking around 50 drunk driving cases daily. Mr. Loganathan said corrective measures including provision of lighting and establishment of speed breakers at service road entrances had been put in place at some accident-prone hotspots and efforts were on to carry out in the remaining places as per the requirement found in each spot. The City Police were mainly targeting drunk driving and over-speeding and had stepped up enforcement during the crucial time period between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m, Mr. Loganathan said. In a city which has been witnessing road rule violations of many types, self regulation and stricter enforcement could alone bring down the accident rate further, observed Mr. Sekaran.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/2020-saw-dip-in-fatal-accidents-in-tiruchi-city/article33505955.ece
06 January 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Elephant Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre gets bigger fodder plot||The Forest Department has expanded the area of the fodder plot within the sprawling Elephant Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre premises at M.R. Palayam for fodder requirements of the seven captive elephants being taken care of by it. Officials of the department had initially created the fodder plot on an area measuring two hectares on a trial basis a few months ago by raising green fodder for the pachyderms. However, the fodder plot area has now been expanded from two hectares to five hectares in which Cumbu Napier grass and other green fodder were being raised to cater to the fodder requirements of the pachyderms which were translocated to the rehabilitation centre from different places since September 2019. The area has been created in a portion of the nearly 20-hectare Elephant Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre which is functioning within a huge reserved forest area adjoining the Tiruchi - Chennai national highway a few kilometres from Tiruchi. “The Forest Department has expanded the fodder plot area to five hectares now within the centre with the long-term objective of becoming self-sustaining,” said S. Ramasubramanian, Conservator of Forests, Thanjavur Circle, holding additional charge of Tiruchi Circle. Care has been taken to ensure that only organic manure is applied for raising the green fodder, he said. Plans were afoot to raise saplings of various tree species inside the centre to add to the nutritional requirements of the elephants and with the objective of further improving the green cover. Raising of tree species is also aimed at creating a natural forest area for the elephants each of which require about 250 kg of green fodder every day, he said adding that water sources have been created inside the centre both for requirements of the animals and for the fodder plot. In addition to green fodder, sugarcane, fruits, vegetables, ragi, cooked rice, jaggery and mineral mixture were also being fed to the elephants to make it a balanced diet. The diet was being given as per the advice of a veterinarian who periodically monitors the health condition of the animals. The animals were being taken for morning and evening walks within the centre where walking paths have been created to keep them physically active and agile, said Mr. Ramasubramanian. The centre which is equipped with a host of surveillance cameras has separate sheds for each animal, a kitchen to cook food for the pachyderms, bathing pond, bathing shower, water trough and mud pond besides quarters for a team of mahouts who take care of the elephants. The centre became functional in early September 2019 when the first captive elephant ‘Malachi’ was translocated from Madurai. Subsequently, five more captive elephants were translocated to the rehabilitation centre including three pachyderms owned by the Kanchi Mutt. The seventh captive elephant ‘Deivanai’ was translocated from the Tiruppankundram Sri Subramania Swamy Temple in Madurai district to the centre in June last.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/elephant-rescue-and-rehabilitation-centre-gets-bigger-fodder-plot/article33505947.ece
06 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Fishermen release adult dugong, calf into sea||An adult dugong and its calf, which got entangled in a fishing net, were released into the sea by fishermen of Theruku Pudukudi near Jagadapattinam in Pudukottai district on Tuesday. Local fisherman K. Jegan, 24, and six of his colleagues were fishing in the sea near Jagadapattinam harbour when they inadvertently caught them in the net. While the female adult weighed about 200 kg, the calf was around 40 kg. The fishermen subsequently pulled them gently to the shore and decided to release them into the sea. Since the adult was big in size, they cut the net carefully so as to avoid causing injury to it. They then released it into the sea. The baby was also subsequently released into the sea, where its mother was swimming. The fishermen thereafter alerted forest personnel. “It was a tough operation to let them back into the sea. Our priority was not only to avoid any harm to the mammals but also to ensure them trouble-free breathing until they reached the surface. We did the operation quickly,” said Mr. Jegan. The marine mammals were highly endangered species scheduled under the Wildlife Protection Act. S. Ramasubramanian, Chief Conservator of Forest (in-charge), Tiruchi, told The Hindu that it was heartening to note that the fishermen acted quickly and saved them. The mammals might have come from Delft Island in Sri Lankan waters. The availability of seagrass in the sea along the coast of Jagathapattinam and Sethubavachathiram might have lured them. Citing a study, he said the population of dugong was less than 100 in the region. The act of the fishermen to let them back into the sea was a sign of increasing awareness among the fishermen of the need to save the highly endangered species. All seven fishermen would be suitably awarded, Mr. Ramasubramanian added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/fishermen-release-adult-dugong-calf-into-sea/article33506697.ece
06 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||At Gandhi Market, it is back to square one||Gandhi Market in the city has returned to its old ways. Street vendors have reoccupied arterial roads causing traffic snares. Slushy conditions prevail in most parts of the market area. Solid waste management too has taken a hit. Gandhi Market was reopened on November 28, after the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court lifted an interim order against its reopening. The district administration laid down a set of norms to be followed by vendors and customers. They included social distancing, wearing face masks and avoiding overcrowding at shops. Vendors were told to confine their ware to their shops, while sellers on the main road were evicted and asked not to return. However, all these norms are up in the air as vendors flout them on a daily basis, customers say. “Even those who enter the premises with a face mask pull it down to their chin to scan the produce and purchase it,” said P. Muthu, a customer. The crowds swell through the day to make purchases from the retail vendors, while trucks carrying loads for wholesale sellers block the streets at night. “There is no restriction on the number of customers, nor is there any official to monitor the vendors and customers,” he added. The market is in a terrible state, with pathways filled with mud and slush. “The civic body said it would regularly clean up the area and keep it neat. Our customers are put off by the slush and some return without buying anything,” a vegetable seller said. The civic body cleared up nearly 110 tonnes of garbage and constructed stormwater drains at the market prior to its opening. “The drains are too small and have clogged up. There was no drain for the water from the recent rains to clear out. It paints us in a bad light, but it is the shoddy work of the city corporation that is to be blamed,” another vendor said. Meanwhile, a senior official of the civic boy says another eviction drive is on the cards in the area. “We plan to remove the encroachments within and on the periphery of the market. A more permanent solution to ensure their non-return will taken along with city police,” the senior official said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/at-gandhi-market-it-is-back-to-square-one/article33505957.ece

The new plant will be built under ‘Design, Build, Operate and Transfer’ (DBOT) model on an outlay of Rs. 14.89 crore which will be released from the Smart City Fund. The old plant with the capacity of 24 MLD was commissioned in 2007. The sewerage scheme covers only 35% of the corporation area. Under AMRUT (Atal Mission for Urban Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) scheme, underground sewerage scheme (UGSS) work (Phase-II and Phase-III) is under progress to cover the whole corporation. Based on the sewage generation, the capacity of the plant will be increased. Prescribed design The proposed plant will follow the design prescribed by Central Public Health and Environmental Engineering Organisation (CPHEEO) manual on Sewerage System and Sewage Treatment. “Since Tirunelveli is expanding rapidly, we need a better sewerage system. Educational institutions and industries attract migrants and there is the floating population So the city’s civic infrastructure, especially water supply and sanitation, must be improved. A proper sewerage treatment system is the need of the hour,” said V. Narayanan Nair, Chief Executive Officer, Tirunelveli Smart City Limited. The sewage plant reduces water contamination and outbreak of water-borne diseases. Moreover, it preserves the natural environment. “As of now, all sewage waste is discharged in septic tanks and cess pits resulting in pollution of groundwater. Polluted water ends in the river causing environmental impact too. With a modern sewerage system, pollution of groundwater can be prevented. The treated effluents at the wastewater treatment plant can be reused for agricultural and other purposes,” he says.

Commercial Taxes Minister K.C. Veeramani named it after his late wife. Similarly, Tirupathur Collector Sivanarul and his staff have named over 130 trees transplanted from the site of the new Collector’s office after their loved ones. “This will make us take care of it better. Every day or at least a few times a week, we will go and check on the condition of the trees just because we have named it,” said Mr. Sivanarul, who has named a tree as Raja. Around 15 students of a nearby karate school have also christened the trees. “After their class is over, they water the trees and then go home. We taught them the importance of each tree and also how to preserve them,” said Syed Kattuva, an environmentalist from Bharathiar University, who is part of the Marangalukku Maruvazhu Amaippu that is behind the transplantation work. The Collector said the district administration was planning to have a separate layout for sandalwood and red sanders trees on the new campus. “We will be transplanting them too. However, we are awaiting permission from the Forest Department for the same,” he added. The present Collector’s office is located in the old Block Development Office and a new one is being constructed on the Forest Department’s residential premises. It will have seven floors and will house over 40 departments and the work is expected to be completed in a year’s time. “Instead of chopping the trees, I wanted to transplant them. Naming them will give an emotional connect,” said Mr. Sivanarul. Some of the tree species identified are neem, pungan , udhiyan and manipungan . Most of them are herbal trees that are usually found in the forests. Mr. Kattuva said it would take at least 30 to 90 days to know how successful the transplantation has been. He said the climate, the mud and species of the tree determined the success of the transplantation. The team digs pits that are 10 ft wide and 10 ft deep at the spot where the tree will be transplanted. Before uprooting the trees, the team checks if the tree is healthy. Then its trunk is covered using cow dung and gunny bags. A pit is dug around the tree and it is lifted along with the mud beneath it called ‘Thai mannu’, and then transported to the new site using a crane.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/trees-transplanted-from-collectors-office-site-get-names/article33506648.ece

06 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Chemists facing a problem of plenty as demand for anti-viral drugs falls||Following a decline in COVID-19 cases in the country, chemists who had stocked up on antiviral drugs — Remedesivir and Favipiravir — used in the treatment of moderate and severe cases of the disease are facing a problem of plenty. With the stocks having a short shelf life of three months, most of the products are nearing expiry. As the chemists had procured these drugs on advance payments, they are worried of suffering losses, with pharma companies not accepting the stocks back. On January 1, the All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists wrote to the marketing and distribution heads of pharma companies (manufacturers of Remedesivir and Favipiravir) requesting them to accept all returns of such stocks. The letter, signed by association president J.S. Shinde and general secretary Rajiv Singhal, stated that the association members, who have always supported the industry, had accepted their “unusual terms” and cooperated with the companies on the matter of COVID-19. “Most of our members were compelled to purchase Remedesivir and Favipiravir drugs on advance payment. But in the recent past, owing to the drastic fall in the number of COVID-19 positive cases, the demand for such products has gone down. The stocks lying with stockists have come close to their date of expiry as most of the batches had a shelf life of hardly three months,” the letter stated. “Besides, a vast difference in trade prices of similar molecules/formulations of various drugs manufacturers also has aggravated the situation for breaking movements of their brands. This has resulted in a huge non-moving stock of Remedesivir and Favipiravir lying with stockists. Suppliers/companies are not accepting such stocks for adjustment,” the association said. “With these drugs strictly mandated to be sold on prescription, retailers and stockists have no other option but to return the stock to the companies.” A.K. Jeevan, general secretary of Karnataka Chemists and Druggists Association, told The Hindu that chemists across the country were facing this problem. “As we were compelled to buy the drugs on advance payments, we will have to face huge losses for no fault of ours if the companies do not accept the returns,” he said. “In Karnataka, although the State government has been providing these drugs free of cost to patients treated under its quota, private patients (those not being treated under the government quota) were buying it from chemists. Now, with the cases dropping drastically, there is no demand for these drugs,” he said. Govt. procuring less C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing, who is also a part of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, said the State government had reduced its procurement of these drugs as the need had come down. “There was a short supply of this expensive drug when the demand had gone up from July. Subsequently, more companies started manufacturing and the prices dropped significantly. The State government has been procuring this at a cost of Rs. 1,800 per vial,” he said. “The number of cases has come down now. Most of the cases being reported are mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic, resulting in a huge drop in the number of ICU cases too,” Dr. Manjunath explained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/chemists-facing-a-problem-of-plenty-as-demand-for-anti-viral-drugs-falls/article33506071.ece
06 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||No new works in sight for legislators as financial crunch refuses to ease||Reeling under financial crunch due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the State government has been finding it difficult to sanction new development works to constituencies represented by both ruling party and Opposition legislators, an issue raised repeatedly by them in various fora. As per the revised revenue estimates, the government was facing shortage of nearly Rs. 30,000 crore in the current fiscal year. This is despite raising the borrowing limit to 5% of the GSDP and borrowing nearly Rs. 90,000 crore. MLAs have been demanding sanction of works under Public Works, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, Urban Development, Water Resources, Education and Housing Departments, but the government has not been clearing new works citing shortage of funds. The government sources say there is a severe shortage of funds to sanction development works. During the two-day meeting with legislators, sources said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has explained the State’s financial position to his party legislators and sought some more time for sanctioning works to their constituencies. Opposition Congress MLAs too said that the government has not cleared new works and so far only made empty assurances. Owing to COVID-19 and shortage of cash, the government had already slashed 30% salary and allowances of MLAs and MLCs for one year. A large amount of revenue was spent on arranging facilities for COVID-19 treatment and providing compensation for unorganised workers hit by the pandemic, and farmers affected by floods, official sources said. Expenditure increase The Reserve Bank of India too noted that the State’s fiscal response to COVID-19 has reflected a larger increase in revenue expenditure in 2020-21 than budgeted. “These spending coupled with revenue receipts shortfall are likely to convert revenue surpluses as budgeted in 2020-21 into large deficits,” the RBI said. No encashment Meanwhile, the Finance Department issued a notification on Monday cancelling leave encashment facilities for its employees in the calendar year 2021 (January to December). However, the facility has been made available to employees retiring in the calendar year 2021, it said. Owing to financial constraints, the government has not increased Dearness Allowances for its employees during the last one year.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/no-new-works-in-sight-for-legislators-as-financial-crunch-refuses-to-ease/article33506081.ece
06 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||BBMP gets a thumbs up||Animal lovers who have, for the first time, rated the BBMP’s Animal Husbandry Department, admit that the civic body has been doing better than they had anticipated. However, there is still room for improvement on many fronts, especially with regard to timely payment to vendors, more focus on rescue, and shelters, they said. Priya Chetty Rajagopal, founder and managing partner of C.J. Memorial Trust, a non-profit organisation working for animal welfare, said the workings of the Animal Husbandry Department had improved vastly over the last two years. “The BBMP has taken several measures proactively for animal welfare. They have begun to use technology for better transparency, improved the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme, and set up the first rabies helpline for the city. Civic officials, including Special Commissioner (Animal Husbandry) D. Randeep, Joint Director Lakshminarayan and team, have been working with various animal welfare organisations,” she said, and added that the BBMP had now transformed into a protector of street dogs and had supported animal lovers in the city. The checklist of all the positives drawn up by the animal lovers who are part of the BBMP’s WhatsApp Monitoring community clearly outweigh the negatives. But some areas that need much improvement, according to the checklist, include timely payment to vendors, better metrics and transparency with monthly data being put up on public domain, increase in checks on ABC centres, more focus on rescue and shelters, and leveraging existing facilities. Acknowledging the good feedback received from animal lovers in the city, Mr. Lakshminarayan said this had encouraged the department to strive towards improvement. “This would not have been possible without the active involvement of citizens. At the end of the day, all that the BBMP and citizens want is animal welfare,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bbmp-gets-a-thumbs-up/article33506412.ece
06 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||ABC-ARV pilot project to be expanded to eight wards||The Animal Birth Control (ABC) and Anti Rabies Vaccination (ARV) programmes, which are currently being implemented on a pilot basis by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), in two wards, Nagarbhavi in West zone and Herohalli in Rajarajeshwarinagar zone, is set to be rolled out to other parts of the city. The initiatives, for which the civic body received technological help from the Worldwide Veterinary Services, saw 70% of the estimated dog population covered in the two wards as part of the pilot. Given its success, the BBMP has decided to extend the pilot to more wards in the city. To begin with, one or two wards will be chosen in each of the eight zones. According to information provided by senior officials in the BBMP’s Animal Husbandry Department, in the next phase the pilot is being extended to Jnana Bharati ward and Laggere ward in Rajarajeshwarinagar zone, Moodalapalya in West zone, H.B.R. Layout ward in East zone, Shettihalli in Dasarahalli zone, Horamavu in Mahadevapura zone, Jakkur in Yelahanka zone, Jaraganahalli in Bommanahalli zone, and Jayanagar East in South zone. BBMP Joint Director (Animal Husbandry) Lakshminarayana Swamy told The Hindu that the pilot in the new wards is likely to begin in January. The BBMP has been using the app developed by Worldwide Veterinary Service Centre, Goa, apart from the ARV recommended by the world organisation for animal health. Assistant Director S.M.M. Shinde said around 2,000 strays in Herohalli and 800 in Nagarbhavi had been geotagged and sterilised. “We may be able to cover 70% of the dog population within a couple of weeks in wards in core zones. However, given the size of wards in outer zones, the pilot may take at least a month,” he said. Explaining the process, he said once a stray dog is caught, it will be geotagged, which will help animal welfare organisations working with the civic body to release it in the same location. All details about the dog, whether it is a puppy, male or female, colour etc., will be uploaded onto the app.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/abc-arv-pilot-project-to-be-expanded-to-eight-wards/article33506417.ece

06 January 2021||BENGALURU,KARNATAKA||Ministers to make themselves available to MLAs twice a week||Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s second day of interaction with Bharatiya Janata Party MLAs ended on Tuesday without hurdles. While day one of interaction was marked by a face-off with disgruntled leader Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, the final day’s meetings were more or less smooth. Mr. Yediyurappa, who is trying to win the confidence of party MLAs in the wake of speculations of a possible leadership change, gave a patient hearing to party MLAs who poured out woes with respect to development of their constituencies and also pleaded for additional funds for development. In an immediate impact of the two-day interaction, all the Ministers have accepted the suggestion of MLAs to make themselves available at their offices in Vidhana Soudha twice a week for the legislators. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi said MLAs had suggested that regular meetings of Ministers with MLAs would help. MLAs’ feedback According to him, the meeting was organised to get the feedback of party MLAs on development of their constituencies in a three-pronged approach. “While their views were taken on the immediate measures for the development of their constituencies in terms of priority, they were also asked to list the pending works besides works to be taken up on a long-term basis,” he said. Seeking to downplay the episode of Mr. Yatnal confronting the Chief Minister during the first day’s meeting, Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol said but for one such episode, the meeting was completely smooth. He claimed that all the MLAs had expressed confidence in Mr. Yediyurappa’s leadership and praised the way COVID-19 was handled. Shah’s visit Mr. Savadi said the party was also planning to hold two separate conventions in Bhadravathi and Belagavi to mark the visit of Union Home Minister Amit Shah to the State on January 15 and 16.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/ministers-to-make-themselves-available-to-mlas-twice-a-week/article33506079.ece
06 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||High Court notice to State govt. on Olekar’s appointment as head of SC/ST commission||The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday ordered issue of notice to the State government on a PIL petition questioning legality of appointing BJP MLA Nehru Olekar as chairperson of the Karnataka State Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Satish Chandra Sharma passed the order on the petition filed by K. Rajanna from Kolar district. It has been contended in the petition that Mr. Olekar has been appointed solely on the basis of him being a legislator from the ruling party as there is no material or document available to show that he has “special knowledge” in the matter of SCs/STs as prescribed in the law to be considered for the post of chairperson of the commission. Apart from belonging to SC community and having been elected from the Haveri Legislative Assembly constituency (reserved for SC), there is no material to show that he has “special knowledge” in the matter pertaining to SCs/STs, the petitioner has contended while pointing out that Mr. Olekar is facing four criminal cases as per his disclosure made before the Election Commission of India in his nomination paper. The wrong tendency of equating the commission with the Boards and Corporation, and appointing a political leader to head such a body is fraught with great risk, it has been stated in the petition.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/high-court-notice-to-state-govt-on-olekars-appointment-as-head-of-scst-commission/article33506077.ece
06 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||HC asks State govt. to submit steps taken to set up old age homes||The Karnataka High Court on Tuesday directed the State government to submit steps taken to establish old age homes as per the provisions of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007. Also, the court directed the government to make its stand clear on the statutory obligation to prescribe a scheme for ensuring minimum standards in the old age homes set up by private organisations. A Division Bench issued a direction while hearing a PIL petition, which has complained about nuisance caused due to operation of an old age home situated in the residential locality of 8th Main Road, Girinagar in Bengaluru city.  If an order is made by the court for closure of the old age home, perhaps it will be violation of the fundamental rights of the inmates of the old age home in question, the Bench observed, while asking the trustees of the old age home and the petitioners to sort out the issue by convening a meeting. Earlier, it was pointed out to the Bench that Section 19 of the Act mentions that the State government may establish and maintain such number of old age homes at accessible places, as it may deem necessary, in a phased manner, beginning with at least one in each district to accommodate in such homes a minimum of 150 senior citizens who are indigent. The Act also empowers the government to prescribe a scheme for management of old age homes, including the standards and services to be provided by them which are necessary for medical care and means of entertainment to the inhabitants.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-asks-state-govt-to-submit-steps-taken-to-set-up-old-age-homes/article33506408.ece

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Satish Chandra Sharma passed the interim order on an application during the hearing of a PIL, filed by Bangalore Environment Trust and Dattareya Devare, related to felling of trees for metro and road widening projects in the city. An affidavit of Vijay Nishanth of Project Vruksha Foundation was produced before the Bench on felling of eucalyptus trees inside NMM Park. Though the trust authorities managing the park had initially sought permission from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike seeking permission to cut 120 eucalyptus tees, they later cut several of them on the ground that provisions of the KPT Act exempts from seeking permission for felling certain categories of trees, including eucalyptus trees. The Bench passed the interim order as it is examining the issue on whether public authorities can mechanically fell the trees, exempted from the provisions of KPT Act, without seeking a view from experts though law permits felling sans seeking permission from the Tree Authority. Meanwhile, the State government, in response to the Court’s earlier queries said that the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. is not required to take permission for felling over 800 trees as KPT itself does not contemplate such permission.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hc-stays-felling-of-eucalyptus-trees-for-installing-plane-at-park/article33506409.ece

06 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Private schools asked to revise fee structure||With private school managements struggling to collect fees and parents unable to pay up due to salary cuts and job loss, the Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka (KAMS) has asked managements to revise the fee structure and reduce the amount to be paid for the 2020-2021 academic year. In an advisory issued on Tuesday, KAMS asked its member schools to ensure that they reduce the fees in the range of 20% to 25% if the amount exceeds Rs. 25,000 a year. They urged schools to do this in the “best interest of students continued learning and support parents during COVID-19 circumstances”. Around 4,000 schools that follow the State syllabus are affiliated to the association. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the association, said they had advised schools to take this course of action as a majority of parents had not yet paid fees but were availing online classes. “We have advised school managements not to ask parents to pay the full amount in one instalment,” he said. The association said that if the fees of the school management is less than Rs. 25,000, then the special development fees and term fees can be relaxed. Besides this, fees for extracurricular activities and sports can be waived, while a minimum charge can be taken for computer usage, transportation, and other maintenance charges. Many school managements in October had offered discounts as high as 50% as they wanted parents to pay the fees due to drop in admissions. During this period, enrolment in government schools had risen as parents were pulling children out of private schools. A member of a school management said that despite reducing fees by as much as 60%, more than half were yet to pay. “During the pandemic, parents want to admit their children in schools that are economical. If we don’t reduce fees, they will admit their children in other schools.” However, many parents who have already paid the fees, are wondering if they will get a refund. Mohan S., whose children study in classes six and 10, said: “I borrowed from my relatives and paid in full in October. Will I get a refund if the school offers a discount?” he sought to know.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/private-schools-asked-to-revise-fee-structure/article33506239.ece

06 January 2021||Benglauru,KARNATAKA||Confusion over missing U.K. returnees persists||Agencies are still fumbling over the exact number of people that have to be traced among those who travelled from the United Kingdom to Bengaluru after the new strain of Sars-CoV-2 was discovered. While Health Minister K. Sudhakar had pegged the number at 75 on Monday, Rajendra Cholan, Special Commissioner (Health), Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, said on Tuesday that 114 people remained untraceable. “A few passengers on an Air India flight were left out and the Intelligence Bureau sent a new list with those names three days ago. Including those on the new list, when we did an on-ground verification, we did not find 114 of them at the addresses mentioned. We have been unable to contact them through their phones or through WhatsApp calls either, as many of them have given their U.K. numbers,” said Mr. Cholan. However, the police, who have been roped in to trace these missing passengers, present a different picture altogether. A few days ago, the city police were given a list of 356 U.K. returnees to be traced. Of them, the police have already traced over 305 passengers, while just over 50 continue to be missing. Of those people, the police said they had some leads about the whereabouts of 15 and tracing them was under progress.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/confusion-over-missing-uk-returnees-persists/article33506075.ece
06 January 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||Street vendors protest against drive to clear encroachments in twin cities||Protesting against what they termed harassment of street vendors and their forcible eviction, hundreds of street vendors marched to the municipal corporation premises in Hubballi on Tuesday and staged a demonstration seeking justice. Led by office-bearers of the federation of various Dalit organistaions and Dharwad district unit of Federation of Karnataka Street Vendors Organisations, the street vendors gathered in large numbers to protest against the drive being carried out by the municipal corporation for eviction of street vendors from pavements and other places. The street vendors said that without following the due procedure as directed by the Supreme Court and without conducting meeting of the town market committee, the officials with the support of the police were harassing the street vendors and were booking cases against them. They said that the municipal authorities suddenly started evicting street vendors who were already going through a rough phase due to the lockdown and post-lockdown restrictions and were trying to make ends meet. They said that it seemed that the authorities were acting under pressure causing hardships to the street vendors. They sought the dismissal of the Assistant Commissioner of Zone No 9 of the municipal corporation, who, according to them, was harassing and exploiting street vendors. They demanded that any decision on eviction of street vendors should be preceded with identification of hawking zones in the municipal limits and subsequent creation of basic infrastructure for them in such zones. Leading the protest Gurunath Ullikashi, Premanath Chikkatumbal, Venkatesh Mestri, Yamanur Gudihal, Riyaz Dalayat and others urged the officials to immediately return the goods seized from the street vendors without any imposition of penalty and also to take immediate steps to hold a meeting of the market committee as per the guidelines issued by Union government’s Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry. They also sought action against commercial buildings that had encroached upon parking spaces and urged the authorities to clear the parking areas. The protestors submitted a memorandum addressed to the Hubballi Dharwad Municipal Commissioner seeking immediate steps to stop harassment of street vendors. The protestors subsequently submitted another memorandum to the Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad and Police Commissioner of the twin cities seeking remedial measures. The municipal authorities are carrying out a special drive to clear encroachments on pavements by shopkeepers and street vendors in the last few days.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/street-vendors-protest-against-drive-to-clear-encroachments-in-twin-cities/article33506062.ece
06 January 2021||HUBBALLI,KARNATAKA||AITUC members stage agitation||Expressing solidarity with the ongoing agitation in New Delhi by farmers of different States against farm laws brought in by the Union government, members of All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) staged a demonstration in Dharwad on Tuesday. Staging the demonstration, AITUC members demanded repeal of the three new farm laws promulgated by the Union government and said that the new laws were pro corporate and anti-farmer. Addressing the protestors, district unit president of AITUC Gangadhar Badiger said that the agitation was in response to a call for a State-wide agitation in support of the farmers who were on an indefinite agitation for the last 42 days braving cold and rain in the national capital region. He said that AITUC units across the State were, expressing solidarity with the farmers, observing agitation day on Tuesday. Various other organisations too had extended support to the agitation. Mr. Badiger said that like the Union government, the State government led by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had promulgated amendments to APMC Act and Land Reforms Act, which were again pro corporate sector. These amendments would only help corporate houses, those who indulge in hoarding commodities, he said. And, the amendments in the land reforms Act would ultimately snatch away land from poor farmers and also their livelihood, he said and demanded immediate repeal of the new farm laws and withdrawal of the amendments. District vice-president of AITUC Bhuvana Ballari said that instead of resolving the issue, the Union government was employing delaying tactics even after seven rounds of discussion. AITUC office-bearers Ramesh Hosamani, Sunanda Hongal, Renuka Karigar and others were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/aituc-members-stage-agitation/article33506061.ece

06 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||There is no clarity on source of water for 24 x 7 supply, say councillors||Councillors of Mangaluru City Corporation on Tuesday charged the promoters of Jalasiri 24 x 7 water supply project with lacking clarity over source of water for ensuring continuous supply to people. The councillors were participating in a meeting on the project at the council hall. The project estimated to be taken up at Rs. 792.42 crore, which funds will come from Asian Development Bank, is being implemented by Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation. A representative of the project consultant firm said that 160 million litres per day (MLD) was being drawn now from the Thumbe Vented Dam — the main source of water supply for the city. “Out of this 160 MLD, 18 MLD was being used by villages en route and 142 MLD was available for the city. This water is sufficient to provide continuous supply to all citizens from 2023,” the representative said. Disagreeing with the views of the project consultant, councillor Vinayraj said that when several areas in the city were receiving water once in two days now, how could it be possible to ensure continuous supply with available quantum of water. Expressing the need for additional water source, councillor Sudhir Shetty Kannur said that a new water line should be laid from Thumbe Vented Dam to the city. “We know how poorly the 24 x 7 water supply project was executed under the first phase of works taken up using ADB funds. The pipes though have been laid, no water is flowing in them. We do not want the same to happen in the second phase of ADB works,” he said. Councillors Lancelot Pinto, Shashidhar Hegde and Naveen D’Souza expressed the need for addressing problems in drawing water from the Thumbe. Mayor Diwakar and Corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar said that the project involved strengthening the existing water distribution network. And, the issue of source of water was outside the scope of the project. Mr. Sridhar said that a new pumphouse is proposed near the upcoming road-cum-vented dam in Adyar to bring water to the city. The new vented dam will meet the water requirements of Ullal and adjoining areas. A solution was being worked out to provide water to villages en route through an independent pipeline, Mr. Sridhar said. Mr. Diwakar said that another meeting will be held with councillors shortly to clarify doubts over the source of water to fulfil the city’s requirements.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/there-is-no-clarity-on-source-of-water-for-24-x-7-supply-say-councillors/article33506588.ece
06 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Sardines are back but don’t harvest them extensively yet, say CMFRI scientists||Fishermen in coastal Karnataka have good news that small and scattered shoals of oil sardine (Boothai and Baigae), whose yield had considerably reduced in the last couple of years, have been spotted during the last quarter of 2020 by Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), Mangaluru. Yet, CMFRI has a word of caution to fishermen that they refrain from extensive and indiscriminate harvest of these yet-to-be reproductive functional fish. CMFRI’s Mangaluru Regional Centre Head Prathibha Rohit and Scientist in Pelagic Fisheries Division of CMFRI K.M. Rajesh, who were engaged in studying the fishery and biology of oil sardine, have said that all fish in collected samples were immature and yet to reach the reproductive stage. Nonetheless, the shoals consisted of sardines in the size range which was above the minimum landing size (MLS) proposed by CMFRI. The scientists said that Indian oil sardine, which was the most important fishery resource in terms of bulk as well as local preference along the south-west coast (Kerala-Karnataka-Goa), had registered very low catch during the last few years. Their landings had declined to a mere 12,396 tonnes in 2019 as compared to the past five-year average (2014-2018) landing of 77,704 tonnes. The ICAR-CMFRI had, through its research, identified the cause for these fluctuations to unfavourable conditions in the ocean ecosystem following El Nino which, in turn, had a staggered effect on their fishery and biology. However, small and scattered shoals of oil sardine were spotted and harvested along southern and central coastal Karnataka during the last quarter of 2020, indicating that the water in the region was becoming conducive for their survival and growth. The shoals were harvested by small seines (Mattubale) as well as ring seine and Purse seines , Ms. Rohit and Mr. Rajesh said. Raising a note of caution against their indiscriminate harvesting, they said that as their availability was meagre during the past few years, unabated harvest of the small sized immature sardines now would further damage the sardine stock that was showing signs of revival. CMFRI recommended imposing a self-regulation in fishing sardines to help augmenting their survival and bringinig back the stock to healthy levels. CMFRI, Kochi, too has issued a similar advisory to Kerala fishermen and it was hoped that this would help provide an ambient environment for the revival of oil sardine stock.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sardines-are-back-but-dont-harvest-them-extensively-yet-say-cmfri-scientists/article33506577.ece

06 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||We’re implementing a comprehensive coastal development plan: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said that the Union government is implementing a comprehensive plan for the development of Blue Economy in the coastal States. As he inaugurated the Kochi-Mangaluru natural gas pipeline connecting the coastal States of Kerala and Karnataka, Mr. Modi laid out his vision of fast and balanced coastal area development. He said that Blue Economy was going to be an important source of Atmanirbhar Bharat. Ports and coastal roads are being connected with a focus on multi-modal connectivity. “We are working with an aim to turn our coastal region into a role model for ease of living and ease of doing business,” the Prime Minister said. Speaking about fishermen communities in the coastal areas, Mr. Modi said that they were not only dependent on ocean wealth but also guarded it. For this, the Union government has taken several steps to protect and enrich the coastal ecosystem. These steps, including helping fishermen with deep sea fishing, an independent Fisheries Department, providing affordable loans and Kisan Credit Cards to those engaged in aquaculture, are helping both entrepreneurs and the common fishermen. The Prime Minister also talked of the recently launched Rs. 20,000 crore Matsya Sampada Yojna which would directly benefit lakhs of of fishermen in Kerala and Karnataka. India was progressing rapidly in marine exports. All steps are being taken to turn India into a quality processed sea-food hub. India could play a major role in fulfilling the growing demand of seaweed, as farmers are being encouraged in taking up seaweed farming, too, Mr. Modi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/were-implementing-a-comprehensive-coastal-development-plan-pm/article33506583.ece

06 January 2021||MYSURU,KARNATAKA||Bird flu scare: Mysuru zoo, Karanji Lake put on alert||The century-old Mysuru zoo and the Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary are on alert in the wake of reports of bird flu in neighbouring Kerala. “Irrespective of the scare, bio-security measures are a permanent feature at the zoo and all protocols are being followed notwithstanding the reports. In view of the pandemic situation, more safety measures are in place,” said zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni. The zoo management has been adhering to the health and safety standards on a daily basis regardless of bird flu scare or no scare after the bird flu episode in January 2017 when the zoo had to be shut down for about a month as a precaution. The scare doesn’t matter much to it since all safety precautions are in place round the year. However, the general alert is in place following the directions from the government, especially with COVID-19 pandemic situation yet to be over. The zoo has made it a practice since the last three years to send the blood samples and bird droppings for routine tests every month to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal, one of the top labs in the country, after the 2017 incident. It has been maintaining the health data of all birds for three years. “Now that there is a scare, we would send the samples once in 15 days instead of a month,” Mr. Kulkarni said, adding that the birds at the zoo and at the Karanji Lake Nature Park (where there is a walk-through aviary) are in good health with the vets and keepers screening them almost daily. The zoo authorities are also keeping a watch on the migratory birds roosting at the Karanji Lake, which is a home to winged beauties that migrate to the water body. Biosecurity measures are in place in every bird enclosure at the zoo and at the park. Closure Three years ago, the zoo was shut to carry out biosecurity measures after it was hit by avian influenza (H5N8). The zoo was closed from January 4, 2017 to February 2, 2017 on the advice of the experts. The NIHSAD had confirmed avian influenza as the cause of the death of some migratory birds in December 2016. Never in the history of Mysuru zoo was it out of bounds for tourists for about a month. Meanwhile, the Forest Department authorities in Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary are also on alert over the bird flu scare. The behaviour of birds nestling at the islands of the sanctuary are being watched and any unnatural death of birds would be reported to the higher authorities for remedial measures. The visitor area is being sanitised as a safety precaution. “Surveillance has been stepped up not just in Ranganathittu but also in Kokkrebellur near Maddur where a lot of migratory birds roost. As of now, the birds appear to be in good health and no sick or dead birds had been noticed. The precautions will continue,” sources in the Forest Department said. The villagers in the nearby areas had been told to inform the forest authorities in case of any death of birds in fields or water bodies near the bird sanctuary.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bird-flu-scare-mysuru-zoo-karanji-lake-put-on-alert/article33506237.ece
06 January 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Bird flu: Waterbodies under surveillance across State||Forest Department officials across Karnataka have been put on alert following reports of bird flu in the neighbouring States. As this also coincides with the annual winter migratory season, staff will monitor the waterbodies that are in the hinterland which play host to migratory birds. This is in the backdrop of a large number of migratory birds being reported dead in Himachal Pradesh in what is suspected to be an outbreak of bird flu. There have been cases reported from Kottayam and Alappuzha in Kerala too. Special vigil has been set up in Kodagu, which borders Kerala. Prashanth Kumar, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Mysuru Territorial Division, said that they have received an advisory from the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) to take precautionary measures including stepping up monitoring of waterbodies in their respective jurisdictions. This entails reporting any bird death, collecting the viscera or the carcass and sending the samples to the laboratories for analysis, handling the carcass with gloves and other protective gear, etc. Staff will also monitor the wetlands where the migratory birds tend to roost. Signs to be observed include birds tending show signs of tremors, tilted heads or found to be paralysed. Monitoring issues There is routine surveillance in protected areas such as Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary and Kokkrebellur in Mandya district, and Karanji Nature Park and Lingambudhi Kere in Mysuru city. But there are hundreds of wetlands in the South Karnataka belt, and Central and North Karnataka region that do not have regular monitoring as they are not under the Forest Department. Hence, the authorities have sounded out to the general public to watch out for any presence of bird carcasses and inform the department. Last week there were two pelican deaths at Kokkrebellur. Viscera collected from the bird carcasses were sent to the laboratory and they turned out to be negative for bird flu, said Mr. Kumar. “As on Monday evening, there have been no cases of bird flu deaths in the State,” he added. While the monitoring of the protected bodies is not an issue given the presence of forest watchers deployed for security, the real challenge is to monitor wetlands in the hinterland. In certain places with a strong bird watching activity the authorities are banking on birders to inform them of the presence of any bird carcasses. Roosting birds Mysuru region plays host to winter migratory birds that come to roost from different parts of the globe. Hadinaru near Nanjangud, Kaggalipura near Somanathapura in T. Narsipur taluk, Nugu, Yellandur, Narasambudhi, Sulekere, Kunthur Kere, Kallur, and Kesthur are a few of the wetlands where the migratory birds tend to congregate.  As of Monday evening, there have been no cases of bird flu deaths in the State.

Kote taluk||The Mysuru district administration has banned transportation of poultry and other birds from Kerala to the district through the Bavali checkpost in H.D. Kote taluk as a precautionary measure in the wake of bird flu outbreak in the neighbouring State. Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri said vehicles passing through Bavali checkpost from Kerala would be sanitised before their entry into the district and the officials from the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Sciences are on an alert, stepping up surveillance. The authorities had been asked to be keep vigil on sick birds and unnatural bird deaths. The public are also requested to inform the department if they come across any sick or dead bird in their vicinity for checking the spread of the bird flu. The Deputy Commissioner has also alerted the taluk-level officials on the steps to be taken by them in any event besides issuing directions for monitoring of vehicles transporting poultry birds and poultry products. Alert in Kodagu In the wake of bird flu outbreak in Kottayam and Alappuzha, Kodagu, which shares border with Kerala, has been put on an alert with the district administration issuing directions for establishing checkposts in the border areas of Kutta, Makutta and Karike. This is for screening poultry birds and products arriving from the neighbouring State besides sanitising the transport vehicles as a precautionary measure. Officials of the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Sciences were told to act according to the guidelines issued by the government over the bird flu scare. Deputy Commissioner Annies Kanmani Joy told a meeting in Madikeri on Tuesday that all poultry-carrying vehicles arriving from Kerala need to be sanitised before their entry into the district. She asked the officials from the departments of Forest, Police and Transport to assist the authorities in establishing the checkposts and making other necessary arrangements over the scare. She told the people of Kodagu not to heed rumours as the district administration has been taking all necessary measures at the border for controlling the flu. Deputy Director of Animal Husbandry Suresh Bhat said a rapid response team had been set up in the district for general surveillance of birds and control and management measures in case the need arises. On alert He said the department machinery had been put on alert and any unnatural death of poultry or local birds and wild birds in the district would be immediately reported for necessary action. Assistant Director of Animal Husbandry Chidananda said the faecal samples of poultry birds are being sent for the lab tests to determine their health.  Vehicles passing through Bavali checkpost from Kerala would be sanitised before their entry into the district.  Kodagu DC asks officials from the departments of Forest, Police and Transport to assist the authorities in establishing checkposts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/curbs-imposed-at-bavali-checkpost-in-hd-kote-taluk/article33506230.ece
06 January 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Cauvery water coming for Manasagangothri campus||The Manasagangothri campus in Mysuru is expected to begin receiving Cauvery water in about a year’s time. Vice-Chancellor of University of Mysore G. Hemantha Kumar said Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) has agreed to ensure supply of 2 lakh litres of water every day from KRS. The MCC had agreed to pay Rs. 3.5 crore for a drinking water project under which water from Hongalli pumphouse will be brought to the campus and stored in an overhead tank. The University had already paid Rs. 1 crore for the project, which is expected to be completed in about a year’s time, he said. The water requirements of the campus were presently being met by 16 borewells in addition to the 10 truckloads of water supplied to the campus every day. Even though the University had identified two spots for a common toilet complex in the campus to sort out the complaints of unhygienic toilets, Mr. Kumar said a permanent solutioncannot be found till the water problem is solved. Even if they build new toilets and replace the sanitaryware, the hard water from the borewell corrodes the taps and makes it difficult for use, Mr. Kumar said. Similarly, the borewell water was not conducive for experiments carried out in the various laboratories of the Department. University Registrar R. Shivappa said no effort had been made to bring Cauvery water to the Manasangothri campus so far. The number of students in the campus had doubled from 2,000 to 4,000 in the last 10 years. Women account for as many as 1,500 of them. Besides, the strength of students in the hostel too had gone up. The University had also taken up rainwater harvesting projects in about 8 to 10 departments on the campus. Mr. Kumar said the admission for postgraduate courses had started on January 4 while the admission for undergraduate courses had been completed in December end after the deadline was extended by a fortnight from December 15. He, however, admitted that admission of students from foreign countries had been hit this year. “We get about 800 to 1,000 students every year. But not so this year due to COVID-19.” Though a few foreign students had remained in India, many students, who returned their native countries, have not been able to return as they have not received visas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/cauvery-water-coming-for-manasagangothri-campus/article33506232.ece

The festival entails conducting a bird survey to assess the number of species found in the BRT Tiger Reserve forests. N. Mahesh, MLA, who inaugurated the festival said renowned ornithologist late Salim Ali had identified nearly 100 species in these forests in 1939 and another survey conducted in 2012 had increased their numbers to 282 species. It is reckoned that the eco system could be supporting nearly 300 species of birds and such festivals will help ascertain the number of species. He said a robust data could be collated with the help of local adivasis who live in the forests and are fully abreast of the flora and fauna around them. Ajai Mishra, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, said the bird festival is an effort to collate the bird species and similar festivals have been conducted at Chikkamagaluru, Belagavi etc and this is the 7th edition of the festival. He said this is also a platform for ornithologists to interact with budding bird watchers and share their knowledge and exchange information. Santosh Kumar, BRT Tiger Reserve Director; Manoj Kumar, Chief Conservator of Forests, Chamarajanagar; and Natesh, Director, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, were present. Apart from the survey, the bird festival will feature presentations and talks by experts.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/hakki-habba-begins/article33506234.ece
06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,KARNATAKA||ICD project work gains steam; export sector to benefit||Work pertaining to the Inland Container Depot (ICD) at Kadakola near Nanjangud has commenced and is in full steam consequent to clearance of all formalities including transfer of land. An official ground breaking ceremony was scheduled to be held in December but was called off due to the Gram Panchayat polls and the code of conduct in place that forbid holding any functions. But a site inspection was conducted on Monday by the Mysuru MP, Pratap Simha, accompanied by Anup Dayanand Sadhu, Group General Manager, Container Corporation of India (Concor,) which is implementing the project. Mr. Sadhu said the project will be fully functional in 2 years but the work on warehousing is expected to be completed within the next 10 to 12 months. The Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) has also completed the transfer of 55 acres of land to Concor which is investing nearly Rs. 100 crore in the greenfield project. The project was in the pipeline for almost a decade and though the contract was awarded more than 2 years ago, civil works could not take off due to the protests by the local farmers who sought permanent jobs in lieu of land surrendered by them. This led to the tender being cancelled and Concor had scrapped the ICD project. But a series of meetings with the farmers by the stakeholders of the region including the elected representatives saw the farmers relenting to pave way for the works to commence. Mr. Simha said he was thankful to the Concor officials who revived the project on learning that the land acquisition issue had been resolved. Though the project does not come under Mysuru Parliamentary constituency, sources said Mr. Simha was evincing interest in the works as it has a bearing on the industrial activity and exports from Mysuru. A sizeable section of the stakeholders live in Mysuru and this also has a bearing on the industrial and economic development of Mysuru. The ICD will be a multi-nodal logistic park and will have a catchment area of 200 km to 300 km around Mysuru. This includes not only manufacturing units from Mysuru region but also coffee exporters from Kodagu. The shift of material transportation from road to rail is expected to help decongest the existing highways considerably. The ICD will provide a one-stop solution to customs clearance, export-import procedures and shipment formalities, and is expected to reduce the logistic cost. The existing project is also in sync with the government’s policy on logistics which aims for a reduction in logistic costs from 16-20 per cent to 10 per cent of the GDP and reduce the dependence on road from existing 60 per cent to 25 per cent while increasing the share of rail from 35 per cent to 60 per cent.  Work on warehousing is expected to be completed within the next 10 to 12 months.  KIADB has also completed the transfer of 55 acres of land to Concor which is investing nearly Rs. 100 crore in the greenfield project.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/icd-project-work-gains-steam-export-sector-to-benefit/article33506228.ece

District Animal Husbandry Officer Santhosh Kumar T.K. said rapid response teams culled 20,330 birds, mostly ducks, in Alappuzha till 3.30 p.m. Mr. Kumar said around 45,000 birds within one km radius of the four hotspots would have to be culled. The culling operations would continue in the next two days. On Tuesday, culling was carried out at Ward 3 in Pallippad, Ward 1 in Karuvatta, Ward 11 in Thakazhi, and Ward 12 in Nedumudi as per the Centre’s guidelines. After killing the birds, carcasses were burnt using firewood, diesel, and sugar. Rapid response teams will sanitise the areas after the completion of the culling process. In addition to culling, surveillance activity is being carried out over a radius up to 10 km from the hotspots. Director of Animal Husbandry K.M. Dileep, who visited Alappuzha, said the disease had not spread to other farms in the region and the situation was under control. Authorities had collected samples from six places in the district following the mass death of ducks in December and sent it to the National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, for analysis. Four samples tested positive for bird flu. According to the Animal Husbandry Department, around 28,000 ducks died in the last two weeks in Alappuzha. Meanwhile, the Health Department has launched a survey and awareness campaign in and around the infected areas in the district. People are being checked for fever and other ailments. Officials said health teams visited 657 houses at Nedumudi, Thakazhi, Pallippad, and Karuvatta on Tuesday. The teams screened 66 duck farmers in the region. Caution urged The department has urged the people to maintain caution in view of the outbreak. Officials said the H5N8 virus did not usually infect human beings. However, mutations might occur and the virus could be transmitted to human beings. This is the third outbreak of avian influenza in the region in the past seven years. The Animal Husbandry Department has submitted a recommendation to the government for declaration of the H5N8 outbreak in Alappuzha and Kottayam as a State-specific disaster.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/culling-begins-in-bird-flu-hotspots-in-alappuzha-kottayam/article33506214.ece

At a meet-the-press programme organised by the Wayanad Press Club on Tuesday, district panchayat president Samshad Marakkar and vice president S. Bindu said they would focus on the comprehensive development of the hill district and the divergent views of political parties would not be a hurdle. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the United Democratic Front (UDF) have eight seats each in the 16-member civic body. Mr. Marakkar of the Congress and Ms. Bindu of the CPI were elected after the drawing of lots. The master plan would focus on the sectors of tourism, healthcare, tribal welfare, agriculture, education, and sports, they said. “We are planning to give major thrust to tapping the vast potential of the agri-tourism sector, as it will provide the benefits of tourism to the farming community too,” said Mr. Marakkar. Though many tourism destinations had been developed in the district, the potential of many destinations was yet to be utilised properly, said Mr. Marakkar. The local body would set up an IAS academy in the district and priority would be given to tribal aspirants, he said. A separate master plan would be prepared for the overall development of the district hospital at Mananthavady, said Ms. Bindu. Though various government agencies had been providing funds for the development of the hospital, they were not being used properly, she said, adding that the master plan would address the issue. Effective measures would be adopted to mitigate the increasing man-animal conflict, said Mr. Marakkar. A meeting of forest officials and wildlife experts would be convened soon to discuss the issue, he added. The local body was also planning to set up cultural centres in major tourism destinations to woo tourists. The promotion of tribal medicines and opening of more dialysis centres were also on the anvil, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/master-plan-to-be-prepared-for-development-of-wayanad/article33506097.ece

Speaking to the media, K.J. Devassia, chairman of the organisation, said junior liaison offices functioning in rural areas were offering immense help to small-scale coffee growers. The offices provide advisory and information about various schemes and incentives offered by the board to growers. The closure of such offices will adversely impact the farming community at a time when the price of coffee beans has declined to the lowest level, Mr. Devassia said. The Ministry of Commerce and the Coffee Board are adopting anti-farmer polices, and they are yet to consider the fair demands of farmers, including fixing minimum support price for coffee beans, he added. “The Ministry should fix an MSP of Rs. 200 a kg of coffee beans, as the price of the produce had reached the lowest in the past 10 years, he added. If they continue their anti-farmer stance, the organisation will launch an indefinite agitation with the support of similar bodies in the neighbouring States,” Mr. Devassia said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/call-to-keep-coffee-boards-junior-liaison-offices-intact/article33506096.ece

The decision to begin the much-delayed work was taken at a meeting convened by Mayor M. Anilkumar with the representatives of Indian Oil-Adani Gas Private Limited in Kochi on Tuesday. The laying of the pipeline had been long overdue in the city. Disputes regarding trenching of roads and its restoration had delayed the project considerably. Residents of 18 divisions in the city will benefit from the project, which aims to supply natural gas at subsidised rates. In the first phase, city divisions that are located on the flanks of Kundannoor-Aluva road stretch through which the main supply line has been laid will benefit. Residents of areas such as Vyttila, Palarivattom, Padivattom, Ponnurunni, Kaloor, Karanakodam and Kunnumpuram in the city would benefit from the project, said Mr. Anilkumar. The trenching of roads would be completed before June, when the south-west monsoon hits the city, said a communication issued by the civic administration. A meeting of civic representatives of the 18 divisions that would be benefited from the scheme and officials will be convened on January 18 to discuss the project.

06 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Fraudsters roam online with fake SIM cards||Bank account holders flush with funds would better check their SMSs often and be alert to any sudden mobile network disruption lest they risk their accounts getting wiped clean. These seemingly innocuous oversights helped fraudsters rob nearly Rs. 1.50 crore from four accounts in Ernakulam and Thrissur, the key accused behind which was recently arrested by the Ernakulam Rural police. At the centre of the fraud were as many duplicate SIM cards, which the accused had procured using forged identity proofs and about which account holders had no clue. Hacked into accounts Fraudsters somehow vetted and hacked into bank accounts, some of them secured with double passwords, with a balance of Rs. 20 lakh or more. Once they got hold of the mobile number linked to it, all that they needed was access to One Time Passwords (OTPs) to transfer the money to their accounts. This they did by securing duplicate SIM cards using forged identity proofs with the address of the account holder but with the picture of the conman who approached the network provider who seems to have overlooked this. Though the service provider had sent an SMS alert to the customer to verify whether the request for a duplicate SIM was genuine, that message was overlooked and the duplicate SIM card was issued. As the duplicate SIM card was activated, the original SIM card became automatically deactivated and the fraudsters had easy access to the OTP, helping them transfer money to their accounts. “The disruption in service is often mistaken as a network issue or the SIM card getting corrupt, which customers take lightly and there is a time gap in seeking redressal, which is more than enough for fraudsters to pull off their ploy. Besides, while people often check WhatsApp and Facebook, SMSs are largely ignored,” said Cyber police sources. The police also cited the ease with which mobile service providers issued duplicate SIM cards. Service providers “We will probe whether there was any negligence or wilful neglect on the part of service providers in which case we will notify the authorities concerned. Even otherwise, we are planning to reach out to service providers to be careful while issuing duplicate SIM cards,” said K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). In three instances, duplicate SIM cards were procured from BSNL offices in Thiruvananthapuram and Aluva. In the case of a Muvattupuzha-based educational institute, which lost Rs. 85 lakh over two days from its current and overdraft accounts, the SIM card was procured in this dubious manner twice, sources said. “We have also noticed that such online frauds are committed often on the eve of bank holidays so that the victim has no access to immediate relief, leaving fraudsters with enough time to scoot,” said cyber sources.  While people often check WhatsApp and Facebook, SMSs are largely ignored||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/duplicate-sim-cards-help-online-fraudsters-siphon-off-crores/article33506550.ece

Cinemal halls in the State had remained closed for nearly nine months following the COVID-19-induced lockdown. A meeting of the Film Exhibitors United Organisation of Kerala (FEUoK) and Film Exhibitors Federation held here on Tuesday decided to complete the disinfection work within a week. “We will be ready to screen Tamil actor Vijay’s movie Master, scheduled for release on January 13. However, producers and distributors have to ensure a steady release of movies after reopening,” said M.C. Bobby, general secretary, FEUoK. Despite the government giving its nod to reopen cinemas with 50% occupancy from Tuesday, the exhibitors did not reopen the halls stating that they need at least one week’s preparatory time. Three shows a day They pointed out that only three shows could be screened daily as per the timings prescribed by the government. “We may need 45 minutes between each show to disinfect the cinema halls. The producers and distributors will have to agree on the restricted timings and earnings during this period,” said Mr. Bobby. The theatre owners reiterated their demand for a reduction on the tax burden and fixed electricity charges. Antony Perumbavoor, producer and president of FEUoK, justified his decision to release Drishyam 2 on the over-the-top (OTT) platform while stating that he had not signed any contracts agreeing to screen the movie in theatres. “The decision cannot be reversed despite the reopening of the cinemas,” he said. On whether the organisation was adopting double standards over its stance on those releasing movies on digital platforms, Mr. Bobby said they had opposed producers who had released their movies on the digital platform after collecting advance from the theatre owners. Producers’ demand Meanwhile, the Kerala Film Producers Association and Film Distributors Association have demanded the settlement of the the arrears incurred by the theatre owners before going ahead with a full-fledged release of movies.

The civic bodies include Kalamassery, Aluva, Angamaly, Thrikkakara and Thripunitura. The board had earlier assessed environment compensation for the five municipalities for their failure to comply with the provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The civic bodies had filed a report before the board explaining the steps taken at the household-level for effective management of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste. Senior board officials said that a technical survey was progressing to ascertain whether the claims made by the civic bodies were true. “We will take stock of the source-level treatment methods in select houses in each ward. A score sheet will be prepared based on the guidelines prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB),” they said. A total score of 100 is given for different activities. The percentage of achievement is calculated based on the data sheet on solid waste management submitted by the local body. The team deployed for survey will visit at least 10 homes in each ward across the five municipalities. They will check whether the households have facilities like biogas plants and bio-bins for decentralised waste management. A decision on whether to revise the environment compensation imposed on the municipalities will be taken based on the findings of the survey. Despite fixing the compensation, the board was not able to impose it for want of clarity on the guidelines to be followed while fixing it on cities coming under Class II and below categories.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/pcb-begins-survey-on-waste-management-in-5-municipalities/article33506544.ece

Anilkumar has mooted the idea of a professionally competent city manager who can appreciate the growth potential and needs of a city like Kochi. At a ‘Leader Talks’ session organised by the Kerala Management Association on Tuesday, he said there could be a city manager for Kochi, on the lines of such a position existing in developed cities, and that this would be discussed with the Finance Minister very soon. He said it could either replace the secretary or be in addition to the post. Mr. Anilkumar said that the city manager should have expertise in urban issues, have sound legal knowledge of issues and be in a position to appreciate the growth requirements of a pluralistic urbanscape. Challenging times He said the times in which he took over the reins of the corporation were challenging on many counts and therefore presented him with the best opportunity to perform. He looked forward to taking everyone along, not just those who supported the CPI(M), his party, or the Left front. To the members of the KMA, he said he would be seeking their advice on areas where the civic body needed their expertise and counsel. While he would still require CSR funding for projects, more than CSR, he would knock on their doors for management solutions. Mr. Anilkumar also assured them that there would be synergy among the civic administration, the district administration and various departments. “I look forward to attending standing committee meetings and be a part of formulating the programmes in a consultative fashion.” Kochi being a city with cultural roots also needed to preserve and promote its cultural spaces and have more cultural activities. “The basic idea is to instil a sense of ownership of the city in every citizen,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mayor-moots-idea-of-city-manager/article33506542.ece

Gopakumar, Deputy Director, Animal Health Department, Ernakulam. Field officials have also been alerted about the disease. The authorities asked people to be on the lookout for unusual and massive death of poultry. Incidentally, the disease has been confirmed in the duck population in Alappuzha. Avian flu experts have identified the virus as H5N9. “The disease will not be transmitted to human beings,” said Dr. Gopakumar. A considerable number of ducks are reared in the coastal areas of the district including Cherayi, Chellanam and Puthenvelikkara, he said. If any unusual death of birds are reported, advised Mr Gopakumar, the dead ones should not be handled with bare hands. Information on bird death should be communicated to the authorities immediately, he said. Those who are handling dead birds should wear personal protection equipment. On confirmation of the disease, poultry in one-kilometre radius of the place where the infection has been reported will have to be culled. Birds should be buried deep in the soil or burnt as per the protocol laid down by health experts, he said. The public can contact the district animal health authorities at 0484-2360648 for clarifications.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/avian-flu-ernakulam-district-put-on-alert/article33506538.ece

The flyover is slated to be formally opened by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday. The vehicles were found scaling the structure around 7.30 p.m., following which the police immediately rushed to the scene and stopped them on their tracks. The Maradu police have registered a case against 10-odd persons “identifiable by sight”, invoking relevant provisions of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act and IPC Sections 336 (endangering life or personal safety of others) and 447 (criminal trespass). “The situation was brought under control immediately, as the motorists were sent back. Someone seems to have removed the barriers and waved the vehicles on to the flyover without authorisation,” police sources said. However, the decision of the police not to remove barriers on the other side of the flyover and let the vehicles exit along the Ponnurunni side did not go down well with a section of motorists who threatened to protest against the resultant hardship. The police, it is learnt, have noted the registration numbers of the erring vehicles, besides collecting the footage of the incident from television channels. Police presence around the flyover had been scaled up in the face of protests by organisations like V4 Kochi against the delay in opening the flyover despite its completion. V4 Kochi activists who were holding a meeting at Palarivattom rushed to the scene on learning about the incident. “This amounts to people’s inauguration of the flyover. We will take legal recourse and approach the High Court against police action denying the motorists their right to use the flyover which was built using taxpayer’s money and which has already been handed over to the Public Works Department by the contractor on completion,” said Nipun Cherian, campaign controller of V4 Kochi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/high-drama-as-vyttila-flyover-has-an-informal-opening/article33506552.ece

Raghavan, MP, has sought the immediate launch of work on the 28.4-km six-lane Kozhikode bypass along National Highway 66 from Vengalam to Ramanattukara, accusing consultant INKEL Limited of delaying the project. He told the media here on Tuesday that though the Hyderabad-based KMC Constructions Limited had been given the contract after the tender procedure in 2018 April, the company delayed submitting the financial closure statement, which was necessary for the execution of the financing agreements of the project. Mr. Raghavan accused the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) of showing negligence in time-bound execution and completion of the procedures. The NHAI also indirectly supported the irresponsible approach of KMC Constructions, he claimed. Mr. Raghavan asked how the Hyderabad-based company, which had a bad track record, managed to get the contract. He pointed out that the NHAI was also yet to approve the financial closure statement that was submitted after much delay. The Rs. 1,710-crore project was supposed to have been completed within two years. Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari had laid the foundation stone for the project on October 13, 2020. Mr. Raghavan also found fault with INKEL Limited, in which the State government had a major stake. The MP claimed that INKEL did not have any previous experience in executing construction works. Mr. Raghavan said the delay was ironical as funds and land had already been made available. “If the project is delayed further, it will lead to the doubling of cost,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mp-flays-delay-in-launch-of-six-lane-bypass-work/article33506103.ece

Shylaja has said. She was opening a new MRI unit under the aegis of the Kerala Health Research and Welfare Society at an online event on Tuesday. Ms. Shylaja said once the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) clears the master plan, its implementation would help the institution gain international standards. Drastic changes have been made at the medical college hospital in the past three years, as the institution is being modernised. She pointed out that a trauma care system with a minor outpatient section and other facilities at the entrance to the hospital itself was being envisioned. “Changes are being brought to emergency medical care units in hospitals across the State. Facilities at medical college hospitals and taluk and district hospitals are being modernised. The congested atmosphere in casualty wards are being addressed,” she pointed out. The OP sections at medical college hospitals have resting places and are patient-friendly, she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/initial-work-on-mch-master-plan-in-progress/article33506102.ece

Murali took charge as president of the Malabar Devaswom Board (MDB) at a function held at the Azhakodi Devi Temple hall here on Tuesday. Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran inaugurated the swearing-in ceremony in which the new member, K. Mohanan, also took charge. A. Pradeepkumar, MLA, presided over the function, and Kozhikode Mayor Beena Philip was the chief guest. Mr. Murali, who held a meeting with the agitating unions, said steps had been taken to disburse wage arrears. “Funds for the purpose have been received, and arrears will be distributed within two weeks,” he added. On wage revision, he said the State government was committed to adopting legislation in the matter. Outgoing Devaswom president O.K. Vasu was present. Mr. Murali held talks with various organisations, including representatives of Kerala State Employees Coordination Committee, Malabar Devaswom Employees Union (CITU), and Malabar Devaswom Staff Union (INTUC). Committee convener V.V. Sreenivasan said the agitation had been called off following conciliatory talks with the new president. Over 6,000 employees attached to 1,600 temples in north Kerala will benefit from distribution of arrears. Wages had not been paid to employees in last three years. “However, wage revision is more important for employees. Wages were not revised for the last 12 years. A proposal in this regard submitted two years ago was pending with the State government,” Mr. Sreenivasan said, adding that employees were now offered an advance of Rs. 2,000 a month. Temples in Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur and Kasaragod districts come under the MDB.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/temple-staff-to-get-wage-arrears-in-two-weeks/article33506101.ece

The park was built in memory of Vagbhatananda, a renaissance leader in Uralungal (then Karakkad), which was the centre of his activities. The park is extended along the renovated Onchiyam- Nadapuram Road from the railway station to the national highway and was constructed at a cost of Rs. 2.80 crore by Uralungal Labour Contractors Cooperative Society, which was founded by Vagabhadananda himself. The park has been constructed as a model for the State government initiative to develop public places in accordance with the culture of the respective regions. The park consists of statues, an open stage, badminton court, open gymnasium, and children’s park, besides small huts along the way, for rest. There are seating corners beneath the trees. Toilets have been designed to accommodate the differently abled as well. The bus stop, fish market, and well along the road have been redesigned to be part of the park.

As such, airlines planning to start or resume operation of wide-bodied aircraft have been asked to submit more documents on safety risk assessment by January 15. This is as per the requirement of the Director General of Civil Aviation, the regulatory body of the Ministry of Civil Aviation dealing with safety issues. Sources said representatives of Air India, Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Saudia (Saudi Arabian Airlines) had attended the online meeting with AAI officials. Reports submitted by airline companies will be forwarded to the DGCA for approval, the sources said, adding that it was apart from airlines and AAI being asked to stick to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) such as Regulatory Take Off Weight while operating wide-bodied aircraft. The operation of big aircraft at the airport was suspended after the Air India Express crash on August 7. The aircraft involved in the crash was classified under Code C (medium or short range). In November last year, a special team led by S. Durairaj, Deputy Director of Operations (Aerodrome Standards), Southern Region, had carried out an inspection at the airport. Concerns have been raised after the airport was excluded from the list of Haj embarkation points. Incidentally, it was in July 2020 that Saudia resumed operation of Haj flights after a gap of five years. The operation of wide-bodied aircraft is likely to be resumed after a five-member team of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) probing the Air India Express crash submits its report. Earlier, the DGCA had given No-Objection Certificate (NOC) to three airlines — Air India, Saudia, and Emirates under political pressure.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/talks-on-for-resumption-of-big-aircraft-operation/article33506100.ece
06 January 2021||PALAKKAD,KERALA||Keeping good hopes for better days||Dozens of artistes practising the traditional Tholpavakkoothu temple art form heaved a sigh of relief with many temples in Palakkad and neighbouring districts coming forward to conduct their annual festival after 10 months of COVID-19 restrictions. Tholpavakkoothu will be one of the key attractions during festivals, especially in Devi or Kali temples. Most temples in Malabar conduct festivals between January and May. Traditional puppetry Dozens of artistes make a living by performing Tholpavakkoothu in 85-odd Devi temples. The traditional art of puppetry is performed using figures made of leather. After going through testing times during the COVID-19 lockdown, the artistes are excited about performing nearly after a year. “We always used to say there will be light at the end of the tunnel. Many of our artistes did not have any means of livelihood during the lockdown period. They had lost almost the entire festival season last year. This year, with the government having relaxed the norms and with temples coming forward to conduct festival, we are hopeful of not only reviving a dying art, but also making a living with that,” said Rajeev Pulavar, who has been promoting Tholpavakkoothu in Malabar. Bhagavathi temples especially in Palakkad, Thrissur and Malappuram conduct Tholpavakkoothu in order to appease Goddess Devi. Story behind the art Legend has it that Kali missed the battle between Sri Rama and Ravana as she was busy battling a giant called Darikan. Tholpavakkoothu tells the story of Ramayana, especially Rama-Ravana battle, in order to appease Devi. The first temple festival of the season is being held at Kulangara Devi Temple at Edappal in Malappuram district. “It will be followed by several other temples in Malabar. But all performances will be in accordance with COVID-19 protocol,” said Mr. Pulavar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/keeping-good-hopes-for-better-days/article33506695.ece

06 January 2021||R.K. Roshni,KERALA||Year-long awareness campaign on anaemia||The Women and Child Development Department will organise a year-long information, education, and communication (IEC) campaign to raise awareness of anaemia. The campaign has been included in the Chief Minister’s 10-point programme to combat anaemia among children. Expected to start this month, it will concentrate on children in the 10-18 age group and their parents. Special focus Special focus will be on children whose haemoglobin level is below 10. In the case of children in the 10-13 age group, the intervention will target their parents, while in the case of the 14-18 age group, a lot of the focus will be on the children themselves. Awareness creation among parents, awareness and training for school counsellors and teachers and anganwadi teachers, targeted intervention at children who have been found to be anaemic by the National Health Mission, and poster campaigns are some of the programmes planned as part of the IEC campaign. ‘Lunchbox’ A ‘lunchbox’ competition, in which parents and the public can send in breakfast, noon meal, and evening snack recipe combo, is also under consideration. Posters will be put up on notice boards and other display spaces at government offices and schools across the State at the same time on the same day as part of the poster campaign. Monthly programmes, including activities and trainings, targeted at anganwadi teachers, school counsellors and teachers, parents, and so on will also be held. NHFS-5 results The results of the fifth National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5 2019-20) have heightened the importance of the campaign. As per the survey, the percentage of children in the 6-59 months age category who are anaemic in the State increased from 35.7 in the fourth NFHS (2015-16) to 39.4 in the fifth NHFS. The percentage of men in the 15-19 age group who are anaemic also increased from 14.3 to 27.4 while that for women in the same age group fell from 37.8 in NFHS-4 to 32.5 in NFHS-5.

06 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||City cries for more waste collection hubs||The city Corporation’s segregated dry waste collection hubs, which had won much appreciation from the public for its convenience and utility, have failed to expand beyond its initial phase. Though it was proposed to put up such collection hubs in all the hundred wards, only four such hubs have been opened, more than one-and-a- half years after the first one was opened at Sasthamangalam. As there is a shortage of workers to be deployed here, the hubs that were supposed to function round-the-clock now remain closed during night. For the new council that has taken charge and the health standing committee that is going to be formed, the problem of the waste collection hubs could be the one to focus on immediately. “The hubs were very popular right from the beginning. Hundreds of people used to arrive with segregated waste through the day. Though a proposal for hundred such hubs in the city was submitted, it did not take off after the COVID-19 crisis hit and, later, with the local body elections too coming up and the administrative panels taking charge. It has to be revived as we got a lot of positive feedback from the public regarding these hubs,” said a Corporation official. Positive response The first such waste-collection hub in the city was launched at Sasthamangalam in June 2019. The hub made it easy for the public to hand over segregated non-biodegradable waste. The hub has six compartments with top-loading facilities for segregated depositing of glass, paper, footwear, bags, plastic, broken glass pieces, cloth, and metal waste. The four hubs located in the Sasthamangalam and Palayam areas are still functioning. A sanitation worker is posted at the Sasthamangalam hub for managing the depositing of waste and clearing of the compartments. However, the other hubs do not have permanent staff posted, and are cleared at regular intervals when the compartments overflow. Recycling agencies In a city that does not have waste bins, the waste-collection hubs were seen as a useful model to ensure segregated collection of various kinds of waste, which are then handed over to recycling agencies. The hubs were launched after the civic body’s periodic collection of various kinds of waste was found to be popular with the public. The health wing of the Corporation had seen it as a way to reduce dumping of waste in public spaces, Awareness campaigns about segregated waste collection were also launched along with this.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/city-cries-for-more-waste-collection-hubs/article33506676.ece

A total of 25 water kiosks and five information kiosks are proposed to be installed in different parts of the city. The water kiosks, to dispense drinking water to the public, were planned as a measure to reduce the dependency on mineral water, and thus reduce the amount of plastic waste owing to discarded mineral water bottles. With the disappearance of most public taps too, there has been hardly any way for free access to drinking water. Within a month “A total of 25 water kiosks are coming up in the nine wards that form the core area of the city, around Statue, Palayam, and nearby regions. Five of these have already been installed, while the work on eleven more will be completed this week. To install the remaining nine water kiosks, we need permission from the Kerala Road Fund Board. We are expecting it soon, after which the work will probably be completed within a month,” said an official of the Smart City project. Five information kiosks, providing key information regarding the city, are also coming up. Work on three of these are almost complete, while two more are set to be installed within a few weeks. These will be located near the Corporation office, Gandhi Park, the KSRTC bus stand at Thampanoor, and other major locations. Work on the ‘smart’ mosquito surveillance system, which makes use of various technologies to alert the Corporation’s health wing regarding the location, density, and type of mosquito population, is expected to be completed by February. With this information, the authorities can plan selective fumigation of the areas and then monitor the effect it has had on the mosquito population. Smart mosquito surveillance system eliminates blind spraying of fumigation and thus enables smart fumigation.  Park redevelopment Another project that will be completed by February is the redevelopment project for the Ponnara Sreedhar Park at Thampanoor, including plans for improvising the landscaped areas, shifting the existing statue to a higher pedestal, constructing a stage to conduct meetings, illumination works to improve the aesthetics of the park, and an art installation with fountain.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/water-info-kiosks-getting-ready/article33506689.ece
06 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||KSRTC shifts gears as patronage, revenue go up||The resumption of full-fledged operations after nine months has come as a silver-lining for the cash-strapped Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC). Offices and commercial establishments back to normal functioning, partial reopening of educational institutions, and the lifting of curbs as part of the ‘Unlock’ measures are expected to further increase patronage and revenue. Needs of customers Though the KSRTC announced full-fledged operations, the management is operating schedules based on the needs of commuters. On January 4, it was able to operate 3,034 buses for 9,72,634 km and the revenue from the fleet was Rs. 3, 89,770,42. The revenue that was hovering below Rs. 3 crore last month had for the first time crossed Rs. 3 crore, an official said. Among the three zones, the South Zone based in Thiruvananthapuram operated 1,128 buses, followed by 1,091 in the Central Zone based in Ernakulam, and 815 by the Kozhikode-headquartered North Zone. On January 4, the earnings per bus (EPB) was Rs. 12,829 and earning per km Rs. 40.07. The KSRTC operated 2,877 schedules on December 18, when full-fledged operations suspended since March 25 following the lockdown resumed. Fast-passenger services continue to be restricted to two districts and super-fast services to four districts. The KSRTC was operating 5,218 schedules before the lockdown days and the plan is to operate 4,791 schedules daily in a phased manner. Fare cut The KSRTC has slashed ordinary fare by Rs. 2 to win over commuters. Those commuting on ordinary buses up to 47.5 km and paying ticket fares up to Rs. 49 need not have to pay the cess and this has resulted in the bus fare going down by Rs. 1 to 2. The Buses on Demand (BonD) non-stop service for office-goers has also come to the rescue of the KSRTC. But, the escalating price of diesel is a challenge. The price of diesel that was Rs. 70 a litre before the lockdown has crossed Rs. 80 now.  The revenue that was hovering below Rs. 3 crore last month has for the first time crossed Rs. 3 crore||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ksrtc-shifts-gears-as-patronage-revenue-go-up/article33506217.ece

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja told mediapersons here on Tuesday that none of the six persons who had contracted COVID-19 because of the virus variant had displayed any symptoms of concern and that their condition was stable. Except for the two persons in Kozhikode who had been isolated in hospital, the others were in strict home isolation, she added. 41 positive for COVID-19 So far, 41 persons from the U.K., out of 1,609 travellers who reached the State between December 9 and 23, had tested positive for COVID-19 in the State by RT-PCR. As on Tuesday noon, 31 samples had been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, for genomic sequencing, of which the virus variant B.1.1.7 had been detected in six samples. Since the U.K. had reported that there is a decrease in RT-PCR threshold cycle (Ct) value by around two for this variant compared to other variants (indicating an increased viral load by a factor of around four), the Centre had directed that only those samples that are positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and preferably with a Ct value of 30 or less should be packaged and transported. (The Ct value is the number of cycles necessary in a PCR test to spot the virus. The Ct value indicates how much virus an infected person harbours. The lower the Ct value, the higher will be the amount virus in the sample.) However, the Minister said that according to the information they received, except for the six samples which were found to have the mutant variant of SARS-CoV-2, most of the other samples could be sequenced as all these had a Ct value of over 30.  Genomic analysis Epidemiologists have already pointed out that rather than just focus on those who have returned from the U.K. or Europe, the State should be doing random genomic analysis of PCR samples it already has in the repository of scientific institutions and major microbiology labs to ascertain if the U.K. virus variant or any other mutated virus strain are in circulation in the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/all-guards-in-place-against-uk-variant/article33506219.ece

A cake-cutting ceremony at his house in Peyad, with his close family in attendance, was shared live on the actor’s Facebook page. Actors Mammootty, Mohanlal, Manju Warrier, Suraj Venjaramoodu, Nivin Pauly, and others shared birthday wishes to the actor on their official Facebook pages. Debut in 1975 Jagathy, who made his debut in 1975, had remained an unavoidable presence in Malayalam cinema, acting in around 1,500 films, until his car met with an accident near the University of Calicut on March 10, 2012. He was under treatment for a long time, and has been confined to a wheelchair ever since. Though there have been rumours of his return to screen for the past couple of years, nothing has materialised as yet. Initially known for his comic roles, he had proved his all-round brilliance with a slew of character roles, showcasing various shades. More than a comic sidekick, he often played roles which were equal in importance to that of the protagonist, as evident in films like Yodha and Kilukkam . Though the actor has not acted in a single film in these nine years, clippings from his old performances are still a regular staple for the Malayali audience, be it through political satire programmes in television channels or through new age memes in social media.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-solemn-70-for-jagathy-sreekumar/article33506209.ece

06 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,KERALA||Local bodies to form BMCs by January 31||With the new elected councils assuming charge, the local bodies in the State have been asked to reconstitute their biodiversity management committees (BMC) by January 31. The Kerala State Biodiversity Board (KSBB) has written to the heads and secretaries of the grama panchayats, block panchayats, district panchayats, municipalities, and Corporations in this regard. The terms of the BMCs correspond to that of the elected councils of the local bodies. Therefore, once a new elected council takes over, the BMCs also need to be reconstituted. The board has asked the local bodies to urgently take steps in this direction. The Biodiversity Act, 2002 requires every local body to constitute a BMC in its jurisdictions for “promoting conservation, sustainable use, and documentation of biological diversity including preservation of habitats, conservation of land races, folk varieties and cultivars, domesticated stocks and breeds of animals and microorganisms, and chronicling of knowledge relating to biological diversity.” The BMCs, headed by the presidents, chairpersons or Mayors concerned, should have eight members, including the secretary of the local body. The remaining six members are nominated by the elected council of the local body. Of this, one member should be from the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes and two members should be women. Also, one of the six nominated members should be appointed as convener. The board has also asked the local bodies to report the details of the reconstituted BMCs to it by January 31.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/local-bodies-to-form-bmcs-by-january-31/article33506637.ece

All India Kisan Sabha vice president S. Ramachandran Pillai will flag off the buses in which 500 protesters will be travelling to the national capital.  Second batch The second batch of 500 will begin their journey on January 21. In a press release issued here on Tuesday, the Kerala Karshaka Sangham said that indefinite strikes in solidarity with the protests were going on at all the fourteen district centres in the State. The sangham said that the three farm laws were meant to surrender to the monopolistic corporates not just the lives of the country’s farmers, but that of every citizen. Contract farming It was aimed at creating profits for the corporates through contract farming. The Minimum Support Price system for farm produce would come to an end and corporates would purchase these in bulk at low rates, pushing farmers to hunger. This would also eventually destroy the Food Corporation of India and the rationing system. This would result in creating major problems for States such as Kerala that depended on other States for foodgrains, according to the sangham.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/500-protesters-to-leave-for-delhi-on-january-11/article33506194.ece

While evaluating the importance of these historical sites in the State, Mr. Kanna Babu told The Hindu that all the four heritage sites should be properly presented to the UNESCO for getting the tag.

On December 5, 2020, 15 patients were admitted to the Government General Hospital (GGH) with epilepsy, fever and convulsions. The number of patients increased by the hour, and in just a week, over 600 patients were admitted to the GGH with similar symptoms. Unconfirmed reports put the number of affected persons in Eluru, Denduluru, Madhavaram and other areas in West Godavari district at around 1,500. With the situation taking an alarming turn, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy visited the GGH, interacted with the patients and enquired about their health. He held a meeting with doctors, specialists and scientists from various State and Central organisations, who arrived in the town to investigate the illness.  Doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (New Delhi and Mangalagiri), National Institute of Nutrition (NIN, Hyderabad), National Institute of Virology (NIV, Pune), Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Indian Institute of Chemical Technogy (IICT), World Health Organisation (WHO), National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Public Health Department and other organisations visited the hospital and the affected colonies. The scientists collected blood and urine samples from the patients as well as water and food samples and sent them for testing. Reports confirmed that traces of lead and nickel were found in blood samples while pesticide content was found to be high in some food samples. However, the researchers were unable to explain how the chemicals entered into humans. ‘Prolonged study needed’ The State government constituted a 21-member High-Level Committee to study the reasons for the outbreak of the illness and suggest preventive measures. Health Minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas said a prolonged investigation has to be done to find out how lead, nickel and other chemicals entered patients’ bodies.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-month-on-officials-yet-to-crack-eluru-enigma/article33505898.ece

Agitated devotees in large numbers thronged the temple as it is one of the important Vaishanavite centres in the State, to see the damaged structure. A posse of police rushed to the spot and cordoned off the area and restored order. The temple was built during the reign of Vijayanagara emperor Sri Krishnadevaraya and the same was renovated from time to time thereafter. The temple authorities used to renovate the temple arch constructed some 20 years ago at the time of Brahmotsavam every year collecting donations from philanthropists. But they could not do so last year as the annual festival was not held as COVID-19-induced lockdown was in force, temple Devasthanam Executive Officer Bairagi said.

06 January 2021||ONGOLE,ANDHRA PRADESH||Why no arrests yet, BJP questions Minister||Activists of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party burnt the effigy of State Endowments Minister Vellampalli Srinivas and demanded his resignation in the wake of a series of attacks on Hindu temples in the State. Leading the protest, BJP Ongole Lok Sabha unit president S.Srinivas said a series of attacks on temples, including the latest one at Singarayakonda, had taken place but the culprits had not been brought to book. The activists came in a procession from the party office to the busy Kurnool road and burnt the effigy of the Minister near the RTC bus station. The activists raised slogans against the YSR Congress Party Government for suppressing the party’s Ramateertham Chalo protest through the police. The BJP leader saw a conspiracy behind these incidents with a view to hurt the sentiments of the devotees. Instead of providing protection to temples, the Minister was questioning BJP Telangana unit president Bandi Sanjay Kumar for pin-pointing the alleged failures of the Jagan Mohan Reddy Government, he said. He said: “the State will be free from such attacks only when the Jena Sena Party-BJP combine comes to power”. People were waiting for an opportunity to the ruling YSRCP in the Tirupati Lok Sabha byelection, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/why-no-arrests-yet-bjp-questions-minister/article33506529.ece
06 January 2021||Sumit Bhattacharjee,ANDHRA PRADESH||Professors for increase in retirement age to 65 years||Many senior professors from the public universities in the State such as Andhra University, Acharya Nagarjuna University and SV University, who are set to retire this year or the next year, on attaining 62 years, feel that the retirement age should be extended to 65 years. It is learnt that a group of professors will be meeting the Minister for Education and the Chief Minister, shortly, to impress upon the idea. Speaking to The Hindu , a senior professor from AU, said that UGC has already set the retirement age limit to 65 years and about 18 States in the country have already implemented it. It may be remembered that the retirement age was enhanced from 60 to 62 years, by the earlier Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu. As of now the sanctioned strength for the 13-odd public universities in the State is around 10,000, but the there are only about 1,000 to 1,200 full time professors. The required strength for Andhra University, the oldest university in the State, is around 1,200, but the strength is less than 300. As it is there is a shortage of senior and experienced manpower and this year about 100 senior professors will be superannuating. This will further bring down the strength, said a senior professor from ANU. The argument that enhancing the retirement age limit for existing senior professors will dim the chances for new recruits, does not hold water, as there is a huge dearth of manpower, across all universities, said another senior professor from AU. Moreover, if all senior professors go, who will groom the new recruits. Moreover, all government departments such as UGC, DST, CSIR or Dept of DAE, allot projects on the strength of senior professors. And the presence of senior professors not only enhances the possibility of projects, but also increases the rating of the university, he added. Out of all projects that a department gets, about 15% goes into the kitty of the university. The absence of senior professors will not only dim the chances of good rating, but will also reduce the chances of getting good projects and consultancy, said a professor from SVU, who is scheduled to retire, in this year. The professors feel that in the USA, the retirement age for a professor is 70, and A.P. should at least follow the UGC guidelines by enhancing it to 65 years.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/professors-for-increase-in-retirement-age-to-65-years/article33506733.ece

06 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Chinna Jeeyar condemns attacks on temples in State||Sri Tridandi Srimannarayana Ramanuja Chinna Jeeyar has reacted bitterly to the attacks on temples in the State. “There is no security to idols and temples, and there is no clue on what is happening. Most of the temples that have been vandalised are under the control of the Endowments Department,” he said. The seer chose not to blame the government or any individual for the attacks, but said, “if the attacks were on a church or on a mosque, the whole world would have responded.” The temples were like wounded persons and required attention. Everyone should condemn the attack on places of worship whether it was a temple or a church or a mosque, he said Chinna Jeeyar was addressing the media on Tuesday to announce his plans to launch a yatra from January 17 to instil confidence in the locals. The yatra would cover all the temples that were attacked. The locals need solace. Their opinions would be elicited during the yatra. Future action plan would be chalked out after holding discussions with eminent personalities and stakeholders, he said, adding, “Now, it is more important to heal the wounds rather than pondering over things like who is responsible.” “The yatra is planned as the very existence of temples is at stake. It was not correct to keep silent at this juncture. Neither I am against nor in favour of any government. It it not correct to give a political tinge,” he said. When asked why he was silent when temples were demolished by the previous government during Krishna pushkarams, the seer said, “I was not there during that time.” It may be recalled that more than 30 temples in the city were razed to ground as part of the Krishna pushkarams development plans. To another question, Chinna Jeeyar said that plans to organise 1,000 car rally to save 1,000 pillar mandapam was postponed following a report and suggestions given by Andhra Pradesh High Court judge then. But, it was not due to lack of seriousness, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/chinna-jeeyar-condemns-attacks-on-temples/article33506531.ece
06 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||Naidu blames govt. for instances of vandalism||TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu has blamed the government for attacks on Hindu temples and desecration of idols. “The government’s attitude and approach is hurting the sentiments of not just the Hindus but also Muslims. Attacks on Hindus and Muslims have been on the rise ever since YSRCP came to power in the State,” Mr. Naidu said while addressing the party State general body meeting on Tuesday. Alleging that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy was encouraging conversions in the State, Mr. Naidu said, “The Chief Minister is a Christian. I am not faulting that. I believe in Lord Venkateswara Swamy. But attacks should not be allowed on religious institutions of other faiths. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy has no right to continue as Chief Minister even for a minute if he fails to prevent the attacks.” Accusing the government of paying an honorarium of Rs. 5,000 each to pastors illegally, Mr. Naidu wondered “how can the YSRCP leaders extend Christmas greetings from Tirumala and how can the police organise Christmas celebrations in police stations.” Claiming that temples had not been attacked either during his tenure as Chief Minister or during the term of TDP founder N.T. Rama Rao, the TDP president said that the Tadepalligudem incident had been addressed immediately. “In fact, 18 Chief Ministers had ruled Andhra Pradesh in the past, and temples were safe during their terms. In contrast, more than 140 temples have been vandalised during the 19-month-rule of Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy,” Mr. Naidu said. Neither the Chief Minister, nor the Home Minister, nor the DGP visited the temples that were vandalised, he alleged. The government and the police are more interested in filing cases against the opposition leaders than nabbing the actual culprits, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-blames-govt-for-instances-of-vandalism/article33506617.ece

The SIT has completed its task of investigating the allegations about a month ago and still awaiting the nod from the State government for handing over the report. It is learnt that the authorities concerned are yet to ask the SIT to submit its report and some influential persons have been approaching the SIT indirectly to get the names of those named in the report deleted. As per reliable sources, the SIT has named around 25 to 30 prominent persons, including a few serving bureaucrats and senior government officials, former bureaucrats and senior officials and a few persons of repute in the city, who have been involved in the alleged land scams. When the SIT was formed, the Government had committed that the investigation would be completed in three months and the report would be tabled. Thereafter, the report would be made public with transparency. Now, the delay in submission of the report is raising suspicion, said former BJP MLA Vishnu Kumar Raju, who had represented a few cases to the SIT. The SIT that began its work in October 2019, initially comprised three members—former IAS officers Vijay Kumar and Y.V. Anuradha and retired district and sessions judge T. Bhaskara Rao. The interim report was submitted to the government in February last year. And thereafter, the work was hit from March onwards in the wake of coronavirus pandemic. Probe details The SIT again began working from October and the report was ready by the November-end. The report was ready for submission by December first week.  The SIT primarily probed into allegations in six categories such as change of classification, tampering of records, encroachment of government land, grabbing of government land, allotment of government land to private individual and organisations and NoC issue to political sufferers and freedom fighter. Of the total of 1,400 representations received, SIT has cleared around 400 with its recommendations and observation. The other files have been sent to the authorities concerned in the Revenue Department for their clarifications and observation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/vizag-land-scam-sit-awaits-govts-nod-to-submit-report/article33506664.ece

The team included the VRO, Z. Kothapatnam Beat Officer K. Hari and ROFR Surveyor (ITDA) Gali Jyothirlingam. Narsipatnam Sub Collector N. Mourya deputed the team, reacting to the reports published in these columns during the last couple of days, Girijana Sangam 5th Schedule Sadhana Committee district honorary president K. Govinda Rao said in a statement. Mr. Govinda Rao expressed happiness that the officials have at last responded to their plea. The tribal people have been demanding survey of their land and issuance of ROFR pattas for the land on which they were raising cashew gardens for the past few decades. They alleged that some unscrupulous officials had given permission to mining companies a few years ago taking advantage of the ‘gap’ area in between the revenue and forest land on the hill. The Girijana Sangham leaders allege that a few companies have started mining on the hills and others were ready to begin operations. The officials, who had given mining permission in the ‘gap’ area, had failed to issue pattas to them. The tribal villagers of Dolavanipalem, Ramannadorapalem, K. Gadavapalem, Kotnabilli and K.

Appalaraju has alleged. Addressing the media here on Tuesday, Mr. Appalaraju pointed out that most of the temples were vandalised coinciding with the launch of welfare scheme such as Nadu-Nedu or YSR Aasara, or patta distribution. “One incident may a coincidence, but not all. TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu should realise that people are watching him,” the Minister said. When the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak, or when when there was gas leak at LG Polymers, Mr. Naidu did not bother to visit Visakhapatnam to lend moral support to the victims, the Minister said, and questioned, “Why did he visit Ramateertham now?” “Mr. Naidu had never invoked the name of Lord Ram at least once during the Ayodhya struggle. He appears to have suddenly become a devotee of Lord Ram to gain political mileage,” he said. Referring to TDP leader N. Lokesh, the Minister said, “There is a lot of difference between mouthing dialogues and becoming a leader at the grassroots level. Referring to BJP Rajya Sabha member C.M. Ramesh’s detention, the Minister said, “We do not consider Mr. Ramesh as a BJP leader as his affinity with the TDP is still strong.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdps-role-suspected-in-all-desecrations-minister/article33506628.ece

Chandrababu Naidu is raking up the Ramateertham idol desecration issue to gain political mileage, Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao has alleged. Addressing the media here on Tuesday, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said, “Mr. Naidu needs to do an introspection. He should ask for himself if he had visited the Ramateertham temple, or had thought of developing it by catering funds during his term.” “Why is he trying to stir up religious passions now?” the Minister questioned. “Lord Rama is worshipped by all the Hindus, irrespective of their political affiliations. It is wrong on the part of Mr. Naidu to paint the YSRCP as anti-Hindu,” he said. Taking exception to Mr. Naidu’s alleged comments on the faith of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and DGP D. Goutham Sawang, the Minister said, “Following a particular religion is ones preference and a right enshrined in the Constitution. Mr. Naidu has no right to comment on it.” “The TDP’s base is fast eroding due the success of the government’s welfare schemes. That is why Mr. Naidu is stirring up religious passions,” Mr. Srinivasa Rao said. Advice to BJP, JSP Alleging that Mr. Naidu had vested interest in the Ramateertham issue, the Minister urged the leaders of the BJP and the Jana Sena Party (JSP) not to walk into his trap. “Instead of making the desecration incident a political issue, the BJP should focus on developing the State and the north Andhra region by fast-tracking the separate railway zone, the Polavaram project and other development works,” the Minister said. “The TDP may have a hand in the Ramateertham issue. The incident took place during the visit of the Chief Minister to Vizianagaram for the patta distribution programme,” he said. The CID would bring out the truth, he said, and added that security had been beefed up at all places of worship.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/naidu-raking-up-ramateertham-issue-for-political-survival-says-minister/article33506627.ece

06 January 2021||VISAKHAPATNAM,ANDHRA PRADESH||Driving home the message of road safety||Applicants for Learning License Registration (LLR) were all ears as an instructor tried to drive home the road safety rules among them through a PowerPoint presentation, in the packed hall, at the Safety Driving Education Centre (SDEC) on the premises of the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) Office at Madhavadhara VUDA Colony. The applicants for LLR are sent in batches for the training class. On completion of the class, they are allowed to take the online LLR test in a nearby building. On qualifying in the online test, the LLR is issued to the applicant. Attending the test immediately after the PPT is a boon to applicants as the road signs, rules and safe driving practices will be fresh in their minds and the chances of failing in the test are minimised. About three to four batches are being held each day. The hall can accommodate 48 applicants. Awareness has increased among prospective licence seekers and the number of candidates failing in the online test has been considerably reduced, said an employee of the RTA. The two-hour free training to all learner licence applicants is being offered by Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Private Limited (HMSI) in association with AP Transport Department. The training programme is meant to initiate pre-LLR registration programme for all two-wheeler and four-wheeler learner licence applicants of the city. Safety instructors take the LLR applicants through a theory session on road rules, road signs and marking, riding gear and posture explanation and safe driving practices. This is following by a training on the virtual road safety simulator, which increases an individual’s risk prediction ability on the roads before actual riding. All participants of the training programme will receive certificate of participation to further process their application for driving licence. The training programme, which is mandatory for all LLR-seekers, aims at educating learners on the basic road signs and defensive driving to avoid accidents, says Deputy Transport Commissioner G.C. Raja Ratnam.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/driving-home-the-message-of-road-safety/article33506729.ece

Ramesh said his party’s Central leadership had taken the attacks on Hindu temples in Andhra Pradesh seriously. “The YSRCP is bent on trampling the democratic rights in the State, and is treating the BJP leaders and all those who raise their voice against desecration of idols in temples as terrorists and anti-social elements,” Mr. Ramesh told the media here. ‘Why bias?’ Why were the BJP leaders and cadres stopped and prevented from going to Ramateertham when YSRCP Rajya Sabha member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy was allowed, he questioned. “Our senior leaders have asked us to visit Ramateertham to know about the ground reality and inform the same to the people. But the government has not allowed us,” Mr. Rameh said. “Will the government and the police dare prevent Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP national J.P. Nadda from visiting Ramateertham?” he questioned. Claiming that the DGP did not respond when he called him up, Mr. Ramesh alleged that government’s negligence was evident. “Not one or two, about 126 instances of attacks on Hindu temples have been witnessed in the State so far,: he said. ‘CID probe an eyewash’ Senior BJP leader Kamineni Srinivasa Rao termed the government decision to have a CID probe into the Ramateertham incident as an eyewash. “We know how the CID functions in Andhra Pradesh. It acts immediately when messages against the government are posted in social media platforms. But it has not taken any action when a few persons commented against the High Court judges,” he said. Over 40 BJP leaders, including former MLA P. Vishnu Kumar Raju, were detained at their houses since the early hours of the day. Speaking to The Hindu , Mr. Vishnu Kumar said, “We wanted to visit the temple and there was no scheduled public meeting. It was a peaceful car rally, and the State government tried to scuttle it by using police force.” BJP district president Raveendranath Reddy said that detention of the senior leaders was not necessary as ours was a disciplined party and there would not be law and order problem. BJP State president Somu Veerraju, MLC P.V.N. Madhav and a few others had left for Ramateertham late on Monday night, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ysrcp-is-bent-on-trampling-democratic-rights-in-state/article33506625.ece

Appalanarasa has called upon tribal people to participate in the solidarity rallies being organised by the sangham to protest against the three farm laws from January 9 to 12. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Mr. Appalanarasa alleged that the Union government was suppressing the farmers, who have been agitating on the streets of Delhi in the biting cold for the past 39 days. He alleged that the farm laws would lay the red carpet to big corporate companies in the agriculture sector through the contract farming. The Centre will abdicates its responsibility of providing Minimum Support Price to the forest and agriculture produce of tribal people also, Mr. Appalanarasa alleged. The Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC), which is under the purview of the government, would lose its hold, he said. It would lead to food insecurity in the tribal areas, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/take-part-in-solidarity-rallies-tribal-people-told/article33506736.ece

06 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘Main Bhi Digital’ campaign for street food vendors||If GHMC’s efforts succeed, street vendors in the city may soon climb a notch up in digital transactions, and tie up with the food delivery apps such as Zomato, Swiggy, and Uber Eats, towards improving their market. In line with the guidelines issued under PM Street Vendor Atmnirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) scheme, GHMC is launching a campaign to profile all the street vendors in the city in socio-economic terms, facilitate loans, educate them in digital transactions and encourage them to tie up with food delivery apps. Accordingly, a special drive titled ‘Main Bhi Digital’ will be conducted for the street vendors — already registered with the GHMC by December 31, 2020 — between January 4 and 22. As per the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), the urban local bodies identified for the PM SVANidhi scheme will have to prepare a calendar for digital training of street vendors. Each bank should participate in at least three full day camps for training of their borrowers in each ULB during the fortnight. The ULBs have been directed to deploy a nodal officer to coordinate with the lead district manager (LDM). Through coordination with bankers, efforts will be made for 100 % saturation in extending loans to the eligible beneficiaries. District-level monitoring committees headed by either district collector or municipal commissioner will be in charge of the digital training and information sharing.  Comprehensive data The Central government has also developed an integrated mobile application and web-based IT tool for data collection to assess the potential eligibility of the street vendors, for select schemes such as PM Suraksha Bima Yojna, PM Jeevana Jyothi Bima Yojna, PM Shram Yogi Mandhan Pension Yojna, PM Matru Vandana Yojna, Janani Suraksha Yojna, PM Jandhan Yojna, One Nation One Card and registration under the Building and Other Construction Workers Scheme. The socio-economic profiling will be done in comprehensive mode in coordination with all line departments, including ICDS, Medical and Health, and banks. Further, the street food vendors will be sensitised to come on board e-Commerce platforms such as Zomato, Swiggy, and Uber Eats to widen their markets. Pilots conducted in cities like Ahmedabad, Chennai, Delhi, Varanasi, and Indore have given good results, and the same will be replicated in GHMC, a circular from GHMC Commissioner D. S. Lokesh Kumar has informed. Timelines given Mr. Lokesh Kumar has issued necessary instructions to the zonal commissioners, asking them to ensure the pending issues with banks are resolved, and all loan applications are uploaded by January 15. They are to arrange to conduct trainings on digital transactions as per the guidelines, and motivate the eligible street food vendors to come on board with the e-Commerce platforms to widen their businesses. In the city, a total of 1,45,090 street vendors have been surveyed and identity cards have been issued to 1,34,384 of them.  Other ULBs in State Apart from GHMC, municipal corporations of Greater Warangal, Nizamabad, Karimnagar, Khammam, and Ramagundam, and municipalities of Adilabad, Mahabubnagar and Suryapet, are part of the 125 ULBs identified for the scheme.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/main-bhi-digital-campaign-for-street-food-vendors/article33506501.ece

Five days passed since the Pay Revision Commission submitted its report to Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, suspense over basic information like revision in pay scales along with fitment benefit and other aspects continues. The three –member Pay Revision Commission headed by retired bureaucrat C.R. Biswal submitted its report along with recommendations in a sealed cover on December 31. The report follows a more than 30-month-long exercise since the constitution of the PRC in May 2018 and the commission had also been asked to submit recommendations relating to several other employee-related aspects. After the Commission finally submitted its report, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao announced constitution of a high-level committee headed by the Chief Secretary with senior IAS officers K. Ramakrishna Rao and Rajat Kumar as members to study the contents of the report in detail and submit the report after holding discussions with the representatives of employee unions. Sources said a date for the meeting of the high-level committee was yet to be finalised for taking up study of the report. According to the directions given by the Chief Minister, the committee has to study the report in detail and take the views of the employees on record before submitting its findings to the Chief Minister. “It is likely to take some time,” an official said. The employee unions said they were yet to receive any note regarding the recommendations made by the PRC with regard to pay scales nor was there any invitation to talks from the government. Officials said there was still time and exuded confidence that the process would be completed before the month-end in line with the instructions given by the Chief Minister.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/exercise-on-pay-revision-may-take-a-few-more-days/article33506516.ece

Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has spelled out nine categories of municipal workers eligible for the first round of vaccination, which include sanitation workers, waste collectors, sweepers and emptiers, plant operators, frontline ULB staff, vehicle drivers, cremation ground staff, maintenance staff and miscellaneous staff. Fitted into these categories are all personnel working in COVID care centres and isolation centres, personnel engaged in daily collection of municipal waste from households, street sweepers, storm water drain cleaners, beldars, private de-sludging operators, all solid and liquid waste processing plant operators, engineers, Revenue and other department staff working in door to door tax collection, contact tracing and penalty, protocol management such as distribution of masks, queue management at markets and public places, and frontline activities and citizen services such as births, deaths, and marriage certificate issuance, drivers of city buses owned by ULBs, conductors and water tanker operators, staff engaged in cremation grounds, all front line personnel engaged in civil, electrical, and other maintenance activities including junior engineers, water meter readers, plumbers, water supply line-men, and park ground maintenance staff. No differentiation will be made among permanent, contract and outsourced workers. The exhaustive list may cover about 30,000 workers from GHMC, an equal number from all other ULBs, and about 10,000 to 15,000 workers and staff from the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS & SB) and other departments. The department of Municipal Administration has begun the process of uploading the workers’ details in the CoWIN mobile app designed by the Central government for this purpose. The app is, as of now, restricted to the frontline warriors, and not available for common people. Only a few government officials have access to the mobile app, including commissioners of 12 municipal corporations including GHMC, and two Regional Directors in the Directorate of Municipal Administration. The details being collected include name, age, address, phone number and Aadhaar card number of the workers. The vaccine will be given in two doses with a gap of 28 days, and alerts will be sent to the registered phone numbers about the same.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/frontline-warriors-in-all-ulbs-to-receive-free-vaccine-in-first-round/article33506497.ece
06 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Governor calls for unity for mass vaccination||Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Tuesday exhorted people to “keep aside the controversies and prepare to make the world’s biggest COVID-19 vaccination programme in our country a success to help protect the public health, at the same time ensure the best of the morale of Indian scientists and research institutions.” “The World Health Organisation (WHO) too certified India’s vaccine regulatory authority is very much compliant with the international standards. It means we are well equipped to produce and monitor safe, effective and quality vaccines,” she maintained. The Drugs Controller General of India’s approval for the restricted emergency use to two vaccines is a “historic milestone” in the fight against the COVID-19 vaccine and scientists, who worked overtime to come up with effective vaccine candidate, deserve all the praise, she said, in a press release. COVID-19 vaccines coming out with ‘Made in India’ tag is also major step from the pharmaceutical sector towards the ‘Atma Nirbhar’ vision and goal set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. However, as a “medical professional and as Governor”, she was pained to find “some sections of people, possibly with vested interests, unfortunately raising doubts about approvals”. Ms. Soundararajan observed that people creating such controversies are doing “disservice” to the efforts of the scientific community and such negative talk also has the potential to create “unfounded” panic among the public about vaccines. More than 12 million doses of different vaccine candidates for COVID-19 prevention have already been administered all over the world from December 14, and India, with 130 crore people, should not lag behind the vaccination process. The country has witnessed the second largest number of COVID-19 cases (10.03 million cases till January 3), next only to the United States of America and it has resulted in a massive 1.5 lakh deaths. Plus, the huge population is vulnerable to further infection in view of existing co-morbidities, she pointed out. The “baseless” allegations against Bharat Biotech’s vaccine candidate Covaxin, developed in association with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), are “unfortunate” as the firm has made a mark worldwide in vaccine manufacture of 16 varieties. She recalled her visit to the facility and interaction with the founder and scientist Krishna Ella recently. The Governor said rumours regarding vaccine efficacy is likely to impact and intensify ‘vaccine-hesitancy’ among the people and mentioned about instances when some avoided getting vaccinated to prevent polio as it was misconstrued to affect the fertility. Hence, doubts raised by some ‘generalists’, who are not ‘subject experts’, do not augur well for the proposed massive vaccination programme, she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/governor-calls-for-unity-for-mass-vaccination/article33506495.ece

06 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||State MWD spends less than half of allocation||The Telangana Minorities Welfare Department has spent only 43.5% of the total budgetary allocation of FY 2020-21. The expenditure for salaries constitutes around 33% of the total amount spent. According to data obtained by means of the Right to Information Act from YouRTI.in, the total budgetary allocation for FY 2020-21 was Rs. 1,151.46 crore out of which a total of Rs. 658.43 crore was spent. Data under the head ‘budget details for salaries’ shows an expenditure of Rs. 217.66 crore. A majority of these funds spent on salaries were given to the Telangana Minorities Residential Education Institutions Society, over 200 schools across the State which provide free education and boarding to students from minority communities. The remaining went to the Telangana State Minorities Finance Corporation, Telangana State Christian Minorities Finance Corporation, Urdu Academy and other heads such as the Wakf Tribunal. No funds allocated for the T – Prime, which was modelled along the lines of the T Pride scheme to encourage entrepreneurs, and T SEZ, a scheme for businessmen belonging to minority communities, were spent. As per information, the guidelines for both schemes have not been framed, resulting in no expenditure. Interestingly, data shows that the same reason was given for not spending funds since FY 2018-19. As much as Rs. 300 crore was allocated for the Shaadi Mubarak scheme. Data shows that there are 14,381 beneficiaries of this scheme. The amount spent was Rs. 142.98 crore. Further, while a budget of Rs. 28.31 crore was allocated for bank-linked subsidies, only Rs. 12 crore was spent. The Mecca Masjid, which is in need of conservation work, was allocated Rs. 2.35 crore. Out of this, Rs. 1.20 lakh was spent. “It is understandable that the pandemic threw a spanner in the working of all departments. However, not finalising guidelines for T Prime and T SEZ for the past few years in not right. We can see that a large sum was spent on salaries, especially for staff the TMREIS. This says a lot about where funds are going. The expenditure in the previous financial year was much better. Now offices are working and the situation is not as bad as it was since March to October of last year, I hope expenditure and utilisation will be better,” said an activist associated with YouRTI.in. The last financial year saw a budgetary allocation of Rs. 1,344 crore and expenditure of Rs. 1,266.94 crore. In FY 2018-19, government allocated a budget of Rs. 1,973.41 crore and spent Rs. 1,214.73 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-mwd-spends-less-than-half-of-allocation/article33506524.ece

This is the beginning of a gradual process that is expected to continue through the next couple of months. As the COVID-19 situation starts improving and thegGovernment issues guidelines for further unlocking of higher education activities, UoH hopes to facilitate the return of most students to normal academic work.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/phased-return-of-pg-students-to-uoh-campus-continues/article33506489.ece

06 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||BJP challenges govt. to hold Warangal civic polls||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday challenged the government to hold elections to the Warangal Municipal Corporation without further delay and accused it of diverting Rs. 196 crore released by the Centre for the city. “The ruling TRS is afraid of holding the polls because of what happened in recent GHMC polls where we have increased our strength from four to 48. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is trying to give the impression that we are with his party after his trip to Delhi when the reality is he has deceived every section,” said party State unit president Bandi Sanjay Kumar. Participating in a public meeting at Warangal, the BJP leader questioned the government’s refusal to give Rs. 10,000 compensation to people of the city when it had given the same amount to flood-affected families in Hyderabad. “This Chief Minister does not want to step out of the farm house even when people are facing tough times whether it is during coronavirus outbreak or floods. Proper masks were not provided to frontline workers like the police personnel as he downplayed the crisis,” he claimed. Mr. Sanjay Kumar dared the TRS MLAs of the area to swear they were not involved in any land grabbing cases. The government owes at least Rs. 72,000 to each unemployed youth as it had promised Rs. 3,000 for each of them as pre-election promises which never materialised. “Mr. Rao should enter Warangal only after direct transfer of the money to their accounts,” he said, according to a press release. The BJP leader reiterated his demand that the government to release a white paper on grant of Central government funds to TS and accused Mr. Rao of trying to defame BJP as a ‘communal’ party only to hand over power to the Majlis in Warangal. Former MP Jitender Reddy, official spokesperson Rakesh Reddy, and district chief R. Padma spoke. Police action condemned The party leader condemned the police action on protesting BJYM workers outside a movie theatre in which State chief K. Bhanu Prakash was injured. Mr. Sanjay Kumar called up Mr. Prakash and enquired about his well being and said the ‘high handedness’ of the police on a ‘peaceful and democratic’ protest was because of instructions from top. The government, which was fast losing popularity, would have to face severe repercussions if it did not release the arrested leaders and claimed the repressive measures using the police force would not deter the party from highlighting its failures, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bjp-challenges-govt-to-hold-warangal-civic-polls/article33506513.ece

06 January 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Sangareddy medical college remains a dream||It was on November 28, 2018, during the Assembly elections. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had been addressing a series of public meetings across the State. As part of that, he visited the district headquarters town and addressed a public meeting. “There was a need for medical college for Sangareddy. We will establish the medical college in our next tenure,” was what the promise made by Mr Chadnrasekhar Rao during the Prajasheervada Sabha held here. Though the party fared well in elections and won more seats than the 2014 first general elections for the Assembly, it lost the Sangareddy seat with a slender margin and T. Jayaprakash Reddy of the Congress won the seat. In January 2019, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao during the Assembly session stated that the proposals for the medical college at Sangareddy would be forwarded to the Union government for consideration. Two years have passed and nothing has materialised. Last week, Mr. Jayaprakash Reddy urged the Chief Minister to sanction a medical college for Sangareddy and announced that he would take up fast in this regard. District officials said they had not received any proposal for the medical college at Sangareddy. “The government needs to allocated about Rs. 750 crore and 20 acres of land for establishment of medical college. In addition, a recurring expenditure of Rs. 15 crore per month is needed. The proposed medical college was shifted, first, to Mahabubnagar, then Siddipet, Suryapet and, finally, Nalgonda. With the present economic hardships caused by the pandemic, the government is not in a position to fulfil the dream at least for some time, if not forever,” said an official on condition of anonymity. Surprisingly, about a year ago, the Congress MLA and Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leaders had released posters thanking the Chief Minister for sanctioning medical college for Sangareddy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/sangareddy-medical-college-remains-a-dream/article33506520.ece

06 January 2021||Special Correspondent,TELANGANA||Go in for commercial crops: NAFSCOB chief||National Federation of State Cooperative Banks Limited (NAFSCOB) chairman Konduru Ravinder Rao has called upon the farming community to take up commercial crops to reap riches with abundant availability of irrigation sources through Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project (KLIP). Mr Ravinder Rao visited the Kataram mandal headquarters in Jayashankar-Bhupalapalli district on Tuesday to inaugurate the District Cooperative Central Bank (DCCB)’s 30th ATM . The DCCB is having 67 branches and Kataram branch was the oldest one set up in 1978 with over 22,000 customers. The bank branch was doing a business of Rs. 65 crore, including Rs. 40 crore lending, out of which Rs. 13 crore was for farming sector. The bank was providing services to self-help groups, housing loans and other services. The ATM was set up to meet the growing demand in the region. Interacting with customers, the NAFSCOB chairman, who is also Karimnagar DCCB chairman, said that the Kataram region of the erstwhile Karimnagar district was having several natural resources, including irrigation through the river Godavari and the KLIP. As there was abundant water for farm activities now, farmers should go in for commercial crops such as pulses and vegetables along with traditional crops of the region such as paddy and chillies, he stated. Explaining the successful functioning of Choppadandi Primary agriculture cooperative society (PACS) with the farmers going in for commercial crops and emerging number one PACS in the country, he said that they were taking all measures for strengthening the PACS. They were upgrading the PACS to work on a par with bank branches by extending all services for the benefit of farmers, he added. With regard to the plea of extending more crop loans from the existing ceiling of Rs. 1 lakh, Mr Ravinder Rao promised to provide crop loans to the tune of Rs. 3 lakh which included no interest for Rs. 1 lakh and ‘pavalavaddi’ (25 paise) interest for the remainder. District Cooperative Central Bank Chief Executive Officer N Satyanarayana Rao, DCCB director and Manthani Mutharam PACS president Raji Reddy, and PACS presidents Challa Narayana Reddy, Tirupathi Reddy, Shantha Kumar, Rama Rao, and Bhaskar Rao were present.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/go-in-for-commercial-crops-nafscob-chief/article33506511.ece

06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Farmers keep chin up despite rain woes||After a heavy downpour since Monday night, protesting farmers at the Singhu border found ways to protect themselves — digging roads to clear clogged water, pumping out water from over tarpaulins using their hands and bordering their tents using sand. Monday night was tougher for the protesters as compared to other days. Balwinder Singh (58), resident of Moga, said that he was lying on the mattress put on the road under a blue-coloured tarpaulin when it started raining. “Water started seeping through and the blankets got wet. We covered ourselves with a cloth when we went to eat dinner,” he said, adding that a few “good souls” came and handed us charpoys, thick black tarpaulin and langar to those who needed. ‘Not here for picnic’ “ Picnic ke liye nahi aaye hain. Majboori hain . [We are not here for picnic. We’re forced into this],” said Parminder Singh standing next to Mr. Balwinder. Sukhchain Singh, 67, pointing towards the holes in a plastic sheet, urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to look at the conditions in which women and children are living there. “But it’s okay, we don’t have any problem living like this”. Couldn’t sleep all night, said Amarjeet Singh from Haryana’s Kaithal, while showing soaked blankets. On Tuesday afternoon, he and other fellow farmers sat under a makeshift tent while it still rained. “If we won’t get more blankets, then four of us will share one,” he said. Darbjit Singh, 29, from Nawan Shahr who shares a tent with 20 others came up with an idea to save their shelter from water. They bordered it with sand. “We made a border with elevated sand on Tuesday morning so that water doesn’t seep into our tents and beds. We’ve also put wood underneath our mattresses,” he said. But for Hardev Singh (37) and Virender Singh (26), both residents of Ludhiana, the loss was more than blankets and mattresses. They lost kilos of vegetables, pulses and rice. “Rice, pulses, raddish and peas were lying in the open. Everything got wasted,” said Mr. Virender, adding that tarpaulin also broke because of the wind. On Tuesday, road was also seen being dug up to clear the clogged water in an attempt to steer it aside. To ensure protesters don’t get drenched while attending the speeches at the main stage, a waterproof tent was being put up near the stage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/farmers-keep-chin-up-despite-rain-woes/article33506248.ece
06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Women sacrifice comforts of home to join protest||Inside a bus parked at the Singhu border, two women with their children have been residing for the last 42 days, leaving the comforts of their lavish home back in their village in Punjab. Sukhbir Kaur, 51, who claims to be the first woman to have come for the protest, with her 11-year-old daughter Gursimrat Kaur and husband Rajpal Singh, has been sleeping between the two sets of seating in the bus since November 26. “Back home in Hoshiarpur, we have an eight-bedroom house with four toilets and bath. We own 10 acres of land and yet, here we are,” she said. Makeshift home Inside the bus, which looks nothing less than a makeshift home — like all other tractors and trolleys — at the rear, are medicines for cough, cold, joint pain, gastric issues. On the sides, the clothes she washes are put to dry. These medicines have been brought from home so that we don’t have to buy anything, she said. “Initially, we had come here only for two days and I had brought only three pairs of suits. It’s been 42 days now,” she added. Ms. Sukhbir starts her day early, washes her face and brushes her teeth right across the road at the water tanker after which she cooks breakfast in front of the bus. “Three of us go together to a house, a kilometre away, where we bath and I wash our clothes. Going and coming takes us about two hours,” she said. The woman has worked as a nursing staff for 25 years at a hospital in Hoshiarpur, she said, adding: “If I went home even once, my fight will fail. Shaheed Bhagat Singh also never took a break”. Along with Ms. Sukhbir stays Rupinder Kaur and her two children — Jasgul Kaur (2) and Ekamjeet Singh (4). “ Ab aaye hain to fateh karke hi jaayenge (If we have come, we’ll win and go),” she said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/women-sacrifice-comforts-of-home-to-join-protest/article33506253.ece
06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||JNU violence: a year on, students await justice||A year after masked miscreants entered the JNU campus, “attacked” a JNUTA event at Sabarmati T-point and entered hostels and residential areas, protest marches were held on the campus condemning the violence and demanding a speedy investigation into the incident. While the RSS-affiliated ABVP on Tuesday organised a “padyatra against communist brutality” on the campus, the Left parties and the NSUI, along with the JNUTA, organised a human chain and an evening vigil against the “fascist attack”. Blame game The blame game that began a year ago between the Left-wing students and the Right-wing students continued with student leaders from both sides recounting their version of what transpired on the campus that evening. With the Delhi police providing no closure, both sides demanded justice. Speaking at the vigil, JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh who was attacked during the violence and suffered a head injury said, “We are fighting for a socially inclusive and gender-inclusive JNU and even if we are attacked again and again, we will continue to show our dissent and speak our voice.” JNUSU vice-president Saket Moon said that the gathering to observe a year was important as investigation authorities are trying to shelve the matter. ‘Won’t back down’ “We have gathered to sent a message to the government, the police and the JNU administration that we have not forgotten the incident and we will not back down until the members of the ABVP who perpetrated the violence are not arrested.” Ms. Moon said. ABVP’s JNU president Shivam Chaurasia said: “It is really sad to see how the Communists turned violent after they could not reach an amicable solution over the fee hike issue last year. Several ABVP activists and sympathisers were targeted and beaten with rods and sticks. Even the common students were not spared.” Govind Dangi, secretary of ABVP-JNU, said that it was unacceptable that the JNU administration and the police have still not taken any disciplinary and legal action against the miscreants. The AISA said, “Screenshot of WhatsApp messages exchanged before the attack clearly points to a planned attack and the involvement of both insiders and outsiders, including known ABVP activists from JNU and DU.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/jnu-violence-a-year-on-students-await-justice/article33506250.ece
06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Petitioners express dismay at court go-ahead for Central Vista project||Petitioners in the case and academics expressed their dismay at the Supreme Court giving its nod on Tuesday for the Central Vista redevelopment project. Rajiv Suri, one of the petitioners, said that the court’s verdict was a long, rambling, drab and dreary judgment running into 611 pages, containing no landmarks or path-breaking interpretations on law. He said that it merely substantiates and justifies the government’s viewpoints. “The fact of the matter; public lands have been illegally grabbed by Central Government in the most iconic priceless part of India; #CentralVista; Public Trust has been betrayed, India been deprived its treasured free open spaces,(sic),” he said in a tweet. “We are deeply disappointed at the judgment. It is a 611-page judgment and our lawyers are going through it. We will take a call on whether to go for a judicial review,” said Anuj Srivastava, architect and another petitioner in the case. Mr. Srivastava said that there are several lapses in the way the project is being done. “Justice [Sanjeev] Khanna has brought out many problems (related to the project) in his dissenting judgment,” he said. Kanchi Kohli, a senior researcher at Centre for Policy Research, Delhi, said the judgment has generated an erroneous impression that the entire Central Vista project has got the green signal. “Only certain aspects of the project have got the go-ahead from the SC,” she said, adding: “Even the majority judgment says that for the work of the new Parliament, prior permission of the Heritage Conservation Committee is required.” Terming the existing Central Vista area as a “lived heritage of the people of India”, Ms. Kohli termed the majority SC judgment “unfortunate” and “myopic” in terms of the project’s environmental impact. “But still, compared to where we were in September 2019, important gains have been made in terms of the dissenting judgment by Justice Sanjeev Khanna, who recognised fundamental issues brought before the court,” she said. Ms. Kohli said that the government did not look for the “least environmentally damaging alternative” while considering the project and there will be loss of public space and felling of thousands of trees. “The least environmentally damaging alternative was never assessed — it has still not been done. The problem is that a massive redevelopment exercise is being done without detailed discussion in Parliament from the environment point of view,” she said.

06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||SC unhappy with its virtual court system||The Supreme Court took an exasperated poke at the dissatisfactory functioning of its virtual court system while appreciating the Delhi High Court next door for its smooth sailing. “We at the inception must note our exasperation at the inability of the virtual court system to work satisfactorily in the Supreme Court while there is no such problems in the Delhi High Court next door!” a three-judge Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan said in an order on Tuesday. The Bench said it has been since Monday, the first day of work after winter vacations, trying to cope with patchy connectivity and disturbances. “We have been trying to cope with the problem of disconnections, resonance of voices, even when there is a single person arguing. It is difficult to understand this despite more licences stated to have been taken. The only voice we hear is the resonance of our own voices!” the Bench said. The court directed its Secretary General to look into this issue “as it is becoming very difficult to continue with proceedings in the virtual courts in an appropriate manner”. The virtual court system was introduced during the pandemic lockdown. The system has helped the apex court not lose even a day’s work during the few past months.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sc-unhappy-with-its-virtual-court-system/article33506471.ece

With social distancing and other COVID-19 protocols in place, the premises was opened for the public from Monday, ashram’s directorAtul Pandya told PTI . Before the outbreak of the pandemic, the ashram, a former home of Mahatma Gandhi and a historic centre linked to India's Independence movement, used to receive a large number of visitors every day. It is managed by the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust. “People can visit the ashram between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.. We have deployed our staff to guide them to maintain social distancing,” Mr. Pandya said. Sanitiser dispensers have been placed at 18 different places on the premises for the visitors. Currently, the museum and ‘Hriday Kunj’, the house inside the ashram where Mahatma Gandhi and his wife had once lived, have been opened for the public, while the book shop, Khadi shop, and charkha gallery on the premises will remain closed, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/sabarmati-ashram-reopens-for-visitors-after-9-months/article33506157.ece
06 January 2021||Ghaziabad,||Roadside vendor booked for selling shoes with ‘Thakur’ embossed on sole||A roadside vendor was detained by the Bulandshahr police on Tuesday for selling shoes with ‘Thakur’ embossed on the sole. Nasir was taken into custody after a local right-wing leader complained against him. Vishal Chauhan, the coordinator of Bajrang Dal in Gulaothi town of Bulandshahr, told reporters that he was informed by one of his associates that a Muslim vendor was selling shoes with ‘Thakur’ written on the soles. “We went to his shop and handed him over to the police,” he said. In a video, an exasperated Nasir could be heard reasoning that the word was embossed by the manufacturer and he didn’t have anything to do with it; the person making the video could be heard chastising him for not being able to hide them when the ‘group’ came. The police booked Nasir and the unidentified manufacturer under sections 153A, 323, and 504 of the IPC for promoting enmity and voluntarily causing hurt and intentional insult to provoke breach of peace. ‘Not arrested’ Denying media reports, Namrita Shrivastava, Circle Officer, Sikandarabad, told The Hindu that Nasir was taken to the police station for interrogation and that he was not arrested. “We wanted to know about the manufacturer. He told us that he had sourced it from a dealer in Delhi and that he didn’t know that a caste was embossed on the sole of the shoes. He would be released soon,” said Ms. Shrivastava. On why an FIR was necessary in the case, the Circle Officer said she didn’t know the political affiliation of the complainant. “The police got a complaint and we felt that it could hurt the feelings of a community.” She said this was a region where people flaunt their caste on the number plates of their vehicles. “That is done as a boast while this could hurt feelings,” she said, adding both were illegal.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/roadside-vendor-booked-for-selling-shoes-with-thakur-embossed-on-sole/article33506473.ece

Cost of damage The CM also said that the cost of the damage would be recovered from the contractor and the engineer. Twenty-five people had died after the roof of a crematorium collapsed in Ghaziabad’s Muradnagar area on Sunday, leading to a public outcry on the quality of material used in the project that was completed only a couple of months ago. At a meeting on Monday, the CM said such incidents were the result of poor monitoring of civil projects by senior officials and pulled up the District Magistrate, Ghaziabad, and the Meerut Commissioner on why physical examination of the project was not conducted when clear orders were given last September that every project above Rs. 50 lakh was to be physically verified. A task force was also formed to monitor the quality of projects. Apart from an ex gratia compensation of Rs. 10 lakh each to the family of deceased, the CM also announced that the homeless among the affected would be provided with a roof under government schemes. Meanwhile, the National Human Rights Commission sent a notice to the State government on the mishap and sought a detailed report on the incident in four weeks. At the district level, the process of blacklisting contractor Ajay Tyagi, who was arrested late on Monday night, started. On Tuesday, his associate Sanjay Garg was also arrested and both were sent to 14-day judicial custody by a local court. Police sources said Tyagi had admitted that he gave commission to civic officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/ghaziabad-crematorium-roof-collapse-nsa-to-be-slapped-against-accused/article33506472.ece
06 January 2021||Mumbai,||Eyeing BMC elections, Shiv Sena woos Gujarati community in Mumbai||Ahead of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls, the Shiv Sena in a bid to make inroads into the Gujarati vote bank in Mumbai, which is seen close to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), will organise a meeting of the community on January 10. “In every election, political parties try to attract voters of different communities. The Sena is presently the ruling party in the BMC. A meeting of the Gujarati community seeking its support is not a big deal,” Sena’s national organiser Hemraj Shah said, adding that meetings of Hindi-speaking people are also in the pipeline. Mr. Shah said that the inclusive leadership of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is visible in the testing times of the novel coronavirus. “The objective of the meeting is to decide how to move forward and to win votes and more seats,” he said. Western suburbs such as Borivli, Kandivli, Malad and Andheri, and eastern suburbs like Ghatkopar and Mulund are known to have sizeable Gujarati population which can decide the fate of around 40 to 50 wards of the 227. The Opposition BJP criticised the Sena saying that it remembers the Gujarati community only before elections. “The Sena claims to be the champion of the cause of the Marathi community. But as polls approach, it starts appeasing Gujaratis. It forgot Hindutva after the Assembly elections and joined hand with the Congress. Now the Sena again goes back to Hindutva before civic polls,” BJP MLA Ram Kadam said. Hitting back, Mr. Shah said the BJP should come out of the frustration of losing power in Maharashtra. “People vote for a party that works for them. Instead of complaining about others, the BJP should start working on people’s issues. Only that work will ensure votes to its and not whining,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/eyeing-bmc-elections-shiv-sena-woos-gujarati-community-in-mumbai/article33506161.ece
06 January 2021||Mumbai,||HC permits transgender to contest panchayat poll from women’s category||The Bombay High Court’s Aurangabad Bench has allowed a transgender to contest village panchayat polls in women’s category, saying that such persons have the right to “self-perceived gender identity”. A single judge Bench of Justice Ravindra Ghuge on January 2 allowed a petition filed by Anjali Guru Sanjana Jaan challenging the December 31, 2020, order passed by a returning officer that rejected her nomination for contesting a gram panchayat election in Jalgaon district. In the nomination form, the petitioner had chosen female gender and submitted the form to contest from a ward reserved for women’s general category. The form was, however, rejected as the petitioner was a transgender and there was no transgender category in the present village panchayat elections. The petitioner’s advocate, A.P. Bhandari informed the court that the petitioner has always chosen female gender for all purposes and will not be switching over to male gender anytime in the future. The court in its order said that the Union government has introduced the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, and has permitted a transgender person to have a right to self-perceived gender identity. “In the present case, the petitioner has opted for the female gender as her self-perceived gender identity and also makes a statement that henceforth in her lifetime, she would not switch over to male gender driven by opportunism and would continue to opt for female gender, in future, save and except if there is a reservation provided for transgenders in public life,” the court said. The court quashed the rejection order passed by the returning officer.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-permits-transgender-to-contest-panchayat-poll-from-womens-category/article33506159.ece

State Congress in-charge H.K. Patil will meet the elected representatives on Wednesday and Thursday to seek their feedback. “He will be holding a meeting with senior party leaders, including current State unit chief Balasaheb Thorat and former chief ministers Ashok Chavan and Prithviraj Chavan, tonight (Tuesday night),” a party functionary, who did not wish to be named, said. Mr. Thorat had on Monday visited Delhi in his attempt to continue as the State president of the party. A day later he said that he had not yet given his resignation and his trip to Delhi had no relation whatsoever about the change of guard. “I have conveyed time and again to the leadership that I am presently carrying a number of responsibilities and have also said that if the party wants I will be more than happy to give up some of the responsibilities,” he said. At present, Mr. Thorat holds the posts of State Congress president, Congress legislative party leader, and Revenue Minister of Maharashtra. “I will welcome whoever comes forward to take up the responsibility and the party leadership will take a decision on this. As of now, I have not resigned from my post,” he pointed out. Among the names being discussed as the new State president of the party are Energy Minister Nitin Raut, Animal Husbandry Minister Sunil Kedar, Medical Education Minister Amit Deshmukh, Women and Child Welfare Minister Yashomati Thakur, Relief and Rehabilitation Minister Vijay Vadettiwar, former Maharashtra Congress chief Manikrao Thakre, and former chief ministers Mr. Prithviraj Chavan and Mr. Ashok Chavan. The party’s Central leadership is reportedly unhappy with the State leaders who were found to be on the defensive about their lacklustre performance in the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi government, where the other two partners are the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/cong-legislators-feedback-sought-for-choosing-next-state-unit-president/article33506160.ece

06 January 2021||Navi Mumbai,||BJP, MNS oppose naming of Navi Mumbai airport after Balasaheb Thackeray||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) have strongly objected to Thane Guardian Minister Eknath Shinde’s demand that the Navi Mumbai international airport be named after Balasaheb Thackeray. Both parties have been demanding that the airport be named after Dinkar Balu Patil known as DB Patil among the masses. BJP MLA Prashant Thakur said that so far no major project in Navi Mumbai had been dedicated to late DB Patil who had all his life fought for the welfare of farmers. “When the CIDCO had acquired land in Navi Mumbai for construction of the city, Patil had led several protests for farmers. At an agitation in 1984, four farmers died and eventually the 12.5% scheme of the CIDCO was launched for farmers, and now it is applicable across the State. He fought for the villagers in the Uran area when the JNPT acquired the land. He had even steered protest sitting in ambulance,” Mr. Thakur said. MNS leader Gajanan Kale said if Mr. Shinde had sought the opinion of local leaders all would have suggested DB Patil. “We have written to the Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray requesting him to dedicate the airport to Patil,” he said, adding, “It is just another way of the Sena to start a political clash for no reason.” One week ago, Mr. Shinde had written to the CM seeking that the airport be named after the late Sena founder. From the time the airport was planned, all parties had agreed to the idea of naming the project after Patil, Mr. Thakur said. “No one has made an official request in this regard till date as the airport is still shaping up but it is known to all,” he added. Patil was a lawyer while his father was a teacher and farmer. They were residents of Panvel taluka where the airport is being constructed. He was a five-time MLA, once an MLC, and two-time MP. He had started his political career from the Peasants and Workers Party.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-mns-oppose-naming-of-navi-mumbai-airport-after-balasaheb-thackeray/article33506163.ece

06 January 2021||New Delhi,||Tiwari demands CM break his silence on demolition of temple||The BJP on Tuesday stepped up its attack on the Delhi government over the demolition of a temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman as part of the ongoing redevelopment of Chandni Chowk here. North East Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari demanded that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal break his silence on the issue after it emerged that the Delhi government did not oppose the demolition of the temple at any stage of the process. “In the middle of elections, Mr. Kejriwal goes to a Hanuman temple to offer prayers but after he comes to power, he does not utter even a single word when a similar temple is demolished with the approval of chairman of the Religious Committee, Satyendar Jain,” Mr. Tiwari alleged. “We demand that Mr. Kejriwal, viewing all religions and places of worship as equal, should ensure the reconstruction of the demolished Hanuman temple,” he said. ‘CM is anti-Hindu’ On his part, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta accused Mr. Kejriwal of having been exposed as being “anti-Hindu” due to the episode. He also accused the Delhi government of demolishing the temple under a “conspiracy in the name of development.” “From time to time, Kejriwal continues to display Hanuman devotees by shedding crocodile tears,” Mr. Gupta alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/tiwari-demands-cm-break-his-silence-on-demolition-of-temple/article33506154.ece
06 January 2021||New Delhi,||Lord Ram loves Hanuman the most, not BJP: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday said the demolition of a Hanuman temple in Chandni Chowk over the weekend — by the BJP-led civic body — will “upset Lord Ram”. At a press meet, AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said: “We would like to tell the BJP that your animosity is with AAP. Please do not take your revenge from Lord Hanuman. If you will upset Lord Hanuman, it will affect Lord Ram as well, as he loves Lord Hanuman the most and not the BJP. Also, the BJP will not be able to form a government in Delhi by doing this, instead, it will only upset Lord Ram further.” He added that the North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Deputy Commissioner, Satnam Singh, had filed an affidavit in the court, saying that the Hanuman temple could not be demolished due to ongoing festivals but preparations have been done. He also gave the court the date on which the temple would be demolished. The temple was demolished on January 3. Mr. Bharadwaj also denied the BJP’s allegations about AAP demolishing the Hanuman temple in Chandni Chowk and termed them “false”. “How is it possible that without informing the Mayor and the Standing Committee of the BJP, their top official is writing an affidavit and saying we have done all the preparations and the temple will soon be demolished? BJP leader Adesh Gupta should answer this,” he added.   Meanwhile, AAP MP Sanjay Singh said the BJP is showing “shameful reluctance” to accept demands of protesting farmers. ‘BJP torturing farmers’ “The BJP is torturing the farmers by lathi-charge and tear gas. The BJP is insulting the farmers by calling them Khalistani terrorists, agents of China and Pakistan. The Centre is not representing the citizens of India, but capitalists like Adani and Ambani. The struggle of the farmers will continue till the demands are met,” Mr. Singh said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/lord-ram-loves-hanuman-the-most-not-bjp-aap/article33506148.ece
06 January 2021||New Delhi,||BJP challenges Sisodia to open debate||The Delhi BJP on Tuesday challenged Education Minister Manish Sisodia to an open debate on the city government’s education model, which the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has said should be replicated in Uttar Pradesh — after announcing its intention to contest the upcoming Assembly polls in the State. Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana accused Mr. Sisodia of “political tourism” to fulfill AAP’s aspirations of expansion on the basis of the Delhi government’s education model, “when no new school had been built in Delhi in the last six years”. “There were 1,030 schools when the AAP came to power and the number is the same today. According to the Kejriwal-led government, they built 13,000 rooms in schools. Delhi has 1,200 government-funded schools, which means an addition of 10 to 12 rooms in every school,” Mr. Khurana said. “There are 9,024 vacant posts of teachers at government schools; guest teachers and around 19,000 employees have not received their salaries for three to four months. The CM and his deputy have said on many occasions that they want to make Delhi’s children doctors and engineers but only 331 out of 1,030 schools teach science,” he said, adding that the government built five schools in the name of infrastructure and named them Schools of Excellence.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-challenges-sisodia-to-open-debate/article33506146.ece

Taking note of a report furnished by the Delhi forest department, a Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said, “Let further action be taken expeditiously in accordance with law.” In its report dated December 29, the PCCF had said that during inspection it was found that among the 12 trees (present), two branches of one tree and two branches of another were pruned without prior approval. “Apart from the illegal pruning, illegal felling of a tree was also observed in the plot on the basis of previous years Google Earth images,” the report said. It stated the owner of the plot was issued show cause notices and during the hearing informed officials that the BSES was carrying out pruning in the area.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/act-against-illegal-felling-of-trees-ngt/article33506145.ece
06 January 2021||New Delhi,||Plea seeks compensation for ‘illegal occupation’||A suit has been filed before the High Court seeking compensation for loss of rent and interest due to alleged illegal occupation of a flat in Ansal Bhawan here by the Directorate of Estates, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs between 1999 and 2020. The suit is collectively filed by Rajiv Sarin, Deepak Sarin and Radhika Sarin, children of 94-year-old widow Ms. Vera Sarin. The plea stated that between 1974 and 1976, raids were conducted in the business premises of late H.K. Sarin, father of the petitioners. In 1975, the Delhi government issued a preventive detention order under the provisions of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA). Later in 1980, late H.K. Sarin was issued show cause notice to explain the sources of income, earnings and means by which various assets, including the property in Ansal Bhawan were acquired. The notice was issued under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976 (SAFEMA) on the basis of the order passed under COFEPOSA. In 2014, the HC declared the case instituted against late H.K. Sarin under SAFEMA as “nullity”. Petitioners have asked the Centre to pay them Rs. 2.20 crore compensation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/plea-seeks-compensation-for-illegal-occupation/article33506141.ece

06 January 2021||Pune,||Centre should give free vaccine to the poor, says Rajesh Tope||Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said on Tuesday that the State government would seek more clarification from the Centre on the Covishield and Covaxin vaccines approved for restricted emergency use before launching a mass inoculation drive. He also urged the Centre to provide vaccines free to those living below poverty line. “We are seeking some clarifications from the Centre regarding the approved vaccines as they have been cleared for use citing the emergency pandemic situation. We will raise our concerns on the vaccines at a national video conference with Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan on January 7,” said Mr. Tope, adding that the Centre might also inform the State government in the next few days about the availability of dosages. He said that cold storage facilities and supply chains were being set up in Maharashtra and a dry run would be conducted on January 8 to check for preparedness. “Maharashtra will join the nationwide dry run on January 8, which will be conducted in every district. This ‘mock drill’ will help determine the efficacy of the mass vaccination system,” Mr. Tope said. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Tope said that those living on the social margins would not be able to bear the cost of Rs. 500 for two doses of the vaccine and suggested that the Centre bear the cost of purchasing vaccines and supplying them in the State. Mr. Tope said the Centre had already stopped the supply of masks, ventilators and RT-PCR kits, and the cost is now being borne by the State government. Flights from U.K. He also expressed concern over the possibility of resumption of flights between India and the United Kingdom from January 8, given the prevalence of the new strain of virus that has emerged there. “The State authorities have traced 95% of the passengers who landed in Mumbai from the U.K. and Europe between November 25 and December 21. However, if more passengers start arriving, we will have to increase the screening and testing facilities,” Mr. Tope said. On Monday, the State Health Department had announced that the samples of eight U.K. returnees from Maharashtra had tested positive for the new strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has already urged the Centre to help quarantine passengers who were entering Maharashtra after landing at airports in other States. Of the eight samples, five are from Mumbai, one from Pune and one each from Thane and Mira-Bhayander in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). Mr. Tope said all those who tested positive are stable and lodged in institutional quarantine.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/centre-should-give-free-vaccine-to-the-poor-says-rajesh-tope/article33506156.ece

06 January 2021||Dalton,||‘Will fight like hell to save presidency’||With mounting desperation, Donald Trump declared on Monday night he would “fight like hell” to hold on to the presidency and appealed to Republican lawmakers to reverse his election loss to Joe Biden when they convene this week to confirm the Electoral College vote. Electoral voters won by President-elect Biden are “not gonna take this White House!” he shouted as supporters cheered at an outdoor rally in Georgia. Mr. Trump’s announced purpose for the trip was to boost Republican Senate candidates in Tuesday’s runoff election, but he spent much of his speech complaining bitterly about his election loss — which he insists he won “by a lot”. Earlier, in Washington, he pressed Republican lawmakers to formally object to certification of results on Wednesday at a joint session of Congress that is to confirm Mr. Biden’s victory in the Electoral College, which in itself is a confirmation of Mr. Biden’s nationwide victory on November 3. Though he got nothing but cheers on Monday night, Mr. Trump’s attempt to overturn the presidential election is splitting the Republican Party. Some GOP lawmakers backing him are rushing ahead, despite an outpouring of condemnation from current and former party officials warning that the effort is undermining Americans’ faith in democracy. All 10 living former Defense Secretaries wrote in an op-ed article that “the time for questioning the results has passed”. It is unclear the extent to which GOP leaders in Congress will be able to control Wednesday’s joint session, which could drag into the night, though the challenges to the election are all but certain to fail. Mr. Trump himself is whipping up crowds for a Wednesday rally near the White House. Vice-President Mike Pence, who is under pressure to tip the results for Mr. Trump, will be closely watched as he presides in a ceremonial role over Wednesday’s session. “I promise you this: On Wednesday, we’ll have our day in Congress,” Mr. Pence said while himself campaigning in Georgia ahead of Tuesday’s runoff elections that will determine control of the Senate. Mr. Trump said in Georgia: “I hope that our great Vice-President comes through for us. He’s a great guy. Of course, if he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him quite as much.” He added, “No, Mike is a great guy.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/will-fight-like-hell-to-save-presidency/article33505798.ece
06 January 2021||Al-Ula,||Gulf leaders sign deal to end years-long dispute||Gulf leaders signed a “solidarity and stability” deal on Tuesday after leaders of Saudi Arabia and Qatar publicly embraced, bringing Doha back into the regional fold after a three-year-long rift. Saudi Arabia had led a coalition of countries in the Gulf and beyond to cut ties and transport links with Qatar in June 2017, charging that it was too close to Iran and backed radical Islamist groups — allegations that Doha denied. Those countries, along with Oman and Kuwait, which have mediated between the two sides, signed a deal in Al-Ula, after Riyadh overnight re-opened its land, sea and air borders to Doha. “There is a desperate need today to unite our efforts to promote our region and to confront challenges that surround us, especially the threats posed by the Iranian regime's nuclear and ballistic missile programme and its plans for sabotage and destruction,” said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The details of the agreement were not immediately released, and analysts warned that any deal could be preliminary in nature and may not immediately end all the measures taken against Qatar. But the warm welcome that Prince Mohammed extended to Qatar’s ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, with the pair embracing at the airport and then chatting animatedly, indicates a significant breakthrough.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/gulf-leaders-sign-deal-to-end-years-long-dispute/article33505796.ece
06 January 2021||COLOMBO,||An Indian gift helps Sri Lanka’s COVID-19 fight||Less than five years after its launch, an India-funded free ambulance service is playing a vital role in Sri Lanka’s COVID-19 response, according to health sector officials. “Over the last few months, the ‘1990 Suwa Seriya’ Emergency Ambulance service has doubled its efforts, attending not just to medical emergencies, but also helping us transfer COVID-19 patients, including those with co-morbidities, to hospitals swiftly,” said Dr. Sunil de Alwis, Additional Secretary, Medical Services, Ministry of Health. For this, the service coordinates with the Health Ministry, Public Health Inspectors, and the Epidemiology Unit to ensure that coronavirus patients are able to access treatment at the right hospital, without losing time. On Sri Lanka’s request, India provided a grant of $7.56 million for the Suwa Seriya [vehicle or journey for good health] service, launched first in 2016, in Sri Lanka’s Western and Southern Provinces, with 88 ambulances. In the next couple of years, the ‘1990’ service was expanded to cover all nine provinces in the island, with a fleet of 297 ambulances — Sri Lanka purchased them from Tata Motors — with an additional Indian grant of $15.09 million. It is India’s second largest grant project in the island, after the housing project of more than 60,000 houses, with a nearly $400 million grant. The idea of launching such an ambulance service came not at any high-level bilateral discussion. It was a proposal made by Harsha de Silva, then a junior Minister and now opposition parliamentarian. “Sri Lanka didn’t have a pre-hospital emergency ambulance service until 2016 ,” Mr. de Silva, an MP with the main opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB, or United People’s Front), told The Hindu . The grant, he recalled, was in the context of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka in March 2015. “The Indian side put forward only one condition. That after the launch and the initial phase, the government of Sri Lanka must take over the ambulance service and run it. We readily agreed.”  Resistance to service Following bilateral deliberations and paperwork, the service was launched about a year later. Not without resistance, though. Some, including nationalist groups and an influential trade union of government doctors, vehemently opposed the “Indian ambulance”, on grounds that Sri Lankan health workers would lose jobs to Indian counterparts, quality, and national pride. After setting up the service, New Delhi and Colombo organised training for Sri Lankan emergency medical technicians. “The hands-on training in India has really helped our emergency medical technicians. They now undergo other refresher programmes periodically,” said Sohan de Silva, CEO of the 1990 Suwa Seriya Foundation, a semi-government, not-for-profit organisation functioning under the Ministry of Health. After the initial partnership in training and operations, India exited the scene. “While we have a sticker saying ‘This is a gift from the people of India with the Indian flag on each ambulance, there is no Indian connection in the running of this service now,” Mr. Harsha de Silva said. “It is Sri Lanka’s, run entirely by Sri Lankans.” Despite meeting initial resistance, the service gradually gained popularity, more apparent after COVID-19 struck. In March, when Sri Lanka’s first wave of the pandemic struck, the 1990 call centre noticed a surge in calls — from about 5,300 a day to 9,000. It meant that the ambulances were attending to at least 500 more cases than the daily average of 1,050. Sri Lanka contained its first wave of the coronavirus effectively, but the second wave since October has proved rather challenging. During this time, the number of coronavirus fatalities rose from 13 to 215, while the number of infections went up from 3,300 to over 45,000. “Attending to COVID-19 cases isn’t easy, as all the staff have to be in full PPE and disinfect the vehicle after every hospital transfer,” Dr. de Alwis said. “But we are really happy with this service and greatly appreciate the Indian assistance. In fact, it would be wonderful if India can help us expand this service even more,” he said. “The success of this service is seen in the trust people have on it. No greater validation than that,” Mr. de Silva said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/an-indian-gift-helps-sri-lankas-covid-19-fight/article33505801.ece

The measures will be reviewed from February 15, he said, but the government cannot “predict with certainty: whether they will be lifted then”, said Mr. Gove. “I think it is right to say that as we enter March, we should be able to lift some of these restrictions but not necessarily all,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/englands-lockdown-could-last-into-march-says-minister/article33505792.ece
06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Alibaba to stop online music streaming service amid probe||China’s e-commerce giant, the Alibaba Group, on Tuesday announced it will close a popular music streaming platform, Xiami Music. The announcement comes amid continuing investigations into the group and questions surrounding the future of its founder, Jack Ma. Xiami Music said it will stop the service “due to operational adjustments” from February 5, marking an end to Alibaba’s online music streaming platform. It was launched in 2008 and acquired by Alibaba five years later. It remains unclear if the closure of the platform will be followed by further restructuring of Alibaba’s businesses, which have expanded beyond e-commerce to financial services — which is currently under the scanner by regulators — and a range of other online businesses. The troubles for Alibaba started on the eve of the initial public offering (IPO) of its Ant Group, its financial arm and the company behind Alipay, China’s biggest digital payments company. The IPO was expected to be a world record-breaking one and was likely to raise $35 billion. But it was suspended by regulators in early November. This followed a speech by Mr. Ma in Shanghai at a high-profile financial forum. The speech was thought to have angered regulators as Mr. Ma took aim at China’s financial system and labelled state-run banks, whose monopoly has been challenged by his group’s entry into online financial services, as “pawn shops”. ‘Monopolistic acts’ On December 24, the State Administration for Market Regulation said it had launched a probe into Alibaba’s “suspected monopolistic acts”, including “forcing merchants to choose one platform between two competitors”. China’s state media said Mr. Ma was “summoned” for talks ahead of the IPO, and talks with regulators are ongoing. The People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank, said last month that it was, along with the banking and insurance regulator and the securities regulator, holding talks with the Ant Group that were aimed at “implementing financial regulatory requirements, holding onto fair competition and protecting consumers’ legitimate rights”. Mr. Ma has cut back on public appearances since his high-profile attendance at the Shanghai forum and the ensuing controversy. So far, neither regulators nor the state media in China have accused Mr. Ma of personal wrongdoing, but he has been asked, according to Bloomberg , to stay in the country while investigations into the group continue.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/alibaba-to-stop-online-music-streaming-service-amid-probe/article33505799.ece
06 January 2021||Atlanta,||Georgia goes to polls for key Senate runoffs||After an unprecedented campaign that mobilised Donald Trump and his White House successor Joe Biden, Georgians troop to the polls on Tuesday for two closely-watched U.S. Senate runoffs that could shape the first years of the new Democratic presidency. For nearly 20 years, Georgia has voted reliably Republican in the presidential election and Senate contests. But Mr. Biden pulled off a shock victory in Georgia in November, one of the several States that he flipped to win the White House, and the races for the Senate have come down to the wire in the biggest, most expensive congressional runoffs in U.S. history. Polls open at 7 a.m. in the southern State. A record three million-plus people have voted early, election officials say, and final results may not be known for several days. Massive spending A staggering $832 million has been spent on the two contests, including spending in the primary and general elections, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.  If Democrats flip both seats, they win back the Senate, effectively handing Mr. Biden all the levers of political power in Washington and helping him enact his ambitious legislative agenda.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/georgia-goes-to-poll-for-key-senate-runoffs/article33505793.ece

06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||The dark step of writing hate into law||Chaudhary Charan Singh, the former Prime Minister, made a proposal to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954. As a Minister in the Uttar Pradesh government, he wanted Nehru to pass a law so that jobs as gazetted officers could only be for those who wanted to or had married outside their caste (https://bit.ly/3oc4ALv). Nehru turned the proposal down because this struck at the exercise of the free will of individual citizens in India. Setting a precedent It is an indicator of the distance travelled since; that Charan Singh’s State (Uttar Pradesh) has an ordinance which criminalises inter-faith marriages. The U.P. government’s focus is firmly on ‘protecting’ Hindu women from marrying Muslim men. It does this under the pretext of regulating religious conversions. The law in U.P. has already set a precedent for other States ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) such as Madhya Pradesh. In another BJP-ruled State neighbouring U.P., namely Uttarakhand, a routine press release from the Social Welfare department highlighted a scheme incentivising inter-faith and inter-caste marriages. This threatened the communal world view being rapidly ushered in through a series of so-called ‘Freedom of Religion’ laws in BJP-ruled States. The press release was seen so out-of-step by the State government, that an inquiry was ordered by the Chief Minister. In 1872, the colonial state drew up a law after it received petitions from Keshub Chandra Sen of the Brahmo Samaj demanding that people of different backgrounds be allowed to marry according to their ‘rites of conscience’. The Special Marriage Act, in 1954, took this further in independent India by taking away the colonial law’s requirement to renounce religion. However, it still allowed intrusion by the state, unlike under personal laws, by demanding notices to be put up in advance. This was done to ensure there were no living spouses or minors being married, but this clause was misused by communal social groups to stop such unions (https://bit.ly/3okStM4). In BJP-ruled States, there are many other recent ‘laws’ — on slaughter of cattle, marriage, and religious conversions — which taken together, target Muslims, both by denying them shared social spaces and their rights as equal citizens of the republic. It also destroys the long-standing fraternity in everyday lives that has long defined India. The ordinance by U.P., the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, and the Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Bill, 2020 are particularly vicious on at least four counts. Fundamentally wrong Under the Constitution, it is the individual citizen who has and exercises rights and obligations. But these new laws treat religious communities, instead of individual citizens, as basic entities. By taking away the agency that the Indian Constitution allows each individual to exercise, this fundamentally distorts the framework of our republic. For those who argue that the Constitution does address communities when speaking of minority rights and untouchability, it is to only acknowledge and overcome social discrimination because that impedes the ability of those citizens to exercise their rights as individuals. By seeing the world as split between ‘Hindus’ and ‘Muslims’, a khap-ian universe, a fundamental modern characteristic of the guarantee of autonomy to all Indians as individuals is broken. Violate privacy, choice rights Second, these laws blatantly violate the Right to Privacy, which the Supreme Court of India in a much-lauded judgment in 2017, decreed to be fundamental. The level of state interference in a civil union, which is a solemnisation of a relationship between two individuals, breaches the basic structure of the Constitution. Third, the provisions impede the exercise of an individual’s right to choose her faith without seeking state sanction. Under these new laws, everyone — from the police, local administration and communal groups and families — are given ample time to interfere and deny the individual, without any locus to do so. In matters of change of profession, nationalities, electoral choices and even political parties, no such interference is brought into play. The ruling by the Supreme Court (1977), which upheld earlier restrictions to convert by the States of Madhya Pradesh and Odisha (https://bit.ly/394c4tv), said it did so to penalise “conversion by force, fraud or by allurement. The other element is that every person has a right to profess his own religion and to act according to it. Any interference with that right of the other person by resorting to conversion by force or allurement cannot, in our opinion, be said to contravene Article 25(1) of the Constitution of India, as the article guarantees religious freedom subject to public health (https://bit.ly/2LjX8zm)”. By making “propagation” contentious, the 1977 ruling pushed back freedoms in Article 25, so the mass conversion of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar to Buddhism could invite a jail sentence! Instead of rescinding the 1977 ruling, these laws further criminalise an individual’s choice of faith. Fourth, the basis of the new law is deeply patriarchal. The nightmare that India traversed in the 1920s, with competitive communalism fanning charges of Hindu betis in North India being taken away like cattle, are being relived now. The pernicious myth of ‘love jihad’ where adult women are seen as property, is not just a pamphlet or WhatsApp message. It is now the law. We saw a brief preview in 2017 of the dark consequences of the ‘Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020’ when the law confronted Hadiya, a 25-year-old health professional from Kerala, for her marital choice a year after converting to Islam. This law targets Muslim men, but is also a living hell for Hindu women. Cost of inaction It is with good reason that India is said to have effected a social transformation, thanks to the values spelt out and written into the law of the Republic. The Constitution offered high principles to aspire for, which Indians may never fully live up to. But that may have been the intention, to set high standards and ensure we were always jumping just a little bit, to be better. All laws should meet that brief. However, these new laws do the opposite; they put state power and the law itself behind majoritarian communal biases which empower regressive social mores governing marriage and fellowship. Inter-religious marriages may be less than 2.5% of all marriages, but the promise they hold goes beyond numbers. They reaffirm the fundamental constitutional premise of all citizens being equal, besides promoting the ideals of freedom and fraternity. It is diabolical To fan rumours of ‘love jihad’ even as the government confirmed in Parliament that there was no evidence of it, is diabolical. But more than that, it is downright dangerous as it seeds mistrust, and changes fundamental and basic ground rules that all plural democracies must live by. It is for the court to suo motu strike these laws down if it wants to preserve the basic structure of the constitutional edifice. In September 1935 when Hitler enacted the Nuremberg Race Laws, it was fear of the Mischling or the German-Jewish children of ‘mixed’ descent that haunted the Nazi mind obsessed with purity. At 50% Jew and 50% Aryan, they were a threat to Nazi ideas. Closely linked to preventing such marital and sexual unions was the Nazi belief in dodgy eugenics. The tragedy was that these laws were not protested enough when they were enacted. They ended up guiding Nazi racial policy for the remaining decade of the Reich (https://bit.ly/2JMo5LL). We must never forget the price a society and a country pays for writing hate into law.

06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Shock treatment will not work in agriculture||Almost all sections of people including farmers agree that the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC)- mandi policies for agricultural marketing, initiated in the 1960s for a few crops, have outlived their utility and the system needs a new policy in the face of the agricultural sector’s growth slowdown, the crop-composition not widening, and investments in land not happening. Recently, the government of the day has opened up the output market with the aim to let market forces improve efficiency and create more value for farmers and the economy. These laws state that farmers are now free to sell all their products anywhere and to anyone beyond the physical premises of APMC markets. Additionally, the laws promote contract farming through establishing partnerships between farmers and food-processing companies, and also permit unlimited hoarding of food except in special circumstances. What farmers want Three main suggestions were put forth by farmers when we recently made enquiries with them: one, their produce prices should be the cost of production plus a reasonable mark-up; two, fluctuations in prices should be minimal; and three, there should be little or no interface with legal or administrative officials — they are not comfortable dealing with the “ sahibs and the police”. All these farmer concerns have been ignored in the way the current laws are drafted. Additionally, as the old laws are being repealed, they said that there is a need for a wider view of the sector to include more crops. Thus, if the government encourages farmers to move from wheat to vegetables, markets for the latter should address all the above three aspects. New markets are an unknown The first law of the Minimum Support Price- m andi is a known devil, but the new markets will be an unknown ghost with no control over them by anyone. Thus, while “malpractices” in mandis are known and local leaders (Members of Parliament, Members of the Legislative Assembly, panchayats) are often brought in to vent farmers’ anger or arbitrate in difficult situations, malpractices in the new systems are neither forecast-able nor is there any authority to report to. Next, while the government says that the m andi -MSP system will continue, the question is, for how long? If the alternative traders offer better prices, farmers will go there and not to the mandis (as is already the case, highlighted in the recent media article by Gurcharan Das; https://bit.ly/3928m3R). What happens after two to three years when the regulated mandis become weaker or begin to shut down due to lack of business? There are many issues here. Traders could reduce the prices on more than one pretext, such as finding faults with the product; declining to buy on the pretext of glut (a wait and watch strategy); defaulting on payments, and so on. Since traders are few (at least locally) they can form cartels, while farmers many: this is imminently possible. The farmers are further handicapped by the fact that they come from long distances with loads of several quintals/tonnes of produce on hired tractors; going back owing to the transport cost incurred is not an option for them. Their situation worsens when their cash needs are immediate, which is the case for the small farmers who constitute 90-plus% of those who sell at the mandis at MSP. Advantage corporate buyers The second law has somewhat similar issues. The corporate-buyers might just not buy the full quantity of the product on one or another pretext or delay payments;and if farmers complain, the corporates have access to a battery of lawyers, the fine print in contracts, the advantage of language, and, above all, the capacity to wait it out. In both the above cases, the problem is of contracts between unequals: whether it is traders or corporates, they are far fewer and with deeper pockets,and they will deal with (poor/little-educated) small farmers (about 85% have two or less hectares of land), resulting in unequal outcomes. The other issue is in regard to different regions and crops. Many proponents of the agri-marketing laws maintain that farmers from outside the wheat-rice belts in northern India are not protesting. Evidently so, since the country is diverse with some 15 agroclimatic zones and has over 50 crops grown. Issues and farmers’ reactions We also forget that farmers protest against policies in areas where they hail from: like in eastern India, farmers revolted in 1860 against indigo-farming, Mappilas revolted in 1921, or even the Warli Adivasi Revolt of 1945. More recently, in the 1970s to 2010s, Sharad Joshi led agitations for the farming sector mainly in Maharashtra, or farmers in Tamil Nadu had protested demanding Cauvery water. There are many more examples. Farmers protest against problems that affect them: they are not a homogeneous lot. If in 2020 a new policy is being formulated, why is it (ironically) uniform for all farmers, all land and all crops, of opening up the markets; markets which are almost fully opaque, unequal and having imperfect information? What happens to the semi-arid areas and the farmers therein, where crop outcomes are uncertain? What happens to small and marginal farmers who have little to market and are largely inarticulate? How will risk be mitigated if farmers move from wheat-rice cultivation to more volatile crops such as vegetables and fruits, or pest-prone crops such as cotton? Or what happens to landless labourers who have migrated from far away to work in fields (such as from Bihar to Punjab)? Should there not be a comprehensive policy in regard to the agricultural sector rather than a “shock treatment” for agri-markets alone? Expert recommendations The so-far neglected problem of stagnation and high input prices in agriculture can be addressed through a systematic approach proposed in the M.S. Swaminathan Commission and/or the Ashok Dalwai Committee. Typical examples are transitions being worked out for farmers to move out of water-soaking paddy crop in Punjab-Haryana to other crops; say, in five years, they would reduce the area under paddy by 25-30%, and the loss they incur in the short run, will be compensated for by the government. This could, for example, also be done for sugarcane in western Maharashtra. Shock treatments do not work anywhere, be it agriculture, industry or the economy. Many an industry, post-1991, shut down due to “shock treatment” then, resulting in a second de-industrialisation and the loss of hundreds of thousands of industrial jobs. The results in agriculture are likely to be no different in the face of shocks. Sarthi Acharya is Delhi Chair Professor, Institute for Human Development.

06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Changing contours of India-U.K. ties||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made many sudden and surprising decisions: some felicitous, others disastrous. Among the former were invitations to leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation to attend his 2014 swearing-in and his visit to Lahore in 2015; among the latter were demonetisation and the ‘Namaste Trump’ spectacle last February. Yet to be defined in either category is his startling invitation to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson who, due to the ravages of COVID-19 mutations in the U.K., has expressed his inability to attend a truncated version of India’s Republic Day parade this month. Mr. Johnson is a colourful and controversial character, often portrayed in the British media as a clown, but no one can doubt his capacity for manoeuvre and staying power. Choosing a chief guest The nomination of a chief guest for the Republic Day parade is the Prime Minister’s exclusive gift, and he or she is not known to consult others in or outside the Cabinet. American President Donald Trump was Mr. Modi’s first choice for January 2019 but the honour eventually fell to Mr. Trump’s alter ego, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Mr. Modi’s selections are revealing: U.S. President Barack Obama in 2015, French President Francois Hollande in 2016, the Crown Prince of the United Arab Emirates in 2017, the ASEAN leaders in 2018, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in 2019, Mr. Bolsonaro in 2020, and Mr. Johnson for 2021. With 193 countries in the United Nations, the Prime Minister’s choices have mostly been leaders identified with the Western camp. Besides this, the invitation to Britain was the sixth to that country, more than to any other nation. India has a shared past with Britain and needs to chart a different shared future, now that Britain has left the European Union (EU). One joint enterprise will be as members of the UN Security Council where Britain has permanent status and India holds a non-permanent seat this year and next. And this year, Mr. Johnson will be hosting India as an invitee to the G-7, and the UN Climate Change Conference. There is much in common between Mr. Modi’s recent invitees, Mr. Bolsonaro, Mr. Trump and Mr. Johnson. All their countries have been ravaged by the virus and each of them has been infected with COVID-19. They are all populist nationalists advocating ‘make my country great again’ and ‘my country first’. Their brand of democratic politics is self-centred and impervious to criticism. Mr. Johnson propelled himself to British national politics through leadership of the Brexit campaign in 2016, and to the prime ministership by leading a revolt against his predecessor Theresa May who had promised a friction-free Brexit. He has now delivered one that is tariff- and quota-free and allegedly “takes back control over our money, borders, laws, trade, and our fishing waters,” but has potential for friction both with the EU and domestically. Brexit will never cease to divide Britain and already causes tension between Whitehall and two of the devolved regions, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Mr. Modi visited the U.K. in 2015 when six major agreements were concluded. It is unlikely that any assessment has been made of the implementation of those accords, but in contemporary diplomacy, it is common for a raft of new treaties to be superimposed on existing ones even where there is insufficient progress. A fortuitous invite From Britain’s point of view, Mr. Modi’s invitation to its Prime Minister was fortuitous because Brexit necessitates that every effort be made to seek commercial advantage in Asian countries with high growth rates. India has been fruitlessly negotiating a trade agreement with the EU since 2007, during which Britain was considered the main deal-breaker. The EU wanted duty reductions on autos, wines and spirits and wanted India to open financial sectors such as banking and insurance, postal, legal, accountancy, maritime and security and retail. India, as always, sought free movement for service professionals. The same obstacles with post-Brexit Britain will arise, because the export profile of both countries is predominantly services-oriented. In response to free movement for professionals, Britain will refer to its new points-based system for immigrants, while after withdrawing from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, India is cautious about negotiating any new trade agreement, and will place greater stress on aspects related to country of origin and percentage of value addition in exports. Therefore, when the time comes for a discrete agreement with Britain, the two countries may settle for a limited one perhaps covering pharmaceuticals, financial technology, chemicals, defence production, petroleum and food products. Close relations India-U.K. links are substantial. One and a half million persons of Indian origin reside in Britain, 15 of them are Members of Parliament, three in Cabinet and two holding high office as Finance and Home Ministers. Before COVID-19, there were half a million tourists from India to Britain annually and twice that figure in the reverse direction. Around 30,000 Indians study in Britain despite restrictive opportunities for post-graduation employment. Britain is among the top investors in India and India is the second-biggest investor and a major job creator in Britain. India has a credit balance in a total trade of $16 billion, but the level is below India’s trade with Switzerland, Germany or Belgium. In one aspect of his invitation to Mr. Johnson, Prime Minister Modi was remarkably prescient. In November last year, when the invitation was extended, there were short odds against Mr. Johnson continuing as Prime Minister beyond March this year. With the EU-British trade agreement concluded in the dying hours of 2020, the betting now is that Mr. Johnson will lead his Conservative Party into the next election in 2024 as Prime Minister. Mr. Modi would now be well advised to cut back further on Republic Day celebrations, in recognition of the country’s sufferings during the past year.

06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||The hurdles in Xi’s great power ambitions||We will all remember 2020 in terms of how COVID-19 spread to the world from Wuhan, China, despite an alert by a dedicated doctor, because the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership dithered in informing the world and the World Health Organization on time. Instead of cooperating in finding the origin of the virus, Chinese President Xi Jingping decided to use the ‘strategic opportunity’ to launch military assaults against Taiwan, India, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Japan to fortify China’s claims on disputed territories. Xi’s dream Signs of Mr. Xi being an ambitious leader were visible early on. Following his appointment as Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission in October 2010, there was a spurt in China’s militarisation of the South China Sea including recurrent forays into disputed territories. After taking over as General Secretary of the CCP in November 2012, Mr. Xi consolidated his hold by eliminating his rivals in an anti-corruption campaign, pushing his relatives and friends into the politburo, and demolishing patronage networks of rival leaders. In November 2014, Mr. Xi summoned China’s foreign policy and military elite to Beijing and told them that it was time for China “to embrace big country diplomacy”. The following month, he informed politburo members that he planned to make China’s voice heard in the international fora. In October 2017, Mr. Xi spoke of his dream of restoring China to a great power status (on par with the U.S.) by 2049 and building a world-class army by 2035. But the policies Mr. Xi is following — state domination of the economy with increasing reliance on the public sector, slowing down of market reforms, accumulation of high debt, unproductive expenditures, lack of reforms in education and health, erosion of human freedoms, and increasing isolation of China due to his aggressive policies — will not take China towards greatness; rather, they will slow down economic growth. China does not have the cheap migrant labour and favourable international environment that it had in Deng Xiaoping’s era. Mr. Xi and other Chinese leaders have closely followed how the U.S. obtained its great power status: by mastering emerging technologies, modernising the armed forces, and setting up a network of allies. Mr. Xi has used all the tricks available to achieve supremacy in 5G, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and new materials, including forced transfer and stealing of technologies. The concept of restructuring the armed forces and, particularly, introducing joint theatre commands has been borrowed from the U.S. Mr. Xi has commenced a rapid military build-up that is unprecedented in peacetime in recent history. This is aimed at rivalling the U.S.’s military capability in a few years. China has the biggest navy in the world. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was announced in 2013 to seek new markets and allies for political, economic and strategic use. New ports for civilian and military use are being sought at Gwadar (Pakistan), Jask (Iran), Djibouti, Hambantota (Sri Lanka), Sihanoukville (Cambodia) and other places, to project power overseas. Scaling back plans Not unsurprisingly, all this has been done under the CCP’s programme of “socialism with Chinese characteristics”. Little attention has been paid to improve the quality of education in science, technologies and mathematics, which underpins the West’s success in its advances in technology. The capability of high technology equipment like the fifth-generation fighter aircraft, aircraft carriers and long-range bombers remains inferior in China as the country is unable to procure or indigenise advanced technologies. Several American experts believe that Chinese equipment is at least one generation behind theirs. Debt-ridden China is scaling back its BRI projects as many have become financially unviable; these were conceived to please Mr. Xi and never took into account the vulnerabilities of recipient countries. Concerned about the growth of corruption and its impact on the control of the party, Mr. Xi has slowed down market reforms, which were the backbone of China’s prosperity in the last three decades. The U.S. model Despite being the second largest economy, China has few allies and friends (except Pakistan and North Korea). Mr. Xi fails to realise that the U.S.’s status as a global leader was based not only on its wealth and military power but also the lure of its governance model, ability to coordinate responses to international crises, and provision of global public goods such as freedom of ideas, quality education, foreign aid, encouragement of free trade, security of international shipping lanes and fight against terrorism. China has shown little interest in delivering global public goods. Mr. Xi believes that China will be able to impose its will on the rest of the world by sheer use of power forgetting that besides China, there are a number of other countries such as the U.K., France, Japan, India and Australia which have also acquired economic and military power and are capable of resisting its abusive behaviour. Worried at the prospect of President-elect Joe Biden uniting the U.S.’s allies and partners in resisting China’s practices, the Xi regime is trying to divide the transatlantic alliance by offering increased market access to EU countries and vaccines against COVID-19 to ASEAN. How much these efforts will succeed remains to be seen. There is growing concern that Mr. Xi’s unfettered ambition to seek global dominance will create newer conflicts which a pandemic-affected and recession-hit world can ill afford. Given that his colleagues in the politburo are unable to put brakes on his hegemonic ambitions, this year will tell us if the new U.S. President acting with his allies and partners will be able to do so to prevent the world from sliding into new catastrophes.

06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||An arbitrary directive||Recently, the Centre and the West Bengal government were engaged in a tussle. The Centre directed the State government to relieve three IPS officers on Central deputation; the State government refused. The Centre’s move followed the incident that took place in early December when BJP president J.P. Nadda’s convoy travelling from Sirakol to Diamond Harbour in West Bengal was attacked by stone-throwing protesters carrying Trinamool Congress flags. The three IPS officers in question had been posted as in-charges of the police district, range, and zone where the incident took place. The Centre’s directive not only reeks of vengeance but goes against the norms governing deputation of officers to the Centre. To apportion blame on the three IPS officers for the attack without even a perfunctory inquiry goes against the norms of justice. It is impossible to identify a potential miscreant in a crowd that gathers on the road when a leader passes by. In case the powers that be felt that the three officers should be penalised for dereliction of duty, a formal inquiry followed by penal action, if necessary, would have met the ends of justice. Ostensibly, the Centre’s decision was taken to teach the officers a lesson that they were at its mercy, as the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is the controlling authority for all IPS officers. The three officers have been posted to the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD). The process for deputation In normal course, officers willing to be deputed to the Centre are asked to apply through the States. A panel of selected officers is prepared after which they are deputed to various Central Armed Police Forces (the Central Reserve Police Force, the Border Security Force, the Central Industrial Security Force, ITBP and SSB) and even to Central Police Organisations like the Intelligence Bureau, the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Research and Analysis Wing, the National Investigation Agency, and BPRD. It is important to note that the officers are selected after their dossiers are scrutinised and not nominated as the MHA has done with respect to the three officers. Even when the officers opt for Central deputation, they give their choice of the organisation where they would like to serve. Selection is done strictly on merit, based on their annual performance reports. When officers are forcibly deputed to Central organisations, they go with the perception that they have been deputed on grounds of inefficiency or as a punishment. Demoralised officers who become victims of political manipulations cannot be expected to give their best. According to a MHA memorandum of April 2000, “the two-way movement of officers from State to Centre and back is of mutual benefit to the States and Government of India on the one hand and to the officers concerned on the other.” How far it would benefit demoralised officers who are forced to join Central organisations is anybody’s guess. The message that goes out to personnel of Central organisations is that these organisations are dumping grounds for those unwanted in the States or those whom the Centre wants to penalise for any transgression. A proposal to reduce CDR The Central government is already working on a proposal to reduce the Central Deputation Reserve (CDR) of IPS officers from 1,075 to about 500. This is being done as most States are not willing to spare officers to serve on Central deputation. In 2019, only 428 officers were working on Central deputation against the strength of 1,075. Most officers avoid Central deputation as they enjoy better perks and powers in the States. On the other hand, Central deputation could mean a posting in the Northeast or in a Left Wing Extremism-affected State. Hence, when there is already a proposal to slash the strength of the CDR, the Centre’s insistence that the three officers should be relieved appears farcical. Since the States are bound to oppose tooth and nail such arbitrary directives by the Centre, such orders are best avoided. M.P.

06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Moribund governance||Even to those familiar with the anarchy that characterises India’s public spaces, the collapse of a newly-built shelter in a crematorium in Muradnagar, in U.P.’s Ghaziabad district, killing at least 24 people, is a shock. A group attending a funeral sheltered from rain in the structure, when its roof crumbled. The deaths and injuries have left families distraught. Since women are not part of funeral rites in crematoria, they came to know of the fate of the men much later. A token solatium has been announced by the U.P. government for the next of kin of the dead and relief measures for others, but the loss of breadwinners who were in low-paying jobs has left the family members destitute. The State has shown great alacrity in arresting four people including a junior engineer, besides the contractor, citing culpable homicide, causing hurt and endangering lives. There are indications that it may use the National Security Act against some of the accused. Such measures cannot produce consistent improvement to governance, but the Yogi Adityanath government’s favoured image is that of strong enforcement, which it has sought to demonstrate time and again by shooting down in ‘encounters’ those with a criminal record. That approach can do little to improve U.P.’s standing. The Ghaziabad disaster is clearly the product of a system that lacks transparency and audits, and does not yield to quick fixes or measures meant to aid deterrence. Every year, the monsoon extracts a penalty in the form of collapsed buildings in several States. Just over three years ago, several people died when part of a bus stand caved in near Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu. Appalled by the 41 deaths in a building disaster at Bhiwandi, Maharashtra in September last year, the Bombay High Court framed questions for municipal authorities, including the basic premise: are those in authority completely helpless in preventing the collapse of structures and stopping the loss of life? The court also emphasised that citizens have a right to live in safe buildings and environment, within the meaning of Article 21. What happened in Ghaziabad is particularly deplorable, as the cremation ground is an essential facility, and entirely within the ambit of public authorities to maintain. There are suggestions that the structure was poorly designed, lacking stability due to use of inferior materials, while the contractor had several projects assigned to him in the district. These and other charges, including favouritism involving politicians, are best probed by an independent judicial member. Mr. Adityanath should realise that U.P., a laggard on many development metrics, can transform itself only through rule of law and efficient implementation of public projects. The horror of Muradnagar should impel his government to act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/moribund-governance/article33505768.ece
06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||England in lockdown||In a bid to control the spread of the highly transmissible new COVID-19 variant (VOC 202012/01), the U.K. announced on Monday a fresh lockdown in London and southeast England, which is expected to be in force till mid-February. The decision comes after much dithering; the scientific advisory panel had recommended days before Christmas that the government consider a national lockdown, including shutting down educational institutions. As on January 4, the U.K has reported 2.7 million cases and over 75,500 deaths, the second-highest toll in Europe. More than 50,000 new cases have been reported daily since December 29, 2020, with a peak of nearly 59,000 cases on January 4 and over 400 deaths daily. On Monday, more than 26,000 COVID-19 patients were admitted in hospitals, an increase of 30% from the previous week. Though the new variant does not cause increased disease severity or mortality, a surge in cases and hospitalisation can lead to more deaths. It is more transmissible, the reason why the reproduction number (number of people a person can infect) is 1.5-1.7; the spread is considered to be under control when the reproduction number is less than 1. Based on an analysis of cases and genome sequences of nearly 44,500 samples collected from England between September 21 and December 13, it was found that even during the previous lockdown, the new variant spread in many locations. This even as fresh cases were generally dropping due to reduced spread of the then dominant strain. There is evidence that the earlier lockdown was effective in containing the previously predominant strain, suggesting that the new variant grew in absolute terms. The rapid spread of the new variant even during the previous lockdown might not reflect a general failure of control measures but highlights the inherent nature of the new variant to rapidly spread given its higher transmissibility. That areas with slower baseline virus spread also reported a slightly reduced spread of the new variant suggests that it is indeed possible to reduce if not suppress the transmission of the new variant if the lockdown is stricter and compliance is better. It is for this reason that unlike in the previous lockdown, schools and universities too are to be closed now. The new variant appears to affect a greater proportion of individuals under 20 years. The selective spread among the young might probably be more because educational institutions were open during the previous lockdown than due to the inherent nature of the virus. Since a resurgence of the new variant is likely when the lockdown is lifted, the focus is on accelerating vaccine roll-out so that much of the population is protected and transmission is cut. The spread of new variants should alert other countries, particularly South Africa where a problematic mutation has been found, to remain vigilant.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/england-in-lockdown/article33505769.ece
06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||The Government and scientists (From an Editorial)||The inaugural address of the Prime Minister and the presidential speech of Dr. B.P. Pal at the annual session of the Indian Science Congress at Bangalore have been on familiar lines. While the Prime Minister complained against the failure of scientists to help science fulfill its social obligations, Dr. Pal was chagrined over the Government’s neglect of scientists. According to the Cabinet Committee on Science and Technology India’s scientific manpower is said to be comparable with that of the United Kingdom, France and Germany. But the Director-General of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Dr. Atma Ram, had no hesitation in challenging this view when he addressed the Indian National Science Academy in Bangalore. He may or may not be right, but it is a fact that the contribution of Indian science to our material progress has been tardy. This seems to be due as much to our scientists not putting their best foot forward as to the inadequate rapport between scientists and the Government. The Government has felt sore over the lack of initiative on the part of scientists. It has, however, failed to realise the limits of such initiative. As specialists, these persons have the competence, other things being equal, for solving the problems referred to them. But it is a different matter to expect them to identify any scatter of such problems, because these are related to the particular tempo of material progress, decisions on which depend largely on official developmental policy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-government-and-scientists-from-an-editorial/article33505779.ece
06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||India’s economic recovery bucks global trend: FinMin||While the global economic recovery has been hit by second waves of infections and more stringent lockdowns in several countries, India’s economy is ‘riding against the COVID-19 wave’ with persistent improvements in economic indicators showing a V-shaped recovery, the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday. “The new year has dawned with the approval of long-awaited COVID-19 vaccine and initiation of vaccination drives in various countries. This gives strength to the optimism on both health and economic fronts despite continuing surge in global cases and the potential challenge of a mutant strain,” the Department of Economic Affairs said in its monthly economy review for December. “In the global economy, rise in lockdown stringency following second waves has slowed... recovery, as seen in tapering Purchasing Managers’ Index estimates, decline in port traffic activity, and stagnating commercial flight activity…,” the review noted, contrasting that trend with India’s recovery path. ‘Sustained improvement’ “The effective management of the COVID-19 spread despite the festive season and onset of winter season, combined with sustained improvement in high-frequency indicators and V-shaped recovery, along with easing of lockdown restrictions distinguish Indian economy as one riding against the COVID-wave,” it said. Stressing that the agriculture sector — which clocked 3.4% growth in the first two quarters of FY21 — remained the bright spot of the Indian economy, the review pointed to a 2.9% rise in rabi sowing this year, along with accelerating tractor sales suggesting rural distress had been successfully addressed by the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY). “Rise in minimum support prices accompanied by record procurement, and accelerated wage employment generation through MGNREGS, bodes well for rural incomes and bears testimony to PMGKY’s success in alleviating rural distress... This rise in rural incomes is mirrored in the healthy, though moderated, sales in passenger vehicles, two- and three-wheelers and tractors, and a rebound in vehicle registrations for the first time after March 2020,” it said. Mega vaccination drive Asserting that the government was well-prepared to undertake a mega vaccination drive, following the emergency use approval for two vaccines in India, the Finance Ministry said a blueprint was ‘ready with priority for health workers among others, real-time Intelligence Network Co-WIN in place, upgradation of cold-chain infrastructure for last-mile delivery, and ongoing dry runs’.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/indias-economic-recovery-bucks-global-trend-finmin/article33506397.ece
06 January 2021||new delhi,||Surging stocks boost MF assets to Rs. 29.7 lakh cr. in Dec. quarter||Mutual fund asset base rose by 7.6% to Rs. 29.71 lakh crore in the quarter ended December, mainly on account of the rally in equity markets. The average assets under management (AAUM) of the industry, comprising 45 players, was at Rs. 27.6 lakh crore in July-September quarter, according to data by Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). The surge in asset base comes on the back of excellent stock market performance over the last three months, with Nifty 50 rising by 3.15% in October, 12.02% in November and 14.9% in December, Gopal Kavalireddi, head of research at FYERS, said. “The increase in quarterly asset base is majorly due to mark-to-market gains in equity-oriented mutual funds. Markets being at an all-time high has resulted in this, although there have been net outflows in this quarter,” said Omkeshwar Singh, head, RankMF at Samco Securities. Of the 42 operational AMCs, the top four AMCs — SBI MF, HDFC MF, ICICI Prudential MF, Aditya Birla Sunlife MF — continue to dominate and account for 50% of total assets of the mutual fund industry. With an asset base of Rs. 4.56 lakh crore, SBI Mutual Fund continues to be the largest fund house in India during the December quarter. It had an average AUM of Rs. 4.21 lakh crore in the preceding quarter. This indicates a growth of 8.3% quarter-on-quarter. HDFC MF, which is at the second position, saw its asset base rising to Rs. 3.89 lakh crore from Rs. 3.75 lakh crore in the September quarter. ICICI Prudential MF came in third with an average AUM of Rs. 3.8 lakh crore compared to Rs. 3.6 lakh crore. Aditya Birla Sunlife MF, has seen its average AUM growing to Rs. 2.55 lakh crore from Rs. 2.39 lakh crore The asset base of Kotak Mahindra MF soared 13% to Rs. 2.16 lakh crore at the end of the December.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/surging-stocks-boost-mf-assets-to-rs-297-lakh-cr-in-dec-quarter/article33505760.ece
06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Global, India output set to expand in FY22: World Bank||Global economic output is projected to grow by 4% in 2021 assuming widespread roll-out of a COVID-19 vaccine throughout the year, as per the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report released on Tuesday. This projection is still 5% below pre-pandemic levels. India is expected to grow at 5.4% in fiscal year 2021-22 and 5.2% in fiscal 2022-23 after an expected contraction of 9.6% in fiscal 2020-21. India’s expected contraction in the current fiscal is due to a sharp decline in household spending and private investment. There was severe income loss in the informal sector which accounts for four-fifths of employment. However, recent data indicated that recovery in manufacturing and services was gaining momentum. In 2021, the rebound from the low base is expected to be countered by subdued private investment growth due to financial sector weakness, the report said. The global recovery has been dampened by the resurgence of the coronavirus but is expected to strengthen as confidence, trade and consumption start improving, supported by vaccinations. After an estimated 3.6% contraction in 2020, U.S. GDP is expected to grow at 3.5% in 2021 and the Euro area at 3.6%. Emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) are expected to grow at an average of 4.6% in 2021-22 reflecting the above-average rebound in China (forecasted at 7.9% and 5.2%, this year and the next). ‘Dramatic’ inequality Key elements to the strength of the economic recovery would be investment that embraces the changed economic environment and an ability to reduce inequality, World Bank Group President David Malpass told reporters on a briefing call on Tuesday. “The inequality of the downturn and the likely recovery is dramatic,” he said, adding that those with the lowest incomes were worst hit by the downturn and would likely take the longest to regain jobs, healthcare, vaccines and so forth in the post-COVID economy. “Without course correction investment could remain feeble for years to come,” Mr. Malpass said, calling for governments, households and firms to respond to the new economic realities — protecting the most vulnerable and supporting policies that allow capital, labour, skills and innovation to shift to new purposes (such as green sectors). There has been a “massive increase” in global debt because of the pandemic with EMDE government debt set to increase by 9 percentage points of GDP in 2020, the report noted. India’s government debt is expected to rise by 17 percentage points of GDP while service output shrinks over 9%. Private sector debt is also expected to rise sharply. The South Asian region’s economy is expected to contract 6.7 % in 2020 due to the pandemic. This was led by India’s deep recession, where the economy was already weakened by the stress in non-bank financial companies, the report said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/global-india-output-set-to-expand-in-fy22-world-bank/article33505763.ece
06 January 2021||Mumbai,||‘Rise in credit may not always result in higher investments’||An increase in credit may not always find its way towards investments as businesses may use credit lines to finance current liabilities, a Reserve Bank paper said. The paper further says that banks respond to changes in money market spreads faster and better than changes in policy rates, which are announced by the RBI bi-monthly. “In addition to slow or lagged monetary policy transmission, an increase in credit may not always find its way towards increasing investments. Firms may use their credit lines to finance their current liabilities rather than undertaking capital formation,” said the paper written by Saurabh Ghosh and Abhinav Narayanan, both officials of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Monetary policy transmission has remained a pivotal topic of interest across all central bankers. Empirically, however, it is hard to disentangle the effects of a policy change on firms’ investment demand, banks’ credit supply and their interactions. The findings indicate monetary policy transmission works with a lag for bank lending.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rise-in-credit-may-not-always-result-in-higher-investments/article33506401.ece

Steel prices have risen at a time when demand for property is slowly getting back on track with government measures and low interest rates, they said. Prices of construction steel, or TMT bars, had recently touched Rs. 45,000 a tonne in some markets, which was at least 30-40% higher than the rate in the pre-COVID-19 period. Prices under pressure “The steel price rise is hurting real estate companies as property prices are under pressure. The additional cost will result in a shrinkage of gross margin by 5-6%,” said Bengal Peerless Housing Development Company CEO Ketan Sengupta .  Real estate industry body CREDAI Bengal president Nandu Belani said the spurt in steel prices will reduce margins by 4-5%, which is quite high for the sector.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/rising-steel-prices-to-impact-realty-margins/article33505761.ece

06 January 2021||Sydney,||Rohit set to pad up at SCG; toss up between Shardul and Saini||The Indian team management is weighing its options for the third pacer’s slot, with Shardul Thakur and Navdeep Saini in contention, but Rohit Sharma is certain to replace Mayank Agarwal at the top of the order against Australia in the third Test starting here on Thursday. Matter of time While Mayank’s axing was only a matter of time after seven failures in the last eight Test innings, the choice for the third pacer’s slot has got a bit tricky with divergent opinions emerging on who could fit the role best in the absence of an injured Umesh Yadav. Raw pace A few days back, Mumbai seamer and useful lower-order batsman Shardul Thakur was considered a favourite but it is learnt that there are some senior players who feel that Saini, India’s fastest bowler by a distance, could be used to unsettle the wobbly Australian batting line-up with his raw pace. The Indian team had a net session at the overcast Sydney Cricket Ground on the day and all eyes were on Rohit Sharma, who looked pretty comfortable against both pace and spin. The decision on the third pacer has been primarily delayed because, on Tuesday, the SCG centre strip was covered due to overcast conditions. Decisive choice On Wednesday, a look at the strip and the conditions will probably help them make a decisive choice. If the conditions are overcast and there is a bit more moisture on the surface, then Shardul is expected to be preferred. If the track is on the flatter side, Saini, with his pace and ability to reverse the old ball, could prove to be a handful against a batting order that is struggling to put up even 200 runs on the board. If Saini plays, it will be his debut in the longest format while for Shardul, it would be like a debut as he couldn’t even finish his first over when it was officially his debut two years back. Third angle There is a third angle to the pacer’s debate and that is T. Natarajan, who has had a meteoric rise in the past four months and is ready to be handed the red cherry in whites as his tweet after Monday’s photo-shoot suggested.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rohit-set-to-pad-up-at-scg-toss-up-between-shardul-and-saini/article33505869.ece
06 January 2021||SOUTHAMPTON,||Ings’ strike leaves Klopp’s men red-faced||Liverpool slumped to a second loss of its title defence in the English Premier League after a second-minute goal from former player Danny Ings earned Southampton a 1-0 win on Monday. The champion has gone three games without a win — after back-to-back draws against West Bromwich Albion and Newcastle — and leads on only goal difference from Manchester United, which has played one game fewer. Ings, who had an injury-plagued spell at Liverpool from 2015-18, lifted a shot over goalkeeper Alisson Becker and into the far corner after latching onto a free kick by James Ward-Prowse. From then, it was attack vs. defence but Southampton held firm, meaning Liverpool failed to score in successive games for only the second time in Jurgen Klopp’s five-year tenure. Lacking the cutting edge Indeed, such has been Liverpool’s lack of cutting edge of late that Klopp’s team has managed just seven shots on target in the past three games. The Saints with this impressive win have moved up to sixth place. Four points separate Liverpool from seventh-place Everton, with 10th-placed West Ham seven points off the lead after nearly half of the campaign. Gomez bails out Valencia In LaLiga, forward Maxi Gomez equalised late (79th minute) for Valencia to draw with Cadiz 1-1 at home on Monday. Anthony Lozano had given the visitors the lead in the 58th minute. Cadiz improved to 10th in the standings, and Valencia to 17th.  The results:   Premier League: Southampton 1 (Ings 2) bt Liverpool 0.

06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Richard Dawkins on collegemate Tiger Pataudi: ‘Sublime’||There are lessons for today’s players from Tiger Pataudi, whose 80th birth anniversary it was yesterday. Cricket meant everything to him, but it wasn’t everything to him. The difference is crucial to understanding one of the great captains. It explained both his deep involvement with the game and his apparent detachment from it. In the last paragraph of his autobiography Tiger’s Tale , he wrote, “In the country of the blind, it has been said, the one-eyed man is king. But in the keen-eyed world of cricket, a fellow with just one good eye-and-a-bit has to settle for something less than the perfection he once sought. Lucky me, despite this, to have been able to play the game all over the world in the company of the giants.” Amalgam of heroes Pataudi was my first real hero; he took over from the combination of comic book and mythological heroes one had begun to grow out of. The Marvel superheroes were just becoming accessible in India, so Tiger was seen as a combination of Superman, Phantom, Krishna — with the strength of the first, the intelligence of the second and the mischief and humour of the third. Children do such things rather well. And then I met him. I must have been nine or ten, and it was at a Ranji Trophy match in Bengaluru. An uncle had provided a ticket in the privileged section, and as Tiger came out of the pavilion ahead of the day’s play, he called a couple of us youngsters out into the field to take catches from him. Those were innocent days. At one point Pataudi made as if to throw the ball in the air but simply lobbed it straight at me. Fooled by the movement of his head, I looked up - and dropped the catch. “Watch the ball, always watch the ball,” he said with his lopsided grin. It was enough. I was hooked for life. When I took over as the sports editor of a national newspaper, I was the youngest at that level. “How did you handle having everybody else senior to you when you became captain at 21?” I asked Pataudi then. He was not one to dole out advice but when he did, you listened. “Look after the younger people, the older folk will always resent you no matter what,” he said, “I had men like Jai (M.L. Jaisimha), Pras (Erapalli Prasanna), Farokh (Engineer), Dilip (Sardesai), and this was going to be the core for the future.” Mischievous I never tire of hearing stories about Tiger. While editing a book on him, I was privy to some family stories. The sense of mischief never left him. Bishan Bedi has a story of how Tiger asked him to bowl the first over on the third day although he had bowled the last over on the previous day in a Duleep Trophy match. “Let’s see if the umpires are awake,” Tiger explained. Engineer has not been able to live down how he was taken in when Tiger pointed out that the Victoria Memorial in Kolkata was his place of residence. Effortless It wasn’t only the players. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins has written in his autobiography, “The best cricketer I ever saw playing in Oxford was the Nawab of Pataudi (Tiger), the Oxford captain and my exact contemporary at Balliol. As a batsman the effortless way he steered the ball to outwit the fielders was sublime. But it was as a fielder himself that he especially impressed me…” One of my favourites is this gem from left-arm spinner Colin Drybrough, passed on by Sharmila Tagore: “At Oxford I was secretary in the year he was captain. He asked me to carry him from the dressing room onto the ground at Lord's at the start of the University Match against Cambridge to ensure he did not break a leg going down stairs. If you do not make it onto the ground you do not get your ‘Blue’. “Imagine the kerfuffle if I had piggybacked him through the Long Room! We made sure he reached the turf and he went on to score 131 emulating his father who also hit a century in his first University match for Oxford.” Tiger could convince most people to do what he wanted; it wasn’t just charm, although he had oodles of that. You simply couldn’t believe that a blue-blood had such mischief running in his veins. Lesson for today’s players Tiger was a walking, running, cover-driving self-help manual. He was good enough to play for India six months after the accident that cost him his eye — that told you all you needed to know about him. The passion, the grit, the pragmatism and the temperament to accept without complaint whatever life had to offer. A lesson, and not just for today’s players.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/richard-dawkins-on-collegemate-tiger-pataudi-sublime/article33505919.ece
06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Impressive Mumbai City adds to Bengaluru FC’s woes||Bengaluru FC’s (BFC) stuttering ISL campaign slipped into a full blown crisis as it crashed to a 3-1 defeat against Mumbai City FC at the Fatorda Stadium on Tuesday. A goal each from Mourtada Fall and Bipin Singh within the opening quarter, and a goal-keeping blunder late in the match by Gurpreet Sandhu that resulted in a goal by Bartholomew Ogbeche, handed BFC its third successive loss, a dubious first in the ISL for the 2018-19 champion. Sergio Lobera’s men are now two points clear off ATK Mohun Bagan at the top, setting the stage perfectly for the much-anticipated clash between the two in six days’ time. But for two phases of play, one early in the match and the other towards the end of the first half, Carles Cuadrat’s wards were second-best all evening. As early as the third minute, BFC’s Deshorn Brown blazed over with just the goalkeeper to beat. But once the initial nerves settled, Mumbai was at its enterprising best. Mourtada scores In the ninth minute, a corner by Bipin was headed across the goal by Hernan Santana for Mourtada to nod home after rising above Juanan. Minutes later, Bipin split the defensive duo of Juanan and Rahul Bheke right down the middle and slotted home a peach of a ball by Mandar Rao Dessai from the left. BFC improved and ended the opening period brightly, with Cleiton Silva forcing Mumbai custodian Amrinder Singh to parry away a free kick and Sunil Chhetri coming close through a header, albeit a weak one. Silva was workmanlike in the second half, so was Chhetri. The former even won a penalty — a harsh one on Mumbai for Mourtada had clearly won the ball — which was converted by Chhetri. But what BFC needed was a moment of magic, a flash of inspiration, both of which were beyond it.  The result:   Bengaluru FC 1 (Chhetri 79-pen) lost to Mumbai City FC 3 (Mourtada 9, Bipin 15, Ogbeche 84).

06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Bajwa and Mairaj to skip trials||Indian shooting is all set to get into the competitive mode with the shotgun selection trials scheduled to start on Wednesday. However, Asian skeet champion Angad Vir Singh Bajwa and runner-up Mairaj Ahmad Khan have opted to skip the event. “Both our places are confirmed in the team. So, we decided to continue with our training,” said Bajwa. “I am not shooting the selection trials as it is not compulsory for us”, said Mairaj, who has been training at the Dr. Karni Singh Range here. Bajwa did go through the training camp at Tughlakabad along with Mairaj for about a month before returning to his home range in Chandigarh. “It was a nice change from training alone. A long camp gets taxing, but I kept busy by visiting the gym. Training with Mairaj pushes me to my limits,” Bajwa said. Angad felt the need to slow down as the season could get busy with competitions after a month. The first shotgun World Cup is scheduled in Cairo from Feb. 22. “I hope we get the chance to travel abroad for training as that will be very crucial in our build up to the Tokyo Olympics. We need to get used to training on different ranges and conditions. Delhi is our home range and not much of a challenge,” observed Bajwa. Suggesting that it was important to test one’s self in tougher conditions, He said shotgun was much different from rifle and pistol. “Everything changes in our sport from machines, clays, background, climate, lighting conditions, wind etc.” Intense training Conceding that he was already preparing for the World Cup, Bajwa added he trained with intensity at the camp. “I am training regularly, but we don’t know anything about competing in the World Cup in Egypt,” said Mairaj. The rest of the skeet shooters will be shooting two sets of trials from Wednesday to book their place in the national team for the season ahead.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/bajwa-and-mairaj-to-skip-trials/article33506173.ece

The 28-year-old, who has played 36 Tests but was left out at Adelaide and Melbourne, will head to the NCA in Bengaluru to recover.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/rahul-out-with-sprained-wrist/article33505865.ece
06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Great bowlers like Ashwin, Bumrah hard to score against’||Australia head coach Justin Langer on Tuesday praised the Indian bowlers’ discipline in recent times after the visitors levelled the series with an eight-wicket win in the second Test at Melbourne last week. Australia has managed to get to 200 only once — in the second innings in Melbourne — and Langer said his team has been working hard to tackle the Indian bowlers ahead of the third Test in Sydney, which begins on Thursday. “India’s greatest strength over the last couple of series has been their discipline. India has taken a straighter line to a couple of our batters and set the fields accordingly,” said Langer. The former Australia opener also praised R. Ashwin and Jasprit Bumrah, saying that it has not been easy to score quickly against the Indian bowling line-up, in response to criticism that his side has been batting too slowly. Credit to India “We know how we like to play our cricket as Australians, but credit to India... very well-planned. As you would expect, they have discipline in their bowling. And let us not discount Ravi Ashwin. How many has he taken... 380 Test wickets [sic: 375]? The great bowlers are the ones who are hard to score against. Bumrah is up there and Ashwin is up there at the moment,” he added. Langer also said his team has been working on methods to tackle the spin of Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. “I think we have got to look at our strategies against the Indian spinners. Ashwin is bowling very well, and we have worked hard on that for the last week or so.” In what would come as a boost to a misfiring Australian batting line-up, Langer confirmed star opener David Warner is highly likely to play in Sydney after recovering from a groin injury. Moving pretty well “He is moving pretty well and is determined to play. He loves the competition and playing Test cricket. So we will get some final eyes on him at training and make a decision, but I would say he is looking very likely to play the Test match,” said Langer.  Watch the third Test between India and Australia live and exclusive on Sony Ten 1, Ten 3 and Sony Six (SD & HD) channels from January 7 (coverage starts 5 a.m. ).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/great-bowlers-like-ashwin-bumrah-hard-to-score-against/article33505871.ece
06 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Clark joins men’s team support staff||Former Junior India men’s hockey coach Gregg Clark has been appointed as the analytical coach with the national men’s team till the Tokyo Olympics later this year. The South African replaces Australia’s Chris Ciriello, who quit last year for personal and medical reasons amidst the COVID-19 lockdown. Clark, whose last assignment was as Canada’s assistant coach for three years till 2020, is expected to join the ongoing national camp in Bengaluru later this month. Clark had earlier been in charge of the junior men’s team for one year (April 2013-April 2014) and led it to a 10th place finish at the 2013 Junior World Cup in Delhi, deciding against renewing his contract. He was also coach of the Ranchi Rhinos franchise, winning the inaugural edition of the Hockey India League in 2013. Interestingly, the captain of the junior India team back then, Manpreet Singh, is now the skipper of the senior side with seven players of that outfit being part of the current squad. “Having worked with Hockey India earlier, I understand the set-up and their professionalism. Most of the players I coached in the junior team back in 2013 are now in the senior group. It has been exciting to watch this team grow over the past couple of years,” Clark said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/clark-joins-mens-team-support-staff/article33506169.ece

Sri Lanka was bowled out for 211 in its second innings. Set to make 67, the hosts sealed victory without losing a wicket. Karunaratne, the Sri Lankan captain, made 103 after starting the day on 91. His dismissal started a collapse as Sri Lanka lost its last six wickets for 35 runs. Lungi Ngidi took four for 44 and fellow fast bowler Lutho Sipamla ripped through the tail to take three for 40.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sa-gallops-to-series-win/article33505863.ece
06 January 2021||MUMBAI,||IPL 2021: no decision yet on host country||Irrespective of whether the Indian Premier League’s 2021 edition is played in India or the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it is likely to be staged at a limited number of venues.  The Hindu understands that the IPL Governing Council, which discussed various possibilities during its meeting on Monday, decided to wait and watch before finalising the host country for IPL 2021, which is likely to begin in the second week of April. “The MoU with the Emirates Cricket Board has been signed for the long term, so shifting it to UAE, like in 2020, won’t be too much of a hassle,” a BCCI insider revealed. “It will be best to wait for around a month more and judge the possible impact of the pandemic on the IPL.” The governing council, chaired by former India cricketer Brijesh Patel, is learnt to have factored in the possibility of restricting the number of IPL venues in India, instead of allotting games to the base city of every franchise. “Yes, that’s something that’ll need to be looked at. Four or five at the most, ideally to maintain biosecure bubbles, but the franchises will have to be taken into confidence for that,” added the source. Should the venues be limited, the top contenders for staging the tournament include Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai and Kolkata. These venues were under consideration even last year before the pandemic forced the BCCI to move the IPL to the UAE, where it was played at three venues. Auction in February The governing council also discussed the timeline for squad revision. The franchises may be asked to confirm retained players by January 21 and a trading window may continue till the end of the month. The Player Auction will be scheduled around February 10.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ipl-2021-no-decision-yet-on-host-country/article33505867.ece

06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Inner worship||The account of Pusalar Nayanar in the Periyapuranam highlights the way in which Siva brings to light the immeasurable quality of heartfelt worship that he practised in everyday life, pointed out Sri R. Narayanan in a lecture. This Nayanar was a staunch Siva devotee who lived a simple life within his means in the sacred town of Tiruninravur. Somehow, the desire to build a temple for Siva began to take root in him and he tried to collect money and materials for this purpose. Finding his efforts in vain, he decided to build the temple in his heart. Every small detail of the temple, right from the walls, to the yaga mandapa, to the sanctum sanctorum was meticulously planned and diligently constructed in his mind. He then fixed the date for consecration. At the same time, the reigning king in Kanchipuram had also completed constructing a temple for Siva on a grand scale and had decided on the same date for consecration. Siva appeared in the king's dream and informed him thus: “O devout king, one of my devotees in Tiruninravur, one Pusalar Nayanar, has finished building a temple and since the Kumbhabhishekam is tomorrow I shall have to be there. You kindly change the date of consecration.” The king was wonder struck and went to meet the great devotee whom the Lord held in such high regard. Enquiries about the temple Kumbhabhishekam in the town showed that none had any inkling of any such event. The king then went to Pusalar's house. Pusalar was all the more baffled by the king's enquiries, as he had not disclosed his temple building efforts to anyone. He wished to know how the king got to know of it. When the king told him of the dream, Pusalar was overwhelmed at the Lord's grace and infinite compassion towards him.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/inner-worship/article33505859.ece

06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||The vulnerable seducer||It would be fair to say that Amber Heard had a tumultuous 2020. The fallout from the actor’s highly-publicised divorce with Johnny Depp was such that her recurring role of Mera in DC’s Aquaman 2 is now in question. However, the 34-year-old is a picture of calm as she sits down to talk to us about the now: her role in the latest adaptation of Stephen King’s 1978 pandemic thriller The Stand . The mini-series, developed by Josh Boone, follows the remnant of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world wrecked by a pandemic(!), who are locked in a struggle between good and evil, either siding with Mother Abigail (Whoopi Goldberg) or Randall Flag, the Dark Man (Alexander Skarsgård). Despite a plethora of interlinking storylines, King’s novel has been feted for its immense attention to charting the complex arcs of every fictional character — such as Amber Heard’s Nadine Cross. Strange times A schoolteacher during the time of the flu outbreak, Nadine’s fascinating journey in the series follows her mission to meet a man who frequents her dreams — often in a sexually-charged manner — and is later revealed to be the terrifying Randall Flag. Along the way, she meets a 12-year-boy named Leo and a musician Larry, who complicate her visions and ultimate destination further. Speaking on Zoom call in a group interview, Heard says that the première of a show like this, in the middle of the COVID-19 outbreak, makes for rather “interesting timing.” “You know, on set, we used to joke around by saying, ‘Hey, it’s day four of the pandemic,’ and now.. wow. Our story is very different from what’s going on now, of course, but you do understand the similarities. It is based on a global pandemic that wipes out most of the population of Earth and leaves with it the best and the worst of humanity, and exemplifies them. And in an ultimate battle for the best survival of our species, the show details how we don’t just survive, but how we thrive and come together to do so,” she explains. Reflecting on Nadine’s character being a seducer on the show, Heard says, “Thank you to King and his genius for creating characters with nuanced backstories. I’ve tried to do Nadine justice and bring out her humanity. A seducer can also be vulnerable, right? They are not mutually exclusive. I don’t feel as a woman, I have to apologise for one in order to justify the other or vice versa. I think Nadine’s... using the tools that she has to survive.” The actor is currently also in preparation for her most popular role — that of Queen Mera from the Aquaman franchise. How does she differentiate between characters? “Nadina and Mera are totally different. What I seem to be really good at is getting an audience to believe in the villainous woman character! (laughs). Actually in Aquaman , it was a bit of a departure for me being able to play someone who’s not using her womanly ways to bring evil to the world. But Nadine is a character coming with a lot of psychological baggage. There’s a lot of preparation for frankly, how people behave when they have been groomed. Owning her journey was understanding people who come out of cults or people who have committed horrendous crimes.” A huge fan of the source material, Heard says that she discussed Stephen King’s The Stand with the show creator Josh Boone. “In my career, I’ve learned a very important lesson: Always trust a nerd (laughs). When it comes to genres like sci-fi and fantasy especially, just always trust the nerd.” Tango with the devil Some of Heard’s most important scenes — ones that define the outcome of the series — are with Alexander Skarsgård. Playing the literal devil, Heard says, came naturally for the Swedish actor. “Once you see Alexander Skarsgård in the character, you’ll be convinced that no one else could play this role. What this character is meant to do, is serve as a surrogate for the devil within us: the one that acts on lower impulses, out of selfishness.” She adds, “And Alex, because he is so incredibly charming — it’s natural for us (the characters on the show) to want to follow him. That’s why he makes the best devil ever!” Heard, who shot to fame in 2008 with films like Pineapple Express and Never Back Down , says that Nadine has been one of her most complex roles. “One of the key themes on the show is that beyond redemption, everyone has a choice to make, always. With Nadine, part of the real tragedy is that her choices are so much more difficult. She has been raised from an early age to follow a certain path, and she has executed that mission. An important point in the arcs of our characters is really where they’re met with temptation. That’s what makes Nadine’s path heartbreaking. Which is that she ultimately does have the choice, and it’s whether she will take it or not. That would justify whether or not she’s redeemed.”  The Standis currently streaming in India exclusively on Voot Select   A seducer can also be vulnerable, right? They are not mutually exclusive.

06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||Say hello to HelloDuck||It was while randomly sketching out ideas, that friends and bandmates Manish Das and Swayam Majumder happened to draw a duck wearing thug-life glasses. That was the moment the Kolkata-based EDM-pop duo’s name, HelloDuck, was born. “It’s a unique name, kind of cartoonish. That’s why we took it,” laughs Swayam. The indie band’s journey began in 2018 but prior to that, Manish and Swayam, who incidentally studied in the same school, both performed solo. After deciding to collaborate, they started experimenting. “It takes time to get habituated to each other’s music and have a connection,” says Swayam. The duo then put out two remixes, including one of Post Malone’s ‘Goodbyes’. Its first original song, ‘Sirf Tere Liye’, was released towards the end of last year. While Manish produces the tracks, Swayam writes and sings. They also create their own artwork. The duo is now gearing up for the release of its first EP, Yaadein . “It’s a four-track EP and should be out by February. The first song off the EP, ‘Jeene De’, released on January 5,” says Manish. Swayam adds, “Two songs are about heartbreak and two are about falling and being in love. It’s about memories hence the name Yaadein. ” Swayam says that one of his sources of inspiration is just listening to his friends’ stories. “I draw from my personal experiences as well,” he says, “I give vent to my feelings by writing songs and if Manish approves and likes it, we make it a track.” While all their releases so far have been in Hindi, the duo doesn’t rule out releasing English music as well. “Everyone thinks of EDM as music you dance to in the club,” says Swayam, acknowledging the stereotype, “But that’s where we come in. When you listen to our songs, you can vibe to it and dance to it, but they can also make you feel certain emotions. We like to break the barrier of stereotypical EDM songs.”  ‘Jeene De’ is available on major streaming platforms.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/say-hello-to-helloduck/article33506118.ece
06 January 2021||January 06 2021 00:00 IST,||‘Those with content library will conquer the film industry’||The time has come to adapt to a new normal. As filmmakers, our challenge has been to get people to keep aside time to spend watching a story in a closed environment. We assumed that the theatrical experience would last for a long time. That is not how it is going to be. We have seen celluloid give way to digital, but all the changes were not standardised; people worked in different formats and algorithms. Once the 5G sector opens up, theatres are also likely to go into streaming set-ups. What we predicted as innovations in about five years is going to take place within a year’s time due to the pandemic. Corporates — perhaps some entity with a huge library — will head the distribution scene almost in the same way the OTT sector is playing out now. Those with content are going to conquer the industry. Once 5G comes in, buffering time and delays will be reduced significantly. We are going to watch superior quality too. Until now, in most theatres, we were watching 2K projection content. What we are now watching at home now is much superior to that. And as smart TVs become popular, many are accepting 4K. Netflix and Amazon now has 4K content. So there has to be a shift in technology in theatres. Ringing in the changes Almost all theatres were closed till recently. At least a few might be renovated to accept new technology; soon others will have to follow to stay in the game. At the same time, manpower will be reduced drastically. So a lot of people will lose their jobs. For instance, I began as an editor on celluloid. While editing on celluloid, we would need the assistance of six to eight people. Now one person can easily do that same editing on a laptop. All that is required is the mindspace, a computer monitor and a visual headset. Manpower is being reduced steadily, and there is no point in resisting that transition. But once you change to such a new technology, globally, there will only be one release for a film. Now, if you take a film in a regional language, there might be distributors for West Asia, another for Canada, and another for the US markets. Soon that will be stopped. You will give the content to one distributor and that person will distribute it to the entire world. The reach will be much more, films and content will also see an increase. As content increases, there will be a filtration... such as what kind of content should go to theatres, what should go to mobiles, what for televisions. For instance, in the US, even now, in the case of OTT platforms, there are separate rates for mobiles and televisions. That is gradually coming to India. Take a platform like Hulu, a popular one in the US. They are producing content and releasing it simultaneously on multiple platforms like theatres, televisions, mobile apps and so on. In such a scenario, content creators like directors may not have the right to decide in which platform our film will be screened. It might be decided by some big players, like for instance, they might decide only films like Baahubali need be screened in theatres. They might decide that smaller films need not be screened in theatres, and audiences might start accepting it as going to cinemas is likely going to be expensive. For instance, in Malayalam, they might choose to screen only films of superstars in theatres. Or in some cases, films that clicked on the digital spaces might be chosen to be screened in theatres as well. Revenue is bound to increase too.  Embracing technology I am almost confident that for some time cinema is going to be made in studios like how it was in the olden days. There will be outdoor shooting but we may have to put up sets and shoot inside sets. For about two years, content producers are likely to play safe and restrict numbers and observe safety protocols in view of the pandemic. They will be more dependent on VFX and advanced technology to create more real-like scenes. When we go for a digital release, the content has to be intriguing enough for the viewer to want to sit through. They have this device called the remote that is missing in theatres. A person who comes to the theatre comes with a mindset to watch the film and might be willing to put up with lags or certain drawbacks in the film’s plot. However, to hook people to a film with a digital release is going to be a challenge. I am still learning that. That is the reason why even web series on OTT platforms are not like the soap sagas on televisions. There are plot changes, twists… everything is planned to keep the viewer glued to the story. We have to embrace technology. There are going to be transitions, which might be painful. But change is the only constant. Virtual reality might be the future of films. We don’t know. But emotional content will always have its audience; there is a universal truth in it.

06 January 2021||Ghaziabad,||Civic body seizes AMU accounts||Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on Tuesday clarified that it had written letters to the Union Minister of Education and the University Grants Commission to settle the issue of payment of property tax dues of the Aligarh Nagar Nigam. The municipal corporation had seized some accounts of the University on Monday over nonpayment of property tax of over Rs. 14 crore. Vinay Kumar Rai, Nigam’s Chief Taxation Officer, told reporters that the body had given many opportunities to the University to pay the dues. “An amount of Rs. 14.83 crore is due from the University. After giving them many chances, including issuing a notice of demand and personal contact, we have attached the accounts of AMU in the State Bank of India, because the financial interests of the Corporation were getting affected,” he said. Week’s time given A week has been given to AMU to deposit the amount but if it still fails, the amount in the account will be transferred to the Corporation, Mr. Rai said. In an official release, AMU pointed out that the matter was sub judice and pending in the Allahabad High Court and a court of small causes was also hearing AMU’s plea. The University, the release said, had been paying house tax for residential areas, and it got exemption for the classrooms, laboratories and libraries from the Aligarh Municipal Council. In 2006, when the Aligarh Nagar Nigam came into being, it reversed the decision and the University approached the High Court. AMU spokesperson Shafey Kidwai said the University had an outstanding amount of over Rs. 9 crore against the Nigam as it has not paid electricity consumption charges for its tubewells. He added Banaras Hindu University and some other central institutions also got house tax exemption from the court and no tax was levied on classrooms, etc.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/civic-body-seizes-amu-accounts/article33506136.ece

Leader status in Assam Assembly||Congress Legislature Party leader Debabrata Saikia has lost the status of the Leader of the Opposition in the 126-member Assam Assembly. An official notification said the Assembly has withdrawn the status from Mr. Saikia as the present strength of the Congress is one less than the required number of 21 MLAs. “The present strength of the Congress in Assembly is not equal to the quorum fixed to constitute a sitting of the House that is one-sixth of the total number of Members of the House as required,” the notification said. It added that Speaker Hitendra Nath Goswami withdrew the recognition to Mr. Saikia as the Leader of the Opposition from January 1. ‘Unfortunate, shocking’ The Congress reacted on Tuesday, saying derecognising Mr. Saikia as the Leader of the Opposition at the fag-end of the Assembly was “unfortunate and shocking”. “Due to the sudden demise of a few members and defection of a few others, the number of (Congress) members has decreased but we are still the single-largest Opposition party in the House,” Durga Bhumij, Congress MLA from Doomdooma, said. He reminded the Speaker of States where the Leader of the Opposition is recognised despite the Opposition party bagging far fewer seats than the “one-sixth rule of the quorum”. He cited the cases of Chhattisgarh where BJP has 14 out of 90 seats, Delhi where BJP has three out of 70 seats and West Bengal where the Congress has 23 out of 294 seats.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/congress-mla-loses-oppn-leader-status-in-assam-assembly/article33506137.ece

AJYCP had petitioned the Supreme Court for the implementation of the British-era Inner Line Permit (ILP) system that restricts the entry of people from elsewhere in India. “Apart from staging protests, our objective is to bring different political parties on board for the intervention of the Central government in CAA and ILP,” AJYCP general secretary Palash Changmai said on Tuesday. He added that AJYCP and other like-minded organisations would be reviving the anti-CAA movement in Assam, with the first mass protest across all districts and sub-divisional headquarters of the State scheduled on January 9.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/assam-group-to-take-anti-caa-fight-to-delhi/article33506138.ece
