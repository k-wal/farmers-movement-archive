08 January 2021||Washington,||Biden win confirmed amid pro-Trump mob attack||The U.S. Congress confirmed Democrat Joe Biden as the presidential election winner early on Thursday after a violent mob loyal to President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol in a stunning attempt to overturn the presidential election, undercut the nation’s democracy and keep Mr. Trump in the White House. Lawmakers were resolved to complete the Electoral College tally in a display to the country, and the world, of the nation’s enduring commitment to uphold the will of the voters and the peaceful transfer of power. They pushed through the night with tensions high and the nation’s capital on alert. Before dawn on Thursday, the lawmakers finished their work, confirming that Mr. Biden had won the election. Vice-President Mike Pence, presiding over the joint session, announced the tally — 306-232. Mr. Trump, who repeatedly refused to concede the election, said in a statement immediately after the vote that there would be a smooth transition of power on Inauguration Day. “Though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20,” Mr. Trump said in a statement posted on Twitter by an aide. Woman shot dead The Capitol was under siege on Wednesday, as the nation’s elected representatives scrambled to crouch under desks and don gas masks while the police futilely tried to barricade the building, one of the most jarring scenes ever to unfold in a seat of American political power. A woman was shot and killed inside the Capitol, and Washington’s Mayor instituted an evening curfew to contain the violence. The rioters were egged on by Mr. Trump, who has spent weeks falsely attacking the integrity of the election and had urged his supporters to descend on Washington to protest against Congress’ formal approval of Mr. Biden’s victory. Some Republican lawmakers were in the midst of raising objections to the results on his behalf when the proceedings were abruptly halted by the mob. Congress reconvened in the evening, with lawmakers decrying the protests that defaced the Capitol and vowing to finish confirming the Electoral College vote for Mr. Biden’s election, even if it took all night. ‘Failed insurrection’ Mr. Pence reopened the Senate and addressed the demonstrators: “You did not win.” Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the “failed insurrection” underscored the lawmakers’ duty to finish the count. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress would show the world “what America is made of” with the outcome. The President gave his supporters a boost into action on Wednesday morning at a rally outside the White House, where he urged them to march to the Capitol. He spent much of the afternoon in his private dining room off the Oval Office watching scenes of the violence on television. At the urging of his staff, he reluctantly issued a pair of tweets and a taped video telling his supporters it was time to “go home in peace” — yet he still said that he backed their cause. Twitter for the first time time locked Mr. Trump’s account, demanded that he remove tweets excusing violence and threatened “permanent suspension”. Facebook banned him from the platform “indefinitely” due to his efforts to incite the violence, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said. ‘Assault on democracy’ A sombre President-elect Biden, two weeks away from being inaugurated, said American democracy was “under unprecedented assault”, a sentiment echoed by many in Congress, including some Republicans. Former President George W. Bush said he watched the events in “disbelief and dismay”. The domed Capitol building has for centuries been the scene of protests and occasional violence. But Wednesday’s events were particularly astounding both because they unfolded at least initially with the implicit blessing of the President and because of the underlying goal of overturning the results of a free and fair presidential election.  Mr. Trump spent the lead-up to the proceedings publicly hectoring Mr. Pence, who had a ceremonial role, to aid the effort to throw out the results. He tweeted, “Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!” But Mr. Pence, in a statement, defied Mr. Trump, saying he could not claim “unilateral authority” to reject the electoral votes that make Mr. Biden President.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/biden-win-confirmed-amid-pro-trump-mob-attack/article33524922.ece
08 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,||CS: design behind attacks on religious structures runs deep||Chief Secretary Aditya Nath Das has said the design of the recent attacks on Hindu temples is deep and that the intention behind them does not appear to be to merely commit a crime. Rather, the objective is to disturb peace in order to derail welfare activities undertaken by the government, going by the circumstances and the manner in which certain vested interest groups are raking up the issue, he opined. “What has happened is a matter of grave concern for the government, as the incidents brought disrepute to a State that is known for religious bonding and communal harmony,” he observed at a press conference on Thursday while announcing the constitution of State and district-level Communal Harmony Committees.  The State-level committee will be chaired by the Chief Secretary and will have the Director-General of Police as the vice-chairman. It will comprise one representative each from Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain and other communities and Principal Secretaries (Home, Endowments and Minority Welfare) as members, and Principal Secretary (General Administration) as member-convener. Mr. Das said the attacks on religious structures warranted constant vigil, which was the task assigned to the committees. These committees would strive to foster a spirit of togetherness and brotherhood among the communities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/cs-design-behind-attacks-on-religious-structures-runs-deep/article33524924.ece
08 January 2021||New Delhi,||Farmers hold ‘rehearsal’ of Republic Day tractor parade||Protesting farmers who took part in tractor rallies on the expressways surrounding Delhi on Thursday emphasised that it was only a “dress rehearsal” for the parallel parade that they plan to hold within the capital on Republic Day. They urged the Centre to accept their demands for the repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee for minimum support prices at Friday’s negotiations. The tractor march started simultaneously from four different points around 11 a.m., with each group returning to their starting points around 4 p.m. More than 5,000 tractors took part, according to a statement from the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a joint front coordinating the protests. Protesters also joined in buses and private vehicles. However, there was a no-show from a fifth group at Rewasan, as its leaders were detained by the Haryana police. “This was just a trailer, the complete picture will be shown on Republic Day,” said Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson for the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU-Tikait), who led hundreds of tractors from Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border, travelling along the Eastern Peripheral Expressway. He said the government could test the farmers as much as it wanted but the farmers would not go home before the farm laws were repealed. “The government still has a day to ponder over repealing the three laws and forming a new law, guaranteeing the MSP.” Farmers from various parts of Uttar Pradesh continued to join the group as they progressed towards Palwal in Haryana. Minor skirmishes between the farmers and policemen were reported in Bulandshahr and Gautam Buddha Nagar when farmers veered off from the prescribed route, leading to traffic snarls. Iraj Raja, Superintendent of Police (Rural), Ghaziabad, said no permission was sought for the rally but “the administration was in no mood for confrontation as long as there was no law-and-order problem. We had put more policemen on the ground to ensure smooth flow of traffic.” Another group was supposed to have come from Rewasan in Nuh district to join them in Palwal, but failed to get started. Mewat Vikas Sabha president Salamudeen Meo said that All-India Mewati Samaj president Ramzan Chaudhary was detained by the Nuh police, and three other farmer leaders put under house arrest. Narendra Bijarniya, Superintendent of Police, Nuh, said only Mr. Chaudhary was detained and let off in the evening.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/farmers-hold-rehearsal-of-r-day-tractor-parade/article33524959.ece
08 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||With an eye on polls, Budget session begins today||A host of political issues are likely to dominate the Budget session of the Kerala Legislative Assembly that gets underway here on Friday. The Opposition's demand to remove Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan is likely to loom large over Governor Arif Muhammad Khan's policy address and ensuing discussions. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Thursday accused Mr. Sreeramakrishnan of using the legislature's heft to protect his staff from questioning by the Customs probing the politically tempestuous UAE consulate gold smuggling case. Earlier, IUML legislator M. Ummer had initiated a notice to table a resolution to remove Mr. Sreeramakrishnan from his office on the charge of lowering the esteem of the House by associating with gold smugglers. The Speaker said that he would allow the motion and had nothing to hide. The government is approaching the session with a clear eye on the elections. Aggressive Budget It plans to present an aggressive Budget with an emphasis on welfare economics. The administration's spending plans will highlight populist schemes to improve infrastructure, health care, education, agriculture and social security net. The government hopes to steer legislative dialogue away from scandals and towards its development agenda. It believes that welfarism in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic had helped the LDF counter the Opposition's recriminatory tactics and savour victory in some measure in the local body polls. LDF strategy The government hopes to use the session to amplify its election manifesto to replicate the local body poll trend in the Assembly election too. It also hopes to use corruption cases against UDF leaders to press the Opposition back into defence on the floor. The LDF might politically weaponise the controversy surrounding the alleged Congress- Jamaat-e- Islami poll alliance and the "dominance" of a resurgent IUML against the Congress. In turn, the party will seek to spotlight LDF's "tacit understanding" with SDPI and BJP in over 100 local body wards. Opposition plan The Opposition feels that it has several arrows in its quiver to target the government. They include the gold smuggling case, Sprinklr scandal, CAG's observations against KIIFB and breach of privilege motion against Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac. Moreover, the UDF is confident that its floor strategy will bring political dividends on the Assembly poll.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/with-an-eye-on-polls-budget-session-begins-today/article33525271.ece
08 January 2021||Ghaziabad,||Budaun case: main accused still at large||The main accused in the gang rape and murder of an anganwadi worker in a Budaun village continues to elude the police. The crime took place on Sunday night and he was seen by the local people till Monday afternoon. On Wednesday, the U.P. Special Task Force was also pressed into service. An award of Rs. 50,000 has been declared by the Budaun police for information leading to the arrest of Satya Narayan. His two aides and co-accused were arrested on Wednesday. “We have strong inputs and he will be arrested soon,” Sankalp Sharma, SSP, Budaun, said. Chandramukhi Devi, a member of the National Commission for Women, made a controversial statement after meeting the victim’s family. “I have always told women not to go out at untimely hours under somebody’s influence. I think had she not gone to the temple premises in the evening or had a family member accompanied her, the incident could have been avoided. I have been told it was a planned incident. She got a call from the accused.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/budaun-case-main-accused-still-at-large/article33525430.ece
08 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||GDP likely to contract by 7.7% this fiscal: govt.||India’s real GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is estimated to contract by 7.7% in 2020-21, compared to a growth rate of 4.2% in 2019-20, with GVA (Gross Valued added) shrinking by 7.2%, advance estimates released by the National Statistical Office on Thursday show. India’s economy had expanded 4.2% in 2019-20, but entered a recessionary phase with two successive quarters of sharp contraction triggered by the COVID-19 lockdowns beginning March 2020. Following a 23.9% collapse in the economy in the April-June period, the GDP shrank by 7.5% in the second quarter — leading to a real GDP contraction of 15.7% in the first half of 2020-21. The economy will surface in the second half to record near-zero growth, or a mere 0.1% contraction, the estimates suggest. Based on an uptick in several indicators in the past few months, several agencies have upgraded their estimates, with the RBI recently projecting a 7.5% contraction in the year compared to its earlier estimate of a 9.5% decline. Just two sectors are estimated to record positive growth in GVA, with agriculture continuing its strong run through the first half of the year into the second half (3.4%) and electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services posting (2.7%). The sharpest decline in the pandemic-dented year is expected in Trade, Hotels, Transport, Communication and Services related to broadcasting (-21.4%), followed by Construction (-12.6%), Mining and quarrying (-12.4%) and Manufacturing (-9.4%). Public administration, defence and other services are also projected to contract by 3.7%, while Financial, Real Estate and Professional Services shall record a marginal 0.8% decline year-on-year, as per the advanced estimates. Real GVA at basic prices is estimated at Rs. 123.39 lakh crore in 2020-21, against Rs. 133.01 lakh crore in 2019-20, while the real GDP in 2020-21 is likely to attain a level of Rs. 134.40 lakh crore, as against the provisional GDP estimate for 2019-20 of Rs. 145.66 lakh crore, the NSO said in a statement. The Finance Ministry said the advanced estimates “reflect continued resurgence in economic activity” in the third and fourth quarters. “The continuous quarter-on-quarter growth endorses the strength of economic fundamentals of the country to sustain a post lockdown V-shaped recovery. On the demand side, real GDP in 2020-21 has been supported by an estimated increase in Government Consumption Expenditure by 5.8%,” it said, reacting to the NSO report. State Bank of India group chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh said, “It’s now official. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, India will witness negative GDP growth rate for the first time after 1979-80. This estimate, however, has a shelf life of only two months and is only used as an input for Budget arithmetic. We believe that GDP and GVA for 2020-21 would be revised further downwards in estimates that will be released in February and May.” Government expenditure is expected to show a robust growth of 17% in the second half of the year, despite the challenges faced by the government on fiscal consolidation and the fact that government expenditure fell 3.9% in the first half of the year, CARE Ratings said. Private consumption and investment will end the year in the negative zone.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/gdp-likely-to-contract-by-77-this-fiscal-govt/article33524953.ece

08 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||States will get vaccines soon, says Vardhan||Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday said the government would ensure a seamless last-mile delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine, which “is on the verge of being available in the country”. Dr. Vardhan was interacting with the Health Ministers of the States and the Union Territories ahead of the second nation-wide mock drill on the COVID-19 vaccination on Friday. He said all the States/UTs would start getting their vaccine supplies soon. The Union Health Minister directed that robust preparations be made for the roll-out of the inoculation drive. During the meeting, senior officials from Kashmir raised the issue of not having enough technology to work with the Ministry’s digital platform Co-WIN which provides real-time information on vaccine stocks, their storage temperature and beneficiaries of the vaccine. The officials sought for an offline system for collecting and storing data. Priority group Ministers from States, including Bihar and Odisha, demanded that MPs, MLAs and panchayat members should be included in the priority group for the vaccine, while others wanted the Centre’s assistance in getting the technical glitches cleared and arranging enough transportation facility in time for vaccine supply and a template for registering the elderly and those with comorbidities. Equal distribution The States also sought an equal distribution of the vaccine and the maintenance of a smooth supply pipeline to ensure adequate supply. Dr. Vardhan said the objective of the mock drill was to simulate the actual vaccine administration event. “The dry run will also familiarise the State, district, block and hospital level officers on all aspects of the vaccine roll-out. “This activity will help administrators in strengthening the linkages between planning, implementation and reporting mechanisms, identify any residual challenges prior to the actual implementation and to provide confidence to the programme managers at all levels to carry out a smooth implementation of the vaccination drive,” he said. Cold chain infrastructure The country’s cold chain infrastructure had been sufficiently upgraded to ensure last-mile delivery, he said, adding that adequate supplies of syringes and other logistics had been provided.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/states-will-get-vaccines-soon-says-vardhan/article33524952.ece

08 January 2021||New Delhi,||SC expresses concern over farmers’ stir||Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde on Thursday voiced the Supreme Court’s apprehension that mass gatherings of protesting farmers will lead to a “problem similar to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation” in March last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “Same problem will arise from the farmers’ protest... Don’t know if they are protected from COVID-19... You must tells us what is happening,” the CJI, heading a three-judge Bench, addressed Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta. “We will find out the status,” Mr. Mehta responded. The court was hearing a petition filed by Jammu-based advocate Supriya Pandita, represented by advocate Omprakash Parihar, seeking a CBI probe into circumstances leading to the swelling of migrant workers, anxious to leave the national capital for their villages and hometowns, at the Anand Vihar Bus Terminal for buses, and the Tablighi Jamaat congregation, which even saw foreign delegates, in violation of the social distancing norms. Both incidents happened last March, the month which saw a complete lockdown to prevent the spread of the infection. Report sought The court issued notice to the Union and Delhi governments, and asked Mr. Mehta to file a detailed report on the guidelines to prevent COVID-19, including restrictions on mass gatherings. When Mr. Parihar submitted that there was “no trace of Maulana Saad”, the chief of Nizamuddin Markaz, the CJI stopped him, saying “we are interested in preventing COVID-19 and compliance of guidelines here... and you are worried about one person”. The petition accused the Centre, the Delhi government and the police of failing to stop the spread of the virus. The advisory, the petition said, “clearly states that religious leaders are to regulate mass gatherings and ensure no overcrowding. There should be a metre’s distance between people, non-essential travel should be avoided”. The petition quoted the advisory, which mandates that “any event [social, cultural, political, religious, academic, sports, seminars and conference] except marriages is restricted to a maximum of 50 persons in the NCT of Delhi till March 31”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/sc-expresses-concern-over-farmers-stir/article33524878.ece

These States have been reporting an upsurge in the number of daily new cases in the recent days, said a release issued by the Health Ministry. The States have been advised to maintain a strict vigil and take steps to keep a check on the rising cases, especially in view of the new virus strain being observed in certain countries and reported in a few States in India. In his letter, Mr. Bhushan has drawn the attention of the States to the low and declining testing rates. Any laxity at this crucial juncture may squander the results of the collective actions in containing the transmission, he noted. The health authorities in the States have been advised to proactively promote wearing of masks and other COVID-19 appropriate behaviours while the vaccination drive starts. “It is important to ensure no complacency in the collective efforts in containment and management of COVID-19,’’ the Health Secretary said. Bharat Biotech trial Meanwhile, Bharat Biotech on Thursday announced “successful completion” of volunteer enrolment for Phase-3 clinical trials of its indigenously manufactured vaccine, Covaxin. In a tweet, the company said, “COVAXIN successfully completes Phase 3 clinical trials enrolment of 25,800 volunteers.’’ Suchitra Ella, joint managing director of Bharat Biotech International Ltd., said: “We sincerely express our gratitude to clinical trial sites, principle investigators & healthcare workers for their relentless support and trust in our public-private partnership vaccine discovery.

08 January 2021||MYSURU,||Residents shocked as leopard enters doctors’ quarters||A leopard entered the residential quarters of doctors and professors of the Chamarajanagar Institute of Medical Sciences (CIMS), located about 7 km from Chamarajanagar town, on Wednesday night, scaring inmates. But the big cat, which reached the first floor of the residential complex, retreated through the stairs and disappeared under the cover of darkness. CCTV footage showed the animal racing along the corridor and going down the stairs. But within seconds it reappeared, peeped inside an open door but backtracked and went out of view again. One of the residents who sighted the leopard alerted other residents in the quarters and Forest Department personnel were informed who deployed guards to patrol the area. Deputy Commissioner, Chamarajanagar, M.R. Ravi said the medical quarters abuts the Yadapura hillock and leopards had been sighted in the area frequently. But it was unclear whether it was the same leopard or there were others too living in the vicinity. He said the footage showed the leopard peeping into a house which had the door open and retreating from there and it was at that point, around 9.30 p.m., that its presence was noticed Meanwhile, the Forest department has placed a cage inside the campus to trap the leopard in case it ventures again, besides issuing a set of instructions for the inmates to adhere to, especially in the evenings and nights. Manoj Kumar, Chief Conservator of Forests of Chamarajanagar, said the area surrounding the medical college campus had lot of open pits of abandoned quarries and leopards from the forests tend to use them as hideouts. One of them might have strayed into the residential quarters in search of a prey and it was sheer providence that there was no untoward incident, he added. The Forest department had suggested that the open pits left abandoned after quarrying be reclaimed by filling them with soil followed by plantation. Mr. Manoj Kumar said his staff were preparing a report on open quarries and would submit it to the district administration and the government so that they could be closed. Meanwhile, other sources said the area around the Yadapura hillock, where the medical college and the quarters were located, was a natural habitat for leopards and other wildlife. Approval for slew of constructions, including government buildings in this area despite its proximity to forests, has led to habitat degradation and squeezed the leopards to the periphery, resulting in such conflict situations.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/residents-shocked-as-leopard-enters-doctors-quarters/article33524852.ece
08 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||New freight corridor a big boost: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday inaugurated the New Rewari-New Madar section of the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor and flagged off the world’s first 1.5-km-long electrified double stack long haul container train. Mr. Modi said the project was part of the mission to modernise the country’s infrastructure and was being seen as a game changer for the India of 21st century. The section, which became operational after a hard work of five to six years, would be beneficial to farmers, industrialists and businessmen in the National Capital Region, Haryana and Rajasthan. More jobs, investment The corridor would lead to the development of growth centres and points in several cities, creation of job opportunities and conditions attracting more investments. It would give a new fillip to the local industries and manufacturing units by providing them faster and cheaper access to the national and international markets. They would get easy access to the ports in Gujarat and Maharashtra, he noted. A portion of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor, the New Bhaupur-New Khurja section, was started last month and through it, farm produce were being transported from Punjab and coal from Jharkhand was being supplied to the National Capital Region, Haryana and Punjab. Compared to the previous freight train average speed of 25 km/hour, the maximum of 90 km/hour had now been achieved, Mr. Modi pointed out. In all, 133 railway stations in nine States would be impacted by the Dedicated Freight Corridor. New multi-model logistic parks, freight terminals, container depots/terminals and parcel hubs would be developed at these places. It would not only benefit villages, farmers, the poor and the small businesses, but also attract big manufacturers, he said. With the launch of the double stack long haul container train between New Ateli in Haryana and New Kishanganj in Rajasthan, India had also entered the club of nations with such high capabilities, he stated. Northeast link Given the rapid infrastructural expansion, all the Northeast State capitals would soon be linked to the national rail network. The work of indigenously developing high-speed tracks was also under way. Earlier, Mr. Modi listed several initiatives, including a digital payment of Rs. 18,000 crore to farmers under the direct benefit transfer scheme, taken by the government in the past couple of weeks, to highlight the speed with which important projects were being implemented despite the COVID-19 induced crisis.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/new-freight-corridor-a-big-boost-pm/article33524892.ece
08 January 2021||Kochi,||HC defers proceedings on order on church takeover||A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court deferred till January 15 further proceedings based on a single judge order directing the Central Reserve Police Force to take over the Kothamangalam Marthoman church if the Ernakulam District Collector did not comply with its earlier order this regard by January 8. The Bench comprising Justice Alexander Thomas and Justice T.R. Ravi passed the order on an appeal filed by the State government against the single judge’s order. The single judge had passed the order on a contempt of court petition filed by the Orthodox faction against the Collector for not complying with an earlier Hight Court directive. ‘Beyond power’ State Attorney K.V. Sohan contended that the directive was beyond the power of the single judge. It amounted to interference with the sovereign power of the State over law and order issues. If the court found that the action of the Collector was contemptuous, the single judge could only refer it to a Division Bench. The single judge’s order had violated rules on the contempt of court proceedings. The Bench orally observed that the issues raised by the State government in the appeal required a serious hearing. It would examine whether the single judge could issue a directive of this nature in a contempt proceeding at the admission stage. The government in its appeal said the single judge ought to have directed the Chief Secretary to initiate action if the Collector did not comply with its directive.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/hc-defers-proceedings-on-order-on-church-takeover/article33524856.ece
08 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Key nutrition committees fail to meet||The government’s three top committees on nutrition responsible for providing policy directions, monitoring the implementation of various schemes and reviewing the nutritional status of various States and Union Territories have failed to meet even once since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, though they are required to meet every quarter. This is despite global warnings of rising levels of hunger, malnutrition and child mortality. A leading member of one of these bodies, Chandrakant S. Pandav, who is also known as the “Iodine Man of India”, told The Hindu that “he is depressed and angry” at the “collapse” of the nutrition system as the “situation has gone from bad to worse, which could have been prevented”. Another member of the Executive Committee of the National Nutrition Mission said on the condition of anonymity that “structures created by the PM under the Nutrition Mission need to be used and not be kept idle”. Both members said they had raised their concerns with the heads of these committees urging them to call an urgent meeting. Three panels The three top committees are: the National Nutrition Council (NNC), headed by NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar and including 12 Union Ministers and five Chief Ministers on a rotational basis; the Executive Committee (EC) of the National Nutrition Mission headed by the Secretary of the Women and Child Development Ministry Ram Mohan Mishra; and the National Technical Board on Nutrition (NTBN), headed by Member, NITI Aayog, V.K. Paul. These committees were set up after the Cabinet approved the National Nutrition Mission in December 2017 and were mandated to meet once every quarter. They have to supervise the policy framework and the implementation of the government programmes, review the performance of various States, give scientific and technical recommendations for the execution of various schemes and propose corrective measures. Only one this year The NNC held its last meeting in October 2019, and the EC met last in February 2020. According to the NITI Aayog’s website, the NTBN has met only twice and its last meeting was held in August 2018. ‘Bad to worse’ Asked if the meetings were scuttled because of the focus on COVID-19, Dr. Pandav said: “COVID-19 is the reason why these meetings should have been held urgently. COVID-19 has scuttled everything. I am depressed and angry. The situation [poverty and hunger] has gone from bad to worse, which could have been prevented. We could have used imaginative ways of engaging communities, but we lost the opportunity to reach them.” Another expert, who is a member of the EC that met last in February 2020, said: “COVID-19 has put a lot of pressure on the underprivileged, especially women and children, who need nourishment at a time income levels have gone down. We need to put our heads together to ensure this.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/key-nutrition-committees-fail-to-meet/article33524894.ece
08 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Judges should not be hypersensitive: Justice Lokur||Judges should not be “hypersensitive” about criticism, former Supreme Court judge Justice Madan B. Lokur has said. It was high time judges sat down for an introspection on what had gone wrong and what was to be done, he said. N. Ram, Director of The Hindu Group of Publications and former Editor-in-Chief of The Hindu , said there should be a “robust, strong, uninhibited and informed criticism of the functioning of the judiciary”. They were speaking at a webinar on “Keys to governance: independence of judiciary” organised by the India International Centre and the D.S. Borker Memorial Foundation on Thursday. Other speakers were senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy and Professor Tarunabh Khaitan. The discussion was moderated by Suhas Borker. The Supreme Court has been at the centre of a furious public debate on various aspects, including a Chief Justice of India becoming a Rajya Sabha member after retirement and the trial and punishment of civil rights lawyer Prashant Bhushan for allegedly scandalising the top court. Mr. Ram pointed out that the “scandalising the court” provision in the contempt law should be struck down by the court itself. Parliament would not do it. The provision was vague, arbitrary and had a chilling effect on free speech. ‘Shocking case’ He said the case against Mr. Bhushan was “shocking” and one must push the line with well-informed criticism of the judiciary. “It is important for people to have the opportunity and entitlement to criticise the judiciary, to call it out when judiciary is corrupt or arbitrary or allows itself to be submissive to external influences. Was the January 12 press conference of the judges a contempt? A lot of people applauded [the four judges, including Justice Lokur, who held the press conference],” Mr. Ram said. Ms. Guruswamy said the contempt of court law should be scrapped. Justice Lokur, however, said it was for each individual judge to decide whether or not to accept post-retirement assignments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/judges-should-not-be-hypersensitive-justice-lokur/article33524896.ece

Interim report While the commission has been asked to submit its interim report in one year, it has been given a two-year tenure to complete its study and suggest measures to be implemented. The Secretary, Department of Personnel Administrative Reforms, will function as the commission’s secretary.

08 January 2021||COIMBATORE,||Satya Paul, who ‘reinvented’ the sari, passes away in Coimbatore||Satya Paul, best known as the designer who reinvented the sari for contemporary women, died at the Isha Yoga Centre here on Wednesday. He was 78. His son Puneet Nanda shared on Facebook that Mr. Satya Paul, born on February 2, 1942, had suffered a stroke last month and was recovering at hospital. “His only wish was to get all the things he was being monitored and poked with removed so he could fly away. We finally got clearance from doctors to take him back to Isha Yoga Centre, his home since 2015. As per his wish, he gently passed on with blessings of the Master,” Mr. Nanda wrote. According to a press release, Mr. Satya Paul’s inquisitive nature led him to be a pioneer in the field of retailing, starting in the late 1960s and expanding to exports of the finest Indian handloom products to high-end retail stores in Europe and the U.S. In 1980, he launched the first sari boutique in India, L’Affaire, and in 1986, India’s first designer label, with his son Puneet. The Satya Paul brand became one of the premier brands in the country and he passed on his mantle to his son in 2000. They exited the company in 2010. Mr. Nanda wrote on Facebook, “Most people are not aware, more than as a designer or entrepreneur, he has been steadfastly a seeker ... He couldn’t have had a sweeter life or passage ... at the feet of the Master. We are sad only a bit, mostly rejoicing him, his life and now his passing with such a blessing.” Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, Founder of Isha Foundation, tweeted, Satya Paul, “a shining example of what it means to live with immeasurable passion and unrelenting involvement. The distinct vision you brought to the Indian fashion industry is a beautiful tribute to this. A privilege to have had you amongst us.

08 January 2021||Ghaziabad,||Budaun case: main accused arrested||In a late-night crackdown on Thursday, the Uttar Pradesh police arrested a priest who is the main accused in the alleged gang rape of an anganwadi worker at Budaun. District Magistrate Kumar Prashant said that “mahant” Satya Narayan was hiding in the house of his follower in a village in the Ughaiti police station limits and was picked up from there. He was immediately arrested and is being interrogated by a police team. On Wednesday, the U.P. Special Task Force was pressed into service to help the local police. An award of Rs. 50,000 had been declared by the local police for information leading to the arrest of Satya Narayan. His two aides and co-accused in the case were arrested on Wednesday. Controversial remark Chandramukhi Devi, a member of the National Commission for Women, made a controversial statement after meeting the family of the victim. “I have always told women not to go out at untimely hours under somebody’s influence. I think had she not gone to the temple premises in the evening or had a family member accompanied her, the incident could have been avoided. I have been told it was a planned incident. She got a call from the accused.” She also questioned the role of the police in the incident and described their behaviour as “insensitive”. “If the police had reached in time, the woman could have been saved. There was a delay in post-mortem as well. I have seen the report... it is a loathsome incident.” Sankalp Sharma, Senior Superintendent of Police, Budaun, told The Hindu that apart from suspension, an FIR under 166A of the IPC had been lodged against the SHO for dereliction of duty. “The fact that the police were busy with another incident on the said date is no excuse. There is sufficient manpower in the station to handle more than one case,” he said. He said the police were not hiding the severity of the injuries mentioned in the post mortem report. A delegation of the Samajwadi Party visited the victim’s family. Senior leader Dharmendra Yadav demanded a CBI probe and Rs. 25 lakh as compensation for the family. “The Yogi government has failed on all fronts,” he said. The vice-president of the Bharatiya Janta Party’s Uttar Pradesh unit B.L. Verma also visited the family and promised prompt action. Mr. Verma hails from Budaun.

08 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||JEE-Advanced to be held on July 3||JEE-Advanced 2021, the entrance test for the elite Indian Institutes of Technology, will be held on July 3, Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank announced on Thursday. IIT Kharagpur will conduct the examination this year. The IITs will relax their eligibility criteria again this year, said Mr. Nishank. Earlier, students had to score a minimum of 75% in their Class 12 board examinations or rank in the top 20 percentile of the qualifying examination in order to be eligible for JEE Advanced. However, a simple pass in Class 12 will be sufficient this year. The same relaxation was offered in 2020 also due to the impact of the pandemic. JEE-Main is the qualifying exam for JEE-Advanced. A larger number of candidates than usual are likely to attempt JEE-Advanced this year. In view of the pandemic, the IIT Joint Admission Board had decided that all students who successfully registered for JEE Advanced in 2020, but did not write the examination, will be allowed to attempt the examination in 2021, without having to first write JEE Main 2021. That is, their qualifying JEE Main scores for 2020 will be considered valid for one more year. This was a one-time measure, in view of students unable being to write JEE Advanced in 2020 because they had COVID-19, lived in a containment zone, were unable to travel to an examination centre, or for any other reason. Candidates getting this second chance to write JEE-Advanced will be considered in addition to and not as part of the total number who will qualify from JEE-Main 2021 in order not to disadvantage this year’s candidates.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/jee-advanced-to-be-held-on-july-3/article33524885.ece
08 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||China must respect rules, says France||A day after the Chinese Ambassador in India objected to the outgoing U.S. Ambassador’s comments on the India-China stand-off, a senior French diplomat, on Thursday, said that “when China breaks rules, we have to be very robust and very clear”. When it came to direct threats to India, he said, France had always been supportive on Kashmir at the UN Security Council and did “not let the Chinese play any procedural games”. “Let us not go for confrontation — it’s much easier to say this from Paris, [than] from Delhi when you almost have a problem in the Himalayas and when you have Pakistan at your border. And I mean on direct threats to India, we have always been very clear. Whether on Kashmir we have been very supportive of India in the Security Council, we have not let the Chinese play any kind of procedural games,” Emmanuel Bonne, Diplomatic Adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron, said at a webinar organised by the Vivekananda International Foundation on Thursday. Referring to the stand-off in eastern Ladakh, he said that when it came to the Himalayas, the statement had been “perfectly clear”. “What we say publicly, we say to the Chinese also privately. We need to be robust…” Mr. Bonne said. Mr. Bonne was in India for the third India-France strategic dialogue led by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval from the Indian side. Thanks for support Mr. Bonne thanked India for its support recently in “countering disinformation” from Turkey and Pakistan, and said that their relations with Pakistan were “at a historic low”. “We very much appreciate the support we got not only from your authorities but also from Indian civil society when our country was under attack by some leaders in Turkey and Pakistan and in other countries,” he said. Saying that they wanted China to respect “certain rules, be less aggressive,” Mr. Bonne said China should work in the same framework as others and it was important for France to be more defensive, aggressive but also be more dynamic and nimble, and join forces.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/china-must-respect-rules-says-france/article33524920.ece
08 January 2021||CHANDIGARH,||Congress leader points out ‘gap’ in Haryana Panchayati Raj Act||Terming the provisions in the Haryana Panchayati Raj (Second Amendment) Act, 2020 as arbitrary and unconstitutional, senior Congress leader and former Haryana Minister Karan Singh Dalal has asked Governor Satyadev Narayan Arya to get the Act annulled. In a letter to the Governor, Mr. Dalal pointed out that sub-Section 3 of Section 9 of the Act, which was notified by the State government on December 7, is “arbitrary, irrational, discriminatory and unconstitutional”. ‘Gender-biased attitude’ The amendment, he pointed out, would be capping the participation of women at 50% in the local bodies. “In such case, their political representation in the panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) cannot exceed more than 50% at any point of time, which is a clear case of gender-biased attitude against women,” he wrote. The Act provides for 50% reservation for women in PRIs. “It is very unfortunate that the right to contest for women has been restricted to 50% by the government by amending the Act. The amendment means that their right to contest in all the seats which are not reserved has been snatched away from them. With the passage of time, many States have increased the reservation to 50% as a result of which the representation of women had even reached about 55% in Uttarakhand as many women were elected from non-reserved seats too,” he wrote. Mr. Dalal said the amendments violate Article 243D of the Constitution. “The rationale behind the constitutional provision is to empower women and make the local governance institutions more inclusive and participatory. It facilitates more women at the grassroots democracy to participate in public life, but the present Haryana government has diminished the rationale behind the Constitutional provision,” he wrote. Mr. Dalal said, “The amendment in question is not reserving 50% seats for women — rather it is allocation of seats which only they can contest and by the said amendment their right to contest in more seats has been curtailed as the other 50% is stated to be reserved for other than women which is totally biased, irrational, unconstitutional.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/congress-leader-points-out-gap-in-haryana-panchayati-raj-act/article33525090.ece
08 January 2021||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,||ISRO engineer’s labour of love turns old car into backhoe||Old car means quick disposal for most people. Not for Ben Jacob. Rather than consign his old hatchback to the scrap heap, the young scientist with Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) here chose to convert it into a backhoe/excavator. Ben, 34, managed it all by himself over several months of COVID 19-plagued 2020. Now, the transformed Daewoo Matiz, with the metal arm with a digging bucket at the end extending like a small crane, sits in his yard ready for work. “I had to seek the help of a local workshop for punching 44-mm holes for the hinges. That aside, I constructed it all by myself,” says the Scientist/Engineer-SF at LPSC who is a resident of Choozhattukotta in the district. The car-turned-backhoe weighs 1.1 tonnes. The backhoe has a vertical and horizontal reach of 14 ft and can exert a digging force of six tonnes. The maximum lifting capacity is 500 kg. Technically, it would fall in the mini excavator category. Commercial excavators in this category cost upwards of Rs. 20 lakh, says Ben. His home-made machine cost just Rs. 70,000 to put together. “The conversion took two months,” recalls Ben who graduated in mechanical engineering from the College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram (CET). He had purchased the 1998-make car second-hand for his wife Jeeja a few years ago. Though the vehicle is more than two decades old now, Ben simply didn’t have the heart to see it scrapped. “I wanted to convert it into something useful,” he says. It helped that Ben had a reasonably equipped workshop at home. He started work on the design aspects of the backhoe in May. Still, he had to order many of the components from Gujarat. The parts were slow in coming due to the COVID-19 restrictions, but he managed to kick off work by July-August last year. The machine can find everyday practical use in farms or for digging ponds, says Ben. But more than that, he insists, his project is an example of how old vehicles can be transformed into something useful at a low cost.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/isro-engineers-labour-of-love-turns-old-car-into-backhoe/article33525330.ece

Since he had not named a nominee, bank officials expressed their inability to release the money. The infuriated villagers kept the body inside the bank for three hours. Later, when the local police intervened, the bank officials gave Rs. 10,000 to the villagers under their corporate social responsibility fund for the cremation. The man had Rs. 1,17,298 in his account. The incident took place on Tuesday. Sexagenarian Mahesh Yadav, a daily wager and a bachelor with no living relatives, died at Singriyawan village in the Shahjahanpur police station limits in rural Patna. Withdrawals barred The villagers searched his house for money for the cremation, but found only the passbook of the local Canara Bank branch. “The deceased Mahesh Yadav had not done his KYC formalities for the last two years despite our regular reminders and consequently withdrawals from his account were barred as per banking rules and regulations,” said bank manager Sanjeev Kumar.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/villagers-take-body-to-bank-for-funeral-expenses/article33524881.ece

08 January 2021||Thiruvananthapuram,||Kerala govt. drops move to take over DM WIMS||The State government has dropped the proposal to take over the private medical college hospital DM Wayanad Institute of Medical Sciences (DM WIMS). A high-level meeting convened by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan here on Thursday decided to find government-owned land in Wayanad to set up a new government medical college. ‘Impractical’  The government had earlier engaged a committee headed by the Chief Secretary to examine a proposal to take over the DM WIMS and to convert it into a government medical college. However, the suggestions put forth by the DM Educational Research Foundation, which own the DM WIMS, were impractical and unacceptable. It was following this that the government had dropped the idea to take over the institution and instead decided to go ahead on its own to set up a medical college for Wayanad. Search for land The Health Department has been entrusted with the task of finding suitable land in Wayanad to establish the medical college. The meeting was attended by Health Minister K.K. Shylaja, Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekaharan, Chief Secretary Vishwas Mehta, Law Secretary P.K.

08 January 2021||HYDERABAD,||IIIT-H starts project to crowdsource hours of speech in Telugu||Personal digital assistants can soon ‘converse’ with you in Telugu, and with a greater level of accuracy. For, the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Hyderabad has embarked on an ambitious project of crowdsourcing at least 2,000 hours of speech in this language that could be used in such devices. According to Prakash Yalla from IIIT’s Technology Transfer Office, the move comes after talks between various organisations and the Centre. Around Rs. 1 crore has been earmarked for the project. The initiative seeks to give a large number of speakers of regional languages, such as Telugu, access to gadgets that use Artificial Intelligence enabled speech recognition such as Siri or Alexa. The intention is to crowdsource speech from different regions of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in order to include the diversity of language, spread across the region. For instance, there are differences in the Telugu spoken in Telangana, Rayalaseema and Andhra regions. Also, the way in which a youth speaks is different from the speech of senior citizens. The challenge is the quality of the dataset. For this, the IIIT team is working on devising certain data collection protocols. “Good quality data is collected when we are speaking naturally, with emotions and in an environment which is natural to us, in conversational language. This would be different when we, say, talk on the stage or studio which is a controlled environment,” Mr Yalla says. To capture data, the IIIT team comprising Mr. Yalla and Prof. Anil Vuppala from the Speech Processing Centre decided to go for a voice telephony platform, and teamed up with Ozonetel. A link is given to the volunteer with a topic in Telugu (Games or television, which is better?). The user has to enter his or her mobile phone number, after which a screen seeks information of the age group of the volunteer: Junior (0-18), Young (18-30), Adult (31-59) and senior (60 above). It also seeks information on the volunteer’s native accent, and gender. After this the volunteer can speak into the microphone on the device and the speech will be recorded. “The platform captures the data in a 16khz, 16 bit format, so that the entire voice spectrum is captured. To ensure data protection, the speech goes into different channels after which it is broken using an algorithm. These are anonymised and mixed into a master dataset. This fragment is then given to transcribers,” Mr. Yalla says. The IIIT team is planning to have the 2,000 hour dataset ready in about a year, without compromising on quality. If required, the quantum of data could be increased to 5,000 hours. “A lot of transcribers and speech contributors have come forward, including those from colleges. This will cover the youth spectrum. We are launching campaigns to see that systems are robust and adults are also covered, in rural areas as well,” Mr. Yalla says.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/iiit-h-starts-project-to-crowdsource-hours-of-speech-in-telugu/article33525236.ece

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala called the incident “reprehensible”. He said, “We in the Indian National Congress believe that rulers are borne by the vote of the people and not by force. Use of force to subvert democracy is unacceptable andcondemnable”.

He refused to accept the verdict and engineered this violence. It is ironical that our Prime Minister talked about a smooth transition of power when he attended Howdy Modi programme and campaigned for Mr Trump,” he said, adding that “subversion of democracy has become the character of right-wing leaders”.

We want the government to listen to us and accept our demands. This agitation will continue unless the laws are repealed,” said Angrez Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Firozpur district, travelling on a tractor heading from Kundli towards Tikri.

08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||GDP likely to contract by 7.7% this fiscal: govt.||India’s real GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is estimated to contract by 7.7% in 2020-21, compared to a growth rate of 4.2% in 2019-20, with GVA (Gross Valued added) shrinking by 7.2%, advance estimates released by the National Statistical Office on Thursday show. India’s economy had expanded 4.2% in 2019-20, but entered a recessionary phase with two successive quarters of sharp contraction triggered by the COVID-19 lockdowns. Following a 23.9% collapse in the economy in the April-June period, the GDP shrank by 7.5% in the second quarter — leading to a real GDP contraction of 15.7% in the first half of 2020-21. The economy will surface in the second half to record near-zero growth, or a mere 0.1% contraction, the estimates suggest. Based on an uptick in several indicators in the past few months, several agencies have upgraded their estimates, with the RBI recently projecting a 7.5% contraction in the year compared to its earlier estimate of a 9.5% decline. Just two sectors are estimated to record positive growth in GVA, with agriculture continuing its strong run through the first half of the year into the second half (3.4%) and electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services posting (2.7%). The sharpest decline in the pandemic-dented year is expected in trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting (-21.4%), followed by construction (-12.6%), mining and quarrying (-12.4%) and manufacturing (-9.4%). Real GVA at basic prices is estimated at Rs. 123.39 lakh crore in 2020-21, against Rs. 133.01 lakh crore in 2019-20, while the real GDP in 2020-21 is likely to attain a level of Rs. 134.40 lakh crore, as against the provisional GDP estimate for 2019-20 of Rs. 145.66 lakh crore, the NSO said in a statement. The Finance Ministry said the advanced estimates “reflect continued resurgence in economic activity” in the third and fourth quarters. “The continuous quarter-on-quarter growth endorses the strength of economic fundamentals of the country to sustain a post lockdown V-shaped recovery. On the demand side, real GDP in 2020-21 has been supported by an estimated increase in Government Consumption Expenditure by 5.8%,” it said, reacting to the NSO report.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gdp-likely-to-contract-by-77-this-fiscal-govt/article33524868.ece

The officials sought for an offline system for collecting and storing data. Ministers from States, including Bihar and Odisha, demanded that MPs, MLAs and panchayat members should be included in the priority group for the vaccine, while others wanted the Centre’s assistance in getting the technical glitches cleared and arranging enough transportation facility in time for vaccine supply and a template for registering the elderly and those with comorbidities. The States also sought an equal distribution of the vaccine and the maintenance of a smooth supply pipeline to ensure adequate supply. Dr. Vardhan said the objective of the mock drill was to simulate the actual vaccine administration event. “The dry run will also familiarise the State, district, block and hospital level officers on all aspects of the vaccine roll-out. “This activity will help administrators in strengthening the linkages between planning, implementation and reporting mechanisms, identify any residual challenges prior to the actual implementation and to provide confidence to the programme managers at all levels to carry out a smooth implementation of the vaccination drive,” he said.

Mr. Adhikari was one of the leaders who was allegedly seen accepting cash on camera in the videos that were made public by Narada news in 2016. Three of the dozen of Trinamool leaders who had featured in the sting videos, including Mukul Roy and Sovan Chatterjee, have joined the BJP. “Who was seen accepting cash on camera ... Now they are trying to paint themselves as symbol of honesty,” Mr. Banerjee asked party supporters at a public rally at Gangarampur in north Bengal. The Trinamool youth leader also challenged those accusing him of “extortion” to prove their charges against him. Mr. Banerjee said that if the charges were proved against him he could be publicly hanged. Only a day ago the Diamond Harbour MP had sent a legal notice to Union Minister and BJP leader Babul Supriyo for levelling allegations of corruption against him.

The STF informed the court that the case crime number 151/2020 PS Chandpa had been amalgamated in crime no. 199/2020 PS Maant, Mathura. The CJM accepted the application and ordered the accused to be released in the Chandpa case. The accused were arrested by the Mathura police when they were going to meet the family of the victim of the alleged gang rape and murder in Boolgarhi village of Hathras which falls under the Chandpa police station. “We had previously in the bail plea said the investigation of these two cases is being done on the same set of facts against accused persons which is not legally permissible. In a way, the STF has back-pedalled,” Mr. Chaturvedi said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/only-one-case-against-pfi-members/article33524871.ece

08 January 2021||New Delhi,||Follow our fuel tax, Sonia tells Modi||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday demanded that the Modi government charge the same rate of excise duty on petroleum products as the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance did and give relief to common people. Excessive taxation by the Modi government has led to the highest ever price of petroleum products in the past 73 years and the government has so far collected Rs. 19 lakh crore in excise duty in the past six years, she alleged in a statement. Ahead of a fresh round of talks between the Centre and the farmers’ union on Friday, Ms. Gandhi urged the government to withdraw the three farm laws.  “In the midst of a collapsing economy because of corona, the Modi government is trying to convert the disaster into an opportunity to fill its treasury. Today the price of crude oil is $50.96 per barrel or just Rs. 23.43 per litre. Despite this, diesel is being sold for Rs. 74.38 and petrol at Rs. 84.20 per litre. This is the highest in the last 73 years,” she added. The Congress president said the government was resorting to profiteering through excise duty instead of providing relief to common people.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/follow-our-fuel-tax-sonia-tells-modi/article33524884.ece

The narco-terror case is related to the seizure of about 61 kg of heroin, along with arms and ammunition, on September 20 last year along the International Border at Arnia in Jammu. NIA said the accused hatched a conspiracy to carry out anti-national and unlawful activities and to help terrorist organisations such as Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) by collecting funds and channelising the proceeds of drugs for furthering their activities. The case was initially registered by the local police in September in connection with unprovoked firing at a police patrolling party and was re-registered by the NIA on November 26. “The searches were conducted at the residences of six accused persons, namely Jasraj Singh, Sham Lal, Bishan Dass, Ajeet Kumar, Gurbaksh Singh and Gurpartap Singh,” the NIA said in a statement.

08 January 2021||AHMEDABAD,||ISRO scientist claims he was poisoned||A top scientist from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) claimed that he was poisoned in 2017 in order “to eliminate” him. Sixty-year-old Tapan Misra is currently senior adviser to ISRO and was earlier Director of the Ahmedabad-based Space Application Centre (SAC). He is set to superannuate at the end of January. In 2018, he was overlooked when Dr. K. Sivan was appointed as the Chairman of ISRO. Dr. Misra was the senior-most scientist to take over from Dr. A.S. Kiran Kumar but the government preferred to appoint Dr. Sivan while Dr. Misra was given an advisory role in the country’s premier scientific body. “This happened in 2017 at the Bengaluru campus [of ISRO],” Dr. Misra told The Hindu at his Ahmedabad residence two days after he made the sensational revelation on Facebook. “The poison was mixed with food,” he said, adding that he had to undergo treatment at various hospitals. “I believe that some internal people were involved in the exercise.” In his FB post, Dr. Misra further claimed that in July 2017, Home Affairs security personnel alerted him of arsenic poisoning, and helped doctors focus on finding the exact remedy.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/isro-scientist-claims-he-was-poisoned/article33524897.ece
08 January 2021||Lucknow,||Charges against Muslim man in U.P. dropped||More than a month after booking a Haridwar-based Muslim labourer under the new ordinance for allegedly trying to coerce a married Hindu woman from Muzaffarnagar to convert, the Uttar Pradesh government has told the Allahabad High Court that it found no evidence of unlawful conversion against him and has dropped the charges. However, the State police have filed a chargesheet accusing him of criminal intimidation. The woman, 34, whose husband had lodged the case against the Muslim man, came to the support of the accused and denied that he had ever tried to convert her. She alleged that her husband had falsely implicated the labourer because he had supported her when she faced domestic violence and “mental torture” at home. An FIR was lodged against Nadeem and an associate, Salman, at Mansoorpur under the U.P. Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 on November 29, 2020 on the complaint of Akshay Kumar Tyagi, a contractor in a pharmaceutical company in Haridwar, who accused Nadeem of having an illicit relationship with his wife and of trying to convert her to Islam for marriage. On December 18, the Allahabad High Court stayed Nadeem’s arrest till January 7. On Thursday, a Division Bench of Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Saurabh Shyam Shamshery extended the relief to him till January 15. This is the only case under the new ordinance so far in which the HC had stayed the accused’s arrest.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/up-drops-charges-against-muslim-man/article33524870.ece

Vandavasi tank, Kadaisthiriyendal, Ayakulam, Paraiyankulam and Pudukulam tanks near Ezhuvani panchayat breached in the early hours of Thursday, said K. Balakrishnan, 63, of Vandavasi, a farmer. Almost all 200 small and big waterbodies in Narikudi block were brimming with water following a good rainfall in the last few months. “Farmers did not use the water from the tanks in the last few weeks as it has been raining frequently so that tanks had water to their full capacity,” said an officer. Sharp showers that started at around 10.30 p.m. on Wednesday continued till the early morning of Thursday and a huge flow of water breached bunds, Mr. Balakrishnan, former president of Ezhuvani panchayat, said. Standing crops on a vast extent of paddy fields have been destroyed. Water gushing in huge quantity washed off crops which were ready for harvest. Some crops that were over three months old were about to be harvested. “Since it was raining in the last few days, we could not harvest the crop. Now, the flood water has destroyed them,” he added. With water from upstream continuing to flow into tanks, officials could not move earth movers closer to the breached tanks to plug the leak. “We have kept sand bags ready and once the flow of water slows down, we will try to plug the breaches,” said Tiruchuli Block Development Officer, N. Sathyamoorthi. Joint Director of Agriculture S. Uthandaraman said that officials would inspect villages and survey the nature and extent of damage to the crops on Friday.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/rain-causes-breach-in-tanks/article33525164.ece
08 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Hospitals resume regular services as COVID-19 daily tally dips||Routine healthcare services are back to normal in government hospitals across the city. After leading the COVID-19 patient management since March, these hospitals have been witnessing a gradual rise in the turnout of patients for regular services in the past three months. But, this has not affected the COVID-19 services. Outpatient services and elective surgeries were stopped in a number of government hospitals when the pandemic was its peak. However, with the daily tally of fresh viral infections declining in the past few weeks, non-COVID services, especially elective procedures, were resumed, and are running full-fledged at present. Out-patient turnout up At the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), 7,000 people turn up at the outpatient departments (OPDs) every day on an average. Prior to COVID-19, this figure was 10,000 to 15,000. The hospital has around 1,500 to 1,800 in-patients. “Now, all in-patient wards such as medicine, surgery, haematology, diabetology, rheumatology, orthopaedics, neurology and surgical gastroenterology are full. During the peak of the pandemic, we had 200 to 350 in-patients on an average. We are now performing nearly 50 elective surgeries a day and are preparing to resume organ transplant procedures,” E. Theranirajan, dean of RGGGH, said. In fact, hospitals have reduced the number of healthcare professionals posted on COVID-19 duty. “At present, all our COVID-19 services are concentrated in a single block — Tower 3. The maximum number of COVID-19 in-patients that we saw was 1,083. Today, we have 54 positive patients and 123 persons with suspected symptoms of COVID-19. We have reduced the number of doctors on COVID-19 duty from 243 to 90 for a cycle of six days,” he said. Reduction in COVID-19 duty did not mean a breather for the personnel, a government doctor said. “The number of patients coming for non-COVID services has increased. The work has only shifted to the routine,” she said. All emergency medical and surgical services continued throughout the COVID-19 period at the Government Stanley Medical College (SMC) Hospital. “With regard to non-COVID-19 OP services, the numbers gradually increased from September at 1,250 a day to 4,500 a day at present. The non-COVID in-patient strength increased from 750 a day to 1,200 a day,” P. Balaji, dean of SMC, said. Elective surgeries were stopped in April, May and early June in a few speciality departments, they were being done in general surgery, orthopaedics and ENT sections based on the need although on a much lower scale. At the SMC, COVID-19 OPD and wards continued to function from a single block with separate entrance and exit. Along with COVID-19, the Government Kilpauk Medical College (KMC) Hospital has been running regular services simultaneously as it caters to deliveries, treatment of burns and paediatric cases. As per data available with the hospital, 2,100 deliveries were recorded in October, November and December while 4,959 major and minor surgeries were performed on COVID-19 and other patients during the same period. “Prior to COVID-19, our OPD census was 3,500 to 4,500. Now, we are getting 2,500 to 3,000 outpatients. In fact, our bed occupancy has been 85% throughout, ” P. Vasanthamani, dean of KMC, said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hospitals-resume-regular-services-as-covid-19-daily-tally-dips/article33525022.ece
08 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Stalin lays down conditions for holding debate with CM||DMK president M.K. Stalin on Thursday said he was ready to debate with Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on corruption charges if the latter adopted a resolution in the Cabinet urging the Governor to grant sanction for inquiry into the allegations against him and his Cabinet colleagues. He also wanted the Chief Minister to file a petition to vacate a stay against an inquiry into the alleged illegal tenders offered to his son’s in-laws. Reacting to the Chief Minister’s poser that he was ready for a debate at any place, Mr. Stalin said Mr. Palaniswami was the Chief Minister of a party whose leader (Jayalalithaa) was removed from the Chief Minister’s post on corruption charges. “Even Mr. Palaniswami was subjected to a CBI inquiry. But without any shame he is claiming that he is not involved in any corruption,” Mr. Stalin alleged in a statement. Ad campaigns Accusing the Chief Minister of using the coffers to release advertisements to falsely promote his government, Mr. Stalin said Mr. Palaniswami, who was campaigning with police protection and State machinery, was left with only four months [in office]. “He does not know what he is saying and is under the impression that people will believe what he utters,” Mr. Stalin said. According to him, the Chief Minister did not know the difference between his son’s in-laws and a public servant and granted tenders to the tune of Rs. 6,000 crore. “In the beginning, he argued in the court that there was nothing wrong in his relatives getting the tender. Now he takes a U-turn and says that he is not aware of the participation of his relatives in the tender process,” Mr Stalin alleged. Responding to Mr. Palaniswami’s allegation that DMK men were involved in land grabbing, the Opposition leader wanted to know how many DMK men were awarded punishment since the AIADMK was in power for the last 10 years. “The special courts constituted to deal with land grabbing cases were dissolved on the ground that the cases were foisted on the DMK men,” he said. Mr. Stalin said he would meet the Chief Minister in a debate if he wrote a letter to the Governor saying that he was ready to face the case related to amassing wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income. “Then fix a date and place. Bring all your Cabinet colleagues and if possible your Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam. I will expose the corruption charges against you and others,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/stalin-lays-down-conditions-for-holding-debate-with-cm/article33525014.ece

The children, aged 3 and 7, suffered from Thalassemia Major and required frequent blood transfusion. The children, who hailed from poor families, had been referred to paediatric haematologist M. Deenadayalan at Dr. Rela Institute and Medical Centre. One child was from Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh and another is from Tamil Nadu. For both children, their older sibling was the donor. The three-year-old received bone marrow from his 7-year-old brother. For the six-year-old girl her 10-year-old sister was the donor. The surgeries were done with financial support from online funding platforms such as Ketto and Milaap, besides the hospital’s trustees, said S. Balasubramanian, Medical Director of KKCTH. Dr. Deenadayalan said such families spend Rs. 1.7 lakh annually on medical treatment. Bone marrow transplant would give such children better quality of life. Mohamed Rela, chairman of Dr. Rela Institute, said the association between the Institute and the hospital helped as in institutions such as the KKCTH, the treatment cost was low. “That is an advantage. The success of the transplant depends on the infrastructure at the hospital and how well the children are protected against the infection,” he said. KKCTH chief executive officer S. Chandramohan said each surgery cost over Rs. 18 lakh. For the children in Tamil Nadu, post-surgery medical support was offered free of cost for a year, he also added. One of the children’s parents summed up his experience saying, “They explained everything to us and gave us confidence. He has given my child back as a complete person.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/two-children-undergo-bone-marrow-transplant-at-kkcth/article33525024.ece

They say lack of clear guidelines has left the colleges confused. P. Wilson, principal of Madras Christian College, said that of the total of 2,000 students, only 400 had returned. “Every day, we are conducting RT-PCR tests. If a student is sick, we isolate the entire class and ask them to go for online classes...,” he said. A recent circular has left students of Stella Maris College and their parents confused. It said students were expected to come to college. Attendance would be given only to those who attended classes in person. All assessment tests would be conducted only in college. But “those who are COVID-19-positive/ quarantined in the containment zone must produce a request letter, along with the evidence/certificate for the same, to the class teacher specifying the period to claim attendance,” the circular stated. On a social media platform, the students were requested to attend classes offline. “If a student is facing any difficulty in attending class offline, you are requested to send a mail to the principal...,” the message read. The students were also advised to check their daily attendance on the portal. Principal Rosy Joseph said no student was forced to come to college. “We have asked the final-year students to come to campus. The hostels are also open. The government asked us to open hostels, too. Every day we must provide attendance details by 11 a.m. to the government. The government has not clarified whether students who lack attendance will be allowed to take the exams. We have provided study material to students who are unable to come to college. We do not have online classes for final-year students. Online classes are for only first- and second-year students,” she said. Sources in the Department of Higher Education said the instructions, issued before allowing colleges to reopen, had specified that students could not be forced to come to college and the online stream should continue to help those who were unable to return to college.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thin-attendance-in-colleges-as-most-students-opt-for-online-classes/article33525005.ece

Navin Gnanasekaran, associate director of medical services, MGM Healthcare, said: “During the peak of COVID-19, we had very few outpatient departments and elective surgeries. From physical OPDs, we moved to teleconsultations. Emergency services were always active. However, over the last four to five months, we have resumed all routine services. We are seeing around 300 to 500 outpatients a day now. “Non-COVID admissions have increased significantly,” he said. During the peak of pandemic, 80% admissions were patients with the viral infection. “Now, about 25% are COVID-19 admissions, and remaining are all non-COVID admissions. Teleconsultations have reduced while our walk-in OPD visits have gone up, as many patients prefer in-person consultation with doctors. Elective surgeries are regularly being performed. Earlier, among the daycare procedures, only dialysis was active besides emergency procedures. Now, we have dialysis, chemotherapy, endoscopy, radiological and cardiological interventional procedures being done regularly,” Dr. Gnanasekaran said. One of the indicators of normalcy was the rise in the number of people coming in for master health check-up. Among the transformations ushered in by COVID-19 were innovations such as remote monitoring of patients, healthcare digitisation and stringent clinical protocols, Dr. Gnanasekaran said. With normalcy returning, doctors are facing another challenge. “Many are presenting late. We see many patients with cancers of the head and neck — that is involving the larynx, throat and cheek — in an advanced stage. They knew they had a problem but did not seek help due to COVID-19,” said Mohan Kameswaran, managing director of Madras ENT Research Foundation.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/check-ups-resume/article33525023.ece

Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy refused permission to a lawyer to move a lunch motion, after observing that there was no tearing hurry involved in the case, and that it could be heard in the usual course.

Ramadoss on Thursday urged the State government to withdraw its decision allowing cinema halls to function at full occupancy and accept the Centre’s directive allowing just 50% occupancy. In a statement, he said the State government’s decision to allow 100% occupancy was not correct, especially at a time when people were tackling the new strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerging from the U.K. He called for proactive measures in the State to control the spread of the new virus strain. Mr. Ramadoss said Tamil Nadu did not have a facility to confirm whether passengers coming from the U.K. had been infected with the new strain. He urged the State government to discuss the issue with the Centre and, immediately, start a facility in Chennai to test and detect the new strain. Alagiri slams move Also slamming the move, TNCC president K.S. Alagiri urged the State government to withdraw its order, which, he said, posed a danger to movie-goers.

08 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Sand lorry owners want Chennai-Tirupati road repaired||Members of the Tamil Nadu State Sand Lorry Owners’ Federation staged a protest at Pattaraiperumbudur in Tiruvallur district on Thursday demanding the damaged portions of Chennai-Tirupati Road to be repaired and speedy construction of bridges at Pattaraiperumbudur and Narayanapuram. They complained that the stretch falling under Pattaraiperumbudur toll plaza remained battered and posed a risk to motorists. People were put to hardship as the construction of two bridges at Pattaraiperumbudur and Narayanapuram was yet to be completed. Federation president S. Yuvaraj said the construction work at Pattaraiperumbudur had been put on hold for several months. This forced people travelling between Tiruttani and Tiruvallur to use the dilapidated old bridge. “We have made a representation to the Tiruvallur district administration. The officials have assured us that the pothole-ridden portion of the road would be repaired in a month and the construction of the bridges would be resumed in March,” he said. The Federation had written to the Chairman of the National Highways Authority of India complaining about the poor maintenance of several stretches of roads such as Chennai-Bengaluru National Highway between Walajapet and Maduravoyal; Chennai-Tada Road; Ulundurpet-Salem; and Krishnagiri-Salem sections. Members alleged that incomplete roadwork caused accidents. About 500 accidents are reported every year at the Nazarathpet junction and on the Walajapet-Maduravoyal stretch of Chennai-Bengaluru NH. They complained that high toll was being collected although the road had not been widened to a six-lane. NHAI officials said a new concessionaire would be appointed for the 124 km Chennai-Tirupati Highway soon. “The repairs, if any, will be taken up by the new company,” the officials said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/sand-lorry-owners-want-chennai-tirupati-road-repaired/article33525477.ece

Some are already in the midst of the exams, while others will take them in the coming days. The university has issued oral instructions to the colleges to conduct the exams. As a result, all those who were admitted to postgraduate programmes and those who had supposedly graduated are taking the exams online. The exams are, however, limited to those who had paid their arrears fees in March, the colleges noted. Manonmaniam Sundaranar University and the University of Madras had promoted even those who had arrears and had paid the tuition fees. The decision was taken in view of the lockdown, which resulted in the suspension of classes. It was the start of the end-semester exams when the lockdown was announced.

Alagiri on Thursday urged the State government to withdraw its order as it poses immense danger to movie-goers. Mr. Alagiri asked whether the State government was right in allowing full occupancy, especially when a large number of cases had been reported from IIT-Madras. The order also went against the guidelines of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, he said. “If the team of medical experts recommended this [100% occupancy], then the State government should make it public. What is the backdrop to allowing full occupancy at this time?” he asked. When the Chief Minister himself was asking people to wear masks and adhere to physical distancing norms, how could he allow theatres to run at full capacity? “Is there not a contradiction here?” Mr. Alagiri asked.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/alagiri-slams-govt-for-permitting-100-occupancy-in-theatres/article33525156.ece

08 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Kattabomman’s execution record to be digitised||Many may consider melodramatic the performance of Sivaji Ganesan in the 1959 classic Tamil feature film, Veerapandia Kattabomman , one of the early fighters against British rule and whose birth anniversary was observed on Sunday (January 3). But the thespian’s acting in the scene, depicting the hanging of the warrior, is broadly in tune with an account of Major John Bannerman of the East India Company. Bannerman, who led a force to take on Kattabomman (1760-1799), the poligar (local chieftain) of Panchalankurichi (now in Thoothukudi district), paid encomium to the latter in his eight-page report, written in cursive style and sent to Governor Edward Clive (1754-1839), who held the post during 1798-1803 and who was the son of Robert Clive, the first British administrator of Bengal. The report, which spelt the name of the warrior as “Cataboma Naigue,” was prepared on October 17, 1799, the day after the execution of Kattabomman. It was received at the Fort St. George, the seat of power of the authorities, on November 8, 1799. Being preserved at the office of Archives and Historical Research here, this report is among the documents to be digitised soon. At present, a software is being developed for indexing and retrieving scanned documents. The retrieval software will be installed initially on local intranet and later on the Internet, according to a plan of the department. Among the benefits of the digitisation project is to do away with physical handling of the records and facilitating easy search and retrieval of the documents. Initially, survey records, most sought-after government orders and records of the East India company and British administration, prior to the 1857 uprising, will be covered, an official said. Describing the manner and behaviour of Kattabomman at the time of his trial as “undaunted and supercilious,” Bannerman had this to say in his document: “It was reported to me that in his way to the place of execution [in Kayathar of Thoothukudi], he expressed some anxiety for his dumb brother [Oomaithurai] alone...” During the trial, Kattabomman “frequently eyed” the Ettayapuram (also in Thoothukudi) poligar, who “had been so active in attempting to secure his person” and the poligar of Sivagiri (now in Tenkasi district) with “an appearance of indignant scorn”. When he went out to be executed, he “walked with a firm and daring air, and cast looks of sullen contempt on the poligars to the right and left as he passed”.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/kattabommans-execution-record-to-be-digitised/article33525159.ece

08 January 2021||CHENNAI,TAMIL NADU||Widespread rain to continue over T.N. for next five days||It’s only a week into January. But Chennai has already recorded the decade’s highest rainfall for the month. Many other weather stations across the State, too, received a heavy downpour on Wednesday night. With the Northeast monsoon activity intensifying over the State, the Meteorological Department has forecast widespread rainfall to continue in most parts till January 13. On Friday, one or two places in 14 districts, including Coimbatore, Tiruvarur and Madurai, may receive heavy rain. The intensity is likely to go up to very high rainfall in some places on January 10. During the past 24 hours ending at 8.30 a.m. on Thursday, Memathur in Cuddalore district and Natham in Dindigul district recorded the day’s highest rainfall of 21 cm each. Several other places, too, recorded heavy to very heavy rain.  Cyclonic circulation Officials of the Meteorological Department said a cyclonic circulation over the south Tamil Nadu coast and the neighbourhood also influenced the rain spell. However, easterly waves were the major reason for the incessant downpour. Many districts had already accumulated massive amounts of rainfall within the first seven days of the month. The rainfall surplus in percentage runs into thousands in many districts. For instance, Chengalpattu district has recorded 16 cm, which is 3,684% more than the monthly average of 4.2 mm for January. The weather station in Nungambakkam has already recorded 16.1 cm of rain against its monthly average of nearly 3 cm. Similarly, Meenambakkam has registered nearly 23 cm of rain so far this month. This is the decade’s highest rainfall during January in the city. Last year, Chennai recorded 7 cm of rainfall in January, officials noted. La Nina effect S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said the convergence of moisture-laden easterly winds over land largely led to such heavy rainfall. “We have had instances in the past when the NE monsoon had extended till January 18. But what made this January wet spell special is the intensity of rainfall and more coverage,” he said. La Nina conditions, a global weather phenomenon that refers to cooler sea surface temperatures over the Pacific Ocean, had its effect over the NE monsoon spillover to January in the region. It had a tendency to prolong the monsoon after the official end of the season in December. “Weather models are now indicating that the rain spell may extend till the third week of January. However, its intensity may vary,” he said. The Meteorological Department forecast moderate rainfall in some areas of Chennai till Saturday. The maximum temperature will be around 29 degree Celsius.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/widespread-rain-to-continue-over-tn-for-next-five-days/article33525026.ece

According to Art 20 of ICCPR it is mandatory to enact a law to curb hate crimes,” Mr. Ravikumar pointed out. He also cited a Supreme Court directive to the Law Commission of India to draft a bill to curb hate speech. The draft was submitted to the Union Government in March 2017 and it had suggested insertion of new section 153 C (Prohibiting incitement to hatred) and section 505A (causing fear, alarm, or provocation of violence in certain cases) in the Indian Penal Code to curb hate speech, Mr. Ravikumar noted. He pointed out the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill 2017 has been pending with the government for the past three years and urged the Law Minister to take immediate steps to introduce the bill in both the houses of the Parliament in the upcoming session.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/enact-law-to-curb-hate-speech-vck-mp-writes-to-union-law-minister/article33525481.ece

08 January 2021||COIMBATORE,TAMIL NADU||Textile units urged to avoid panic buying||The National Committee on Textiles and Clothing has urged textile units to avoid panic buying across the value chain, in an effort to bring stability of prices. T. Rajkumar, co-ordinator of the committee, recently wrote to the units that it was decided at a virtual meeting of the national and regional textile associations held last month to adopt a win-win strategy. However, there is a panic situation again at the fabric stage. Mr. Rajkumar pointed out that raw materials and finished goods inventory at each segment of the industry has drained out due to prolonged lockdown. Therefore, every manufacturer is trying to build an inventory, apart from meeting the regular production requirement. Manufacturers across the value chain have to manage with minimal inventory till supplies improve. The current market demand revival is "V" shaped and if the units fail to manage the inventory prudently, manufacturers across the textile value chain may face erosion of working capital if the prices fall (as it happened in 2010-2011) causing irreparable damage to the industry, he said. The country had over 105 lakh bales of cotton stock during the last season and is likely to have the same stock in the current season. Hence, spinning mills should avoid panic buying by offering higher prices, Mr. Rajkumar said. And, yarn producers should fulfil their commitments before taking fresh orders, he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/textile-units-urged-to-avoid-panic-buying/article33525048.ece

08 January 2021||ERODE,TAMIL NADU||Chief Minister criticises Stalin for setting terms to take part in debate||Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday criticised DMK president M.K. Stalin for demanding the withdrawal of a case in the Supreme Court as a condition to participate in an open debate on the corruption charges levelled by the latter against him and a few Ministers. Addressing an election campaign titled ‘ Vetrinadai Podum Tamizhagam ’ (Tamil Nadu marches on successfully) in Arachalur, he said the Opposition leader had levelled corruption charges against him and the AIADMK government, and, hence, he had invited him for an open debate. “But now, he wants the case in the top court to be withdrawn for participating in the debate,” he said, adding, “Don’t give excuses. Say that you cannot come for the debate.” Mr. Palaniswami contended that the Supreme Court had stayed the Madras High Court order, allowing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct inquiries into allegations against him, as the charges were found to be untrue. “Let the debate take place and then the people can decide.” He said during the erstwhile DMK rule, a tender was floated for Rs. 200 crore to construct the new Secretariat building. But the contractor was paid Rs. 430 crore. “It is corruption, and if we point this out, Stalin gets angry,” he said. He criticised Mr. Stalin for questioning the Amma Mini Clinics’ scheme, when the whole nation was appreciating it. “When the country appreciates a scheme, Mr. Stalin opposes it,” he said, adding that only doctors provide treatment at the clinics. “If he has doubts, he can check with the doctors,” he said. The Chief Minister said the State government was providing post-matric scholarships, of Rs. 1,500 crore, every year, to students, and it had also arranged bank loans worth Rs. 80,000 crore to 1.07 crore women members of self-help groups in the State. He said the government had provided free rice and essentials to those whose livelihoods had been affected by the pandemic. Besides, a Pongal gift hamper, comprising Rs. 2,500 cash, was being given to all ration rice cardholders to enable them to celebrate the festival. “But Mr. Stalin says the government has done nothing for the people. If he does not know, let him know from his partymen,” he added At Chithode, he said starting and upgrading of schools and launching of new colleges had helped the State improve its Gross Enrolment Ratio in higher education, from 32% in 2011 to the present 49%.  When the country appreciates a scheme, Stalin opposes it. If he has doubts, he can check with doctors||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cm-criticises-stalin-for-setting-terms-for-debate/article33525004.ece

Members of various unions, including Labour Progressive Federation, Centre of Indian Trade Unions and Tamil Nadu Government Transport Staff Federation, participated in the sit-in protests that were held across the State. S. Sampath, State joint secretary of Tamil Nadu Government Staff Transport Federation, said the main demand of the protesters was faster disbursal of retirement benefits pending from April 2019 to April 2020. “A government order was passed on December 21, 2020, regarding the settlement of retirement dues such as gratuity and provident fund. But, till date no action has been initiated for the settlement of dues,” he said. The protesters also urged the government to spell out the exact number of transport unions that could have negotiations with it. Mr. Sampath said that around 15 years back, only six transport unions, which were elected through a secret ballot, were functional. “But, as the government started registering transport unions, the number of unions increased. In September 2016, the government had called upon 47 transport unions for the negotiation of wage revision. Although a majority of the unions accepted the terms of the government, all of them were smaller unions. None of the major unions accepted the government's representations. Hence, the government must work towards streamlining the transport unions,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/expedite-settlement-of-retirement-dues/article33525378.ece

The petitioners said it looked like the order was passed without consulting the Health Department, medical experts, District Collectors and other departments that too at a time when a new COVID-19 variant had emerged. They sought a stay on the G.O. in the interest of the public and pointed out that the Centre too had expressed its displeasure over the permission for 100% occupancy in the theatres granted by the State.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/pil-pleas-against-go-permitting-100-occupancy-in-theatres/article33525375.ece

08 January 2021||MADURAI,TAMIL NADU||Tejas Express to be back on track||After cancelling Chennai Egmore-Madurai-Chennai Egmore Tejas Special from January 4 due to lack of patronage, Southern Railway has proposed to re-introduce the premium train from January 10. Welcoming the move, Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan thanked Railway Minister Piyush Goyal for heeding people’s demand. Mr. Venkatesan had objected to the cancellation of the train claiming that unaffordably high fares and the pandemic situation were the major reasons for lower patronage. A railway official here said after re-introduction following relaxation in lockdown norms the train saw poor patronage. “Though the passenger patronage increased from 15% during the initial days to 25% to 30%, the maximum occupation of seats was only 40% during weekends and holidays,” he added. Officials in Madurai division too had asked for running the train expecting higher patronage during Pongal. On continuing the operation of Tejas Special train, the official said it depended on the patronage. Meanwhile, the timing of the express train is said to be a major reason for the poor patronage. “The train leaves Egmore at 6 a.m. With no stoppage at Tambaram, passengers find it difficult to reach the station on time for the train,” said Dakshin Railway Employees’ Union divisional secretary R. Sankaranarayanan. Stoppage at Tamabaram will also help passengers going to Chennai airport. Similarly, meeting the long-pending demand for shifting the stoppage from Kodaikanal Road to Dindigul railway station is also expected to bring more patronage. The train is scheduled to depart Madurai junction at 3 p.m. and reach Chennai Egmore at 9.15 p.m. It stops at Kodai Road (3.28 p.m.) and Tiruchi (5 p.m.). It leaves Egmore at 6 a.m. and reaches Madurai at 12.15 pm. It stops at Tiruchi (9.55 a.m.) and Kodai Road (11.18 a.m.).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/tejas-express-to-be-re-introduced/article33525165.ece

08 January 2021||Thanjavur,TAMIL NADU||Preserving a dollop of tradition in a coconut shell ladle||Come Pongal cooking rice in mud pots placed over a clay ‘chulah’ in the colourfully decorated courtyard of houses are images that flash through everyone’s mind. Though this practice continues even now in rural pockets, another locally made utensil used to cook the ‘pongal’ in the mud pot has vanished. It is nothing but the ladle made of coconut shell and bamboo stick. Surprisingly this utensil, is still in practice at a small hamlet, Venngaoryankudikadu, near Thanjavur. A group of carpenters residing in Vengaroyankudikadu manufacture this traditional ladle using the coconut shells collected from houses in the village and by chopping off the bamboo into small pieces of two to two-and-half feet in length. As this utensil is made primarily to preserve the traditional practice, M. Ganapathy of Vengaroyankudikadu, a carpenter said these laddles are distributed free of cost to houses celebrating the `pongal’ festival. In turn, the families honour the carpenters by presenting a ‘padi’ (roughly 1.50 kilograms) of rice, unbroken coconut, fruits, betel leaf and areca-nut, Ganapathy added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/preserving-a-dollop-of-tradition-in-a-coconut-shell-ladle/article33525135.ece
08 January 2021||THENI,TAMIL NADU||Key suspect in NEET impersonation case surrenders before Theni court||Rasheed, a key suspect, wanted in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) impersonation case since 2019, surrendered before the Judicial Magistrate Court here on Thursday. The police arrested a doctor and his son after it was found that the boy had joined the Theni Government Medical College with forged certificates. When many students were found to be involved in the scam subsequently, the case was transferred to the CB-CID police. In all, 14 persons, including some parents, were arrested and imprisoned in Madurai and Theni. Courts granted bail to the accused. The High Court Bench, which was hearing bail applications of the accused, directed the media to refrain from publishing names of students. Based on confession of suspects, the police were on the lookout for the key suspect, Rasheed, a native of Malappuram in Kerala. He was suspected to be living in J.P. Nagar, Bengaluru. So, special teams were deputed to nab him there but they could not secure him. Under these circumstances, he surrendered before Judicial Magistrate Panneerselvam here who remanded him in judicial custody. He was taken to Madurai Central Prison amid tight security. A senior officer said they would take custody of Rasheed soon and inquire into the case based on the confessions made by students and their parents, because he was instrumental in facilitating impersonation of many students. He managed to send others to write the NEET examinations and got high scores, for which he had collected huge sums of money from the aspirants through brokers in Vellore, Dharmapuri, Chennai and Coimbatore, the official said. The issue came to light when one such impersonator sent a mail to the Theni Government Medical College Dean stating that a student who had been admitted in the college had not written the NEET. Inquiries revealed that it was true following which a police complaint was lodged.

08 January 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Parents remain divided over reopening of schools||The consultation meetings held with parents on the decision to reopen schools for Class 10 and Class 12 students seems to have evoked mixed reactions. Some parents claimed that their wards were unable to learn well through online classes and teachers of government schools noted that some students were forced to take up jobs to make ends meet. The School Education Department had asked the schools to organise meetings with parents of students studying in Class 10 and 12 and submit the feedback by January 8. Schools in Tiruchi have been calling parents in batches to get the feedback. With the board examinations fast approaching, schools have been insisting on conducting practical examinations. At the Syed Murthuza Higher Secondary School in Palakkarai, parents requested the teachers to conduct classes on a shift-basis. “With only four months to go, we are unsure of the future of our children. Many of our wards do not have access to Android phones to attend online classes, and in some households that do, we do not know if the child is able to learn through it,” said Satheeshwaran, a parent. Many families are also unable to afford the cost of internet access on the phone, they said. Mary Grace, headmistress, said that she was unable to trace many students after the long break as they may have been forced to go to work during the lockdown. “We will have to work harder to bring them back to school,” she said. In private schools, the parents were concerned about the health risks involved. At Campion Anglo – Indian Higher Secondary School, the response was 50-50, said Correspondent Rev. Bro. Irudayam. “Those who did not want their wards to attend school expressed concerns over the children getting infected. While the school will be able to ensure the students’ safety on the premises, protection during travel to school may be difficult,” he said. Some parents, like those at St. John's Vestry Anglo-Indian Higher Secondary School said that immuno-compromised children and those with pre-existing illnesses such as asthma would be at risk. “These concerns are valid. We must put these forward to the department too,” said Simon Sugumar, Principal. However, the number of attendees at the meeting was low, he said and added that only 45% of parents attended the meetings.  The school will be able to ensure the student’s safety on the premises, but protection during travel to school may be difficult Rev.

08 January 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||Farmers call for fresh assessment of damages due to unseasonal rain||With the unseasonal rainfall during this month resulting in waterlogging and lodging of crops in some parts of the central region, farmers have called for a fresh enumeration for sanction of compensation to affected farmers. Inundation of paddy, groundnut and blackgram crops were reported in villages in Andimadam and Jayamkondam blocks in Ariyalur district on Thursday. Lodging of paddy crop ready for harvest was also reported in T. Palur area. Ariyalur Collector D. Rathna, accompanied by Agriculture Department and other officials, inspected some of the affected fields and areas at Kattathur, Villanatham and Pattanankurichi in Andimadam block on Thursday She instructed the officials to take steps to drain the water and use earthmovers wherever necessary to clear drainages. Ms. Rathna said agricultural fields and residential areas have been inundated at Andimadam, Jayamkondam and Sendurai taluks due to Wednesday’s heavy rain. Steps were taken to accommodate affected residents in temporary shelters. Paddy crop on about 750 hectares, blackgram on 300 hectares and 300 hectares of groundnut have been waterlogged in Andimadam taluk and steps have been taken to drain the water without affecting agricultural operations, she said. Sources in the Agriculture Department said that crops in Jayamkondam taluk have also been waterlogged. Lodging of paddy crop, ready for harvest, has been reported in about 500 hectares in T. Palur area, the sources said. Over 5,000 hectares of crops were estimated to have been damaged in the district due to heavy rainfall caused by Cyclones Burevi and Nivar, the sources added. Meanwhile, P. R. Pandian, president, Tamil Nadu All Farmers Associations Coordination Committee, while speaking to reporters at Sirkazhi on Thursday, urged Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to order a fresh enumeration of crop damages in the wake of the unseasonal rainfall. Although an enumeration of crops affected by the rainfall caused by the cyclones have been completed, a re-survey was required in view of the latest spell of rainfall. In many places, crops ready for harvest have been damaged causing heavy losses to farmers, he said. Since rainfall has been predicted till Pongal, the government should conduct a fresh enumeration of crop damages after the festival, he demanded.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/farmers-call-for-fresh-assessment-of-damages-due-to-unseasonal-rain/article33525143.ece
08 January 2021||Tiruchi,TAMIL NADU||For potters this Pongal is a soggy saga||Potters in the city, living in Thiruvanaikovil have avoided making earthen pots ahead of the Pongal festival this year due to the intermittent rains. The rainfall has come at a time when the pots should have been baked and drying, they rued. The year was not a fruitful one for potters in Mela Kondayampettai where they make earthen lamps, pots and stoves for a living. While many have moved on to construction work to make ends meet, only three to four families continue to make the earthenware, they said. Many workshops, such as M. Inbarasu’s were locked up after poor sales during Karthigai. “We struggled to make lamps as it would rain suddenly, rendering hours of hard work go waste. Many unbaked lamps were discarded,” he said. A mini-truck’s worth of clay costs Rs. 3,000 but on most days, the potters are unable to break even, they said. “The clay becomes watery and it is difficult to mould it to the shape we want,” Mr. Inbarasu said. Another potter, S. Ramu, said that while this time of the year would be a good period of sales for potters in the area, sales have been bad this year. “We have not been able to make and sell even one pot this year,” he said. Meanwhile, a vendor of earthenware in Gandhi Market said that the pots being sold at her shop this year were from Madurai and Puducherry. “We were only able to purchase some earthen lamps from makers at Thiruvanaikoil. We had to buy the pots for Pongal from makers in other districts,” the vendor said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/for-potters-this-pongal-is-a-soggy-saga/article33525138.ece

08 January 2021||TIRUCHI,TAMIL NADU||Thanjavur veena-maker replicates Mayuri Yaazh||N. Rajendran, a veena-maker of Thanjavur, has made a replica of the Mayuri Yaazh, an ancient open-stringed harp of Tamil music, in which the resonator base is shaped like a peacock. Though it was made for a private collector at Karur as an ornamental show-piece, Mr. Rajendran is confident of revival of the interest in the instrument. “My family has been engaged in making the Saraswathi Veena for four generations. I joined at the age of 20, and have always been keen on making rare instruments from time to time,” he told The Hindu.  Though the Yaazh is mentioned in Tamil classical literary texts like the Silapathigaram and has been depicted in temple sculptures, it has become outmoded. Using old palm leaf manuscripts from Thanjavur’s Saraswathi Mahal Library, Mr. Rajendran spent over a month to create a modified version of the 12-stringed instrument from scratch. “I sourced the wood of the jackfruit tree from Panruti [in Cuddalore] for this project. I had it machine-cut, and then shaped it manually by sanding and carving to the required structure,” he said. “Many artisans don’t know how to make instruments like the Yaazh, so I had to work on it all alone.” Mr. Rajendran’s Mayuri Yaazh is a working replica, and costs Rs. 50,000. The intricate engraving to shape the peacock base was the toughest part of the project. “I have tried to make the bird’s feathers look as realistic as possible with multiple carving techniques,” he said. He has also added a bunch of tail feathers. The weight of the 3 kg instrument has been balanced on the two sturdy ‘claw feet’ of the rounded base. “I had to carefully calculate the exact spot where the feet could bear the body of the instrument and allow it to stand upright. Unlike the veena which has a separate fibre stand to support its base and which can be used either in a horizontal or vertical position, the Yaazh has always been played upright,” he said. There are around 150 artisans involved in the making of veenas in Thanjavur. Business has been looking up for Mr. Rajendran after the lockdown was eased late last year. “I usually complete two veenas in a month. My customers are both seasoned performers and learners. But I always like experimenting. Two years ago, I made a Matchi Yaazh, shaped like a fish, that was well-received,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/thanjavur-veena-maker-replicates-mayuri-yaazh/article33525011.ece

The research team is assessing the environmental flow of the Moyar in three areas within the reserve – Theppakadu, Sigurhalla and Thengumarahada. It is being done with the support of the Forest Department. “Environmental flows are described as the quantity of water flowing through a river system at different points throughout the year which are required to sustain a river and the biodiversity dependent on it,” explained a top forest department official from MTR. WWF-India’s Associate Director for River Basin Management Nitin Kaushal told The Hindu that the study of the river was part of a larger project that would eventually include solutions to help in the rejuvenation of the Noyyal-Bhavani river basin. The environmental flow assessment process for the Moyar is in alignment with the E-Flows assessments, which WWF-India is doing for over a decade in the Ganga basin and in other river systems, he said. “Our work for the time-being involves studying the flows of the Moyar throughout the year and recommending a flow regime that will be conducive to maintaining biodiversity along the river,” he said. Sanket Bhale, WWF-India’s Team Leader for Western Ghats – Nilgiris Landscape, said the Moyar was home to many endemic species of fish, mammals and reptiles including the critically endangered humpbacked mahseer ( Tor remadevii) , marsh crocodiles and smooth-coated otters. The researchers from WWF-India hope to chart out the current and past flow of the river and come up with recommendations on the minimum amount of water that should be present in the river during each season. They hope to achieve this by convincing the government authorities in-charge of the dams upstream to moderate the release of water, and by restoring native Shola forests and grasslands in the upper Nilgiris. “Rivers are living ecosystems and provide a huge number of ecological services, apart from just the water supply for cities and agriculture. The linkages between a river and the ecosystem surrounding it is often complex. For instance, the Terminalia arjuna tree, which are used by vultures to build their nests on, often grow near rivers and their life-cycles are linked to seasonal variation in the flows of the Moyar. As part of our study, we are trying to understand these linkages better.” said Mr. Bhale. Field Director of MTR K.K. Kaushal said such studies of water flows were crucial in understanding and formulating policies that would ensure the maintenance of water levels conducive to the health of local wildlife that depend on the Moyar. “Nowadays, tiger reserves are also seen as one of the best sources of water, and they provide ecological services that benefit human communities as well. This kind of research will benefit both local wildlife and also people living downstream as we will better understand the quality and quantity of water flowing through this region,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/wwf-begins-study-of-environmental-flow-of-river-moyar/article33525043.ece

Raja on Thursday claimed that people had not even heard of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami till the death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. Addressing a Makkal Gram Sabha organised by the DMK in Gudalur, the Nilgiris MP said that people had not voted for Mr Palaniswami to be their Chief Minister. He contended that Mr. Palaniswami had become CM by “bowing” to V.K. Sasikala, the former close aide of Jayalalithaa.  Mr. Raja, said DMK president M.K. Stalin had progressed through the party ranks and “matured” into the leader he is today. He worked his way up in the party over the course of many years. Mr. Stalin was organising Makkal Gram Sabhas to hear the grievances of people across the State. “This should be a job for the State government, but is being undertaken by Mr. Stalin,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/palaniswami-not-known-till-jayalalithaas-death-a-raja/article33525041.ece

Stating that cultivation of millets in the district had increased to 16,000 hectares in the last few years, he said that efforts were on to increase cultivation area under National Food Security Mission. “Cultivation techniques for minor millets like sorgum, cumbu, barnyard and finger millet would be campaigned among farmers,” said the Joint Director. He added that the district was concentrating on promoting Barnyard millet. Besides, nutritious value in millets, its production and value addition would bring more remuneration to farmers.

08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,TAMIL NADU||High Court notice to Centre, ECI over postal ballots||The Madras High Court on Thursday ordered notices to the Centre and Election Commission of India (ECI) on a batch of cases, including the one filed by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), challenging their decision to permit voters above 80 years of age, the physically challenged and those in quarantine due to COVID-19 to opt for postal ballot during the election. The first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy directed the Registry to list the cases after four weeks for further hearing. Though the petitioners’ counsel urged the court to stay the EC’s decision, the Bench said that any order on the issue could be passed only after hearing the counsel for the respondents. RP Act Senior counsel P. Wilson, representing the DMK, pointed out that the party had challenged the constitutional validity of Section 60(c) of the Representation of the People Act of 1951 which empowers the ECI, in consultation with the government, to create a new class of voters and permit them to exercise their franchise through postal ballot instead of casting votes at polling booths. The counsel contended that the legal provision violates the right to secrecy in voting since postal ballots do not guarantee as much secrecy as Electronic Voting Machines do. Unbridled powers Stating that secrecy in voting was a sine qua non for ensuring free and fair elections, he said the executive could not be allowed to exercise unbridled power on the issue of granting exemption from visiting polling booths. Mr. Wilson also pointed out that political parties do not get a chance to audit postal votes unlike the procedure of appointing booth agents to verify the genuineness of voters in polling booths. Stating that persons employed in essential services too had been given the option of postal ballot, he said the term essential services had not been defined clearly. “The ECI can call any service as essential service,” he said and stated that there was no rationale behind providing postal ballot facility to voters above 80 years of age when any one above 65 years was categorised as a senior citizen for all other official purposes. The extent of disability had also not been prescribed for permitting the differently abled to vote through postal ballot, he said.  There was no rationale behind providing postal ballot facility to voters above 80 years of age when any one above 65 years was categorised as a senior citizen for all other official purposes.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/hc-notice-to-centre-eci-over-postal-ballots/article33525483.ece

After they were asked to submit their views in writing for the second time on the issue, they came to the schools accompanied by their wards on Thursday. The students and their parents were allowed to enter Kallanai Corporation Higher Secondary School in Tirunelveli Town to submit the completed forms.  But schools in Palayamkottai allowed only the parents to enter the campus in a bid to maintain physical distancing among visitors. On entering the premises, parents were asked to the meet the class teachers of their wards to submit the forms. On emerging out, many said they were in favour of reopening of schools with protective measures such as physical distancing in classrooms and laboratories and sanitisers put in place. “Since vaccine is to be administered to frontline health workers to shield them from the viral infection, it can also be administered to students on a priority basis so that they can attend classes or revision tests without fear of getting infected,” said N. Balamurugan, father of a student from Alangulam in Tenkasi district. Hostel dilemma Managements of schools that have hostels are not ready to reopen the facility even though the Department of School Education has decided to reopen the institutions from January 18 across the State. “After almost losing a whole academic year, we may restart activities mid-January. If we reopen the hostel, one infected student can spoil the entire academic plan we have in mind as we will have to close the school and the hostel,” said the headmistress of a girls’ higher secondary school in Palayamkottai. “So we do not want to take the risk of reopening hostels even though we have understood that it would be difficult for poor rural children coming to school from homes in remote areas,” she added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/most-parents-for-reopening-of-schools-after-pongal/article33525571.ece

Tobacco use is one of the known causes of cancer, as well as lung, cardiovascular, and oral health conditions. According to the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) report (2020) released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 26.9% of adults aged 45 and abovereported that they used tobacco in smoked or smokeless form. The use of tobacco in this age group was far higher in the northeastern States such as Mizoram (64%), Tripura (63%), Assam(47%), and Manipur (43%), besides Odisha (59%). It was under 10% in Puducherry (9%) and Punjab (8%). Alcohol consumption The report stated that nationally, 14.6% of the population (between 10 and 75 years of age) consumed alcohol, with excessive alcohol consumption found in 2.7% of the population. According to the report, 86% of adults aged 45 and above said they had not consumed any form of alcohol in their lifetime. Of the remaining, 8% were social drinkers, 3% consumed alcohol frequently but in lower quantities, while 3% were heavy episodic drinkers. In Karnataka, 7.6% were frequent non-heavy drinkers among male adults aged 45 and above. These people said they consumed alcohol 1-3 days per month, 1-4 days per week, or five or more days per week. On the other hand, 8.7% adults were heavy episodic drinkers, consuming at least 60 grams or more (approximately five drinks) of pure alcohol at least once in 30 days. Ill-treatment The prevalence of ill-treatment of the elderly was highest in Bihar (12%), followed by Karnataka (10%), West Bengal (8%), Uttar Pradesh (6%), Chhattisgarh (6%), Madhya Pradesh (5%), and Chandigarh (6%). As per the report, victims of physical ill-treatment were highest in Arunachal Pradesh (45%), Uttar Pradesh (43%), Tamil Nadu (40%),and Puducherry (41%). The report stated that in Karnataka, 59.5% adults aged between 49 and 59 depended on agricultural and allied activities, while 13.8% were self-employed. Among adults aged above 60, 79.8% were dependent on agriculture and allied activities. Disability levels The percentage of adults aged 45 and above with physical or mental disabilities/impairment was found to be high in Karnataka at 19%.

08 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Extended metro on Kanakapura Road set to open on January 15||After missing several deadlines, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) has finally fixed a date to start commercial operations of the extended metro line on Kanakapura Road. The line from Yelachenahalli to Silk Institute (earlier referred as Anjanapura) will be inaugurated on January 14. It will be thrown open to the public the next day. It will be the first metro reach under phase II slated for commercial operations. Chief public relations officer of BMRCL Yashvanth Chavan said that Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State (independent charge), Housing and Urban Affairs, will virtually inaugurate the metro line from Delhi. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa will also take part in the event by flagging off a train. “Usually, when an inauguration is scheduled in the evening, the commercial operations start from the next morning,” Mr. Chavan said. Fare structure The official said that the existing fare structure will continue. The 6-km metro stretch on the Green Line has five stations: Konanakunte Cross, Doddakallasandra, Vajrahalli, Thalaghattapura, and Silk Institute. Once the extension is open to the public, the total length of the operational Green Line will be 30 km. Under phase I, BMRCL had built the Green Line from Yelachenahalli to Nagasandra, with a total length of 24 km. Under phase II, BMRCL is also extending the Green Line from Nagasandra to BIEC on Tumakuru Road.  BMRCL initially planned to open the extended line for public use in 2018. With delays, it fixed one deadline one after another but failed to start commercial operations. Last year, BMRCL had planned to open the line in August 2020, but it was once again postponed due to COVID-19 and other factors. This year, one more reach is likely to open for commercial operations: Mysuru Road to Kengeri line, which is an extension of the Purple Line. It’s expected to be opened to the public in May. This was the first line taken up for construction under phase II in October 2015.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/extended-metro-on-kanakapura-road-set-to-open-on-january-15/article33524962.ece
08 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Govt. bid to dip into SC/ST sub-plan fund for infra work||The cash-strapped State government is making attempts to divert funds set aside for the welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for infrastructure works. Despite objections from within the BJP and the Opposition Congress, the full funds allocated to four major departments by the Social Welfare Department this financial year may end up being utilised for this purpose. A sum of Rs. 5,170 crore was sought to be diverted to works other than SC/ST welfare citing a ‘deemed expenditure’ clause. While provisions of the Karnataka Scheduled Castes Sub Allocation and Tribal Sub Plan (Planning, Allocation and Utilisation of Resources) Act, 2013, do not allow bulk transfer of allocations, the Finance Department has told the Social Welfare Department to transfer the full allocation made in four major departments for the welfare of SC/ST people, officials said. From its allocation of Rs. 26,614.69 crore in the 2020–21 budget, the Social Welfare Department has sub-allocated Rs. 5,170 crore for the welfare of SC/ST people in these four departments. This comes from Water Resources Department (Rs. 2,035.89 crore), Public Works Department (Rs. 1,427.97 crore), Urban Development Department (Rs. 1,341.97 crore), and Minor Irrigation Department (Rs. 364 crore). Withdraws statement The issue turned into a heated discussion in the Legislative Assembly in the recently concluded winter session where members from both the BJP and the Congress objected to diversion of funds meant for SC/ST welfare, and criticised Social Welfare Minister B. Sriramulu for justifying the diversion under ‘deemed expenditure’ clause. The Minister had withdrawn his statement later. The Finance Department informed the Social Welfare Department that the Chief Minister’s permission has been taken to consider this as ‘deemed expenditure’ since there is a severe shortage of resources owing to COVID-19. Funds earmarked for the four departments will be taken as ‘deemed expenditure’ to make bill payment. The instruction to the Social Welfare Department, sources said, came through an unofficial note from the Finance Department. It had asked the Social Welfare Department to consider the full allocation to these four departments as ‘deemed expenditure’. However, the Social Welfare Department has refused to consider the letter, and pointed to violation of the Act. Sources in the department said they had opposed it, but acknowledged that there have been serious attempts to divert funds. “The department is insisting that if infrastructure projects have to be funded, then the cost can be borne in proportion to the SC or ST population in the area. It has been conveyed to the Finance Department multiple times that bulk allocation is not possible,” a source said. A senior government official pointed out that section 7 (D) of the Act states that in the non-divisible projects where it is not possible to identify how many SC/ST people benefited, only a portion of the project amount can be provided, and whole allocation cannot be considered as ‘deemed expenditure’. Meanwhile, an office-bearer of the Government SC/ST Employees’ Association said that action should be initiated against officials who suggested this measure in violation of the Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-bid-to-dip-into-scst-sub-plan-fund-for-infra-work/article33524984.ece
08 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||43 trees to make way for new auditorium at planetarium||A total of 43 trees will make way for a new building as part of the smart upgrade plan of the Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium. The Deputy Conservator of Forests, Bengaluru Urban, has issued a public notice about the project, which states that of the 190 trees that are there in the project area, 43 will have to be removed, of which 28 can be transplanted. The Rs. 20-crore project announced in February 2020, which will be carried out by Bengaluru Smart City Ltd., will have a well-equipped auditorium and lecture halls over a total built-up area of 40,350 sq. ft. Pramod G. Galgali, Director of the planetarium, told The Hindu that the project, which was brought to a standstill by the COVID-19 pandemic, is aimed at providing necessary infrastructure to the non-formal science education activities of the planetarium. “We have been organising non-formal science education activities since two decades. The science lectures are becoming popular. But we did not have the necessary infrastructure, and hence requested the government. The new building will house a 600-seater auditorium and some classrooms as well,” he said. The proposed building will also have a viewing deck for events/eclipses, restrooms and toilets, apart from a small café with seating and basement parking. “We will accommodate what we can inside. The experts will decide on the details,” he said. Citizens are not entirely enthused. Sandeep Anirudhan, convener of Citizen’s Agenda of Bengaluru, a citizen’s movement, said, “Public consultation is mandated by EIA, but they have to give drawings, survey of the place and other details. How is the public going to make objections without all these?” He also said that there should not be any plans involving loss of green cover. “We've destroyed the city enough. Transplantation success rate is only 10%. They should be thinking of designing a project around the trees,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/43-trees-to-make-way-for-new-auditorium-at-planetarium/article33524964.ece
08 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Be clear about ideology: party leader to JD(S) brass||Senior Janata Dal (Secular) leaders, who have in recent weeks been denying having any truck with the BJP, had to field questions from their own partymen on the issue on Thursday. Questions posed by MLA for Arsikere K.M. Shivalinge Gowda to party supremo H.D. Deve Gowda and the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy reflected the thoughts of many within the party. “We are all confused about our ideology. You take a decision on it so that we follow and we rally behind you. There should be one ideology for the party. We should decide and stick with it,” Mr. Shivalinge Gowda told the leaders at the party’s meeting of office-bearers of all districts and legislators here. “There is a need for a regional party in the State. The party is still strong and should not change its stand,” he added. Mr. Shivalinge Gowda’s advice at the meeting came, even as Mr. Kumaraswamy and Mr. Deve Gowda recently issued clarification over rumours about the JD(S) striking an alliance with the ruling BJP, and even a possible merger of the regional party with the saffron outfit. Over the last fortnight, Mr. Kumaraswamy, who was seen as “soft-peddling” issues pertaining to the BJP government earlier, is being more aggressive in his denial of the party’s alliance or merger. Seeks meeting The three-time legislator from Arsikere inHassan district also sought a meeting with senior leaders so that he could explain the ground realities. “There is lot of misinformation being spread about the JD(S). Please invite us to a meeting and we will share inputs on it,” he added. Mr. Shivalinge Gowda was also critical of his senior party colleague and seven-time MLC Basavaraj Horatti for speaking to the press about a possible alliance, and causing confusion among the workers. He accused Mr. Horatti of doing so to become the chairman of the Legislative Council. “There are 50 to 60% secular votes. If it organises, then it can hit back at Hindutva votes.” Mr. Kumaraswamy, who later addressed the gathering, reiterated that there would be no alliance or merger with the BJP. “There is a systematic arrangement to sully the party’s image by floating rumours of alliance or merger with the BJP,” he said. He said leaders should not speak in public, but air their views on party forum.  We are all confused about our ideology. You take a decision on it so that we follow and we rally behind you. There should be one ideology for the party. We should decide and stick with it. K.M.

08 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||COVID-19: U.K. returnees in the dark about test report||U.K. returnees who have tested positive for COVID-19 and admitted in the Trauma and Emergency Care Centre (TECC) on the Victoria hospital campus allege that they are not being told about their new strain status even after discharge. Passengers who have returned from the U.K. are being isolated and admitted in separate wards of government COVID-19 facilities as soon as their RT-PCR reports are positive. However, they say that doctors are not letting them know their new strain status. So far, 25 U.K. returnees have been admitted at TECC and 10 have been discharged. Prashant Agarwal, a 50-year-old patient who was discharged from TECC on Thursday, told The Hindu that he is still not aware of his new strain status. “There is so much hype about the new strain. Anyone returning from the U.K. is being treated as an alien. Although I have been in the hospital for 14 days, I have not been told if I have contracted the new strain, not even after discharge. Mine is not an isolated case,” he said. Cause of anxiety Stating that this has increased his stress and anxiety levels, Mr. Agarwal said it is the patient’s right to know the lab reports. “Whenever we asked for the genome sequencing report, doctors told us that NIMHANS would convey it to the Centre and from there it would come to the State and then to the hospital,” he said. “Although it does not make any difference whether my infection is the new strain or not, “I wanted to know as I had tested RT-PCR negative before boarding from Atlanta, US. I transited through the UK and landed in Bengaluru on December 21 and must have contracted the infection enroute,” he said. Smitha Agarwal, his wife, alleged that her husband was not even given basic medicine for fever and cold till the fifth day in TECC. She had to send paracetamol and vitamin C tablets from home till the fifth day. “It was only after his oxygen level dropped that they started medication,” she alleged adding that the family was not even informed before discharge. Another patient, who was discharged two days ago, had a similar experience. Refusing to be named, he said he was not informed whether he was positive for the new strain or not. “Is it not my right as a patient to know about my reports?” Smitha Segu, nodal officer for COVID-19 at Victoria hospital, said only those who were positive for the new strain had been informed. Admitting that even those who are negative should have been informed, she said, “Their reports may not have come when they asked for the status.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/uk-returnees-in-the-dark-about-test-report/article33524977.ece
08 January 2021||Bengaluru,KARNATAKA||Affidavit sought on fire safety at Aero India||The High Court of Karnataka on Thursday directed the Ministry of Defence to file an affidavit of an officer of the Indian Air Force (IAF) stating that all precautionary measures would be taken during Aero India-2021 to prevent fire accidents, such as the one that occurred during the 2019 edition destroying nearly 300 cars at the parking area. Aero India-2021 is to be held from February 3 to 5. The IAF authorities, in coordination with the State government and its agencies, will have to take all precautions at the parking area to prevent such fire accidents, the court said. A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum issued the direction during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by Wing Commander (retd) G.B. Athri seeking a probe into the 2019 fire. Earlier, a report submitted by the city police to the court stated that the fire had occurred as dry grass at the P-4 parking area inside Yelahanka Air Force Station had come in contact with the heated engines and silencers of the cars. The report stated that 277 cars were completely burnt and 44 partially burnt. It also stated that the police, in coordination with the Transport Department and various insurance companies, assisted the car owners to claim insurance by setting up special counters. While the owners of 242 cars received the insurance amount, the owners of the remaining cars did not as they did not possess a valid insurance or had only third-party insurance, it was stated in the report. It was also pointed out that the case registered based on a complaint lodged by an officer of the air force station was closed after the investigation found that the cars were burnt in an accidental fire.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/affidavit-sought-on-fire-safety-at-aero-india/article33524988.ece

Board chairman H.S. Sachidananda Murthy said that under the Arundathi scheme, a sum of Rs. 25,000 would be provided for poor Brahmin brides. Under the Maitreyi scheme, a bond of Rs. 3 lakh would be assured, particularly to Brahmin women who marry priests in the State. Mr. Murthy said every bride would have to fulfil other conditions, including that it had to be her first marriage. The couple would have to give an undertaking that they would remain married for a specified period of time as well. He said that around 500 girls of marriageable age and falling under economically backward sections have been identified for the Arundhati scheme.

The farming community is facing difficulty in protecting crops as the downpour continued on Thursday morning as well. The growers are forced to postpone harvest, while those who have already harvested the yield are struggling to protect it from getting damp. Parts of Shivamogga received heavy rains on Wednesday night. Many houses in Hosamane Extension were flooded. Coffee growers of Magundi, Koove, Baluru, Kottigehara and other places in Mudigere taluk have suffered a loss as coffee beans spread on the ground for drying were washed away. The year-long work of the growers has gone in vain. Veeresh Gowda of Malinganadu in Mudigere taluk said the growers were already suffering a loss as the yield had come down due to heavy downpour, besides the shortage of workers. Now the untimely rainfall had snatched away whatever growers could harvest. The paddy growers have been advised to postpone the harvest for a few days. Chikkamagaluru, Shivamogga and Hassan districts have received more than the normal rainfall in the last three days. In the 24 hours before Thursday morning, Chikkamagaluru recorded an average rainfall of 11.6 mm against the normal 0.1 mm.

Admitting a complaint filed by a local RTI activist Riyazuddin Khateeb regarding the death of a 16-year-old patient due to what he said medical negligence, the Commission has asked GIMS to specifically report the instance and to submit a detailed report of the case. According to the complaint, the 16-year-old patient, Akash, was suffering from chronic kidney disease since September 2018, and he was undergoing haemodialysis at the dialysis unit in GIMS. On September 12, 2019, as many as 13 patients, including Akash, underwent dialysis. Of these patients, 10, including Akash, were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit after they developed complications due to technical issues. Akash died. The Commission learned that in 2017, a female child, Aliya, who was suffering from dengue, died due to unavailability of ventilator and medical negligence while getting treatment at GIMS. Mr. Khateeb also complained that none of the staff were suspended for such repeated negligence at the hospital. Mr. Khateeb also sought for compensation for the victims and action against the officials concerned. He requested the Commission to direct the government to replace the dysfunctional dialysis units. On September 13, the Deputy Director for Directorate of Health and Family Welfare, Bengaluru visited the hospital and enquired about the incidence. Now, the KSHRC has ordered the District Surgeon and the Superintendent, GIMS Hospital, to appear before it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/human-rights-commission-sends-notice-to-hospital/article33525211.ece

Raghupati Bhat, president of the Committee on Government Assurances, to make a recommendation to the government to establish a new district hospital in Kalaburagi. Mr. Revoor, who was also a member of Committee on Government Assurances, met Mr. Bhat at Gulbarga Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Kalaburagi on Thursday and made the appeal. “After the establishment of GIMS in the city, the district hospital was attached to it as a teaching hospital required for a medical college. A majority of human resources are being used to serve GIMS and, hence, the hospital is facing a serious manpower crunch. We are not able to effectively implement national health programmes due to staff crunch. We need a district hospital with dedicated staff so that it could function independently and effectively implement all health schemes of the State and Union governments,” Mr. Revoor said. Mr. Revoor also demanded that the committee recommend to the government the establishment of branches of Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health and the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences in Kalaburagi. District Surgeon Ambaraya Rudrawadi raised the issue of delayed payment of salaries to the hospital staff and urged the committee to take steps to correct it.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/panel-urged-to-recommend-new-district-hospital-for-kalaburagi/article33525212.ece

08 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Sand policy exclusively for coastal districts in 15 days||The long-pending demand for a sand mining policy for the coastal districts will be realised in another 15 days, said Minister for Mines and Geology C.C. Patil here on Thursday. Speaking to reporters after meeting MLAs and members of the District Task Force from Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, Mr. Patil said that with areas in the coastal districts divided into Coastal Regulatory Zone and non-CRZ, the sand extraction policy has to be different from the one that applies to other parts of the State. “Such a policy is a long-pending demand. The State government is committed to resolving it,” Mr. Patil said and added that a high-level meeting will be held in Bengaluru shortly. The Deputy Commissioners of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi will be invited to it. “We will make an announcement in another 15 days,” he said. Affirming the commitment of the government to providing sand at affordable prices, the Minister said that if more licences are issued for extraction, the rate of sand will automatically come down. “Sand is now available at Rs. 6,000 per load in Dakshina Kannada. It will come down further,” the Minister said. Mr. Patil said that Mysuru Minerals Limited has been asked to extract sand in 30 blocks in the non-CRZ areas where more than 10,000 tonnes of sand are available in each block in Dakshina Kannada. In areas where fewer quantity is available, agencies such as Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Limited will be asked to extract sand. As many as 104 people have been involved in traditional extraction of sand in CRZ areas since 2011. This number will be slightly increased, he said. The State government will come down hard on those involved in illegal transportation of sand and illegal extraction of red stone. Surveillance cameras are being placed at 196 places in Dakshina Kannada to keep a tab on inter-State movement of vehicles, he said. While there are about 800 sites identified for extraction of laterite stones, only one permit has been issued. The government would enhance the numbers after scrutinising applications by 250 persons in a fortnight to allow such extraction only in patta lands, Mr. Patil said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sand-policy-exclusively-for-coastal-districts-in-15-days/article33525398.ece
08 January 2021||MANGALURU,KARNATAKA||Pressing problem needs a solution, says Karkala MLA||People’s representatives from Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts on Thursday urged Minister for Mines and Geology C.C. Patil for early announcement of a sand extraction policy for coastal Karnataka. Speaking at a meeting of members of the District Task Force of the two districts here, Karkala MLA V. Sunil Kumar said that elected public representatives of the region were demanding the sand policy for the last two years. “The pressing problem needs to be addressed and the issue needs to be taken to a logical conclusion,” Mr. Kumar said. Mr. Kumar said that as in CRZ areas, where sand is allowed to be extracted in a traditional way, provision should be made to allow traditional extraction of sand by going down to the riverbed in non-CRZ areas too. “Traditional sand extraction was allowed prior to 2011. Not allowing traditional extraction of sand in non-CRZ areas now is leading to law and order problem,” he said. When Additional Chief Secretary (Mines) G. Kumara Naik and Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra pointed out that panchayats were empowered to take steps for extraction of sand from the riverbeds and vented dams in their jurisdiction, Mr. Kumar said that panchayats lacked expertise in getting sand extracted. Mr. Kateel said that the government should allow traditional sand extraction by local residents in places such as Belthangady where the river flows continuously. In places such as Puttur and Sullia, where there is no need for traditional sand extraction, panchayats should be allowed to extract sand using the services of government and other agencies. MLC Prathap Simha Nayak, MLAs Rajesh Nayak, Y. Bharath Shetty and D.Vedavyas Kamath also spoke.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/pressing-problem-needs-a-solution-says-karkala-mla/article33525395.ece

Hosabelaku Seva Trust organised the programme in which over a 100 people participated and performed rituals that are accorded to a pregnant Hindu woman. Gauri, the cow, was found injured near Rajathadri in Manipal about 20 days ago. Taken care of initially by local autorickshaw drivers, the trust office-bearers later took the cow under their care. They conducted the ceremony on Wednesday. The cow was given a bath, then draped with a green sari. Then, rice, coconuts and other items were offered as Bagina to the cow even as sprouted grains of nine varieties and other delicacies were given as food. Women present performed Arati to Gauri. Trust members, including convener Tanula Tarun, ensured that Gauri recovered from the shock and pain.

08 January 2021||Mysuru,KARNATAKA||Bulk waste generators should comply with rules: MCC||The Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) will direct bulk waste generators to manage the solid and wet waste independently so as to reduce the pressure on the civic body and comply with the solid waste management rules. This will apply to all apartments, hotels, restaurants, choultries and kalyana mantapas, each of which generate at least 100 kg of wet waste per day and qualify as bulk waste generators as defined by the SWM rules. This was stated by the MCC Commissioner, Gurudutt Hegde, on Thursday. He said though there was a resolution passed by the council and a law making it mandatory for bulk waste generators to install a waste recycling and management system, the MCC has not implemented it so far. This was also an issue that did not get adequate attention in 2020 due to the COVID-19 but the MCC is set to build pressure on the bulk waste generators to establish their own units for recycling waste. Mr. Hegde said some of the apartment complexes in the city have already established such a mechanism and it was functioning smoothly. But there were many who either cited lack of adequate space within their complex or paucity of funds for establishing such a facility. Now with the pourakarmikas stretched to their limits in waste collection and segregation, it had become imperative for the MCC to implement the rule, said Mr. Hegde. Earlier in the day Mr.Hegde and MCC officials visited a private apartment complex in the city which has installed its own facility for recycling wet waste. The complex generates nearly 200 kg of wet waste daily and it is being recycled and converted to compost and used for gardening purpose.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bulk-waste-generators-should-comply-with-rules-mcc/article33525421.ece

This is because the receptors of the H5N1 virus are not located in the upper respiratory tract like Influenza ‘A’ H1N1 (swine flu). “Not even a single case of bird flu among human beings has been reported in India,” V. Ravi, former head of the Department of Neurovirology at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), told The Hindu on Thursday. He said that only those who are in contact with the infected birds and health workers examining poultry workers are at risk. “This is not the first time that bird flu is being reported. We have been seeing this outbreak once every two years, but we have been able to tackle it early by culling birds,” he said. “During the current outbreak, the good thing is that we have a system in place. The COVID-19 precautions of SMS – Sanitisation, Masking and Social Distancing – that people are following is the best defence against all viruses,” Dr. Ravi said. The doctor, who is a member of the COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, said the receptors of H5N1 are deep down in the lungs, unlike in H1N1 or COVID-19 where the virus can attach itself to a human being through the nasal cavity. “The human body has several defence barriers in the upper respiratory tract to check the virus. One has to inhale high loads of the virus and that should go deep down into the respiratory tract to get infected,” he said. Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said the State government has taken all measures to contain the outbreak. Samples sent “Six crows have died in Dakshina Kannada district. Their samples have been sent to the forensic lab for tests. “Once the reports come, we will know if it is bird flu. Meanwhile, all precautionary measures have been taken in border districts,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bird-flu-there-is-no-need-to-panic/article33524973.ece

Though the Union government has declared COVID-19 as a “notified disaster” under the Disaster Management Act, and Karnataka grappled with a large number of COVID-19 positive cases, the government us yet to set up the SDRF notwithstanding the fact that the fund should have been established when the State Disaster Management Authority came into existence, the court observed. A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum issued the direction during the hearing of separate PIL petitions filed by High Court Legal Services Committee and Mallikarjuna A. of Chelur village in Gubbi taluk in Tumakuru district for enforcement of the DM Act. Though the government said that it has earmarked around Rs. 200 crore towards the State Disaster Mitigation Fund (SDMF), and around Rs. 33,000 each for every district under the District DMF, the bench noted that the creation of Disaster Mitigation Fund is only on paper. Meanwhile, the bench directed the Chief Secretary to inform the court whether the government is willing to exercise the power conferred on the State to create rules under the DM Act for effective implementation of the Act, as there was no clarity on framing of the rules in the statement filed by the government.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/govt-failed-to-set-up-disaster-fund/article33524971.ece

The Kerala Forest Research Institute, Peechi, had done a survey nearly 12 years ago on the relocation of settlers under the voluntary resettlement project. It found that as many as 10,604 people from 2,613 families in 110 settlements needed to be relocated. The survey had identified 1,388 people from 880 families in 14 settlements for relocation in the first phase at a cost of Rs. 88 crore.  600 families relocated The government could relocate nearly 600 families so far, including tribal families, in 12 settlements in the WSS under the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitat Scheme (IDWHS) of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, N. Badusha, president of Wayanad Prakruthi Samrakshana Samithi, said. A few more families in two hamlets, including Chettyalathur and Kurichyad hamlets, have to be relocated, and the project is moving at a snail’s pace owing to technical reasons and alleged negligence of Revenue Department officials. However, the Kumizhy hamlet is included as the first hamlet in the second phase of the project and as many as 120 families, including tribal families, have been awaiting for the execution of the project. “As the hamlet is surrounded by the sanctuary on two sides and Mudumalai and Bandipur tiger reserves on the other sides, man-animal conflict is common in the hamlet, especially during summer when animals start their annual migration to the sanctuary from neighbouring tiger reserves,” said Vijayan, a tribal chieftain of the hamlet. Infrastructure facilities such as educational institutions or healthcare facilities are still a distant dream to the inhabitants. Many of the farmers in the hamlet had left for their relatives’ homes in neighbouring villages owing to the recurring incidences of wildlife attack, he said. Meeting held The remaining members of the hamlets convened a meeting on Thursday and decided to submit their grievances to the Forest Minister and senior officials of the Forest Department. Their demands include expediting steps to execute the relocation project on a war footing and increasing the compensation from Rs. 10 lakh for a family to Rs. 30 lakh a family as the current compensation was fixed nearly 16 years ago.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/discontent-brewing-among-settler-farmers-inside-sanctuary/article33525277.ece

Private stakeholder(s) will have to ready a design which makes optimal use of available space, pool in funds and construct the building. The land will be leased to them for a particular period, and they will be able to make commercial use of whatever space the Railway does not need. But the Railway will operate the entire premises, since it owns the land, he added. Concept plan The project’s concept says the station ought to be developed to international standards, as a multi-modal transport hub. The amenities must be disabled friendly too, having acess ramps, lifts, and tactile flooring. There must also be seamless flow of passengers in all weather conditions. The structures must also be eco-friendly and must make maximum use of light and ventilation. The RLDA, a subsidiary of the Indian Railways, had earlier entrusted KITCO with the task of readying a report on amenities for passengers, eateries, multi-tier parking space for private and public transport vehicles, and a skywalk to the adjacent Kochi metro station (where too commercial space is available), apart from commercial ventures for which space could be earmarked in the building. The last date to submit RFQ is February 22. .The Thiruvananthapuram Railway Division will involve with the project after the tender is awarded. On its part, the Railway is keen to extend three short platforms by a few hundred metres, so that they can hold trains having 24 coaches. The inadequate availability of lengthy platforms is one reason why express trains are held up outside the station, official sources said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/redevelopment-of-ekm-jn-station-gets-a-boost/article33525297.ece
08 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Police ready plan to meet spike in snarls at Edappally||Foreseeing an increase in traffic snarls at Edappally Junction when the six-lane flyovers at Vyttila and Kundannoor are commissioned on Saturday, the traffic police have readied a plan to streamline flow of vehicles that converge at the junction. “We have identified three congestion-prone areas at the junction. One among them is the point south of the junction in front of Mylalath Temple, where vehicles tend to divert from the NH Bypass and take the service road, to avoid long queue awaiting the green signal. They create traffic hold-ups when they try to re-enter the bypass when vehicles begin moving on getting the green signal. This will not be permitted. In addition, more time might be allotted to vehicles coming from Palarivattom to Edappally Junction, to cross the junction,” said Francis Shelby, Assistant Commissioner of Police, City Traffic Police (East). The other two bottlenecked locations are located at the gate of Lulu Mall that faces the Edappally-Varapuzha national highway and the junction north of that. Parking curbs for around 600 metres from the junction and other regulations like redirecting vehicles which want to take U-turn to the underpass of the Edapally overbridge too are on the cards, he said. The police foresee approximately 20% increase in the number of vehicles converging at Palarivattom and Edappally from Vyttila, once the flyovers on the NH Bypass are commissioned on Saturday. Among those who cited the possibility of traffic hold-ups worsening at Edappally include Ernakulam Regional Transport Officer (RTO) Babu John. “The additional influx of vehicles is likely to cause snarls at the junction. Commuters must be encouraged to avail public transport to lessen snarls at such junctions,” he said. A necessity While expressing concern that serpentine snarls may develop at Edappally, especially when discount sales are announced at Lulu Mall, a senior PWD official said the State government or the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) must take a call on the underpass linking the NH Bypass and the Edappally-Varapuzha NH corridor, which Metroman E. Sreedharan and many others suggested long ago, to decongest the junction. “The junction urgently needs a four-lane underpass, which will lessen congestion by over half,” said P.R. Padmanabhan Nair, president, Edappally Vikasana Samiti. The existing flyover would have served its purpose if it landed beyond the Edappally Toll Junction, he added. Ponekkara bridge Social activist K.A. Francis said an underpass and realisation of the long-awaited Ponekkara bridge would ensure streamlined flow of vehicles at the junction. The bridge will open up an alternative corridor for vehicles to North Paravur.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-ready-plan-to-meet-spike-in-snarls-at-edappally/article33525307.ece
08 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Huge haul of fake sanitisers||The Intelligence wing of the Drugs Control Department seized around 2,500 litres of fake sanitisers from a house near the Nedumbassery airport on Thursday. The illegal products were manufactured and labelled at the house located in a residential area at Kottayi. Officials found that the sanitisers had been given various brand names and sold to retailers and other customers without bills or receipts. “We are in search of one Hashim, staying near Union Christian College at Aluva, who is suspected to be the key person behind the illegal activity. He had taken the house on rent. His mobile phone remains switched off, and he is learnt to be in Mumbai,” said Jayan Philip, Drugs Inspector (Intelligence), Ernakulam. A case under the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act was registered against him. The house was sealed, as the team found that the accused had set up equipment for labelling and manufacturing fake sanitisers. The clandestine operation was busted by the Intelligence wing after officials, who had posed as customers, made a call to the contact number of the illegal firm. A woman who picked up the call directed them to a person employed at the house. “He came in an autorickshaw to deliver our requirement. They were found selling five litres of fake sanitisers at Rs. 500. Regular customers, mostly retailers, were given the fake product at lower prices, and they promoted the products over the counter,” said Mr. Philip. Local residents informed officials that they had also purchased the product on several occasions without realising that it was fake. The accused had taken care not to invite customers to the house by always delivering the products at shops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/drugs-control-dept-seizes-over-2500-litres-of-fake-sanitisers/article33525302.ece
08 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||Relief for families of special children||Much to the relief of the parents of special children, the local self-government department (LSGD) has decided to roll back its previous decision to cut back on the annual educational scholarship for their children. A circular issued by the LSGD dated January 5 said the entire tranche of scholarship amount of Rs. 28,500 would be paid as before, considering that the beneficiaries belonged to the most vulnerable sections in the society. A meeting of the State coordination committee for decentralised planning held on October 21 had directed local bodies to withhold the travel allowance (TA), amounting to Rs. 12,000 at the rate of Rs. 1,000 a month, as schools were remaining closed and to restore it when schools reopen. Over 1.25 lakh children afflicted with autism, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and multiple disabilities are eligible for the annual scholarship. Educational assistance of Rs. 12,000, dress allowance of Rs. 2,000, books allowance of Rs. 1,500, and tour allowance of Rs. 1,000 were the rest of the scholarship components. The scholarship is funded in the proportion of 50% by the grama panchayat, 25% by the district panchayat, and the remaining 25% by the block panchayat concerned. Multiple organisations of parents of special children had petitioned the government asking to desist from the move considering that many of them were not being able to work and forced to stay back to take care of their children owing to the pandemic. Parents’ Association of Intellectually Disabled Kerala (PAID Kerala), one of the organisations to petition the government, had decried the move to withhold TA while door-delivering other welfare pensions as discrimination towards the special children. It had even suggested distribution of the proposed reduction as a special COVID-19 package to the families of special children as a means to overcoming potential audit objection if that triggered the move.  Sympathetic view The LSGD seems to have taken a sympathetic view as the dilemma of parents about giving up their jobs for their children finds a mention in the circular. It also states how parents have to bear the cost of therapy for their children in private clinics and arrange for their online classes. “It is a big relief for the families of special children as the move to withhold TA would have further deteriorated their already sagging financial position,” said K.M. George, State president of PAID Kerala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/relief-for-families-of-special-children/article33525304.ece
08 January 2021||KOCHI,KERALA||House surgeons at MCH on warpath||It is a catch-22 situation for the authorities of the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Ernakulam, with house surgeons on the path of agitation demanding immediate resumption of inpatient (IP) admission of non-COVID patients, so that they are able to have clinical training as part of their academic requirements. The hospital, saddled with a major share of COVID-19 patients for the last 11 months, has its 40 ICU beds fully occupied, and unless an alternative arrangement is made, opening of IP could be troublesome, said Dr. V. Satheesh, Principal, MCH . The 73 house surgeons had a turbulent year, rues Siby Manuel Jose, a house surgeon. “While we performed duty at the COVID triage for the first four-and-a-half months, for clinical postings, students were divided into three batches and allocated to Kottayam, Alappuzha and Ernakulam Medical Colleges on rotation. That got over by December 31. And, it was agreed that OP and IP would be opened since January beginning. But while the outpatient wing began to function in a limited manner, IP was shut a day after it was opened,” he said. While the students feel that the burn ICU and the cath facility could be used tentatively as non-COVID ICU. They also argued that it was possible to shift low-category COVID-19 patients to an adjacent block for admission of non-COVID patients in wards. “It is possible to ensure there is segregation of patients in the two categories,” said Mr. Jose. But the principal said it may not be possible. “However, we held a meeting with the District Collector on Monday and requested him to make alternative ICU arrangements. That is being done at the district hospital in Aluva. But it takes a fortnight to a month’s time. In the meantime, we have a schedule to restore all non-COVID operations in a phased manner,” he added. While the hospital has reopened medical, surgery and orthopaedic OPs, primarily to give clinical exposure to the house surgeons, its continuing pivotal role in the COVID-19 fight is throwing the spanner in its academic role, said senior doctors.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/house-surgeons-at-mch-on-warpath/article33525314.ece
08 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Police continue arrests of V4 Kochi activists||The City police continued their arrest of activists of V4 Kochi, the recently launched non-political outfit, with four more getting arrested from their homes in the early hours of Thursday. The arrested include Shakeer Ali, V4 Kochi Kochi zone controller; Sajan Aziz, Thrikkakara joint controller, and Antony Abin and Isaac Chacko who contested in the Kochi Corporation in the local body polls. Mr. Chacko, who was arrested under the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance, was released on station bail, while others were slapped with non-bailable charges. The police have so far arrested eight V4 Kochi activists since Tuesday in connection with the unauthorised opening of the Vyttila flyover, which is slated to be inaugurated by the Chief Minister on Saturday. Four, including the organisation campaign controller Nipun Cherian, were arrested late on Tuesday night. “More arrests are likely in the days to come, since we are not only after those who had illegally opened up the flyover but also those who had participated in a protest at Vyttila before, demanding the immediate opening of the flyover,” said a police officer associated with the probe. V4 Kochi accused the police of trampling upon human rights. “We are expecting more of our activists to be dragged away in the night. We are being persecuted for something we haven’t done,” said John Jacob, north zone controller, V4 Kochi. The police have slapped the arrested with various provisions of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act and IPC Sections 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 336 (endangering life or personal safety of others), 447 (criminal trespass), 143 (unlawful assembly) 147 (rioting), and 149 (unlawful assembly guilty of the offence committed in prosecution of common object).||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/police-continue-arrests-of-v4-kochi-activists/article33525318.ece
08 January 2021||Kochi,KERALA||Expansion of Corpn. limits sought||The Cochin Chamber of Commerce has demanded expansion of the Kochi Corporation limits to give a focused approach for development. The chamber in its pre-budget memorandum submitted to Finance Minister Thomas Isaac contended that while other major towns grew in area, Kochi has more or less stood still since its formation. The Kochi Corporation covers an area of only 94.88 sq. km. But the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation, which had an area of only 30.66 sq. km. during its formation has grown to 214.86 sq. km. This will give a focused approach for development, Cochin Chamber president K. Harikumar said. The chamber proposed reduction of VAT from 14.5% to enhance the utilisation of natural gas in Kerala itself from the recently inaugurated Kochi-Mangaluru gas pipeline. Tamil Nadu charges only 4%, and it will give an impetus for development and growth, he said. The chamber also sought the formation of a maritime cluster based on Willingdon Island at par with leading international maritime centres, to be included in the budget. This was proposed by State government in Ascend 2020. The project will develop core, financial, regulatory and other services (tourism, maritime museum etc.). The chamber also sought finalisation of maritime rules to facilitate the implementation of the Maritime Board Act 2017. It commended the government for taking proactive steps for the formulation of a plantation policy. Kerala produces around 48% of the total plantation crops in the country. Around 3.3 lakh labourers are directly dependent on plantations. On ease of doing business, the chamber sought to make Kerala Industry 4.0 ready. Industry 4.0 is the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. It includes cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things, and Cloud Computing. Industry 4.0 creates what has been called a ‘Smart Factory’. The chamber also demanded governance reforms, representation of more industry organisations in committees of the government, and a comprehensive and unified Kerala Public Health Act.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/expansion-of-corpn-limits-sought/article33525298.ece

Final work The final work on street lights too had to be completed (at Kundannoor), while signals and other amenities had to be readied. “A section of people are resorting to protests and spreading rumours, citing delay in commissioning the flyovers, possibly because they are unaware of such details. We also doubt the interference of ‘professional criminalism’, seen only in Ernakulam, in this,” said a release from the PWD. The two flyovers also cost Rs. 15 crore less than the estimate. The 720-metre-long Vyttila flyover cost Rs. 6.73 crore less than the estimated Rs. 85.90 crore, while the 731-metre-long Kundannoor flyover cost Rs. 8.29 crore less than the estimated Rs. 82.74 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/mandatory-procedures-delayed-reopening-pwd/article33525308.ece

According to UDF sources, the entry of NCP to the coalition comes even as the Congress looked to affirm its presence across Kottayam following the exit of Kerala Congress (M) led by Jose K. Mani from the coalition. The situation is likely to get complicated further if attempts by the Kerala Congress led by P.C. Thomas and the Kerala Janapaksham led by P.C. George, MLA, to join the coalition ahead of the Assembly election turn successful. “Discussions regarding the allocation of the Pala, Poonjar, Kanjirappally and Changanassery seats have been taking place for a while among leaders in the second rung with some of them even shifting their base to these constituencies. The reports about the entry of new partners, apparently eyeing at the Catholic vote base, have left them perplexed,” said a senior leader.  Janapaksham stance The other day, the Kerala Janapaksham had confirmed the reports of holding consultations with the UDF ahead of the Assembly polls. According to the party leadership, it planned to contest from as many as seven seats, including Pala and Kanjirappally. Though the ‘A’ group in the Congress was not really keen on associating with Mr. George, the UDF's set back in the recent local body polls appears to have softened its stance. The coalition, however, will have to navigate through strong opposition at the local level before taking Mr. George on board. The party led by Mr. Thomas, meanwhile, is likely to be offered a seat along the eastern side of the district. An array of seat aspirants within the Congress notwithstanding, the majority of the UDF leaders appear positively inclined towards offering the Pala seat to Mr. Kappan, as was evident from the statement of P.J.

08 January 2021||KOTTAYAM,KERALA||Outbreak under control in Sabarimala||The efforts to reign in the rapid outbreak of COVID-19 within the Sabarimala pilgrimage zone have finally paid off. A latest antigen testing drive organised by the authorities found that all 78 persons examined at the Sannidhanam were negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. At the same time, only one out of the 44 samples collected from Nilackal tested positive. The latest results have served as a major relief to the authorities concerned, where over 360 officials on duty tested positive for the virus infection till January 4. The staggering numbers had also put the authorities in a dilemma over whether to declare the pilgrimage zone as a containment area or not. “The latest results have come as a boost as the temple prepares for the Makaravilakku festival on January 14 and host different procession groups prior to it. Among other things, the decision to insist on RT-PCR test for those joining the pilgrimage duty proved most crucial in containing the spread,” said a top official of the Health Department. Besides the Sannidhanam, the authorities also decided to intensify testing among those stationed at Pampa and Nilackal base camp.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/outbreak-under-control-in-sabarimala/article33525364.ece
08 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||CBSE schools invite parents’ wrath for not reducing fees||A couple of schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in Kozhikode district are incurring the wrath of parents over charging of fees in the current pandemic period. Al-Farook Parents Welfare Association, an organisation representing the parents of Al-Farook Senior Secondary School, Feroke, recently held a demonstration outside the school premises claiming that the management was not willing to reduce the fees despite their expenses coming down considerably now. Parents were being asked to pay for festival and sports meets though such events were not being held. Though the government authorities have allowed reduction in fees between 55% to 67%, the management had reduced it to only 30%. Parents are now planning to refuse fee payment if their demand of a reduction up to 50% was not allowed. The parents’ welfare committee at Prestige Public School, Mankave, staged a protest on Wednesday accusing the management of expelling students, including those in Class 10, on the grounds that they had not paid the fees. Parents claimed that many among them had lost their jobs and were facing financial difficulties. They alleged that the school management was not willing to consider their request to reduce the fees by 50%. A similar problem had cropped up at Apex International School, Odumbra, as well. However, the management and representatives of the parent-teacher association are reported to have sorted out the dispute. Last month, the Kerala High Court had asked the State government if it was possible for a specified authority in the Education Department to look into the complaints over overcharging of fees and to verify and scrutinise the income and expenditure of CBSE schools. The court also rapped the CBSE for not issuing a circular directing all the affiliated schools not to charge fees in excess of the actual expenses incurred for the current academic year and to verify the statements of income and expenditure. The General Education Department also barred schools in the State from charging excess fees for the 2020-21 academic year in view of the pandemic and warned against “profiteering” attempts. This followed an interim order of the Kerala High Court on November 20. The court was of the firm view that schools must charge no surplus for this academic year but “only the actuals”. The CBSE had informed the court that fee should be fixed as instructed by respective State governments. Meanwhile, representatives of Al-Farook Senior Secondary School and Prestige Public School have refuted the allegations. They claimed that parents were being consulted while charging the fees.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/parents-irked-over-cbse-schools-not-reducing-fees-by-50/article33525283.ece
08 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Cong. kick-starts preparations for Assembly elections||The Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) on Thursday set in motion the process of gearing up for the Assembly polls by holding a meeting of elected representatives of the Legislature and Parliament and senior office-bearers of the party here. The meeting chaired by P.V. Mohan, All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary in charge of Kerala, discussed the political and electoral strategy to be adopted in the Assembly elections after the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) received a walloping shock in the recent three-tier local body polls. The leadership while deliberating the driving forces and possible outcomes of the Assembly polls wanted senior leaders from refraining from trading barbs against one another in public. Mr. Mohan from Karnataka has been appointed by the Congress high command to assist Tariq Anwar, the AICC general secretary in charge of Kerala. He will monitor the north Kerala region, while two others — P. Viswanathan and Ivan D’Souza — central Travancore and southern sectors. Addressing the media, Mr. Mohan said the exercise would continue in all districts. It is too premature to divulge details about deliberations at the meeting, he added. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said the target of the Congress was to achieve cent percent success in the Assembly elections. The party will study the reasons for its failures, he said. He alleged that the CPI(M) and the BJP had joined hands against the Congress in the State. “Plans are afoot to accommodate youngsters in the electoral fray. The selection of candidates will be foolproof and transparent,” Mr. Ramachandran. On the Congress having covert and overt relationships with the Welfare Party of India, the political arm of the Jamaat Islami Hind, Mr. Ramachandran said it was a closed chapter. He declined to comment on rumours of his candidature in the Assembly polls. Earlier, K. Sudhakaran, MP, said the high command was vested with powers to effect any changes in the State leadership of the party. The Congress will not have any tacit understanding with the Welfare Party of India. However, the party will accept votes from anyone, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/congress-kick-starts-preparations-for-upcoming-assembly-polls/article33525280.ece
08 January 2021||Kozhikode,KERALA||Illegal money lending schemes thrives in Kozhikode||Despite rising instances of fake online credit schemes and loss of money, not many complaints have reached the police for a comprehensive probe. Since a majority of borrowers are reportedly those who obtained loans below Rs. 5,000 as one-time instalment, they tend to keep their details confidential fearing legal complications. Though a State-level team may be formed to probe illegal online money lending schemes and the charging of exorbitant interest rates violating RBI regulations, the victims are yet to hand over any incriminating evidence to the police. Meanwhile, the government is considering a probe to expose Kerala-based executives assisting illegal credit schemes. A preliminary probe found that mostly social media users from poor families fell prey to such schemes. Many of them had even installed a fraudulent android application, providing their complete details and identity proofs for processing loans. Though loans were instantly credited to their accounts, the high interest rates drove them into distress. “We learnt that there are also a few WhatsApp groups managed by Keralite youths to communicate with borrowers. A few borrowers are also victims of social media defamation for failure to pay interests,” said a police officer in Kozhikode city. He added that several borrowers had been trapped after the pandemic outbreak and the consequent financial crisis. A relative of a borrower from Vadakara said he came across the problem after getting a call from an executive of an online credit distribution agency. “He said I was a guarantor for the money borrowed by my relatives. Many people had been contacted by fraud agents in a similar fashion,” he added. A cyber cell official warned that sharing of identity documents with the third party could land individuals in unforeseen legal issues and the resultant loss of money. “Anyone can access bank account details or create fake accounts using the documents and siphon off money. It is wise to avoid clicking unfamiliar social media links promising quick money,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/illegal-money-lending-schemes-thrives-in-kozhikode/article33525468.ece

She said here on Thursday that unique projects would be chalked out for the comprehensive development of the farming sector in the district. “The issue of rice procurement in Palakkad district will be addressed when the Kannambra rice mill becomes a reality,” Ms. Binumol said. Vice president C.K. Chamunni said the new rice mill would be large enough to procure even the paddy from Thrissur district. Around 3,000 Kudumbashree units in the district are currently engaged in lease land farming as part of the Subhiksha Keralam programme. Ms. Binumol and Mr. Chamunni said joint farms would be introduced in all grama panchayats in the district. Vegetable storage centres will be constructed considering the spurt in vegetable production, they said. “We are duty-bound to continue the development activities initiated by the outgoing council,” they said, addressing a meet-the-press organised by Palakkad Press Club.  New jobs  Ms. Binumol hinted that the district panchayat would make interventions in health, education, and sports sectors, with an objective of opening new job opportunities. They said they expected the support of the Palakkad municipality for treatment of waste in the town. The Bharatiya Janata Party is ruling the municipality when the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is ruling the district panchayat. They said that more green islets or ‘pachathuruthus’ would be developed as part of conserving the rivers in the district. Ms. Binumol said that a one-way project would be chalked out by joining hands with the municipality to do away with the frequent traffic congestion in front of the Women and Children Hospital in the Palakkad town. They admitted that shortage of employees in the District Hospital had begun to adversely affect COVID-19 treatment in the district.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/district-panchayat-offers-support-to-farmers/article33525472.ece

The right to catch and sell the reservoir’s fish was held by a fishery cooperative society of people belonging to the Scheduled Castes until several years ago. However, the government froze their rights as the society failed to display efficiency in catching and selling the fish. Those who have been fishing in the reservoir now were selected from the Malampuzha grama panchayat by the Fisheries Department. However, the grouping of people who used to catch fish from the Malampuzha reservoir demanding that they be allowed fishing in the dam led to the tension. The police defused the tension by holding talks with the group leaders and assuring that a decision would be arrived at by January 28.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/tension-at-malampuzha-over-right-to-fish-in-reservoir/article33525473.ece

Going by rough estimates, around 2,000 people, including students and guardians, thronged the Senate Hall of the university headquarters and other parts of the Palayam campus during the spot admissions to the General category seats of BA, BCom and BSc courses in colleges in Thiruvananthapuram district. Several aspirants, some even from Kollam, turned up for the process as early as 8 a.m. Amid lack of measures to streamline crowds, the attendees jostled each other as they rushed to find seats in the hall as they flouted physical distancing norms. While the venue could barely accommodate 1,500 people, extra chairs were brought in for those who had to stand long hours in the sun outside the hall. In a bid to decongest the area, the university authorities deferred the spot allotment process for BSc courses to the afternoon. However, almost all of those who had come from faraway places chose to stick around. With the situation threatening to go out of hand, the university authorities abruptly brought the process to a halt by noon. The aspirants who managed to obtain allotments by then were provided assurances that their admissions remained intact. Vice Chancellor V.P. Mahadevan Pillai later issued directions to conduct the spot allotments in more number of centres to adhere to the COVID-19 norms. Decision rued Many students rued the university’s decision to conduct spot admissions to affiliated colleges in a centralised manner this year. On the basis of the online admission monitoring committee, the university had decided to replace the previous practice of permitting colleges to conduct admissions following allegations of certain institutions scuttling priority for higher-ranked students during the admission process. This year, the university decided to conduct spot admissions in each of the four districts that came under the jurisdiction of the university.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/ku-throws-covid-precautions-to-the-wind/article33525358.ece

Invested Rs. 40 crore Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, a group of investors who claim to represent 146 people, mostly NoRKs, who had invested Rs. 40 crore for the State’s first build-operate-transfer (BOT) project in the tourism sector levelled allegations against filmmaker and sculptor Rajiv Anchal, the concessionaire who had headed the execution of the project. Vasu Jayaprakash, the executive director of Jatayupara Tourism Private Limited (JTPL), a company formed by the investors, along with other investors Ramesh Babu, Mathew P.J., Varkala Sathyan and Babu Cheruvallil accused Mr. Anchal of colluding with the Ecotourism Director, the nodal officer of the project, for their vested interests. Commercial court “While there is a valid contract between JTPL and Guruchandrika Builders and Private Limited (company owned by Mr. Anchal that had entered into agreement with the government for the project), he has now sought to terminate the contract, despite it being devoid of a termination clause. While the illegal termination was challenged in the Commercial Court, Thiruvananthapuram, the nodal officer had labelled us strangers and hijackers of the project as well as the 65 acres of land allotted by the government for the project,” the group of NoRKs said. Equity shares They also claimed that the court held that the legality of the termination of the agreement has to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal, the contract between the parties will remain intact till then. They added that JTPL had allotted 45% of the equity shares, equivalent to Rs. 30.90 lakh to Mr. Anchal’s company, for signing the operational right agreement, despite the sculptor only making an investment of Rs. 10 lakh for the project. Ticketing system While the Jatayu project has been operational since 2018, the investors alleged that Mr. Anchal has been permitting entry for visitors without any proper ticketing system in a bid to misappropriate funds and deceive the government. “While the government has not intervened in the issue thus far, our plight could deter non-resident Indians (NRIs) from investing in any projects in the State,” they lamented.  ‘While the government has not intervened in the issue so far, our plight can deter non-resident Indians from investing in projects in the State.’||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/nrk-investors-cry-foul-over-jatayu-project/article33525357.ece

Children should not be forced or lured by offering inducements to take part in strikes or agitations, the commission said in an order on Wednesday. Children should not be made to take part in stirs in which they suffer physical or mental distress or their rights are violated. They should not be made to participate or used as shields in protests or agitations by adults, a Division Bench comprising commission members K. Nazeer and B. Babitha said. If there is the possibility of the strike turning violent, children should be removed from the spot immediately, and the police should give necessary directions in this regard. Children should not be included if violence is expected to break out during protests or if the protests are held in areas of strife, the panel said. They should also be kept away from prolonged agitations or where there is the possibility of danger, as also from protests and gatherings that have been declared illegal.  The commission was disposing of a complaint in connection with a class 7 physically challenged student’s education coming to a halt. It was alleged that the child’s guardian made him participate in a protest seeking upgrade of a school near their house. The commission pointed out that while it was laudable to seek the upgrade of the school, the child’s education should not come to a stop because the demand did not materialise. It directed that the child be admitted to a school that was the nearest and his studies be continued.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/children-should-not-be-forced-to-take-part-in-strikes-panel/article33525361.ece

Anantapur MP Talari Rangaiah had worked towards getting a ‘Kisan Rail’ from Anantapur to transport the produce to other places, but it did not work out in late December when the tomato prices were very low both in the district and in the Azad Market in New Delhi where the produce was supposed to the transported. Mr. Rangaiah on Wednesday met Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) Chairman G. Satheesh Reddy to thank him for sending a team of experts to Anantapur for two days last week and studying the requirements of the farmers and understanding the profile of the district when it came horticultural produce. Transport subsidy In October last year, the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MOFPI) sanctioned Rs. 2.9 crore for subsidising 50% of the transport cost of tomatoes and sweet lime, along with other farm produce through the ‘Kisan Rail’. However, concerns were raised as to why the money was not being spent on establishing processing industries for tomato or sweet lime in Anantapur district. A private trust was also established to subsidise train freight for the farmers who are sending their produce by the ‘Kisan Rail’, but finding a solution pertaining to value-addition of produced was the view point of many. Detailed project report “During their two-day interaction with the district horticulture officers, the DFRL team was urged to provide an executable detailed project reports for establishing 1,000-tonne or 5,000-tonne capacity processing units for groundnut, sweet lime and tomatoes at Kadiri, Kalyandurg and Anantapur regions,” Deputy Director Horticulture K.

08 January 2021||Hyderabad,ANDHRA PRADESH||Akhila Priya could have harmed victims: police||Andhra Pradesh’s former minister Bhuma Akhila Priya Reddy was bent upon harming the three Katikaneni brothers, who were allegedly kidnapped by her associates on Tuesday evening, physically or financially, if she was not arrested, Hyderabad police stated in a remand report submitted to a local court. “The accused are high profile political leaders and they can influence the victims and tamper with the evidence, if they are not arrested,” it said. The remand report, a copy of which is with The Hindu , also cited that Akhila Priya’s husband Madhoor Bhargav Ram Naidu, who is currently absconding, was ‘habituated to crime’ and if not arrested he will continue his activities. All other accused, who were actively involved in committing the offence are still at large and if Akhila Priya is not arrested, she will communicate investigation development to them and will not hesitate to carry out physical attacks on the victims’ family, the report read. Earlier to the accused had trespassed into the property of the victims. A senior officer associated with the investigation of the case said that teams were deployed to nab Bhargav Ram, Srinivas Choudhary alias Guntur Srinu and others. “We believe Bhargav Ram did not leave Hyderabad, and is taking shelter at one of his friends' place here, while other people who carried out the kidnapping went back to Andhra Pradesh in two groups,” he said. The officer said that Bhargav was constantly coordinating with the advocates to get his wife out on bail. In 2016, Katikaneni Praveen Rao and one of his six brothers had purchased 25 acres of land near Hafeezpet, which was mediated by Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader AV Subba Reddy with the assistance of the late Bhuma Nagi Reddy, Akhila Priya’s father. “Two years ago, Praveen Rao paid a huge sum to Subba Reddy and settled the issue, but as the market value of that land parcel shot up drastically, both Subba Reddy and Akhila Priya started harassing the victims for their share,” the officer said. ‘Conspiracy hatched’ As Praveen was not willing to give more money or share in the land, the former minister and her husband hatched a conspiracy to threaten them by kidnapping, the officer said. “And as part of their plan, they engaged Guntur Srinu, Sai, Chanti, Prakash and others to carry out the offence.” The investigators also suspect that Akhila Priya conceived the plan to kidnap Praveen Rao and his brothers five months ago, and was waiting for the right time to execute it. As part of the plan, Guntur Srinu recceed the area frequently and was once caught by the Bowenpally police while driving an SUV with a fake number plate. “When questioned, Srinu said he changes the number plates often fearing threat to his life from the rivals of a person with whom he was employed,” the police said. Teams were al sent to Allagadda and other places in Andhra Pradesh to nab the kidnappers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/victims-at-risk-from-ex-minister/article33524863.ece
08 January 2021||K. UmashankerCHITTOOR,ANDHRA PRADESH||Poaching on rise as demand for bushmeat soars in Bengaluru||There has been a considerable spurt in poaching activity involving small game in the forests of Chittoor district, particularly in Palamaner and Piler ranges. Senior forest officials said though the poaching activity was under check, of late the bustle had raised its ugly head and the reason is “high demand for bushmeat in Bengaluru”. Giving credence to the suspicion among the forest officials is the increasing incidence of poachers arranging snares to hunt wild boars and deer. A few days ago, a sloth bear died after being caught in the snare arranged by poachers in the reserve forest near Palamaner. Last week, the Rallabuduguru police in Kuppam circle arrested a man and confiscated a country rifle from him, after he had accidentally shot at a 14-year-old boy, while hunting wild boars. Similarly, on January 4, the forest officials arrested an accused and seized a country rifle and some meat of sambhar at Bhakarapeta in Seshachalam ranges. Small-time poachers are reportedly making a fast buck by supplying bushmeat, preferably of wild boar, rabbit, spotted deer and fowl, to their clients in Bengaluru. Owing to COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for bushmeat, believed to be rich with protein and having medicinal values, has increased. Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor West) S. Ravi Shankar told The Hindu that there was some yet-to-be verified information with the department that there was a very big demand for bushmeat in Bengaluru, “which might have prompted recent spurt in hunting the small game.” The official said it was possible that those involved in poaching might be cashing in on the demand. The DFO said that to put an end to poaching, a special drive had been planned. “We want to cover all the forest fringe villages and the hamlets in the forest enclosures and urge prople to cooperate with the forest department to preserve the flora and fauna. As a first step, we will ask those in possession of illegal firearms to surrender them to the area police and forest officers. Our next step will be to file criminal cases under Wildlife Protection Act,” Mr. Ravi Shankar added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/poaching-on-rise-as-demand-for-bushmeat-soars-in-bengaluru/article33525460.ece

A delegation of farmers urged State Environment Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy to use his good offices with the Centre not to go ahead with enactment of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) (Amendment) Bill, 2020 as livelihood of over 45.7million people depend upon the sector was at stake. The proposed legislation came at a time when the growers were grappling with unseasonal rains and COVID-19 casting its shadow on the market. The bill drafted to curb smoking was ‘draconian’ in nature at a time when the country already had stringent regulations which aided illegal tobacco trade, said Tobacco Board vice-chairman G. Konda Reddy. The proposed legislation aimed at increasing the smokers age from 18 to 21 years, ban sale of free cigarettes, get rid of smoking rooms in airports and eateries and enhance penalties for flouting public smoking guidelines. Voicing their concern over regulatory overreach, Southern Black Soil Farmers’ Welfare Association president Pothula Narasimha Rao said India was now a safe haven for illicit tobacco trade. The country was fourth largest illicit market for cigarettes in the world and the menace went unchecked. Illegal trade The proposed legislation would only aggravate the illicit cigarette trade controlled by unsocial elements. It would adversely affect, among others, farmers and farm workers in the drought-prone district as they grew tobacco, a drought-resistant crop without any viable economic alternative, opined Ongole II Tobacco Farmers’ Welfare Association secretary V.V.Prasad. The Centre should focus on curbing illegal cigarette trade comprising international smuggled and locally manufactured tax-evaded cigarettes which accounted over 25% of domestically manufactured cigarettes, they said. According to an estimate by the tobacco industry, the government lost more than Rs. 15,000 crore per year on account of illegal tobacco trade. Extreme regulations and discriminatory taxation policy would not result in decrease in overall tobacco consumption.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tobacco-growers-express-concern-over-new-draft-bill/article33525462.ece

08 January 2021||TIRUPATI,ANDHRA PRADESH||Suspects picked up in Ramateertham case||The Vizianagaram district police, who are investigating the Ramateertham temple desecration case, have picked up some suspects in the case. The accused allegedly desecrated Lord Sri Rama idol at Ramateertham on December 28, 2020, and the incident came to light the next day. “We took about 10 persons into custody in the temple desecration case. One of the suspect, who allegedly damaged the idol, is an activist of a political party. We are probing deep into the case,” said an investigation officer. Police are trying to find out the exact motive of desecrating the idol in Ramateertham, and who are behind the conspiracy. Director-General of Police (DGP) D. Gautam Sawang said police rounded up the accused in some temple vandalising cases after the incident at Antarvedi Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple on September 5 last year. “We are investigating the temple attack cases in all angles, including political instigation, conspiracy, creating communal disharmony, disturbing law and order, provoking public and other aspects. Investigation officers are verifying whether the accused have criminal or political background earlier or involved in similar cases earlier,” the DGP said. Hacksaw seized In a related development, Additional Director-General of Police (Law and Order) Ravi Shankar Ayyanar said that the police seized a hacksaw from an accused, who made an attempt to enter into a temple in Krishna district. The same weapon was used in an offence at Eluru, he said. “The accused attempted to commit theft in a wine shop in Eluru a few days ago. Again, he tried to cut the iron grill of Kali Matha temple located at Paritala in Krishna district recently. The Kanchikacherla police took the accused into custody and seized the tool. The finger prints of the accused were matched in both cases,” Mr. Ravi Shankar told The Hindu on Thursday. “Police collected the CCTV footages in Rajamahendravaram, Ongole, Krishna and other cases . There are similarities of the modus operandi in some temple attack cases,” the Additional DGP said.  We are probing the temple attack cases from all angles, and investigation officers are verifying whether the accused have criminal or political background D.

Jagan Mohan Reddy in his inaugural address delivered virtually at the 63rd AP State Police Duty Meet here four days ago, Home Minister M. Sucharitha also saw a conspiracy to downplay the achievements of the State. Speaking to the media on the sidelines of the closing ceremony of the meet here on Thursday, Ms. Sucharitha pointed out that every incident in the series of razing of religious structures, or disfiguring of idols, coincided with the launch of a welfare scheme by the government. The Opposition was out to besmirch the YSRCP regime with baseless and concocted narratives. “It is a conspiracy to eclipse the schemes and show the government in poor light. We will definitely hit back by taking stringent action against the culprits,” she said. Criticising the opposition for “unnecessarily” blaming the government, she wondered how a government could function on the basis of faith. “ Our government was formed with the blessings of people of all faiths,” she reiterated. Overall champ Meanwhile, the Anantapur range bagged the ‘Overall Championship’ and received the trophy from the hands of Ms. Sucharitha.

Model EM cities He said the government was focused on transforming the State into a major hub for electric mobility in the country, and that Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Amaravati and Tirupati were declared as model EM cities and hundreds of charging stations were planned to be set across the State. Besides, the government designated special ‘green zones’ with entry only to non-fossil fuel based vehicles. More importantly, it had been targeted to migrate the entire fleet of the APSRTC to electric mobility by the year 2029. The Minister said the Australian entrepreneurs should also look at the opportunities at Krishnapatnam in the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor (CBIC). The other areas in which the Australians could invest were IT, optical products, automobiles, engineering and electrical machinery, pharmaceuticals and food processing. Australian High Commissioner to India Barry O’Farrell and Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly Jessica Shaw, and IACC Director P.

08 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||TDP demands CBI probe into all attacks||The TDP has urged Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan to order a CBI inquiry into the series of attacks on Hindu temples in the State. The TDP team, comprising Polit Bureau member Varla Ramaiah, former MLAs D. Narendra and Sravan Kumar, and MLC Buddha Venkanna, met the Governor here on Thursday and submitted a memorandum to him in this regard. “There have been consistent violations of fundamental rights in the State ever since the YSRCP came to power. There is a need to ensure religious harmony by respecting religious sentiments of all the people,” the party said in the memorandum. The attacks on Hindu temples were antithetical to the secular fabric and harmonious social life in the State, the TDP said. “Never in the history of Andhra Pradesh have such attacks taken place,” it added. ‘Hidden agenda’ In spite of the unprecedented attacks on temples, the government appeared to be pursuing a sinister design with a hidden agenda and continued to remain complacent, the TDP leaders alleged. The TDP leaders told the Governor that not a single person was arrested so far though attacks had taken place in over 145 temples. The CBI should probe all instances of attacks on temples and in the past 19 months, they said. The TDP further alleged that the government was acting with revenge and filing false cases against the leaders questioning it on the issue. “It is only with the support of the ruling party that these atrocities are continuing in State,” they alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tdp-demands-cbi-probe-into-all-attacks/article33524859.ece

In a statement, Justice Kanta Rao said many colleges in this category lacked proper standards while conditions in some of the colleges were dismal. He said last month, the Commission had directed 354 D. Ed. colleges to submit documents for assessment, but only 99 of them carried out the instruction. After a through scrutiny of the documents, the Commission came to a conclusion that barring only a few, other colleges did not maintain even minimum standards.  Show-cause notices The managements of 11 colleges had volunteered to close down, while the Commission was recommending closure of another 18 colleges.  He said the colleges that did not attend for the scrutiny were being served with show cause notices and if they did not respond, the Commission would recommend to the government to cancel their recognition. Justice Kanta Rao said the future of the society depended on today’s students and if the teachers who were responsible for grooming them into responsible citizens fell short of adequate standards, it was a matter of grave concern. He said the Commission members would soon visit the colleges that were found to be below the expected standards, and warned that those found to be resorting to irregularities would not be spared.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/education-regulatory-panel-cracks-whip-on-d-ed-colleges/article33524940.ece

08 January 2021||VIJAYAWADA,ANDHRA PRADESH||No coercive action against suspended IPS officer: HC||The single-judge Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, comprising Justice K. Lalitha Kumari, has directed the police that no coercive steps be taken against IPS officer A.B. Venkateswara Rao, who is accused of committing irregularities in the procurement of surveillance equipment when he was Additional DGP (intelligence). The court posted the case for next hearing to January 18 even as Advocate-General S. Sriram pleaded on Thursday that the petitioner’s apprehension (of arrest), which led to the filing of an anticipatory bail plea in the High Court (on January 3), was not bona fide, and his approach to the court based on some “entitlement mindset” was unreasonable. “It is an extraordinary course for the court to stay, or grant protection, even when no proceedings are initiated. The petitioner has not demonstrated any such circumstances in the present petition,” Mr. Sriram argued, insisting that the case was open for the State to launch prosecution and there was material for it. Mr. Venkateswara Rao’s counsel maintained that his apprehension was reasonable because of the State’s action in placing him under suspension from May 31, 2019, and issuance of a charge sheet recently. In his bail petition, Mr. Venkateswara Rao stated that an FIR containing accusations having penal provisions of a sentence beyond seven years was prepared in consultation with “legal minds” and that he could be arrested either on the evening before a holiday, or weekend, and produced before a magistrate / special judge for remand in order to deny legal assistance. All this to keep him in judicial custody for 48 hours to make out a fresh ground for suspension order, he alleged.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/no-coercive-action-against-suspended-ips-officer-hc/article33525451.ece

A Division Bench of the High Court comprising Justices Rakesh Kumar and D. Ramesh also directed Mr. Pravin Kumar to show cause why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him for committing an act of perjury, in six weeks. The government’s plea that Justice Rakesh Kumar should recuse on the ground that he prejudged the case without a hearing, was rejected. The crux of the original petition, which Guntur-based social worker Thota Suresh Babu had filed, is that the proposed sale of government lands in Guntur and Visakhapatnam was illegal. Referring to the allegation that he was biased, Justice Rakesh Kumar, who retired on December 31, had made certain scathing comments on the government and various cases pending against Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. These observations by Justice Rakesh Kumar and the order to initiate criminal prosecution against the Mission Director prompted the government to file the SLP.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/govt-files-slp-in-sc-in-mission-build-ap-case/article33525449.ece

Under identical circumstances, the Telangana High Court had directed the power utilities of that State to give weightage marks to the persons who had worked on contract basis, he contended. Mr. Kasaiah further alleged that the vacancies were sought to be filled as per the recommendations of the people’s representatives, which was not in conformity to the service guidelines and against law.

COVID impact The COVID-19 pandemic sent shock waves across the globe and the talk on social media the the virus might spread through chicken created panic among consumers. The poultry industry suffered badly with consumers stopping consumption of chicken and eggs even when it was sold at a fraction of the actual cost. Some poultry traders in the city even sold chicken at Rs. 60 a kg and a few even offered it free to drive away apprehensions among the public. The poultry industry bounced back in a short time with doctors and health experts advising consumers to eat chicken and eggs to boost their immunity to fight COVID-19. The sales picked up and within a short time long queues were witnessed at chicken stalls all over the city. Now, the latest news is once again causing concern among consumers. “There is no immediate threat due to the consumption of chicken as the virus has not been reported from anywhere in Andhra Pradesh or Telangana. The H1N8 virus strain spreads from wild birds. Our personnel are conducting surveillance and the poultry farmers have been asked to disinfect the farms to check the possible spread of the virus through wild birds,” Joint Director of Animal Husbandry D. Ramakrishna told The Hindu on Thursday. Teams formed “In all, 43 teams have been formed for surveillance all over the district. As and when the death of a bird is reported, our team members will send it for testing and, if the bird flu virus was found, all the fowls in the nearby areas will be culled to prevent spread of the virus,” he says. Chances remote “There is no evidence of transmission of the bird flu virus to humans through chicken consumption. Indian cooking is normally done at 100 degree C and the question of survival of the virus can be ruled out,” said Bharanikana Rama Rao, national executive member of the National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC). Disinfected “Our poultries are already being disinfected on a regular basis in view of the COVID-19 protocols. About 25 lakh eggs and an estimated 180 tons of chicken, a day, are being consumed in the three districts of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram, and Srikakulam,” said Tummala Uday Bhaskar Rao, NECC Vizag zone chairman.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bird-flu-threat-grips-poultry-industry/article33525266.ece

The ITDA has set a deadline till Ugadi and has planned to curb plastic usage in Agency mandals and is also mulling to take stringent steps including imposing a fine on tourists for using plastic. Very recently, a meet was conducted at Lambasingi to elicit the opinion of tribals, people involved in tourism sector, hotels, restaurants, and volunteers over the issue of plastic pollution due to an increase in tourism. During the meet, ITDA officials and Paderu MLA K. Bhagya Lakshmi expressed concern over the increase in plastic pollution in Agency mandals. Officials have also decided to take up stringent measures to protect the environment immediately. “We have taken two to three decisions in our first meet. Our first plan is to mitigate use of plastic such as water sachets, polythene bags in shops, weekly shandies, commercial establishments by Ugadi this year in all the 11 mandals of the Agency. Water sachets and polythene bags alone contribute 60-70% of the plastic here,” said ITDA Project Officer S. Venkateswar, speaking to The Hindu . He said that in the meantime, the government would coordinate with Self-Help Groups (SHGs) to come out with cloth bags as alternatives for plastic, which would benefit them financially and also help in protecting the environment. All the shops and establishments should also compulsorily have dust bins. “Solid waste management is a big challenge and we are keen on implementing it properly. We will carry this forward step by step. The government will purchase plastic shredders and plastic segregators for disposal of waste soon,” he said. The Project Officer also said that gram panchayat officials were also asked to impose fines on tourists dumping waste and using plastic soon apart from commercial establishments. Steps are also being taken to ensure good hygiene in the tourist places. He said that they are also asking agencies running tent accommodations in Lambasingi and other parts of the Agency to take permission from the government and ensure basic facilities without neglecting sanitation by setting up mobile toilets. “The meeting was our first step towards addressing this issue. A series of meetings would be conducted in the coming days to come up with an action plan and also create awareness over the issue,” he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/itda-to-curb-plastic-usage-in-11-agency-mandals-by-ugadi/article33525498.ece

Madhav, in Vizianagaram district while they were on their way to visit the Lord Rama temple at Ramateerthan on Thursday, former party MLA P. Vishnu Kumar Raju said it was undemocratic, and demanded that the Chief Minster step down owning moral responsibility. Mr. Raju, who was put under preventive custody at his house in the city, said the leaders were going to the temple to find out what actually happened in view of the sentiments of the Hindus. Miscreants had vandalised the 400-year-old idol of Lord Rama at the temple about 10 days ago, following which Ramateertham made headlines with leaders of various parties trying to visit the temple. Mr. Raju questioned why the government was not allowing only the leaders and workers of the BJP and the JSP to the temple. YSRCP Rajya Sabha member V. Vijaya Sai Reddy made an unscheduled visit to the temple hours before Leader of the Opposition and TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu’s visit on Saturday last. “The BJP and the JSP respect every faith and religion. We are not here to create unrest. Our request seeking permission from the RDO and the District collector has not been accepted,” Mr. Raju said. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had visited Ramateertham one day after the incident and had not spoken a single word on it later. “Now, he has constituted a CID inquiry, which is nothing but a farce,” he said. ‘Huge scam’ Referring to the patta distribution programme, Mr. Raju said it was a huge scam as lands were purchased after jacking up their prices abnormally.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/cm-should-step-down-says-ex-bjp-mla/article33525454.ece

Addressing a press conference at Police Kalyanamandapam here on Thursday, members of city police association G. Somasekhar, Ch. Venkat Rao and M. Subhakar said that the police department comprises people from various religious faiths and is a secular force. ‘We live by our oath’ “While joining duties, we take an oath that we will serve the public irrespective of religion, caste and creed and we stick to that oath,” they said. The members also alleged that they were surprised to see political leaders trying to taint the police force with religious colours for their political mileage. “In Visakhapatnam, during Ayudha Pooja, police personnel from Hindu, Muslim and Christian backgrounds celebrate on a grand note. Similarly, a number of Hindus and Muslims take part in Christmas celebrations. We also take part in Iftars organised as part of Ramzan,” they said.

Narasimha Rao, MLC P.V.N. Madhav, and senior leader P. Sanyasi Raju were arrested at different places and prevented from taking out their proposed ‘Ramateertha Yatra’. The police foiled the yatra at the Ramateertham junction, located about 12 km from the district headquarters. GVL alleges bias Annoyed at the forcible arrests, Mr. Narasimha Rao spoke to Mr. Amit Shah and sought his intervention. He also sought an inquiry into the denial of permission by the police only to the BJP, while the leaders of the YSRCP and the TDP had been allowed to visit the temple soon after the incident. There was high drama right from the early hours of the day with many leaders and activists arriving from Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam districts in spite of heavy deployment of police forces and barricading on the inter-district borders. ‘Rude behaviour’ A few of the leaders and activists had reached Ramateertham on Wednesday night itself. The yatra is aimed at exposing the government’s “failure” in tracing the culprits who had desecrated the idol at the historic temple believed to have been constructed in the 16th century. In their attempt to prevent the arrest of Mr. Veerraju, senior party leaders such as former MLA Gadde Babu Rao, N. Eswara Rao, and T. Harinath stood around him. Mr. Veerraju too resisted his arrest and deplored what he called the rude behaviour of the police. The police later shifted the leaders to a private guest house and released them at around 5 p.m. Earlier, Visakhapatnam Range Deputy Inspector General L.K.V. Ranga Rao and Vizianagaram Superintendent of Police B. Rajakumari made it clear that no procession would be allowed in the district since Section 30 was in force. They said that it would be in force till further orders to ensure peace and law and order. Meanwhile, the CID team that is continuing its investigation into the issue is hopeful of nabbing the culprits soon. Officials of the Endowments Department visited the temple to study the steps to be taken to beef up security and undertake developmental activities there.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/bjp-ups-the-ante-seeks-amit-shahs-intervention-in-ramateertham-row/article33525446.ece

According to officials, the district received 2,062 mm of precipitation in the last two days when compared to the monthly average of 516 mm. “The rains, though untimely, have been very advantageous to the ongoing rabi operations. Thanks to the remarkable recharge of groundwater and storage in several tanks and reservoirs due to the months-long rain, paddy cultivation in Chittoor, considered a rain-shadow district, is all set to get a tremendous boost this rabi season,” Joint Director (Agriculture) N. Vijay Kumar. With availability of water, the paddy acreage is expected to go up this rabi season. “Paddy acreage in the district is likely to cross the 60,000-hectare mark when compared to the expected 45,000 hectares. The January rains will add strength to the soil and moisture conditions,” explained Mr. Vijay Kumar. Ailaiah, a farmer of Vedam village near Srikalahasti, said that he had suffered damage to paddy crops in 2015 and 2016 due to rain in November and December. “But the rain this time will help the crops. I am looking forward to a good cropping season this time after a gap of five years,” said Mr. Ailaiah. The officials are hopeful that the rain would help groundnut, sugarcane and intercrops.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/january-rains-bring-cheer-to-farmers-in-chittoor-district/article33525439.ece

08 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||State successfully implements urban local body reform||The State has secured approval to mobilise additional financial resources to the tune of Rs. 2,508 crore through open market borrowings. The Department of Expenditure of the Union Finance Ministry accorded approval after the State successfully implemented the urban local body reform as stipulated by the Centre. The reforms included notification of floor rates of property tax in the ULBs in consonance with the prevailing circle rates as also notify floor rates of user charges in respect of the provision of water supply, drainage and sewerage reflecting current costs/past inflation. In addition, the State had agreed to put in place a system of periodic increase in floor rates of property tax/user charges in line with price increases. Third State By implementing the reforms, Telangana became the third State after Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to implement the urban local body reform. In the process, the State had become eligible for additional borrowing of Rs. 7,406 crore. The Central government, in May last year, enhanced the borrowing limit of the States by 2% of their Gross State Domestic Product. Half of the special dispensation was linked to undertaking reforms in four key areas. These are implementation of one nation one ration card, ease of doing business (EODB), urban local bodies reforms and power sector reforms. The State was the first in implementing one nation one ration card system while it competes with neighbouring AP and Uttar Pradesh in EODB parameters. It has now joined the ranks of AP and MP in ULB reforms. Pvt. sector privatisation Doubts however persist on the implementation of the reform suggested in the power sector as it would entail privatisation of the distribution companies. The State voiced its concern over the proposed reforms as it would have an adverse impact on the agriculture sector for which the government is providing power free of cost on 24x7 basis. Implementation of the last reform would enable the State to get permission for mobilising another Rs. 2,500 crore (0.25% of GSDP) through open market borrowings, but it would depend on whether the State opts for reforms in the power sector as suggested by the Centre in the coming days. According to the Union Finance Ministry, 10 States implemented one nation one ration card so far and seven put in place EODB norms. The total additional borrowing permission issued to these States which implemented reforms was Rs. 54,190 crore.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/state-successfully-implements-urban-local-body-reform/article33525253.ece
08 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Bengaluru shows the way to city on rail link to airport||During pandemic times, Bengaluru has done something unusual. It has provided a land rail link to Kempe Gowda International Airport through an airport station, four kilometres away. For Rs. 10-15, the airport can be reached within an hour travelling in an eight coach train with capacity to carry 2,000 passengers in contrast to paying Rs. 1,000 or more for a cab. This can be done here too with minimum expenditure, if powers that be give a decisive push. South Central Railway (SCR) is scheduled to complete doubling and electrification on the 13 km stretch between Falaknuma and Umdanagar before summer, when it will be possible to run MMTS suburban trains up to Umdanagar, six km from the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) at Shamshabad. Bengaluru airport authorities have funded sprucing up of the airport railway station with flight display boards, seating, cafeteria, toilets, amenities for the disabled, and are running free shuttle services to reach the airport in 20 minutes. The facilities right now near Umdanagar here are minimal and railways may not want to deck it up on its own. Fund issue There is also an unresolved funds share issue between SCR and the government - the latter owes up to Rs. 500 crore as part of pact to share 2/3rds cost of MMTS Phase II project. GMR group running the RGIA airport too has been rooting for a metro rail link from the beginning to provide a more plush service. “We were offered an airport rail station 2-3 km away from the terminal when we wanted closer to the terminal so that passengers need not take another shuttle,” informed senior railway officials, seeking anonymity. Incidentally, in the proposed new Airport Metro to be executed by Hyderabad Airport Metro Limited (HAML), an underground station near the terminal is planned with 2.5 km to be built below the ground from the cargo station inside. Rest of the 32 km airport metro is to be built on elevated piers, save for one km on ground, from Raidurg/Gachibowli via Outer Ring Road (ORR) to RGIA. It costs upwards of Rs. 9,000 crore at Rs. 300 crore per km with GMR group investing Rs. 500 crore, but senior government officials are unsure whether the project will be taken up soon due to the cost involved. Phase one of Metro Rail can also be extended to 5 km to MGBS-Falaknuma from where it is about 16 km to RGIA. However, this route is to be taken up much later as the government thinks traffic movement is higher from Gachibowli to the international airport in city. With Metro not happening, land rail appears to be best bet as it costs just Rs. 12 crore per km. “It can be a win win situation as land rail public transport systems are cheaper, can carry more people and are eco-friendly,” pointed out senior railway officials.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/bengaluru-shows-the-way-to-city-on-rail-link-to-airport/article33525231.ece
08 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||‘TRS leaders have lost faith in KCR’||TRS Ministers and MLAs have lost faith in their leader and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and are ready to leave the party in droves, alleged Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Thursday. “Ever since Mr. Rao has returned from Delhi, he has been confined to the farmhouse and now we hear he is undergoing some tests. We wish him well as we are not like the TRS,” he said, participating in a public meeting at Dichpally in the presence of national general secretary Tarun Chugh, fellow Nizamabad MP D. Aravind and other leaders. Mr. Rao has been trying to keep his flock together stating that TRS and BJP are on the same page. “Who would like to join him, there is no need for any alliance. Our line is clear and we are going to hoist saffron flag on the Golconda Fort after the 2023 Assembly elections. This is not for our party sake but saving Telangana and for a new beginning,” he claimed. ‘Minority appeasement’ The BJP president accused the TRS government of 'minority appeasement' and said efforts to divide people into various caste groups and communities by the ruling party will not bear fruit. "We can also bring the majority community together and show our strength," he said. The BJP leaders and workers will not rest till a person from within takes charge of Telangana to work for the poor and genuine development of the State in all aspects, said national general secretary Tarun Chugh. The 'victory' march had begun during the last parliamentary polls and it will be on relentlessly till the next Assembly elections when one of the party workers will be in the Chief Minister's chair, he said. "The rajababu is having issues because he is aware his throne is shaking. He has forgotten the sacrifices of the youth for the cause of separate Telangana," he charged. Majlis leader Owaisi's "divisive" politics will not work in the country and he should first explain why he is opposing mentioning details of the family's name in the proposed Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The party would welcome anyone having a strong affinity to the Telangana soil and with nationalistic credentials, he maintained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/trs-cadre-have-no-faith-in-kcr/article33525252.ece

Jana Reddy will be the party’s candidate from Nagarjunasagar Assembly constituency for which the byelections would be held soon. AICC in-charge for Telangana, Manickam Tagore announced that Mr. Jana Reddy will be the party’s candidate in the bypoll and to facilitate smooth functioning of the party in the elections the selection of Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) has been postponed. He said Mr. Jana Reddy has requested the party to postpone the new PCC president decision till the bypoll was completed and AICC president Sonia Gandhi has agreed to it. So decisions on the PCC chief and other committees will be taken only after the bypoll, which is likely to be held in February or March. Mr. Jana Reddy’s name as the party’s candidate was a forgone conclusion though there were talks of his son Raghuvir making his entry into electoral politics. Party seniors, however, were in strong favour of Mr. Jana Reddy himself contesting as the party would have the edge right from the word go. He lost in the 2018 elections by a narrow margin to TRS candidate Nomula Narsimaiah, who passed away recently due to some health issues. There were rumours of TRS planning to woo Mr. Jana Reddy and also the BJP, but they were refuted at various levels with Mr. Reddy sending a message that he had no intention to leave Congress at the fag end of his political career.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/jana-reddy-to-contest-nagarjunasagar-bypoll/article33525263.ece
08 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||Toxic COVID waste burnt, mixed with trash||Medical as well as sanitary workers in the city are being put in harm’s way as COVID biological waste is being burnt, tossed in garbage and mixed with regular trash. “We burn the PPE kits everyday. They are used by the staff who do COVID-19 tests. We collect them, pack them in a box and burn them,” said a health worker at the Golconda Area Hospital. Four cardboard boxes filled with PPEs were still burning when this reporter visited the site. Behind the COVID-19 testing centre in the hospital, the biological waste of test kits and discarded gloves are also burnt on a daily basis. Elsewhere in the city, in some of the Primary Health Centres, the CBW is thrown with regular trash into garbage bins. “We don’t know when they will come to collect it, so we drop it at this garbage bin as we have to carry on our work everyday,” said a healthcare worker at a PHC in Malakpet area who has to cross the road with the yellow bags to reach the overfilled garbage bin. Hyderabad has 97 government facilities where on an average 60 to 200 tests are performed everyday. This number doesn’t include centres in private domain or where RT-PCR tests are conducted. The Central Pollution Control Board guidelines for waste from test centres and labs are the same as that of isolation wards and they should be collected in red bags. This localised waste disposal is in sharp contrast to the strict norms laid out by CPCB, which is followed by Ramky Enviro (REEL) tasked with disposing of the CBW in Hyderabad. “COVID biological waste gets priority over everything else. We dispose of it immediately in static or rotary incinerators at temperatures ranging from 850 degree to 1,050 degree Celsius. The flu gas is also monitored on a continual basis,” said Masood Mallick of Ramky Enviro. Asked about slippages in collection, he said, “We have a specialised staff who have volunteered and have been incentivised for the task. From the point of pick up to transport, treatment and disposal, everything is tracked on a continuous basis.” The PCB has rolled out an Android App called COVID19BWM which helps track the movement of the waste from labs, quarantine centres and hospitals. Telangana processed 68.82 tonnes of COVID biological waste (CBW) in December, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board. Comparatively, Chandigarh, which has a population of 11 lakh, treated 73.19 tonnes of CBW. From a peak of 188.82 tonnes in September, this sharp dip in the quantity of biological waste shows either how the impact of the pandemic is on the wane or the slippages in CBW have increased.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/toxic-covid-waste-burnt-mixed-with-trash/article33525235.ece
08 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Beggar rehabilitation to fore again||Beggar rehabilitation is once again to the fore in the GHMC’s list of activities, following the city’s inclusion for the pilot project by the Central government for comprehensive rehabilitation of persons engaged in begging. Hyderabad is among the 10 cities chosen for implementation of the pilot by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, alongside Patna, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Delhi, Kolkata, Lucknow, Indore and Nagpur. GHMC had submitted proposals and action plan for Rs. 4 crore, and was sanctioned Rs. 2 crore for the project, as far back as March last year. Of the balance, 40% was to be released on submission of execution report of the programme as mentioned in the city action plan, and 10% upon submission and acceptance of project completion report. On the ground, however, there is no trace of any measure in that direction even after 10 months have elapsed, as the COVID-19 lockdown and October floods happened in quick succession followed by elections to GHMC Council. In view of an online review meeting with the ministry scheduled for January 13, GHMC commissioner D.S.Lokesh Kumar on Wednesday issued express directions to field level officials asking them to focus on beggar rehabilitation. Accordingly a survey needs to be conducted to identify the persons involved in begging, before they are shifted to rescue homes. Skill development training should be organised for them to ensure integration into mainstream society and a life with dignity and self-confidence. The circular has asked all the zonal and deputy commissioners to convene regular meetings of the circle level and zonal level task force committees, and identify persons involved in begging. Suitable buildings should be identified for being designated as rescue homes—at least one in each zone with basic facilities and infrastructure. As per the guidelines, each shelter home should provide for at least 50 to 100 persons. Living arrangements should be separate for males, females, children and transgender persons. The rescued persons should be provided hygienic facilities, food, clothing, bedding, medical facilities, counselling and education, through involvement of NGOs which have been working in the field. Aadhaar registration is to be done along with opening of bank accounts. In case of children, they should be mainstreamed into education, and after school tuitions need to be provided. Skill development programmes should be conducted for able-bodied adults, before mapping them to appropriate jobs/professions such as security guards, domestic hleps and vegetable vendors. Linkages with homes for the aged should be established for the old and decrepit, while physically/mentally disabled persons should be provided required welfare measures and assistance.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/beggar-rehabilitation-to-fore-again/article33525243.ece

08 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Protest against higher retirement age||The Telangana Unemployed Joint Action Committee has demanded that the State government drop its plans to increase the retirement age of its staff from the existing 58 years to 61 years stating that such a step would force the unemployed youth into frustration further. A protest was held at Indira Park here on Thursday decrying the recent announcement by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao that the government would increase the retirement age of the employees soon, as promised before the last Assembly elections. Several backward classes associations and Communist Party of India (CPI) expressed solidarity with the protest. Chairman of the Unemployed JAC N. Venkatesh demanded that the government give postings to candidates selected for the posts of Principal of residential schools and colleges, physical education teacher posts through tests conducted by the Public Service Commission. He also demanded filling of 2.5 lakh vacancies in various departments. Speaking at the protest, National BC Welfare Association president R. Krishnaiah said the government plan to increase the retirement age from 58 years to 61 years would sound the death knell of lakhs of qualified unemployed youths waiting for the recruitment process to be taken up by the government. The increase in retirement age would mean there would be no retirements and no new jobs for the next three years. Stating that there were about 3.5 lakh employees in 63 departments and organisations of the State government, Mr. Krishnaiah said 90% of the employees were not interested in the retirement age increase. Instead, they were more concerned about the pay revision, the contributory pension scheme, pay hike, implementation of interim relief and others. He suggested that the government instil confidence among employees by addressing their genuine problems and taking up recruitment for filling all vacancies. Increase in the retirement age would lead to further increase in the unemployment in the State since there had been no major recruitment drive for the last seven years, except for in one or two departments, Mr. Krishnaiah said. “KCR said he would give a job to every household and unemployment allowance to the unemployed youth. But, the fact remains that even one job for every village is not given”, Mr. Krishnaiah said and cautioned the government against the retirement age increase or else they would be forced to take up movement on the lines of the one taken up for statehood to Telangana.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/protest-against-move-to-increase-retirement-age/article33525239.ece
08 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||Poor fire safety at Gandhi exposed||The minor fire at Gandhi Hospital on Wednesday night points to, again, dysfunctional fire safety equipment there. Hose reels and fire extinguishers are either missing or damaged. Officials from the hospital said that they have submitted proposals to replace the equipment. However, such proposals were tabled many times in the past but the there is no result. On Wednesday night, a minor fire broke out in linen room on third floor of the main building. The origin of the fire was electrical. It was extinguished before it spread to other rooms. Such accidents occurred in many parts of the hospital in the past. On any given day, thousands of patients, attendants, doctors, nurses, staff and others will be at the hospital, which calls for functional fire safety equipment. While hose boxes are intact, fire hoses which are missing are not replaced. Hose reels are damaged, and required number of fire extinguisher cylinders are not available. The situation is the same on the third floor where the minor fire occurred on Wednesday night. Hospital superintendent M Raja Rao said that he had submitted proposals to re-install the measures which costs around Rs. 2.5 crore. Besides the measures, a proposed fire station at the hospital did not materialize yet. In the beginning of 2020, officials of the State Health department and Telangana State Disaster Response and Fire Services department said that fire stations would start functioning at the tertiary care centre in a few weeks. Works in this direction were apace. However, it came to a halt owing to COVID-19 pandemic. Officials of the Fire Services department said that only minor works were pending.

08 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||HC refuses to give protection to Sukesh Gupta from ED arrest||Businessman Sukesh Gupta and two others on Thursday withdrew the writ petitions they had filed in Telangana High Court seeking protection from arrest by Enforcement Directorate authorities. They withdrew the petitions after a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao declined to pass interim directions protecting them from arrest by the ED. Additional Solicitor General Suryakaran Reddy, appearing for ED, told the bench that Mumbai police issued a First Information Report (FIR) against Sukesh Gupta and others following a complaint lodged by Mumbai-based Neeharika Infrastructure company. Based on the content of the FIR, the ED registered a case. Sukesh Gupta and others were accused of duping Neeharika company and another J&K-based company known as Iris Hospitality by selling them King Kothi Palace belonging to Nizam era for a consideration of Rs. 48 crore. They were charged with using fabricated documents and back-dated sale deeds, ED counsel Anjali Agarwal said. Supreme Court senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi representing Sukesh Gupta said that the ED filed a case in Hyderabad based on a case registered by the police in Mumbai. Referring to the allegations of sale of the palace, the senior counsel contended that it was a dispute between two private parties. ED authorities’ probe was not required in the matter since there was no loss of public money. However, the bench led by the Chief Justice Hima Kohli declined to issue any order protecting the businessman from arrest by the ED. The Additional Solicitor General told the bench that ED would transfer the case to Mumbai unit.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/hc-refuses-to-give-protection-to-sukesh-gupta-from-ed-arrest/article33525268.ece

08 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||CBG project based on poultry litter set up||A 2.4 tonnes per day capacity compressed biogas project based on poultry litter has been set up in Udityal village near Balanagar here. Claimed to be the first such in Telangana, the project of Solika Energy will supply compressed biogas, in cylinders, to an Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) outlet in Attapur. Commercial sale at the outlet is expected to begin next month. The CBG plant was formally opened in the last week of December by Executive Director and State Head of IOC for Telangana and AP RSS Rao along with International Egg Commission Chairman and Srinivasa Farms Group Managing Director Suresh Chitturi, a release on Thursday said. The CBG project exclusively uses poultry litter as raw material and is located next to a large commercial poultry farm with over 4.5 lakh birds. All the raw material from the poultry sheds will be collected to generate biogas. In addition to CBG, the plant will also generate around 15 tonnes of organic manure as a by product daily. Solika Energy has developed the project under the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) scheme of the Union Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. A company backed by Srinivasa Hatcheries and XEMX Projects, Solika Energy is in the process of setting up a second CBG project in Telangana. It will come up in Kandukur, a village on the way to Srisailam from Hyderabad, and have a CBG production capacity of 3 tonnes per day. Mr. Chitturi said that Solika has developed a unique process of ammonia reduction which results in sustained reuse of water making the biogas plant zero liquid discharge. The process removes and reduces all impurities like feathers, stones, and sand. Solika plans to provide the organic manure to the local farming communities, he said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/cbg-project-based-on-poultry-litter-set-up/article33525229.ece

08 January 2021||HYDERABAD,TELANGANA||NAFSCOB chief welcomes Banking Amendment Bill||The National Federation of State Cooperative Banks (NAFSCOB) has welcomed the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act which is set to come into force from the next financial year, April 1, claiming that it was aimed at providing good governance by checking leakages and misappropriation of funds. NAFSCOB chairman Konduru Ravinder said the proposed amendment envisaged bringing the cooperative banks under the regulatory framework of the Reserve Bank of India for protecting the interests of the depositors. The Central government should, however, take steps to ensure that the spirit and principles of the cooperative movement that was serving the rural economy for over a century was not sacrificed. Mr. Ravinder was delivering the inaugural address of the two-day national review meeting and national conclave of rural cooperative banks at the Bankers’ Institute of Rural Development in Lucknow on Thursday. He said the government should protect the principles of the cooperative banks and it should set up a committee for evolving adequate measures to preserve the cooperative movement. Citing the strong cooperative movement in Germany, he said there was need for adopting some of the best practices followed there and these should be incorporated into the Banking Amendment Bill. The Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies were pillars of the cooperative movement in the country and the Federation in association with NABARD was playing a major role in their strengthening and making them more vibrant. In this context, he quoted the successful functioning of the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies in Telangana and said the government had successfully utilised the PACS network for procurement of farmers’ produce at their doorsteps even during the pandemic time. The PACS enabled procurement from farmers and ensured payment at their doorstep. NABARD chairman G.R. Chintala exhorted the other States to emulate the Telangana model in general and Karimnagar in particular for strengthening and ensuring successful functioning of the PACS.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/nafscob-chairman-welcomes-banking-amendment-bill/article33525260.ece

08 January 2021||Hyderabad,TELANGANA||KTR writes to Centre for reinstating ITIR in Hyd.||Minister for Information Technology and Industry K. Taraka Rama Rao has urged the Centre to reinstate the Information Technology Investment Region (ITIR) project sanctioned in 2010 for Hyderabad, which never took off despite repeated requests and correspondence. In a letter to Union IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad here on Thursday, he reminded that as per the requirement of the project guidelines 49,000 acres of land in three clusters (both brownfield and greenfield) were identified in Hyderabad where new IT companies and IT space developers could be encouraged to set up their development centres. The scheme had a provision for the Government of India to pitch in with gap funding for the required trunk infrastructure from its existing schemes. Accordingly, a shelf of five projects with a total outlay of Rs. 3275 crore were identified for the Hyderabad ITIR. The Government of India accorded its approval to the proposals submitted, and also agreed to support the infrastructure proposals in two phases — 2 projects in phase I with an outlay of Rs. 165 crore and the remaining three projects in phase II with an outlay of Rs. 3110 crore. Moreover, the entire project was also given a definite timeline, with the expected date of completion of phase 1 projects by 2018 and the remaining projects within 20 years thereafter. Regarding the first two projects approved in phase 1, the State government and Government of India were engaged in correspondence with the Ministry of Railways and Ministry of Road Transport for sanctioning additional budgets to take up these two projects. However, none of the Union Ministries responded favourably to these proposals and the two projects remained non-starters, he said. Mr. Taraka Rama Rao said both Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and he had written several letters and submitted memorandums about ITIR project to the Union government during the past six years. However, there was no response whatsoever from the Union government on this important initiative. Telangana leads Despite this Telangana, due to its own efforts, was able to double the value of IT exports from Hyderabad from Rs. 57,258 crore in 2013-14 to Rs. 1,28,807 crore in 2019-20. “This translates into a cumulative growth rate of 110%, which is much higher than the national average. In the same period, our IT sector employment also grew from 3,25,000 to 5,82,126,” he added.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/ktr-writes-to-centre-for-reinstating-itir/article33525255.ece

Chandrasekhar Rao of taking a complete opposite view on the new farm laws after his New Delhi visit and it reflects how hollow his love for the farmers was. At a press conference here, he demanded an explanation from Chief Minister on the reversal of his stand after supporting the Bharat Bandh and actively participating in it against the farm bills. He did not even visit the farmers in New Delhi protesting against the new bills. He was critical of the Central government before his New Delhi visit but took a complete reversal after that and people have a right to know the reason for his sudden change, he said. Mr. Bhatti also took exception to Mr. Rao’s statement that the State government suffered loss of Rs. 7,500 crore after purchasing paddy from farmers. He said it is the responsibility of the government to ensure farmers get support from the government and demanded that all the crops be bought by the government at the Minimum Support Price (MSP).

08 January 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Ryots transport sugarcane to other mills||The fate of sugarcane farmers in Zaheerabad area is back to square one despite intervention by Finance Minister T. Harish Rao, Collector M. Hanumantha Rao and officials of the Sugarcane Department. Trident Sugars, which has been running a sugar mill on the outskirts of the Zaheerabad town, has to pay arrears of about Rs. 12.69 crore to the farmers. With the dues pending for years it has become an herculean task for the small and marginal farmers to meet family expenditure. Being in the midst of corona pandemic it has become difficult for the farmer to even get hand loans as everyone is facing similar problems. Mr. Harish Rao held a series of meetings with the representatives of the management of Trident Sugars to address the issue and has given them an opportunity to clear the dues five or six times. The management reportedly failed to keep even the written commitment given to the officials. The issue has not yet been addressed and is presently before the High Court. Meanwhile, in the current season the farmers have grown sugarcane in about 15,000 acres. As the Trident Sugars failed to start crushing the farmers have chosen to move their produce to other places. The sugarcane is being transported to more than 10 factories, including that in Sangareddy, Kamareddy and Nizamsagar in the State and Bidar in Karnataka and some other mills in Maharashtra. Many farmers have sold their produce to agents who will pay a little lower than the market rate. “The agents offer between Rs. 2,150 to Rs. 2,300 per tonne whereas at the mill the farmer can get about Rs. 2,400 per tonne. Here the farmer get relieved from the burden of transporting the crop to the mill. Hence, the farmers have preferred to sell the produce to agents,” said a farmer, who is involved in the farmers getting their arrears from Trident Sugars. Meanwhile, it is reported that Trident Sugars has released Rs. 28.1 lakh as part of arrears payment to the farmers.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/farmers-forced-to-transport-sugarcane-to-other-mills/article33525269.ece
08 January 2021||SANGAREDDY,TELANGANA||Two orphaned boys at mercy of a family||Mayur is about 10 years old and his brother Naresh is about nine years old. They have another younger brother who is not with them now. Both of them are residents of Enkepally village in Sadashivpet mandal. Their mother Shyamala passed away about two years ago. After sometime, their father Prakasham left the village along with the youngest child, leaving them to their fate. There was no one to look after them. Asif, a kindhearted resident of the village and living adjacent to the school, came to their rescue and provided them shelter and has been offering them food since then. The issue came to the notice of mandal education officer D. Anjaiah. He along with headmasters Rudrappa and B Jayanthi visited the village and enquired about the children.

08 January 2021||Kolkata,||Iconic film characters don masks in KIFF posters||Just like in the past, posters of iconic films have come up in several prominent arterial intersections in Kolkata to mark the annual Kolkata International Film Festival (KIFF). But to mark a sign of the times, the characters in the posters now wear masks. Whether it’s Marlon Brando in The Godfather , Uttam Kumar in Saptapadi or Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra in Sholay , all don the ubiquitous face cover. The posters also include stills from Satyajit Ray and Charlie Chaplin classics. They bear the tagline ‘The show must go on’ and make an appeal to people to maintain physical distance, wear masks and use sanitisers. The inauguration of the festival, which has been a star-studded event since the Trinamool Congress government came to power in 2011, will be a low-key affair this year. The inauguration of the festival will be from Nabanna Sabhaghar (an auditorium at the State Secretariat). Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan will participate in the virtual launch of the festival, which will go on till January 15. “Together we will overcome this pandemic. But the show must go on. We are going ahead with #KIFF 2021 virtually, on a smaller scale. Glad that my brother @iamsrk will join us virtually at the inaugural event on January 8 at 4 p.m. Watch Kolkata International Film Festival live,” the Chief Minister had recently said on social media. A total 131 films, including feature films, shorts and documentaries from 45 countries, will be screened at State-run venues Nandan, Rabindra Sadan, Calcutta Information Centre and Sisir Mancha, among others. While physical screenings will be held at these venues, the festival website states that “this edition is proposed primarily in the online mode for cinema lovers, critics, actors and others so that they continue to feel the pulse of the gala international film festival”. Classic film The film that marks the inauguration will be Satyajit Ray’s classic Apur Sansar , the third film in the Apu trilogy featuring Soumitra Chatterjee. The festival will pay a special tribute to Chatterjee, the legendary actor who passed away due to COVID-19 complications in November. The festival will also screen the films of actors Irrfan Khan, Rishi Kapoor, Tapas Pal, Santu Mukherjee, danseuse Amala Shankar, and directors Fernando Solanas, Kim Ki-Duk and Basu Chatterjee — all of whom passed away last year. The festival will also pay a birth centenary tribute to Federico Fellini by screening six of his films. KIFF has a competitive section where the best film and the best director are honoured with a cash award of Rs. 51 lakh and Rs. 21 lakh respectively.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/iconic-film-characters-don-masks-in-kiff-posters/article33525119.ece

Addressing a press conference, AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said, “During the 2017 municipal election campaign ,then Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari promised that there will be no scarcity of money in the corporations because the BJP will directly bring money or fund from the Central government. Manoj Tiwari misled the people of Delhi by making false promises and did not bring a single penny from the Centre, he should resign from the post of MP.” ‘No money’ He said that despite getting funds from the Delhi government, increasing house tax and other taxes, the BJP-ruled municipal corporations claim that they do not have any money to pay the salaries of the employees. Attacking the AAP, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari said, “[Arvind] Kejriwal is not releasing Rs. 13,000 crore to the civic bodies as recommended by the Delhi Finance Commission. By not releasing Rs. 13,000 crore, he is forcing municipal employees to die of starvation.” Mr. Bharadwaj said that employees of the BJP-ruled corporations are protesting at the Civic Centre, demanding the immediate release of their pending salaries. “Doctors, nurses, medical officials, teachers, sanitation workers and others who have worked relentlessly in the time of COVID-19 pandemic have not received their salaries.” Mohalla sabhas Earlier in the day, the AAP held “mohalla sabhas” to expose BJP’s alleged corruption in the municipal corporations.

This scam is the biggest-ever scam in Delhi’s history. This money was to be paid to doctors, nurses, sanitation workers and teachers. But the BJP leaders have looted this money, due to which the employees of all these departments could not be paid.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/bjp-has-failed-should-hold-fresh-civic-elections-says-aap/article33525110.ece

In October last year, amid the raging COVID-19 pandemic in Maharashtra, a group of noted Right to Information (RTI) activists led by the former Chief Information Commissioner Shailesh Gandhi; founder of Pune-based RTI Katta discussion forum Vijay Kumbhar; and founder of Sajag Nagrik Manch rights group Vivek Velankar had requested the State government to conduct the first hearings of RTI appeals through video-conferencing. In their PIL, the petitioners had submitted that the use of video-conferencing technology had “immense untapped potential benefits” for both the government as well as the citizens in that it saved time, addressed delays and adjournments, precluded travel and reduced strain on the existing transport infrastructure, amongst other benefits. The PIL had urged the State Government to make an arrangement for the consultation committee, with petitioners as members of the public, so that the video-conferencing technology was better implemented in the interest of justice. Earlier this week, the Advocate General of Maharashtra, A. A. Kumbhakoni, and Additional Government Pleader Geeta Shastri, on behalf of the State government, had submitted that the government “proposed to assess the necessary infrastructure for deciding as to whether quasi-judicial hearings with the public can be continued through video-conferencing during the post-pandemic period bearing in mind financial implications for the same”. Advocate Shastri, referring to a December 11, 2019 communication received by her from the Principal Secretary, General Administration Department, said that a committee was being formed at the State government level with the presence of the General Administration, Finance, Law and Judiciary and the IT Departments.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/hc-to-state-form-panel-for-online-quasi-judicial-proceedings/article33525120.ece

08 January 2021||Washington,||We love you, Trump tells rioters||Wednesday began as a day of reckoning for President Donald Trump’s futile attempt to cling to power as Congress took up the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. It devolved into scenes of fear and agony that left a prime ritual of American democracy in tatters. Mr. Trump told his morning crowd at the Ellipse that he would go with them to the Capitol, but he did not. Instead, he sent them off with an incendiary rhetoric. “If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” he said. “Let the weak ones get out,” he went on. “This is a time for strength.” His lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, told the crowd, “Let’s have trial by combat.” And then, they went on and stormed the Capitol building. What happened on Wednesday was nothing less than an attempted coup, said Democratic Representative Diana DeGette. Senator Ben Sasse, Republican, a frequent Trump critic, said, “Today, the United States Capitol — the world’s greatest symbol of self-government — was ransacked while the leader of the free world cowered behind his keyboard.” Mr. Sasse went on: “Lies have consequences. This violence was the inevitable and ugly outcome of the President’s addiction to constantly stoking division.” Police said they recovered two pipe bombs, one outside the Democratic National Committee and the other outside the Republican National Committee, and a cooler from a vehicle that had a long gun and Molotov cocktail on Capitol grounds. But Mr. Trump, in a video posted 90 minutes after lawmakers were evacuated, told the rioters, “We love you. You’re very special,” while asking them to go home. Authorities eventually regained control as night fell. Heavily armed officers brought in as reinforcements started using tear gas in a coordinated effort to get people moving towards the door. They then combed the halls for stragglers, pushing the mob farther out onto the plaza and lawn, in clouds of tear gas, flash-bangs and percussion grenades. Video footage also showed officers letting people walk out the doors of the Capitol despite the rioting and vandalism. Only about a dozen arrests were made in the hours after authorities regained control. Early on, some inside the Capitol saw the trouble coming outside the windows. Democratic Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota surveyed the growing crowd on the ground not long after Mr. Trump had addressed his supporters by the Ellipse, fuelling their grievances over an election that he and they say he won, against all evidence. “I looked out the windows and could see how outmanned the Capitol Police were,” Mr. Phillips said.  Representative Scott Peters, Democrat, said he was in the House chamber when the siege began. He said security officers urged lawmakers to put gas masks on and herded them into a corner of the massive room. “This is how a coup is started,” said Representative Jimmy Gomez, Democrat. “This is how democracy dies.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/we-love-you-trump-tells-rioters/article33524847.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||After Capitol siege, friends and foes slam Trump’s poll fraud claims||The storming of the U.S. Capitol by a violent mob while Congress was ratifying Democratic candidate Joe Biden’s victory in November’s presidential race did not occur out of the blue. It was, as commentators have pointed out, the denouement of U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated declarations that he would not necessarily accept electoral defeat. Over the last two months, Mr. Trump had encouraged his supporters to challenge the results, which he said were fraudulent, without providing adequate evidence to back his claims. On Wednesday, shortly before rioters breached the Capitol’s perimeter, Mr. Trump had said: “We will never concede … You don’t concede when there’s theft involved,” giving his supporters, primed over months, a final nudge to indulge in what House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi called an act “anointed at the highest level of government”. By the time Mr. Trump asked his supporters to retreat via a video from the White House, life and property had been lost — one woman was killed and three other people died later. In his video message from the White House, Mr. Trump still insisted that the “election was stolen” and called the rioters “very special” people. This was in sharp contrast to what Mr. Biden said in his video address where he referred to the rioters as “extremists” and called their act an “insurrection”. Not just Trump Mr. Trump was not alone in supporting the chain of events that led to the attack. Many in the GOP — both in Washington and across States — had supported his claims of a “false” election. On Wednesday, in what was described as an “eleventh hour” act by some commentators, these individuals either resigned or were shocked by the mob into changing their positions. “I don’t buy this [massive electoral fraud]. Enough is enough. We gotta end it,” Trump loyalist Lindsey Graham, a Senator from South Carolina, said on the Senate floor. Mr. Graham was one of those who had had difficulty accepting the outcome of the election. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in November that Mr. Graham had pressured him into rejecting legally cast ballots in the State, which Mr. Biden had won. Deputy National Security Adviser Matt Pottinger , First Lady Melania Trump’s Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham and the White House Social Secretary resigned after the Capitol was attacked. More resignations are expected, including from the Cabinet, according to the U.S. press. Some Republicans who had said they would raise objections to the certification of votes in certain States changed their minds after the mob attack — examples include Kelly Loeffler, who just lost her Senate seat in Georgia, and Senator James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican. Others, like former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who had already accepted the Biden victory, said that no congressional audit would satisfy voters who believed that there was fraud, especially since Mr. Trump continued to make that claim. ‘Tell the truth’ “The best way we can show respect for the voters who were upset is by telling them the truth,” said Mr. Romney. Senators Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz, two GOP presidential hopefuls, stuck to their guns and raised objections to the certification of some votes. A photo of Mr. Hawley giving protesters (when they had not yet started rioting) a fist pump before they breached the Capitol went viral across news websites. “Senator Hawley has blood on his hands in the Capitol coup attempt,” the Kansas City Star editorial board said of the 41-year-old, who was the first lawmaker to say he would object to the certification. As a result of Wednesday’s events, talk of the 25th Amendment, a statute that governs the removal of a sitting President from office due to reasons of incapacitation, increased. ‘Unfit for office’ “The president incited an assault on the seat of government because he cannot accept the reality of his election loss,” said Pennsylvania Representative Madeleine Dean. “He is clearly unfit for office and must be removed from command.” Several Democratic lawmakers wrote to Vice-President Mike Pence asking him to invoke the amendment. CNN reported that Cabinet officials were discussing invoking the statute as well, according to a “well-placed GOP source”. Among other questions being asked by commentators on TV news and social media were whether Wednesday represented a security failure and would the security response have been the same had the rioters been black or Muslim. Almost 15 hours after it began the process, the U.S. Congress completed ratifying the Electoral College certification of votes. Mr. Trump did not concede the election, but said there would be “an orderly transition on January 20th” via White House official Dan Scavino’s account. Mr. Trump’s own Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts had been temporarily suspended. The last time the Capitol Building was attacked was when British forces burned it in August 1814. Discussing the incident in Washington Post , Joel Achenbach writes: “In recounting this inauspicious chapter in our history it might behoove us to acknowledge that few Americans care about this strange little war. It was fought beyond the tall ridgeline in American memory of the Civil War.” After Wednesday’s events in Washington, this may no longer be the case.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/after-capitol-siege-friends-and-foes-slam-trumps-poll-fraud-claims/article33524844.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||China compares U.S. violence to 2019 Hong Kong protests||Commenting on the violence in Washington and storming of the U.S. Capitol, China on Thursday said it “hopes the people in the U.S. can enjoy peace” as it compared Wednesday’s events with the protests in Hong Kong. “We believe that the people of the United States want stability and peace, and hope they can soon enjoy security and stability, especially amid the grim situation brought about by the pandemic,” said China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying. The Foreign Ministry as well as state media in China compared the developments in Washington to protests in Hong Kong, where in 2019 protesters had stormed the legislative headquarters. Ms. Hua also tweeted a video of that incident on Thursday. “While U.S. mainstream media denounced the protesters at the U.S. Capitol as ‘mobs’, they had called the violent protesters in Hong Kong ‘democratic heroes’, saying that the U.S. people were standing with them,” the official Xinhua news agency quoted Ms. Hua as saying. ‘Thought-provoking’ “The stark contrast in the reactions and choice of words are thought-provoking and worthy of our reflection,” she said. “What words did they use about Hong Kong? ... The mainstream media in the U.S. are condemning the incident, calling it ‘violence’, ‘thugs’, ‘extremists’, and ‘disgrace’. What words did they use to describe Hong Kong? ‘Beautiful sight’, or ‘fighters of democracy’,” added Ms. Hua. Similarity with the protests in Hong Kong was a common theme in China’s state media’s coverage, even if the difference in contexts — between protesters who were looking to overturn a fairly contested election and those who were calling for direct elections and universal suffrage to be introduced in China’s Special Administrative Region — was left unsaid.  “Double standards are rampant,” said the Communist Party-run Global Times in an editorial. “In Hong Kong, violent actions are described as a ‘beautiful sight’, in the U.S., people involved in this chaos are called ‘mobs’,” it said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/china-compares-us-violence-to-2019-hong-kong-protests/article33524845.ece
08 January 2021||Copenhagen,||‘Alarming’ U.K. virus variant needs bolder response: WHO||The World Health Organization’s European branch on Thursday said more needed to be done to deal with the alarming situation brought on by a recently discovered variant of the novel coronavirus. The WHO’s regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, called the current situation “a tipping-point in the course of the pandemic”.  “This is an alarming situation, which means that for a short period of time we need to do more than we have done and to intensify the public health and social measures to be certain we can flatten the steep vertical line in some countries,” Mr. Kluge said, referring primarily to the new variant first discovered in the U.K.. While it is natural for viruses to change over time and the variant is not believed to cause more severe symptoms, its “increased transmissibility” still raises concerns, according to WHO Europe. “Without increased control to slow its spread, there will be an increased impact on already stressed and pressurised health facilities,” Mr. Kluge said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/alarming-uk-virus-variant-needs-bolder-response-who/article33524839.ece

ATC court issues arrest warrant for Masood Azhar||An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan on Thursday issued an arrest warrant for Masood Azhar, chief of the banned Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), on charges of terror financing. The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Gujranwala issued the warrant during a hearing in a terror financing case instituted by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of the Punjab police against some members of the JeM. “ATC Gujranwala judge Natasha Naseem Supra issued an arrest warrant for Masood Azhar and directed the CTD to arrest him and present him in the court. The CTD told the judge that the JeM chief was involved in terror financing and selling jihadi literature,” an official told PTI . Six others held Azhar is believed to be hiding in a “safe place” in his native town Bahawalpur. Following the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019 in India, Pakistan’s Punjab province police had launched a crackdown on terrorism financing, and in this connection arrested six activists of the JeM in Gujranwala, some 130 km from Lahore. The CTD said its teams raided the whereabouts of the JeM’s “safe house” and arrested its members — Muhammad Afzal, Muhammad Amir, Allah Ditta, Muhammad Iftikhar, Muhammad Ajmal and Muhammad Bilal Makki — and recovered lakhs of rupees from their possession.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/pak-atc-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-masood-azhar/article33524840.ece

08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Do we have a grip on disinformation in 2021?||Disinformation, or “fake news”, is a malaise that has been worsened by the infodemic of the social media age. In the last few years, it has been used as an effective weapon to polarise communities and upset democratic processes. As we begin 2021, what is the current state of the malady? Pratik Sinha and Rasmus Kleis Nielsen discuss this question in a conversation moderated by P. J. George . Edited excerpts: The modes and means of disinformation have been perpetually evolving. What is the state of disinformation as we have entered a new year? Pratik Sinha:In the Indian context, disinformation is not evolving in quality but in quantity. When Alt News started in 2017, we used to debunk maybe five, six stories every week. But the nature of disinformation was the same as it is today — primarily old videos and images used to represent something in the present, especially if they have an element of violence or are highly politicised. We saw massive spikes of disinformation on the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests, elections, the Delhi riots of 2020, and the pandemic. In all of these issues, the kind of disinformation which was perpetrated was pretty simple, and not that difficult to debunk. It’s just the organised manner in which it was produced every single day — multiple false claims using photos, images and text. Going forward, I don’t think this is going to change much. In fact, it is just going to keep increasing because political parties have found out that if you put out organised disinformation, then any political narrative can be controlled. At the same time, even though India has a federal structure, the parties which have been targeted are not doing anything about it. They are not introducing any educational reform so that people can be more aware. So, what we are going to see is just a lot more disinformation that is rudimentary, but with a lot of people consuming it day in and day out, and forming their political opinion. Rasmus Kleis Nielsen:Pratik has described very clearly the basic dynamics of disinformation in many countries. It’s very visible in India, but we also see similar patterns in the U.S. and Brazil and a number of other countries. While the tactics, forms, and communities involved in creating and disseminating disinformation evolve over time, by now we have a very clear sense of what the basic dynamics are. I think of it as the four Ps: You have disinformation that is spread and created in the pursuit of Power. It often comes from the political establishment: sometimes from the governing party, sometimes from the opposition. Then you have disinformation that is spread for Profit. This is mostly sort of low-grade clickbait. Then you have disinformation that’s driven by Profound public disagreement. This is bottom-up disinformation, where people in good faith spread information that others think of as disinformation. We see this around vaccines, climate change, community relations in countries such as India. And the final P is that all of this is enabled by Platform companies. Facebook and WhatsApp, Google and YouTube, Twitter, and others enable the creation and spread of this information in ways that set us apart from where we were before the advent of digital media. These four Ps of power, profit, profound public disagreement and platforms will continue to drive disinformation in 2021. Then there are some things that are changing. Many disinformation actors have embraced formats that are harder to fact-check and harder to moderate, whether by humans or by automated forms. We’re also seeing that platforms have been, on rare occasions, willing to go after disinformation very aggressively. [Due to this], we are seeing a migration or a partial migration of disinformation actors away from the large consumer-facing platforms to smaller and more specialised platforms. These could be encrypted messaging applications or chat functions in online gaming platforms, or newsletters, or any number of other platforms where, at this stage, we don’t have the same amount of effort or resource to try to combat disinformation. Do you think the traditional media has improved its game or is it going round in circles when it comes to disinformation? RKN:The fact-checking community has evolved in really impressive and important ways over time, in particular, when they fact-check powerful and prominent individuals who seem keen that others’ disinformation should be countered but not their own. In terms of journalism, we have seen some recognition of two problems that have plagued news organisations while dealing with disinformation historically. One of them is that a fundamental driver of disinformation is powerful people who lie, and who have weaponised the journalistic convention of quoting powerful people verbatim in headlines, even if what they say is untrue. Any fact-checking and debunking happens much later in articles that many readers never get to. We’ve seen some news organisations, most prominently perhaps in the U.S., showing a greater willingness to have headlines that run along the lines of ‘so-and-so have falsely claimed without evidence that this is the case’. The other area in which we see some progress is in journalists making really important case-by-case decisions about when to cover disinformation narratives that are potentially harmful. They are striving to strike a balance between covering them because it’s important for the public to know of the harmful claims, and risking bringing people’s attention to such narratives by virtue of covering them. PS:In India, there are two kinds of false news: the ones that come directly from politicians, and the other that is organised disinformation on social media. About politicians themselves, [statements by] Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah have hardly been fact-checked by any news organisations. I think one television channel  tried to do a fact-check, and three of its anchors were asked to leave and some advertisements were withdrawn. When it comes to organised disinformation on social media, again, the mainstream media in India has acknowledged the issue but not many news organisations actually do fact-checking. Even if any mainstream media organisations are doing so, they are not looking at the most dangerous claims that are being put out. The main purpose of disinformation in India is to target minorities, and there’s very little fact-checking that has been done to reduce that harm. India also has another problem. Not only is the mainstream media not fact-checking people, but it is actually putting out disinformation. If not disinformation, these are plugs by the government. The government claimed that Arsenicum Album 30, a homeopathic drug, can prevent people from having COVID-19 and so, many organisations carried that claim. Many mainstream media organisations gave Baba Ramdev unlimited bandwidth to put out his claims on Coronil. Platforms such as Facebook, Google, Twitter and YouTube have amplified disinformation with algorithms that prioritise engagement and revenue. Do you see 2021 being any different on this front? PS:From the point of view of India, it is not going to be very different. As I said, one of the most common forms of disinformation in India are old images and old videos. Now, platforms claim that they don’t want to be the arbiters of truth, but it takes very little technological work to have something as basic as a database of images. We have developed a similar technology for the Alt News app with a database of images with dates that the users can look up. There is no question here of the platform deciding what is the truth. This major vector of disinformation can be controlled if platforms are willing to go that extra mile. When I’ve had an audience with some of these platforms, I have suggested that that they bring us in, as we are the people who are bridging journalism and technology and have ideas on how to deal with these issues. But all our requests have fallen on deaf ears. Second, a lot of their decisions are not well-thought-out. They are constantly reacting to situations and do not seem to have any plan. RKN:I agree that technology has the potential to deal with these problems. But at a very fundamental level, there are key parts of these problems that are political and social in nature. Several of these companies took major initiatives around the 2020 U.S. elections. And if you are a user in India, you would have every right to ask, ‘Am I not equally important?’ The companies have some tough questions to answer in terms of how they treat us. While questioning science and questionable science have both been aspects of disinformation earlier, the pandemic period saw an overabundance of this. Where’s the slip up happening due to which established science such as vaccines is being called into question? RKN:Science is arguably the single most powerful way we have of arriving at the best obtainable version of the truth. There are clear examples of misinformation and disinformation that is in direct conflict with the best available scientific evidence. These are harmful as they can be around vaccines or public health emergencies and, for that matter, climate change. It’s a particularly problematic form of disinformation and one where we actually have a ground truth that we can compare the claims against. However, we need to recognise that in a rapidly developing situation, research in science by its very nature deals with uncertainty rather than certainty. Large and powerful institutions that make decisions based on scientific input have to recognise that the scientific consensus will evolve as we get new data, and different analyses sometimes overturn established findings. Think of a situation like the early parts of the pandemic. Very important international health organisations made a number of claims about the way in which the disease is transmitted that we now know are wrong. I don’t think we should blame them for that. There are some areas in which there is a clear scientific consensus and an established ground truth, but there are other areas in which this is less clear. PS:From the Indian perspective, I’ll give it a two part-answer. One is how journalism deals with science. I know The Hindu has one, but most news organisations don’t have a science team that is trained to cover science. They treat science as press releases, dutifully putting them out without examining the facts. Problem number two is that none of us expected a pandemic; we were just not ready for the fact that during a pandemic, we will have science that is constantly changing. Even recently, we debunked a video where people were circulating an old mask protocol. The other thing that happened, especially in India, was that alternative medicine thought of this as a very good chance to gain prominence. A number of cures were put out claiming to be COVID-19 cures. These claims are there on Amazon and Google and many people are buying these drugs; again, no fact-checking. So, in India, we are facing a much bigger problem, not just because we have what the rest of the world has, but because the journalism industry in India is not equipped to handle the science.  Powerful people have weaponised the journalistic convention of quoting them verbatim in headlines, even if what they say is untrue. Any fact-checking happens much later in articles that many readers never get to.

08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Reading Hannah Arendt in Joe Biden’s America||For the first time in the history of the United States, a President has incited insurrection by his neo-Nazi brigade of right-wing supporters, opposing the peaceful transfer of power. It is tantamount to encouraging hostility when the world stood horrified as a witness to the rioters storming the U.S. Capitol. The violence against democracy, a blotch on the American constitutional democracy, interestingly, changed the minds of senators like Kelly Loeffler (Republican) who had previously said that they would object to the Electoral College results. Healing a polarised nation The unhinged and angry authoritarian at last stands crushed and humiliated after trying his best to undercut one of the oldest democratic systems in existence. With Joe Biden walking into the White House on January 20, there can be no overplaying the enormity of the tasks ahead of him, what with the deeply polarised nation divided into two belligerent camps. Afflicted with an escalating novel coronavirus pandemic, an ailing economy, racial discrimination, and a climate crisis rebuffed by millions, Mr. Biden’s America has four long years to undo the tragic consequences of intolerance and division left behind by the incumbent. Tragedy, for Joe Biden, is the very condition of life. Having lost his wife and daughter in an accident and a son to cancer, Joe Biden has always had the deep-seated desire to urge politics towards humanism in the wake of the overwhelming systemic racism that has underpinned American culture recently. The bitter assault on democracy is better understood in the recent revelation of his letter written in 1975 to the famous German-American philosopher, Hannah Arendt (https://bit.ly/38lEct6), requesting her to send him a copy of her paper read at the Boston Bicentennial Forum. It reflects his desire to find “deeper causes” underlying the economic and social collapse as well as the scourge of racism. A contrast to Trump’s politics Arendt sent out a warning in her paper entitled “Coming Home to Roost” which the present generation must heed: “All speculation about deeper causes returns from the shock of reality... the stark, naked brutality of facts, of things as they are.” Her focus is largely on her deep-seated interest in political humanism and a free space in the world inhabited by people who are inspired by public principles and an ethics that stands in stark contradiction to the inherent ethno-nationalist populism and alternate-reality politics of Donald Trump. Boastful and deluded like Mussolini, and with an overriding penchant for self-glorification, he is overwhelmingly obsessed with not letting go of his power. More frighteningly, his conception of reality is different and facts have no significance for him. Arendt returns repeatedly to this theme of the difference in things as they are and things as they can be made to seem — the difference, for example, in “our … outright humiliating defeat” in Vietnam and what Americans had been led to believe would be “peace with honor”. The image projected by Mr. Trump of an America for the whites, where there is no place for immigrant “termites”, coheres with the public sentiment of the white non-college going population that relates fondly with the language of a President that is no better than a junior school third rater. The invasion of Mr. Trump into the political life of America has been more of a politics of lies projected through the dominance of an image to convince the people that only he could save America. And now when the shaky putsch has failed and the Trump loyalists have departed for home, he has begun to exactly do what the American government is an old hand at: “finding ways and means of how to avoid admitting defeat” and keeping the image of a President as the ‘mightiest power on earth’ and the only one who can keep it intact. A bully is no different. In asking for the paper, Mr. Biden, to use Arendt’s words with which she described President Ford’s attitude after the defeat in Vietnam, has taken on the responsibility “to heal the wounds of a divided nation,” urging the people to begin a new chapter. As a young man in his thirties, he had already become aware of America’s “image-making as global policy”, a fundamentally American version of “big lie” techniques devised in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. There, Arendt argues, “lying was guided by ideology and backed by terror”; here, it has been directed at creating images and bolstered by “hidden persuasion” through the manipulation of public opinion. A parallel, then and now Interestingly, Mr. Biden, in keeping with the intellectual leanings of the 1960s and the 1970s, had begun to think at a young age of Arendt as a contemporary philosopher speaking on the idea of “image and lies”, on disinformation, on violence, on public and private freedom, and on political action. It was the war on terror, on Afghanistan and Iraq that echo Arendt’s report on the Holocaust organiser, Adolf Eichmann and his trial which derives its significance from the complex notions of justice and responsibility, ethics and duty. The war, for instance in Iraq or a few decades earlier in Vietnam was not in support of defending democracy and human rights but to exhibit the power and might of the American hegemon. The fabrication of the hypothesis of “weapons of mass destruction” was exposed when no such lethal nuclear arsenal was discovered. The sham left both the United States and Britain red in the face. Setting policy right Mr. Biden had early on in life learnt from political philosophy that the rise of a more workable political and public humanism depends singularly on Arendt’s “free spectators of action” who determine the meaning of action and its public relevance that saves humans from the abyss of a miserable existence. No wonder Mr. Biden has taken keen interest in pressing humanitarian issues such as Sudan’s political crisis or the dark contemporary history of Syria. He has already introduced a national security team designed to repudiate Mr. Trump’s nationalistic isolationism in order to usher in humility and confidence among America’s allies. His choice to execute the nation’s immigration policy is a Cuban-American (Alejandro Mayorkas). Avril Haines will be the first woman to serve as director of national intelligence. And possibly Lloyd Austin would be the first African-American in America’s history to head the Department of Defense. As Mr. Biden’s choice for Interior Secretary, Deb Haaland will be the first Native American Cabinet Secretary to ensure that the nation would make right the wrongs in the long history of bloodshed and extermination of the natives. This counters not only Mr. Trump’s misogynism but also his agenda of withdrawing shamelessly from America’s role in the world as a defender of democracy and human rights.   Arendt’s castigation of Zionism and the fascism of the American supported Israeli leadership brings us to the question of how authoritarian regimes fail to notice the lack of any sense of ethics or humanitarian necessity. It is true that “biological racism” that is visible in the history of apartheid, or in Germany under Nazism, or the resurgence of racist politics under Mr. Trump subsists on the major ideology of enforcing complete submission of the individual self to the state, the evil of incorrigible megalomaniacs striking out at the very dignity of being human. Schooled in Arendt’s writings on totalitarianism and the nature of the human condition in times of crises, Mr. Biden is the right choice for President who hopefully, has the vision for an exceptionally progressive change. It is expected that he will constantly be on his toes with the same readiness as Barack Obama, and alive to what George Santayana warned, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Writings that inspire America must know that politics of terrorism will not work any more at home or abroad. And it is hoped that many around the world would go to Arendt if only to learn a lesson or two about the vulnerability of our democracy that allows people like Mr. Trump to even stand for election when he is guilty of allowing thousands to die of the pandemic. Her writings have always been a powerful foundation of inspiration to the people’s movements fighting against totalitarian lying and the infringement of basic human rights. Her persistent warnings of failure of the American republican tradition for self-government asks for an ideological position underpinned by a more cognitive existence that is mindful of the facts ‘coming home to roost’. For Arendt, if you remain an onlooker and express no reaction appropriate to the circumstances, your inertia will amount to deliberately perpetrating violence and accepting lies to prevail.

08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||A hegemony upended by a Frankenstein||January 6 was supposed to be a day of reckoning for the delicate balance of power between the American legislature and the upcoming presidency. The Democrats had barely managed to retain control of the U.S. House of Representatives in November 2020, even as their candidate, Joe Biden, had achieved a decisive victory over a first-term President. The Senate elections ended on a near coin flip as Georgia headed to run-offs with no candidate, Republican or Democrat, managing to win 50% of the vote, and the Democrats needing two more seats for a 50-50 split in the Senate, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris providing a tie-breaking vote. Change in a ‘red’ State Georgia, traditionally, has been a Republican State, a fixture of the Deep South in the U.S. that has been a stronghold of the Grand Old Party (GOP), years after the Civil Rights Movement and Lyndon B. Johnson’s institution of the Voting Rights Act flipped the Democrats’ support bases and won the GOP white majority support. But demographic changes due to urbanisation and changes in the nature of the economy brought in new objective factors favouring the socially liberal and diverse Democrats. The work done by Democrat leader Stacey Abrams in increasing the turnout of the black minorities against overwhelming odds set by a Republican-controlled legislature to constrain voting, provided the heft that the Democrats long needed to change the contours of a traditionally “red” State. The fact that the Democrats fielded an African-American pastor in Rev. Raphael Warnock who went on to become only the 11th African-American U.S. senator, and a Jewish documentary film-maker in Jon Ossoff, who at 33 was the youngest senator to be elected since Joe Biden, suggested that this was the outcome of substantive change. The Republican candidates were rich plutocrats in incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who positioned themselves on the far-right to secure support. After all, despite Donald Trump’s decisive loss, he did manage to enhance the overall vote for the Republicans in 2020 and consolidate support among the white working and small business-owning classes. Loeffler and Perdue branded their opponents as radical socialists, creating a bogey of the demands for welfarism from the progressive wing of the Democrat party even if the policy palette of Ossoff and Warnock was hued closer to the moderate and socially liberal wing. Scare tactics have been successful in the U.S. against progressive candidates in the past, with a willing right-wing media ecosystem providing the misinformation machinery to do that. But the Republicans hit a road block. Unlike the GOP’s agenda of retaining control of the U.S. Senate and to continue its well-honed obstructionist tactics to stymie any progressive change — something that characterised the second term of the Barack Obama presidency — Mr. Trump’s main agenda was to sow misinformation about the presidential election results and a quixotic pursuit to overturn the presidential mandate. By discrediting the 2020 election and calling into question the mail-in balloting in particular, Mr. Trump depressed the GOP turnout in the Georgia run-offs relatively as a section of his most ardent supporters believed that the voting process was already flawed. This helped the Democrats flip the script in Georgia in the run-offs — a motivated Democrat base adeptly organised by Abrams’ endeavours helped increase the turnout to a historic high (nearly 4.4 million voters), with African-Americans in particular voting in large numbers. Advantage Biden The Ossoff-Warnock wins on January 6 helped the Democrats get a controlling majority in the U.S. Senate and allowed the Biden presidency the breathing space to push for at least minimal reform, away from the Trumpian era. It will now be much easier for Mr. Biden to get his government nominees confirmed and to pass meaningful COVID-19 relief and vaccination measures. Substantive reform, something that progressives seek, would still be difficult as conservative sections among the Democrats could tie up with the Republicans to block policies such as filibuster reform or greater state spending in health care, but this is a definite contrast to a Republican majority which was a cul-de-sac, with reform proposals more or less becoming dead on arrival to the Senate. A Democrat control over the Senate, Congress and the presidency is also a welcome change for the world. The Republican party, after all, has transmogrified significantly in the last few years. A classification of major political parties by the Swedish research institute, V-Dem, located the Republicans (as of 2018) as having moved further into the “Illiberal Right” (in terms of commitment to democracy). Only three right-wing parties were worse-off among electoral democracies — Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s AKP in Turkey, the Viktor Orbán-led Fidesz in Hungary and, to no surprise, the Narendra Modi “led” Bharatiya Janata Party in India. The clipping of the wings of the authoritarian and populist Right in the U.S. at the national level heralds genuine change for liberal democratic positions worldwide, at least on some issues – climate change and immigration. The protectionist driven impulses and the trade “wars” initiated by the Trump regime, will on the other hand take much more effort and coordination in international relations to wither away. Trump and history Mr. Trump will be remembered as a narcissist and a pathological liar who managed to rise up to the U.S. presidency and retain support despite his naked recourse to crony capitalism and venality. He did so by playing into the fears and discontent of the white working class and small business sections with globalisation and affirmative actions. But his success was also enabled by a plutocratic Republican party that gained from his rise by pushing for scores of conservative judicial appointments and achieved comprehensive tax cuts benefiting the ultra-rich and the corporate sectors in the country. Having achieved these sops for the fiscal and social conservative wings of the party, the GOP tolerated Mr. Trump’s repeated excesses and lies, even to the extent of allowing him to discredit the 2020 presidential election. Even though Republican office-bearers at the State and judicial levels resisted the soft coup attempt by Mr. Trump’s allies (which were based on fiction and falsehoods), the party’s senior leaders in the Senate allowed the charade to continue unimpeded till late December 2020, leading a large section of the Republican supporters into believing that the election was stolen. Self-imposed ignominy A thoroughly immoral section of the Party led by Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley among others sought to use a routine certification ceremony in the U.S. Congress on January 6 to repeat lies about the election being stolen. These efforts only emboldened Mr. Trump further and the consequence was there for all to see — the insurrection led by a ragtag bunch of white supremacists and other lumpens egged on by Mr. Trump who sought to violently disrupt Congressional proceedings. The Republican party has brought this ignominy upon itself, and the turn of events in the U.S. have shocked and alarmed the world. It will take a while to overturn the rot in U.S. politics heralded by the Trumpian turn in 2016 but the world will breathe a sigh of relief that the stranglehold of the Republican party has loosened somewhat. srinivasan.vr@thehindu.co.in||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-hegemony-upended-by-a-frankenstein/article33524828.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Getting ready for vaccination||With the announcement that India has approved two COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use, we may finally be seeing some light at the end of the pandemic tunnel. That’s good news. But India is also at a fork in the road: are we prepared to dramatically increase the number of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals who are trained for immunising and treating us? If not, none of these advances will matter for millions of our citizens. This is a problem that can be solved. If we do it right, we will not only be able to provide care for 1.6 billion people, but also have a model to show to the world on how vaccination and treatment can be done quickly and skillfully. If the world’s second-most populated nation can vaccinate and treat its people, other countries with far fewer daunting challenges can learn from India and save millions of lives. Over 4,00,000 frontline workers in India have been trained to respond to COVID-19. This number represents a massive ramping up of skills for many professionals who had never had this training. Thousands have learned about contact tracing, quarantine strategies, ventilator management, personal protective equipment, and psychological issues. Learning from one another India was a beneficiary of a successful global innovation called Project ECHO. It’s a low-cost solution for increasing the capacity of health workers in underserved communities to provide patients with the best possible care. Using videoconferencing technology, community health workers, nurses and doctors — generalists by training — learn specialty care from subject matter experts and from each others’ community informed knowledge. ECHO started as a strategy for treating Hepatitis C, and is now responsible for newly trained experts in HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, addiction, mental health, and many other conditions. The number 4,00,000 is impressive, but it’s not enough to meet the demand in India. There are many States, particularly rural ones, where we are gravely understaffed for the needs of our people. ECHO gives us the ability to reach healthcare workers in the most remote areas and afford them training comparable to what a healthcare worker in one of our largest cities would receive. The fact is that India, led by the Serum Institute of India, has the largest vaccine manufacturing capacity in the world. We need to plan smartly before COVID-19 vaccines become widely available. Who will deliver these vaccines? How do we store and handle the vaccines? How do we overcome cultural and religious barriers for those who are reluctant to accept a vaccine? How do we counsel people about side-effects so that they come to embrace the vaccine even if they start out with reservations? Knowing how to answer these questions requires cultivating real skills. And beyond vaccines, new treatments are on their way. As of last August, there were more than 20,000 peer-reviewed publications on COVID-19, and more than 100 are coming out every day. Who can make sense of this avalanche of knowledge? How will healthcare workers — many new to COVID — keep track of the most important information? More training Training more workers to treat more people is the best solution — for our personal and economic health. Simply put, we need more health experts to support vaccination and treatment. The ECHO model is worth ramping up even more to identify new healthcare workers who can be trained to be COVID-19 experts. At the end of the day, our personal, community, and national health hinges on a trained and plentiful workforce that is constantly up to date with the right knowledge and skills to care for all of us. We now have the model for successfully addressing not only this pandemic but future ones. Let’s build on what we have accomplished so far. Dr. (Col.)

08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Fruits of incitement||If the history of nations is replete with ironies, nowhere were they more evident than in the U.S., when the “greatest nation on earth” became hostage to an ugly attempted coup led by a mob, bearing slogans of support for outgoing President Donald Trump. On Wednesday, hundreds of them stormed the Capitol building, as police appeared to be overwhelmed, and members of Congress, who were gathering to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, cowered behind benches or were evacuated. Although the mob was eventually ejected, lawmakers went on to reconvene and formally certify the results, and Mr. Trump finally committed to an “orderly transition,” major social media platforms locked his accounts for violating their civic integrity policies, namely inciting violence with months of contentious posts that made baseless allegations about electoral fraud. The immediate trigger for the mob, said to have been methodically planned online via social media, was the surprise victory of two Democratic candidates, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, in the January 5 run-off election in Georgia. That election was necessitated by the fact that no candidate won 50% of the popular vote in the November 3 general election. Their win gives Democrats 50 seats in the Senate, which is tantamount to control of the upper chamber of Congress, because the incoming Vice-President, Kamala Harris, will cast a deciding vote in a tie. To say that the incoming and 46th U.S. President, Joe Biden, has a tough job on his hands after his inauguration on January 20, would be an understatement. The sheer viciousness of the January 6 mob attack, and more than two months of hateful vitriol online and offline following the 2020 election, is proof that political America is deeply polarised, brimming with anger and disenchantment at the ground realities. The “unprecedented assault” on the very soul of democracy (as Mr. Biden put it) has been in the making for more than four years. At the heart of the tsunami of angst that was evident throughout the election campaign is a sense of frustration that grips middle America, including the white middle class and blue-collar workers, over the inevitable changes to the U.S. economy and society. There is a view that the forces of immigration and globalisation have lit the fuses on this explosive combination of racial prejudice and economic insecurity. In reality, Mr. Trump’s strident rhetoric exploited this sense of alienation and socioeconomic dysfunction for narrow political and personal gains. Now Mr. Biden has an opportunity to strike a more balanced note by, on the one hand, seeking to revive the moribund spirit of bipartisan consensus and expediently tackling the thorny issue of comprehensive immigration reform, and, on the other, redressing the ills of runaway free-market liberalisation and forging a post-COVID-19 economic vision that can truly deliver on the American dream.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fruits-of-incitement/article33524819.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Flu in full flight||Just three months after India declared itself to be free of the avian influenza outbreak, the highly pathogenic avian influenza subtypes, H5N1 and H5N8, have been reported from a dozen epicentres in four States — Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala. In addition, thousands of poultry birds have died in Haryana, while Jharkhand and Gujarat, too, have sounded an alarm; the cause in these three States is still unknown. The two subtypes have targeted different birds — crows in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, migratory birds in Himachal Pradesh, and poultry in Kerala. While tests have confirmed H5N1 for causing the deaths of over 2,000 migratory birds in Himachal Pradesh, H5N8 has been identified for killing thousands of poultry in Kerala, and hundreds of crows in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. In a bid to stop the spread, as on Wednesday over 69,000 birds, including ducks and chickens, were culled in Alappuzha and Kottayam as per India’s 2015 National Avian Influenza Plan. Other States have been asked to be vigilant of any unusual deaths or disease outbreak signs amongst birds, particularly migratory ones. Migratory birds have been largely responsible for long-distance transmission of the virus into India during winter. It then spreads through local movement of residential birds and poultry. Movement of men and material from poultry farms too has been a cause for further spread. This is why States have been asked to strengthen biosecurity of poultry farms, disinfection and proper disposal of dead birds. With backyard rearing of poultry birds common, the task of elimination will be particularly difficult. A recent European Food Safety Authority report says 561 avian influenza detections were made between August-December in 15 European countries and the U.K. The virus was predominantly found in wild birds, and a few in poultry and captive birds. H5N1 and H5N8 were two of three subtypes found in Europe. Genetic analysis helped confirm the spread from Asia to west-central Europe, suggesting a “persistent circulation of this virus strain, likely in wild birds in Asia”. While avian influenza virus crossing the species barrier and directly infecting humans happens occasionally, human-to-human spread has been rare. But mutations or genetic reassortment of an avian influenza A virus and a human influenza A virus in a person can create a new influenza A virus that could likely result in sustained transmission between humans, thus increasing the risk of a pandemic influenza. Hence, all efforts should be directed at stamping out the outbreaks in the affected States. It is also important to undertake genome sequencing of virus samples to track the evolution of the virus.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/flu-in-full-flight/article33524820.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Rallying at the seat of power||The seat of power has always been a platform for protest. As a child, I would marvel at the fact that the ‘Boat Club’ on Rajpath, just a few hundred metres from Parliament, North and South Block, and Rashtrapati Bhavan, could be used by protesters of all political colours and hues. Protest marchers would begin at the Boat Club and walk to Gol Methi Chowk, just next to the Prime Minister’s residence. As a teenager one witnessed the tens of thousands of farmers led by the Bharatiya Kisan Union “occupy” the lawns from India Gate up to Vijay Chowk for a week in 1988, and then the Mandal anti-reservation agitation of 1990. Years later, it was the anti-corruption movement of 2011 and the protests against the gang-rape of a young woman in Delhi in 2012 that saw crowds overrun parts of “Lutyens’ Delhi”, as the area surrounding Parliament is known. In later years, protests in these areas were no longer allowed, and the government now restricts marches to a small strip of road near the Parliament Street Police Station, while larger protests like those against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the ongoing protests against the farm laws have been relegated to the outskirts of Delhi. During the Arab Spring, one covered protests in Syria against President Bashar al-Assad, and in Libya, against the regime of Muammar Gaddafi where police would take down details of those protesting and those covering the protests. However, “pro-regime” protesters were allowed to gather at will, threaten civilians, and even fire in the air. In Egypt, the second round of Tahrir Square protests in 2013 actually reversed the course of democracy, and installed another authoritarian government — that of former Military Intelligence Director Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The point of rallying at the seat of power is simple: not only are the protesters ensuring that their voice is heard, as it should be in any democracy, they also believe that the buildings of power and the manicured lawns are public property and therefore lay claim on them as members of the public. As a journalist, you learn to quickly appreciate the power of protest when you are about to be trod underfoot in a crush of people. You are trained not to move towards the middle of the crowd, but to stay at its periphery, and move to a height on the side if possible. You are also given a first-hand look at the answer to important questions: when does a cry for justice turn into a movement to overturn a government, or even a coup? Also, when a government is elected by millions, can a crowd of less than a hundred thousand really represent a challenge to it? Finally, is a government more “in control” if it allows large protests to gather against it, or if it quells all protests so the protesters don’t have a chance of ‘Storming the Bastille’ as it were? The answers in my reporter’s notebook are simple: protest is a legitimate part of democracy, and when protestors fight to overturn a government action, or even to demand elections to overturn a government, they only strengthen that democracy. It is those that seek to overturn democracy as a system itself that are the worry: like the mobs on Capitol Hill who bore loyalty to one man over the democratic process, or those we have seen bringing authoritarian movements to power by overrunning democratically elected governments in different parts of the world. They do democracy its greatest disservice.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/rallying-at-the-seat-of-power/article33524831.ece

A guard of the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works was shot dead by the dacoits, and two other employees of the public sector undertaking who had taken the money to deposit in the bank were injured by bomb splinters, according to an official report. The dacoits also took away a double barrel gun from the bank’s guard before making good their escape. The report said that as soon as the money was taken in and kept in the cash enclosure at about 1-20 p.m., five or six people crashed in and exploded more than 50 bombs. The glass panes at the counter were blown to pieces and the hall was filled with thick acrid smoke. One of the members of the gang ordered the bank employees not to move from their places and hang their heads down, while others entered the cash enclosure by jumping across the counter.

Another debutant Navdeep Saini and Mohammed Siraj, in only his second Test, shared the wickets in a clash both sides are desperate to win with the four-match series level at 1-1. After Tim Paine chose to bat in front of 8,692 socially-distanced fans, rain started falling 35 minutes into the opening session. It was enough time for Siraj to grab the key wicket of Warner on his return from injury, caught by Cheteshwar Pujara. But a 100-run partnership between Pucovski and Labuschagne swung the momentum back in Australia's favour before the 22-year-old fell leg before to Saini. The patient Labuschagne, who has been Australia's best batsman in this series, survived an edge off Jasprit Bumrah on 11, which just failed to carry to slip, but was otherwise authoritative. He brought up his ninth Test 50 with a boundary off Siraj, while Smith looked in ominous touch at the other end after failing to reach double figures in his four previous innings. The former captain hit five boundaries in his 31 which came off 64 balls. Dropped catches Pucovski resumed on 14 and Labuschagne two when play finally restarted at 3 p.m. after the lengthy rain delay. India tried to unsettle Pucovski early on with short-balls and he rode his luck, being dropped twice. The first came on 26 when R. Ashwin enticed a thin edge, only for wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant to miss what should have been a simple catch. Three overs later, Pant did it again. Pucovski, on 32, got a glove to a rising Siraj ball and as Pant dived, the ball popped out of his hand. He made another grab and seemed to have caught it, but replays showed the ball hit the ground first. He then survived a run-out opportunity after a misunderstanding with Labuschagne, but refocused to bring up his 50 with a boundary off Saini. But Saini, in the team for the injured Umesh Yadav, finally snared his first Test wicket, trapping Pucovski to snap what was shaping as a dangerous partnership.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/australia-calls-the-shots-on-day-1/article33524911.ece
08 January 2021||Melbourne,||Serena, Barty to headline warm-ups||World No. 1 Ashleigh Barty and 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams will spearhead the two WTA tournaments in Melbourne ahead of the Australian Open, with the top 32-ranked women split evenly across the simultaneous events, organisers said on Thursday. Radical change The onslaught of COVID-19 has forced a radical change to how the early 2021 tennis season will look, with the Australian Open pushed back three weeks to February 8. Players will arrive in Australia from January 15 and undergo a mandatory two-week quarantine before two WTA 500 and two ATP 250 events are held alongside the ATP Cup, all at Melbourne Park. Organisers have branded it the Melbourne Summer Series and named each tournament after areas of Victoria State. That will see the women play the Gippsland Trophy and Yarra Valley Classic from January 31-February 6, marking Barty’s first appearance in 11 months after opting out of the US and European swing last year over coronavirus fears. As well as Williams, the likes of World No. 2 Simona Halep, defending Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin and previous Australian Open winners Naomi Osaka, Victoria Azarenka and Angelique Kerber will take part. The leading men’s stars, including Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, will compete in the 12-team ATP Cup, which will be run at the same time and at the same venue. Those that didn’t qualify will play in two ATP 250 tournaments — the Great Ocean Road Open and Murray River Open, featuring top names including David Goffin, Stan Wawrinka, Grigor Dimitrov and Nick Kyrgios. “There’s no doubt this will be a historic week of tennis, and is the biggest-ever Australian Open lead-in week we have seen,” said Tennis Australia’s major events chief Cameron Pearson.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/serena-barty-to-headline-warm-ups/article33525079.ece
08 January 2021||Bengaluru,||The switch that made the difference||K.L. Shrijith received his maiden call-up to the Karnataka squad on the basis of stellar performances in recent inter-club limited-overs tournaments. The Vultures Cricket Club wicketkeeper-batsman earned his spot by finishing as the highest run-scorer in the Y.S. Ramaswamy Memorial 50-over tournament and the KSCA Twenty20 league. Shrijith and B.R. Sharath are the two wicketkeepers in the squad for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, which commences here on Sunday. Mithun’s encouragement Shrijith’s journey started at Vultures CC a decade ago. He moved up the ranks quickly, representing the club in the KSCA first division as a teenager. Shrijith credits senior pacer and Vultures teammate A. Mithun for spotting his talent early and encouraging him. Incidentally, Shrijith began as a right-hander before becoming a southpaw. “I was ambidextrous when I was younger. When I played tennis-ball cricket, I couldn’t score much when I played right-handed, which is my dominant grip. But once I switched to left-handed, I found I could score more. “When I started playing leather-ball cricket, I had the same problem. Once, during a tournament, I batted right-handed in the first match and didn’t score runs. So I switched to left for the next game and hit 40-odd. “I started batting left-handed that day onwards. My coach wasn’t too impressed. I got yelled at that day, but in my defence, I did make it to the Karnataka team (laughs),” Shrijith said. Looking ahead The 24-year-old is keen to make the most of chances that may come his way. “I just want to continue to scoring like I have in the last two-three seasons. I’m doing something right, so I will stick to that for as long as it works. And then I hope to be picked for the IPL,” Shrijith said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/the-switch-that-made-the-difference/article33524945.ece

08 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Now, a hostel facility at Dr. Karni Singh Range||The long-felt need of the shooting fraternity was addressed with the inauguration of the 162-bed hostel facility at the Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range by Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju on Thursday. A scheme that was neglected when the range was renovated at a huge cost for the Commonwealth Games in 2010, the air-conditioned hostel was readied at a cost of Rs. 12.26 crore by the Sports Authority of India (SAI). Premier sport “Shooting is one of the premier sports at the moment. It is a priority for us, to take all necessary steps for the shooters. “We have huge expectations from shooting and we have a huge reservoir of talent at the grassroots level. “Our athletes represent the country in the Olympics, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games. “They must have a standard of living where we provide the basic facilities,” said Rijiju. In fact, the minister emphasised that the standard of accommodation and food should be a minimum of three-star standard in such hostels. To that end, the management of the hostel would be in the hands of a professional agency. The shooters assembling for the national camps, national and international competitions have invariably been staying in hotels, spending precious time commuting in the heavy traffic of Delhi. Making it easy They will now be walking to their respective ranges of rifle, pistol and shotgun from their rooms. The facility will be open for use not only for the core group of shooters, but also for the other development shooters and those coming through the Khelo India scheme. The shooters generally have been restricting training to one session in the morning as it is virtually impossible to make two visits to the range. “Now we can train in the morning and afternoon, thanks to the hostel,” said Commonwealth Games gold medallist Anish Bhanwala.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/now-a-hostel-facility-at-dr-karni-singh-range/article33525077.ece
08 January 2021||New Delhi,||Santosh injured in crash during Dakar Rally||Indian racer C.S. Santosh was injured in a crash in the Dakar Rally in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday and put in a medically-induced coma after being airlifted to a hospital in Riyadh. “C.S. Santosh is currently receiving treatment at the Saudi German Hospital in Riyadh, after a high-speed crash on Wednesday in Stage 4 of the Dakar Rally. He has no major physical injuries except for the dislocated right shoulder and head trauma. The latest scans have also shown no major issue that could impact his full recovery,” Hero MotoSports said in a statement. “The medical team attending to him have decided that the best approach to manage the injury is to reduce the body functions to a minimum and keep him in a sedated condition or an artificial coma. He is receiving the best possible medical care and will continue to be under constant observation for the next few days,” it added. According to reports, he was conscious when paramedics arrived on the scene before he was rushed to Riyadh. Santosh crashed around 135km into the stage on a gravel track and had to forfeit the stage. This was Santosh's seventh attempt at the Dakar Rally, considered the world's most gruelling off-road motorsport event. The January 2-16 rally, divided into 12 stages, has competitors traversing 7,646km. Stage 4 is, incidentally, the longest stage of the rally, covering 813km.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/santosh-injured-in-crash-during-dakar-rally/article33524907.ece
08 January 2021||KOLKATA,||Majumdar ready for the challenge||Newly-appointed Bengal captain Anustup Majumdar is eager to take up the challenge of leading the State team in the forthcoming Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 tournament. Majumdar, who contributed heavily with the bat to help Bengal reach the Ranji Trophy final last season and performed well in the Bengal T20 Challenge earlier this season, hoped to lead the side successfully in the shorter version. “I am honoured. I don’t see it as an achievement, but as a responsibility that I want to carry out sincerely. When Bengal wins the trophy, it will be an achievement. I love to take up challenges and this is a new challenge for me. With the team we have, I hope we will do well in the tournament,” said Majumdar.  “All the players are in good shape. We had good practice sessions and played some practice matches where everybody performed well.” Bengal, placed in Group B with Tamil Nadu, Hyderabad, Odisha, Assam and Jharkhand, will face Odisha in its opening match here on Sunday. Majumdar advised his teammates not to be complacent. “Every group is tough. On paper there are two tough teams — Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu — in our group. It is T20 cricket and you shouldn’t weigh your opponent lightly. Anyone can perform and change the scenario. We have to stay focused,” Majumdar said.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/majumdar-ready-for-the-challenge/article33525429.ece

The debutant did not disappoint, making 62 to get his team off to a good start after Warner was dismissed early. Pucovski had missed the beginning of the series with concussion issues after being hit on the helmet in a warm-up game against India-A. The 22-year-old opener, who made the most of two dropped chances, felt off-spinner R. Ashwin was the most “challenging” bowler he faced on his first day of international cricket. “Ashwin is the one who is the most unique in a way,” said Pucovski. “Obviously [Jasprit] Bumrah has his unique action, but Ashwin, just with his different variations and how he uses the seam to sort of bowl, was something that I hadn't experienced before.” Asked about the state of the Test after the first day, Pucovski said, “It was a very nice batting wicket. I am very hopeful that, with the amount of batting that is in now and what we have got to come, we can post a good total. Then with the world-class attack we have, put them under the pump and hopefully dominate.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/unique-ashwin-challenging-to-face-pucovski/article33524913.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Mauricio fires Odisha to its maiden win of the season||On a wet night at the GMC Stadium, Bambolim, Odisha FC's long drought finally came to an end. The 4-2 victory over Kerala Blasters on Thursday was its first of the season at the ISL — it came in its ninth match. Odisha, however, remains at the bottom of the table, despite taking its tally to five points. A place above is Blasters, which has a point more. On the attack Stuart Baxter's boys played relentless, attacking football to come back strongly after conceding a goal early on. Diego Mauricio was their hero. The Brazilian striker scored twice and was also responsible for the own goal credited to Blasters midfielder Jeakson Singh. Though Odisha rattled the Blasters defence at the outset and even won a corner in the third minute, it found itself behind four minutes later. After K.P. Rahul's failed attempt with a header, Jordan Murray scored from an acute angle against a fumbling Odisha goalkeeper, Arshdeep Singh. Fifteen minutes later, however, Odisha equalised off a swift counterattack. Jerry Mawihmingthanga's through ball into the box found Mauricio and went in off a deflection off Jeakson's leg. Odisha took the lead towards the end of the opening half through Steven Taylor, who did well to convert a well-taken free-kick by Mawihmingthanga. That goal separated the two sides at half-time. After the break, Odisha began to put the Blasters defence under constant pressure. Mauricio made it 3-1 eight minutes into the second half, thanks to another assist from Mawihmingthanga. The Brazilian scored another 10 minutes later to seal Odisha's victory. Substitute Gary Hooper's strike, with 11 minutes left, was not enough for Blasters.  The result: Kerala Blasters 2 (Jordan Murray 7, Gary Hooper 79) lost to Odisha FC 4 (Jeakson Singh 22-og, Steven Taylor 42, Diego Mauricio 50, 60).

Mirabai Chanu is preparing for the Asian championships, an Olympic qualifying event in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in April. According to coach Vijay Sharma, who accompanied Mirabai to the USA, the stint with physiotherapist Dr. Aaron Horschig helped the former World champion. “The trip to the USA has benefited Mira. She is training with a lot more confidence,” Vijay told The Hindu .  Sharma said Mirabai did not have to stop her training in the USA. “In India, when we approached an expert, he/she asked the lifter to stop her training before starting any treatment. “The best part about the USA trip was Mira continued with her training even while getting treated. We had taken all the reports of Mira’s MRI scan and other tests. There was no major problem according to the reports. The focus of the treatment was only strengthening of muscles.” Mirabai, who is considered a medal contender in the Tokyo Olympics in women’s 49kg, has competed in five of the six mandatory Olympic qualifying events and will take part in the continental event to meet the criteria. Two-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist Sathish Sivalingam was also part of the touring party to the USA to sort out the problem of frequent injuries. The National camp, which has shifted from Patiala to Mumbai for the winter months, will move back to Patiala in February.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/fitter-mirabai-preparing-for-asian-event/article33525219.ece

Tobias Harris and Shake Milton scored 19 points each and Ben Simmons added 17 points and 12 assists as the 76ers notched up their fifth win in a row and pushed their league-leading record to 7-1. The Sixers led by as many as 21 points in the third quarter, but the Wizards hung around and knotted the score at 131-131 with four minutes left to play. From there Sixers scored eight straight points to pull away, the defeat more painful for the Wizards as Russell Westbrook departed in the waning minutes with a hand injury after contributing 20 points, eight rebounds and 12 assists. Beal’s 60 points tied him for the franchise record set by Gilbert Arenas in 2006. The night’s 11 games played out hours after President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington. “We play tonight’s game with a heavy heart after yesterday’s decision in Kenosha and knowing that protesters in our nation’s capital are treated differently by political leaders depending on what side of certain issues they are on,” players from Boston Celtics and Miami Heat said in a joint statement before their game. The marquee match-up in Miami was the first meeting between the teams since the Heat eliminated the Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals. The rematch saw the Celtics emerge from a close game with a 107-105 victory. Oklahoma City Thunder edged the Pelicans in New Orleans 111-110. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 21 points and George Hill made two free-throws to seal the win with 12.1 seconds left to play.  The results: Atlanta Hawks 94 lost to Charlotte Hornets 102; Miami Heat 105 lost to Boston Celtics 107; New York Knicks 112 lost to Utah Jazz 100; Golden State Warriors 101 lost to LA Clippers 108; Sacramento Kings 128 bt Chicago Bulls 124; Phoenix Suns 123 bt Toronto Raptors 115; Milwaukee Bucks 130 bt Detroit Pistons 115; New Orleans Pelicans 110 lost to Oklahoma City Thunder 111; Indiana Pacers 114 bt Houston Rockets 107; Orlando Magic 105 bt Cleveland Cavaliers 94; Philadelphia 76ers 141 bt Washington Wizards 136.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/sixers-down-wizards/article33524950.ece
08 January 2021||KOLKATA,||Newer clubs hold the future: Kushal||The newer clubs getting into the I-League hold the future of Indian football said Kushal Das, the general secretary of All India Football Federation. His comments came ahead of the launch of the I-League, which gets underway at different venues in and around Kolkata on Saturday. “The clubs will have to find the method to sustain themselves and as the parent body we can support them; this is the phenomenon everywhere in the world. I believe some of the new clubs that are coming in like Sudeva FC (Delhi) or Sreenidhi FC (Visakhapatnam) have the sustainable model. Much smarter “The newer clubs are much smarter and understand that while it is important to get into the top league it is also essential to find the ways to sustain themselves,” the AIFF secretary said. “We may not be worth even one per cent of BCCI’s total worth of Rs. 14,000 crore. But Indian football is rising and we hope to get there sometime. The newer clubs, which are coming in, are prepared to go the distance,” Das added. The I-League, which from this season effectively becomes the second tier to the Indian Super League, will have 11 teams contesting for the title and a spot in the AFC Cup group stages. The league will be played in a bio-secure bubble with all the players, officials and match supervisors following the specified COVID-19 protocols.  “The Hero I-League has a nationwide impact on football in India. There are clubs from different parts of the nation and that gives us a unique opportunity for young talent in that area a chance to aspire. It gives them a platform to showcase talent,” Sunando Dhar, the AIFF CEO – Leagues, spelt out the new role of the I-league.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/newer-clubs-hold-the-future-kushal/article33525072.ece

I wish he was here to actually see it.” Siraj’s father, Mohammed Ghaus, passed away on November 20, just after the Indian contingent’s arrival in Australia. Siraj decided against returning home and was rewarded with a Test cap for the Boxing Day match. On Thursday, despite the Hyderabad speedster’s early strike, India could not check the Australian batting line-up on a flat deck at the SCG. Also contributing to Australia’s delight was wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant dropping Will Pucovski twice. However, Siraj spoke up in support of Pant. “It is part of the game, catches get dropped at times. A bowler does feel it a little bit, but it’s not something you can control. So, we have to focus on the next ball,” he said. The SCG pitch appears to be the best of the series for the batsmen. Siraj conceded that the bowlers had to play the waiting game to force batsmen into errors. “It's a flat wicket. The ball is coming onto the bat nicely, so all that we were trying was to create pressure and stick to the same spot,” he said. “Even the bounce isn’t as much as it was in Melbourne.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/missed-my-father-says-emotional-siraj/article33524904.ece
08 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Enhancing the performance of players||Nupur Kaul was unable to achieve her dreams as a tennis player and opted to open the Mind Studio to enhance the performance of every player coming her way. “Being a former National skater and international tennis player, I try to integrate the physical and psychological aspects to provide a holistic learning approach to the athletes,” said Nupur. Specialising in psychology in college in Mumbai, Nupur went to Sheffield Hallam University in the UK to acquire a second Masters Degree in Sports and Exercise Psychology. The 28-year-old Nupur operates mostly on court, “watching and analysing matches, playing the sport with athletes as well as including many physical activities to positively influence the mind.” Coach Todd Clark said: “Nupur is open to new ideas. “Together, our aim has always been to adapt the traditional off court activities to physical on-court activities which can directly enhance the players performance.” Nupur would continue to “integrate the physical and psychological aspects” with Clark in the new venture Accelerate Tennis in Gurugram.  Nupur suggests that even the best of athletes have a sports psychologist in their team. “We conduct many activities to enhance an athlete’s on-court performance. Analysing matches and being a part of the training sessions is essential for a sports psychologist,” said Nupur. Mind training Observing that more athletes were “giving mind the importance it deserves”, Nupur said “tennis is like playing chess with a racquet”. “Training one’s mind to think about how to play the next point and concentrating on relaxing the body is important.”  The bottomline is that being mentally strong “requires extensive work” and does not happen overnight. Nupur is willing to guide the athletes to reach that stage.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/enhancing-the-performance-of-players/article33525069.ece
08 January 2021||LONDON,||‘Ozil’s Arsenal exit would be good for all’||Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta says he is open to Mesut Ozil leaving the Gunners this month afer freezing the German playmaker out of his squad this season. Despite reportedly being the highest earner at the club, Ozil has not featured since a 1-0 win over West Ham on March 7. The 32-year-old has only six months left on his contract and is now free to talk to other clubs over a pre-contract agreement for next season. Moving to Turkey? However, he could bring to an end his eight-year stay in London in the coming weeks, with reports in Turkey saying Ozil is close to agreeing a deal with Fenerbahce. “We will discuss internally what the best situation for him is for the near future, obviously with the player and the agent too, and try to find the best solution for everyone,” said Arteta on Thursday. “If something was sorted this month, it’s because it is good for both parties, it is good for Mesut and his future, and it’s good for the club. If that’s the case, we will move forward. If it’s not the case the player will stay here.” Ozil was left out of Arsenal’s Premier League and Europa League squads for this season, but is free to face Newcastle in the FA Cup third round on Saturday if selected.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/ozils-arsenal-exit-would-be-good-for-all/article33525221.ece

08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Release from samsara||Contemplating on the Lord and His endless effulgence is sure to bring about a humbling effect in every being in whom the sense of ‘I and Mine’ is dominant. The fundamental teaching of the sastras is that by renouncing this feeling of ‘I and Mine’ one can gradually get liberated. But this is a difficult ideal and goal for all embodied beings, including those who have renounced the world, says Appayya Dikshitar in the Atmarpana Stuti, pointed out Sri R. Krishnamurthy Sastrigal in a discourse. The plea is therefore to the Lord to loosen the knots that tie one to this cycle of birth. Siva alone grants the Purusharthas, dharma, artha, kama and moksha for all. He is fit to be meditated upon by all and He grants release by making them aware of their true nature. In the realised state, the sense of ‘I and Mine’ becomes irrelevant. The confessional tone adopted is on behalf of all those struggling in this cycle of birth. For, living in this world entails one to be under the sway of the senses and it is not easy to escape the world and its attractions that are powerful tempters and make us think that these are important. Many of us spend our time chasing these objects and repeat the wrongs. Though we do puja and worship, the pull of the indriyas holds sway all the while. At times, the performance of yagas and yagnas is with aim of attaining worldly gains. But realised souls seek Him for gaining Vairagya. So the poet prays to the Lord to guide him in the right path and turn his entire self away from ephemeral pursuits. One does the greatest harm for himself, that is, his own atma, when he leads a life steeped in worldly aims. There is no greater adverse situation for a jivatma than failing to remember the Lord.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/release-from-samsara/article33524900.ece

08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Unstoppable hallyu||Gone are the days when ‘K’ serials meant Indian tear-jerkers or confusing family dramas with complicated ‘memory loss’ plots and endless twists of reincarnation. The new K-drama lovers don’t just stop at watching the dramas: they pick up the language, explore the food, and immerse themselves in the culture — of Korea. While the Korean wave or hallyu dates back to the 1990s, increased penetration of the Internet and streaming services in the last few years has made South Korean stars like Hyun Bin and Ha Ji-won of Secret Garden , Son Ye-jin and Jung Hae-in of Something In the Rain , Gong Yoo of Coffee Prince and Goblin , Lee Min-ho of Boys Over Flowers and Park Seo-joon of Fight For My Way household names in India. Fans say Korean dramas are better than Indian soaps because the scripts are well-written, and every aspect of modern life, from romance and office politics to family dramas, makes an appearance. Hyderabad-based K. Pavani, a 22-year-old chartered accountancy student, often finds herself confusing her mother with Korean words while speaking in Telugu. She says, “I stay up at night to finish a series I started watching. It helps me go into a ‘la la land’, especially the romance. What they show is fiction and may never happen in real life, but it is still something you can believe has a possibility of happening.” A by-product of the K-drama craze is Indian curiosity towards Korean food, language, and culture, among K-fans of all ages. Mumbai-based children’s book author and mother of two teenagers, Lubaina Tyebji Bandukwala (50), says, “The script is such that the viewer gets involved with the lives of the protagonists. I love the storytelling. I just finished watching Crash Landing On You and though the trapping was improbable, it all paled into insignificance once the relationship between the characters grew. I love the way they treat food and show cooking as an art of love.”  With many productions — especially the smaller ones — turning to Netflix, veiwership seems to be on a steep rise. The TV series are now viewed widely across 190 countries. The Korean Times also reported a rise in K-drama viewership during lockdown, making India among the top six countries contributing to views of K-pop and dramas. Twenty nine-year-old Ramya Boddupalli, a research consultant in New Delhi, says long-format Korean dramas are best suited to kill time. She started watching in June last year when she was in quarantine. She was introduced to it by her friends Mellisa Cyrill and Nishtha Vengurlekar who run Indo Chingu, a page on Instagram that discusses and reviews K-drama. Ramya says, “I resisted it for the longest time. Finally in June, I caved in. I am someone who loves dissecting story plots. I also love to read analyses of shows. Chingu is the Korean word for friend.” Sandhya Ramesh (32), social media manager at a women’s health organisation in Mumbai, says, “ I think the pandemic pushed us into all kinds of directions. For me, a gentle nudge from my friend let me into the world of Korean drama, and in less than a month, I have already seen 14 shows (and counting). I have evangelised a few of my friends and have also got my parents hooked on to them. K-dramas offer an escape from our present.” Some fans have even made it a point to travel to South Korea to get the real feel. Like Sindhoo Dhana, a 28-year-old Chennai-based software business analyst, who has been watching K-dramas since 2008. She says, “My friends were surprised at how much I knew about the streets and place from the shows.” South Korean national Cho Mi Young (50) has made Hyderabad her home, and runs a guest house for working Korean nationals. The guest house canteen, Go Gu Ryeo, specialises in Korean food. The moment she listed the canteen on food delivery apps, a suprisingly high number of enquiries poured in from locals. Most enquiries are about kimchi , kimbab , katsu curry, kimchi stew, etc. She says, “When orders are placed it is always with a reference to a show they are watching. After Korean fried chicken the dish that is asked for most is k atsu curry and Korean r amen. ” Journalist-editor Vaani Sai is so passionate about K-drama and Korean culture that she ended up moving to Seoul, South Korea, to work as an English teacher. In the past year-and-a-half, the 23-year-old has immersed herself in travels through regions in South Korea such as Jeonju, Gyeongbokgung, and Pocheon Art Valley. Vaani says, “I am living in my own sort of K-drama as I visit locations that have been used as sets or film locations. It is also exciting to see the entertainment scene here change and include more racially diverse characters as the demographic of Korea diversifies.” ( With inputs fromDivya Kala Bhavani )  Surging forward OTT platforms too have caught on to this trend and have picked up K-dramas like The Uncanny Encounter , It’s Okay To Not Be Okay , Run On , Private Lives and Stranger . A recent Netflix report states, “The viewing for K-dramas on Netflix in India increased more than 370% in 2020 over 2019.”||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/unstoppable-hallyu/article33525345.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Visakhapatnam||The year 2021 will give a fresh lease of life to one of the most significant and iconic heritage structures of Visakhapatnam: the 120-year-old Town Hall. After years of neglect that reduced the grand edifice to a shadow of its glorious past, the Town Hall restoration project was finally taken up in 2019 by the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation and executed by Savani Heritage Conservation. Being carried out at a cost of Rs. 3.4 crore, the project is nearing completion and will be ready by February. “The project will be a classic example of how scientific restoration of heritage sites can help preserve the basic character of such ancient structures,” says Mayank Kumari Deo, convener of INTACH - Visakhapatnam Chapter. Work on Town Hall demanded a lot of expertise. “The Gothic structure has two tiled conical roofs and the core support material is made of Burma teakwood. Even the flooring is made of wood,” says Edward Paul, a history expert who has extensively researched the history of Visakhapatnam. The Burma teak wooden flooring has been restored with care, using similar material only in sections where the wood has decayed. The restoration project also includes landscaping work around the Town Hall, an amphitheatre and parking space. Built by the Maharaja of Bobbili in 1901, in memory of Queen Victoria, the Town Hall was originally called the Victoria Diamond Jubilee Town Hall, and was handed over to the municipality in 1904. Years of neglect endangered the stability of the structure with the roots of vegetation growing through walls, resulting in cracks and mortar loss. The Town Hall has been witness to fiery speeches delivered by freedom fighters, including Mahatma Gandhi, who addressed a gathering here in 1929. It also saw eminent personalities such as C. Rajagopalachari, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, C.V. Raman, Rabindranath Tagore, and M.S. Subbulakshmi speak and perform here. It is the only surviving building in the district with a massive wooden floor made of Burma teak. “Conservators are not adding anything new. Going forward, the authorities now need to preserve the structure and make it a cultural hub for activities like art shows and literary activities,” says Deo.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/visakhapatnam/article33525350.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Summer’s End What a mess!||The storm broke at night. The thunderclap rattled the windowpanes and woke Keya. Angry flashes of lightning streaked across the sky, rain splattered the windows and a stray branch from the pear tree knocked against the glass. Every time lightning struck, the garden lit up. As she lay there looking out at the sky, Keya heard footsteps in the passage. “Dhruv is scared,” she thought, “he must be going to Moti uncle’s room.” But the footsteps stopped outside her room and the door opened. A burst of thunder followed by lightning lit up the room. The passage was empty. She heard footsteps but she could see no one. Her drawers and cupboard were flung open noisily. She whimpered. Strangely, she felt the glare of icy-cold eyes on her. She crawled deeper into her blanket, not daring to breathe. She passed the rest of the night in a funk and awoke to a messy room. At breakfast, when she told Moti uncle and Dhruv what had happened, all they said was, “It could have been the wind.” In the drawing room, they were surprised to find books off the shelf and papers strewn everywhere. Albert, the general factotum, was putting everything back in place. All morning, it rained. They sat indoors and read, thinking it was a sad end to their holiday. They were due back early the next morning. Mishti was behaving strangely, whining, and walking around with her tail between her legs. Somewhere in the house, a window banged. The cold wind that swept in and the constant slamming of the window added to their unease. Mishti growled, the fur on her neck standing up. Something strange “I’ll check,” muttered Dhruv, getting up. Mishti whined loudly and hid between Moti uncle’s legs. “The storm is frightening Mishti,” said Dhruv, walking out. He found the open window in the study and leant out to get hold of the catch. He felt something cold and clammy on his back. He let out a sharp cry and felt it slithering off. He shuddered and, turning around, caught a glimpse of a dark, black shape scurrying away. He shut the window and looked around. The room was in shambles. It looked like someone was conducting a thorough search. Dhruv went back to the drawing room and said, “The study is a mess. Everything is lying around…as if someone’s searching for something…” “Was the window catch broken?” asked Keya. “No…” he replied and hesitated. “What happened?” asked Keya. “Just that I had a strange sensation when I leant out to shut the window…it was as if something cold and slimy touched me. When I turned around, I saw the shadow of a dark figure moving away…” Mishti howled.  To be continued...   Dhruv felt something cold and clammy on his back. He let out a sharp cry.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/summers-end-what-a-mess/article33525624.ece

08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Welcome to the family||“Meow!” Ritu heard the sound from her room. She ran to the drawing room where her mother was sitting on the floor with the orange cat that came to eat at their house every day. “Mother, can we keep him?” Mother smiled. She got up to get fish and rice for the kitty. Ritu wanted an answer, so she asked again, “Mother, may we please keep him?” Placing the food in front of the hungry cat, Ritu’s mother said, “Yes, we will take him to the vet tomorrow.” Ritu was so happy that danced in joy. Just then the doorbell rang and Ritu ran to answer it. It was her father, finally back from work, and there was good news to share. “Father, we have a pet now!” Ritu announced. Father went to wash his hands, saying he would come and say hello to the new family member in a few minutes. Mother left to buy some things from the pet shop nearby. “He will need some special sand for his toilet duties and we must get him some cat food too.” Ritu’s father called out from the bathroom, “How about a nice cat bed too?” What about a name?  Everyone was excited to welcome the furry creature into their home, but Ritu thought they were missing something important. She shouted out, “He needs a name!” Her parents looked at each other. While Father prepared dinner and Mother went to the shop, Ritu sat next to the sleeping cat with a pen and paper. She wanted to give him the perfect name. He would be her little brother. She thought hard and made a list of all the names of cats and dogs she liked from her books. Scribbling again, she added the names of her favourite fruits and vegetables.  She asked her father, “Father, can we call him Orange?” Her father stirred the curry and joked, “How about Banana?” Ritu stuck her tongue out and giggled. An orange cat couldn’t be called Banana. Mother returned from the shop. She placed a big plastic tray near the bathroom and filled it with cat litter. There was a pink scoop to clean it too. In the kitchen, she placed an orange bowl with paw prints on it, on the floor and poured water into it. “Ritu,” Mother said. “You will help us take care of him. When I was little, I took care of our dog and cats.” Ritu nodded. She was ready to be responsible. But first, she needed to name the cat. As she stared at the names on her paper, the cat came and sat between her ankles. She patted his head, stroking it slowly. The kitty made a soft sound like a running motor. Mother, who was watching, clapped her hands and explained, “He is happy so he is making that sound. It is called purring.” Ritu was happy too. She noticed that he had dark orange stripes on his body. Like a little tiger. At that moment, she knew what his name would be. Little Tiger.  Everyone was excited to welcome the furry creature into their home.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/welcome-to-the-family/article33525607.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Unrequited love||Have you heard of the term narcissist? It means someone obsessed with oneself. Did you know that this term is derived from a Greek myth? This story also gave us the word echo, which means the repetition or imitation of a sound. Here is the story. Echo was a beautiful mountain nymph and one of the attendants of the Goddess Artemis. She wasa favourite with Artemis but she had one weakness: she would keep talking constantly and rarely stop. One day, when Zeus was with the nymphs, Hera came looking for him, as she was very jealous of her husband’s friendship with other women. Echo distracted Hera by talking to her while her friends escaped. When Hera discovered what had happened, she cursed Echo: “Since you cheated me with your tongue, you shall lose all power of speech. In future, all you can do is to repeat the last word you hear.” Meeting Narcissus Poor Echo wandered sadly around her beloved forests. One day, she saw a beautiful young man Narcissus, as he came to hunt in the mountains, and fell in love with him. Since she could not speak to him, she began to follow him and Narcissus became aware of that. “Who’s there?” he called. “There,” repeated Echo. “Show yourself,” he shouted. When Echo came out and he realised that she could only repeat his last word, he mocked her and went away. A grief-stricken Echo slowly faded away until only her voice was left, repeating the last word of whatever was said. Artemis, who was upset at Echo’s fate, became very angry with Narcissus. She cursed that he would know what it was to love and not have it returned. One day, while hunting, a tired Narcissus chanced upon a beautiful pool of water, as clear as a mirror. Soft green grass grew around it and no steps of animals or humans could be seen. He bent down to get a drink and saw his reflection in the water. Now remember, those were days when people didn’t have mirrors to look at themselves. Narcissus thought he was looking at a beautiful water spirit and fell in love with it. He bent close to kiss and hug it but the minute his lips or hands touched the water, the image faded away. When the water was still, it returned. Narcissus lost all thought of home, food, rest… and sat by the pool side gazing at the beautiful image. “Why are you so cruel?” he cried. “All I want is your love.” He begged and pleaded but to no avail. Slowly Narcissus too faded away, just like Echo had. He was then turned into a flower that bears his name.  Echo had one weakness: she would keep talking constantly and rarely stop.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/unrequited-love/article33525629.ece

As a conversation between siblings Tanu and Manu, whose parents are associated with the power industry, the book talks about how electricity is transmitted from power plants to grids and, finally, to households. Apart from the importance of electricity in our everyday lives, it sheds light on non-renewable sources of energy such as coal, oil and gas that are limited in quantity and highlights the skewed supply-demand ratio.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-youngworld/its-electrifying/article33525668.ece

08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Kamboji, the showstopper||A stately Kamboji, painstakingly sculpted, dancing in all its majestic glory, is the lingering memory of Kunnakkudi Balamurali Krishna’s concert for Charsur. One of the finest renditions of the raga heard in recent times, this hour-long exposition included a 15-minute alapana, a 10-minute violin solo by Akkarai Subhalakshmi, and a scintillating tani avartanam by veteran percussionists K.V. Prasad and Ghatam Karthick. The virtuosic Balamurali was at his best, and the artistes that accompanied him were on a roll, thoroughly enjoying the outing. As Balamurali was slowly building his Kamboji, one could hear flashes of grand compositions throughout. With those moving phrases, the raga was in full bloom, making itself available for a leisurely rendezvous. An exposition for 15 minutes in a digital concert may sound like a luxury, but Balamurali seemed to have made a point that changing the format to digital doesn’t necessarily mean compromising on the fullness of a regular concert. The kriti he chose was ‘Ma janaki’ by Tyagaraja with niraval at ‘Raja rajavara rajeevaksha’ which was skilfully embellished by Prasad and Karthick. Confluence of styles If Kamboji was the showstopper, the Purvikalyani that preceded was equally arresting. Balamurali is one of those rare Carnatic musicians who is capable of employing quick-fire Hindustani-style taans and handsome glides which make a raga such as Purvikalyani a distinctly different experience. You constantly hear both a confluence as well as divergence of flavours making the raga exposition a deeply pleasing experience. His taans were magical in the Poorvi portion of the raga, that has the Hindustani colour, and the alchemy arising out of the two halves of the scale was extremely pleasing. Balamurali always sounds good with Hindustani-flavoured ragas and this was no exception. The composition he chose was ‘Kasi visalakshi’ by Muthuswami Dikshitar. As in the case of Kamboji, this too had a leisurely alapana that lasted about 10 minutes followed by Subhalakshmi. Balamurali began his concert with ‘Sri Rajarajeshwari’ (Dikshitar) in Poornachandrika, which was almost like a vertical take off with his chiselled gamakas and cascading swaras. This was a rendition that the whole ensemble seemed to enjoy. With such an energetic opening, they revved up enough momentum to keep the concert lively, mostly in a medium tempo, except for the closing piece in Nilambari (‘Brovavamma’ by Syama Sastri) and the ‘Paluka tenala’ (Annamayya) in Abheri that preceded it. One would generally expect Abheri to be more quick-footed, but Balamurali chose to present a different gait that seemed to have more gravitas. The other songs that he sang were ‘Taye ini tamadam’ in Nattakurinji by Rajam Sitaram, in which his impressive bass registry was on vivid display and ‘Neemadi challaga’ by Kavi Mathrubhoothayya in Anandabhairavi. Instead of its usual plodding stride, the Anandabhairavi was a bit brisker with invigorating swaras. So, both Abheri and Anandabhairavi offered interesting departures from the usual. The concert clearly demonstrated why Balamurali is one of the most exciting singers of the younger generation. Through the concert, his inventive and genre-defying approach, his total command over his art, cheerful voice techniques, and an impressive vocal range that lets him go up and down the octave with absolute ease were on show. That he had accomplished musicians to accompany him on stage amplified the impact of the concert. K.V. Prasad and Karthick were stunning examples of anticipation during improvisation and playing for the lyrics. They stood out in the niraval in Kamboji by the way they kept up with the singer as he sang at will. Being a digital concert with excellent sound quality, the tone of Karthick’s thumb-strokes as well as the way he kept accentuating punch notes were pleasing as well as invigorating. Akkarai Subhalakshmi, who has been accompanying Balamurali for years, was perfect both in her solo and accompanying roles.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/kamboji-the-showstopper/article33524804.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Full-throated ease||Sunil Gargyan is a young and energetic vocalist blessed with a robust voice. Open-throated delivery and perfect enunciation of the sahityam backed by good training also work in his favour. Gargyan had crafted his one-hour programme with good understanding. Andal’s Thiruppavai, ‘Nayakanai nindra’, was the opening song in Mohanam. Sunil started the raga deliberation of Hamsanandhi with short and long phrases emphasising the contours of the raga. It augured well for Ambujam Krishna’s rare Tamil composition ‘Punnagai ondre podhume.’ The singer’s presentation took care of the ample emotional tenor conveyed by the lyrics. Sincere approach The short and rare Dikshitar kriti ‘Renukadevi samrakshithoham’ in Kannadabangala was the filler before Sunil Gargyan went in for a detailed alapana of Madhyamavati. A soulful raga, Sunil touched the signature phrases very effectively and went on to explore the emotional nuances of the raga with absolute sincerity. His choice was Saint Tyagaraja’s popular composition ‘Rama Katha sudha’. The customary line ‘Bhama mani janaki sowmitri’ was taken up for extrapolation and swara exercise. The swara matrices were skilfully woven and this also elicited perfect responses from violinist Madurai M. Vijayaganesh. The kuraippu swaras set on shadjam continued for a few rounds and ended with perfection. After the expansive treat of Madhyamavati, Sunil Gargyan concluded the concert with Syama Sastri’s ‘Brovavamma’ in Nilambari soaked in piety and melody and a fast-paced Thiruppugazh. From start to finish, the concert was marked by involvement and vivacity from all three participants. Vijayaganesh also demonstrated his musical prowess in his brief raga essay of Hamsanandhi as well as with Madhyamavati. Srivanchiam R. Sriram on the mridangam was replete with verve. His dynamic but brief tani avartanam in this one-hour concert was absolutely impressive. With all the appreciation there is a word of caution to young and up-and-coming artiste Sunil Gargyan; there is a slender line that demarcates open-throated and loud rendition. It is wise he keeps a tight leash on this aspect while cruising raga essays and swarakalpanas.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/full-throated-ease/article33524778.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Unhurried and clear||The proper selection of songs and ragas go a long way in the success of a concert. And Nisha Rajagopalan proved to be adept at it. With remarkable stage presence, she commenced her concert with Patnam Subramania Iyer’s ‘Abhimanamennadu’ in a delightful Begada. Little wonder that the composer was known as ‘Begada’ Subramania Iyer. In the kalpanaswara segment, she brought out the richness of the raga through several of its vakra prayogas. On the violin, B.U. Ganesh Prasad was equally creative in his response. After an extensive alapana in Sriranjani, Nisha rendered Tyagaraja’s ‘Marubalga’ with niraval and swaras at ‘Dari nerigi.’ This was followed by an impressive Dhanyasi raga essay for Papanasam Sivan’s ‘Balakrishnan padamalar’ (rupakam). This piece has two beautiful madhyamakala segments. Strong training Nisha rendered appropriate swaras for Tyagaraja’s ‘Makelara vicharamu’ (Ravichandrika). Her rendering of ‘O Jagadamba’ (Anandabhairavi, Syama Sastri) was testimony to her training under stalwarts. She maintained a leisurely pace for this kriti. After an elaborate Kalyani raga alapana, she sang one of Dikshitar’s masterpieces, ‘Bhajare re chittha,’ with niraval and swaras at ‘Devim sakthi beejotbhava.’ Clear diction, impressive modulation and full-throated singing are her forte. Ganesh Prasad’s elucidation and swaraprastara had emotive appeal. The thani in misra chapu between Manoj Siva and B.S. Purushothaman (kanjira) was marked by technical virtuosity and aesthetic excellence. The true picture of several rakti ragas can be found in Kshetrajna padams. Nisha’s next was a padam in Sahana, ‘Chudare adinadeche’, with well-negotiated sancharas. The concert concluded with the Ragamalika, ‘Ganamazhai pozhikinran,’ composed by Ambujam Krishna in Behag, Bowli and Manirangu.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/unhurried-and-clear/article33524798.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||A judge dedicated to music||There have been many lawyers and judges who have taken an active interest in Carnatic Music. A few performers and music scholars have qualified in law as well. But in the history of Carnatic Music there has been only one judge of the Supreme Court, who was a singer, a scholar, a music teacher and above all, a recipient of the Sangita Kalanidhi from The Music Academy. That was T.L. Venkatarama Iyer, whose 50th death anniversary was on January 2. Born on November 25, 1893, Venkatarama Iyer came of scholarly stock. His grandfather Muthusubba Iyer was an expert in Sanskrit and Tamil in Punalveli in the Tirunelveli district. His father Lakshmana Iyer was a renowned Sanskrit scholar who settled at Harikesanallur. While the father took care of the boy’s Sanskrit learning, it was cousin Muthiah Bhagavatar who initiated him into music. This was not entirely to Lakshmana Iyer’s liking but lessons continued nevertheless. Law and musical learning Lakshmana Iyer was successively employed as Sanskrit professor at SPG College Thanjavur and Pachayappa’s College, Madras. The prefix ‘Suri’ was conferred on him by Sir K. Seshadri Iyer, Dewan of Mysore, in 1903 and he was awarded the title of Mahamahopadyaya by the government in 1911. Young Venkataraman was admitted to Pachayappa’s School and later to Madras Christian College. He eventually qualified in law and set up practice at the High Court of Madras. His musical learning was not neglected, for he trained under Manathattai Doraiswami Iyer. It was, however, a meeting in 1931 at Kovilpatti with Ambi Dikshitar, a descendant of the Muthuswami Dikshitar family, that proved the most important event in his life. His love for Sanskrit and music found common ground in the works of Muthuswami Dikshitar and he became a lifelong votary of the composer and his songs. He was instrumental in Ambi Dikshitar’s shift to Madras from Ettayapuram and even after the latter went back in 1933, continued to be his disciple till the guru’s passing in 1936. By then, he had emerged as an expert on Dikshitar’s works and was a much sought-after teacher, his residence on Mylapore’s Sannidhi Street being the venue for lessons to artistes and lay students. He was also one of the early members of The Music Academy, where he soon became vice-president. At its annual conferences it was his voice, along with those of Cheranmahadevi Subramania Sastry and Kallidaikurichi Vedanta Bhagavatar, that staunchly highlighted the Dikshitar style of handling ragas, some of which were in sharp variance to the Tyagaraja school. In 1944, The Music Academy invited him to preside over its annual conference and conferred on him the title of Sangita Kalanidhi. DKP’s moving rendition Venkatarama Iyer was elevated to the bench, becoming judge of the High Court of Madras in 1951. Upon turning 60 in 1953, he was made a judge of the Supreme Court of India, and he carried his propagation of Dikshitar kritis to the national capital as well. It was here that D.K. Pattammal at his request sang Dikshitar’s ‘Cheta Sri Balakrishnam’ (raga Dwijavanti) and moved Babu Rajendra Prasad, the then President of India, to tears. A few years later, when he was visiting Madras on Janmashtami, the President asked for “TLV’s disciple” to be invited to the Raj Bhavan. Pattammal sang ‘Cheta Sri’ once more. Returning to Madras, T.L. Venkatarama Iyer persuaded Sangeet Natak Akademi to give a grant to The Music Academy to enable the latter to embark on a five-volume Tamil translation of Subbarama Dikshitar’s magnum opus, Sangita Sampradaya Pradarsini . In 1962, during the centenary celebrations of the High Court of Madras, at the invitation of S. Ramachandra Iyer, the then Chief Justice, Venkatarama Iyer performed a full concert, the accompanists V.P. Raman (violin), N. Srivatsamani (mridangam) and K.C. Rajappa (kanjira) all being lawyers! In 1965, when the then President of The Music Academy, K.V. Krishnaswami Iyer, passed away, TLV took over, simultaneously serving also as president of the RR Sabha. Under him, The Music Academy finally took the decision to award the Sangita Kalanidhi to women, the first recipient being M.S. Subbulakshmi in 1968. That was also the year when TLV’s biography of Muthuswami Dikshitar was published by the National Book Trust. Two years later, it was Venkatarama Iyer’s favourite disciple, D.K. Pattammal, who was selected for the Sangita Kalanidhi. While the proud guru made it to the inauguration of the conference despite being terminally ill, he could not attend other events. On January 1, 1971, Pattammal received the award and drove straight to his house on Mowbrays (now TTK ) Road. The old man could not contain his joy. He died the next day.  The Chennai-based author,   a historian, writes on   music and culture.   He had emerged as an expert on Dikshitar’s works and was a much sought-after teacher, his residence on Sannidhi Street, Mylapore, being the venue for lessons to artistes and lay students||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/a-judge-dedicated-to-music/article33524776.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||The call of a raag||To a musician, a hawker selling his wares might well be calling out to the scales of a raag. Legend has it that Pt. Dinkar Kaikini’s well-trained ears captured the notes of the quintessential kerosene seller of the 60s, the sing-song call etched in his memory forever. Several years later, this maestro of the Agra gharana created a new raag, based on the shadaj , komal rishabh and shuddha madhyam that he had identified in the hawker’s call. He added teevra madhyam , some shuddha dhaivat, and a liberal portion of devotion to create the raag Gunaranjani. Like Kaikini, there are musicians today who are performers as well as composers. Here, we look at two such artistes: one who has enriched the world of Hindustani classical music with her musical prowess and compositional ability, and another, whose work calls out for attention. “Creating a new raag is addressing an artiste’s urge or need,” says Prabha Atre, a prolific composer and singer. “That is why each generation has added new raags and compositions that have stood the test of time.” Even the uninitiated remember Atre’s beguiling bandish in Maru Bihag and Kalavati, which marked the beginning of her journey into composing. She now has more than 500 compositions in several raags to her credit — and at 88, she is still composing! Methodical process Atre’s 19-part lec-dem series ‘Aalok’ is both enriching and engaging. With a scientist’s spirit of inquiry and experimentation, she follows a methodical and studied process to raag creation, always on the lookout for something new. She has the courage to present well-established raags in a new light, notable examples being Maru Bihag, Shyam Kalyan and Jogkauns. It’s not just musicians who’ve taken to singing Atre’s compositions; they’ve also been taken up in dance and drama. Chaitanya Kunte, a young Pune-based artiste, cites Atre among his influences, placing her among a gallery of greats that includes S.N. Ratanjankar, Aman Ali Khan and Kumar Gandharva. He has himself composed more than 200 pieces — sargam geet, thumri, dadra, chaturang, trivat and bhajan — and innovated many new raags and taals. Having studied the work of musicians of years past, he has used the gleanings to revive forgotten taals and thekas, most notably the Adha Matra taal. Listening to his creations, you can see the influence of his training in the Agra, Gwalior and Atrauli gharanas. Not only a vocalist, he plays the harmonium too and Kunte’s compositions, collected and published in his book Raga Chaitanya , are sung by many renowned musicians, including Ashwini Bhide Deshpande, Arati Ankalikar, Raghunandan Panshikar and Anuradha Kuber. Few new raags stand the test of time. Jogkauns is one example that comes to mind from recent times, a contribution by the eminent composer and musician Jagannathbuwa Purohit, which has won the hearts of performers across gharanas. Who knows which pieces or raags written by today’s musicians will enthral future generations, but what’s clear is that only a few musicians have the gift of composition, and they are the ones who push the boundaries of classical music.  The writer is a Hindustani vocalist.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/the-call-of-a-raag/article33524770.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Essence of tradition||The one-hour slot offered N. Ananthanarayanan limited time to express his musical thoughts. Yet, he was able to deliver a memorable performance that fully adhered to tradition. He began with Tyagaraja’s ‘Tulasi dala’ in Mayamalavagowla. A few rounds of brisk swaras set the tone. Next came ‘Sarasa sama dana’ in Kapi Narayani, again a Tyagaraja kriti. Ananthanarayanan then took up raga Varali for exposition. Varali has a sombre tenor and calls for perfection in the choice of phrases and detailing. Ananthanarayanan painted a flawless picture of the raga. The kriti chosen was Muthuswami Dikshitar’s ‘Mamava meenakshi.’ An interesting swaraprastara was appended to ‘Somasundareswara.’ Sankarabharanam explored The swift and catchy ‘Meevalla guna dosha’ by Tyagaraja in Kapi followed. By then, it was time for the main raga and the artiste chose Sankarabharanam. A traditional melody with ample scope for the performer to explore the beauty and depth of the raga. Ananthanarayanan distributed the sancharas in alapana in middle, upper and lower registers with a fine grasp of the raga’s pure form, adding gamakas in good measure at the appropriate junctures. A concise tanam, the special feature of veena, was presented before moving on to the kriti. The kriti chosen was ‘Saroja dala netri,’ an outstanding composition by Syama Sastri that carries tremendous scope for improvisation on the charanam line, ‘Sama gana vinodhini.’ The artiste, however, moved directly to swarakalpana without niraval. The swaraprastara was done in perfect measure to emphasise the special quality of Sankarabharanam. ‘Govardana giridhara’ in Darbari Kanada (Narayana Tirtha) and Thiruppugazh ‘Madhiyaal viththagan aagi’ in Suratti were the concluding pieces. Akshay Anathapadmanabhan accompanied him on the mridangam cautiously, as veena concerts demand subtle percussion support without overshadowing the instrument’s tenor. He also presented a precise tani avartanam after the Sankarabharanam. I strongly believe vocalists and instrumentalists should announce the kriti, raga, tala and the composer either before or after the rendition. However perfectly an instrumentalist plays and however close to a vocal performance, knowing the composition allows listeners to enjoy the music even more. This in no way belittles the erudite rasika.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/essence-of-tradition/article33524780.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Bilahari at its best||Sriranjani Santhanagopalan’s concert showed her continuing rise and keenness to embrace challenges. Credit is also due to her for trying to pack in a lot more than the short duration allowed. Dikshitar’s Navagraha kritis have a unique charm with their blend of lyrical beauty and raga lakshana. Sriranjani sang ‘Suryamurthe’ (Sowrashtram) at the start with a pleasing patantharam and demanded early attention from the audience. ‘Valli nayakane’ (Shanmukhapriya, Muthiah Bhagavatar) with roller-coaster sangatis lent itself to her fast-paced singing. Her niraval and swaraprastara at ‘Thalli thanri guru daivamu’ upped the tempo that was sustained till the end of the concert. Suratti, the rakti raga, was a good choice at this point. One looked for a more sensitive portrayal of the raga in the alapana. Chidambaram Badrinath eschewed briskness and stayed in the karvai mode to impart the right rasa. Tyagaraja’s ‘Bhajana parula’ (rupakam) has its own raga contours that lend themselves to greater exploration through niravals, but perhaps due to time constraints, this was avoided. In modern concerts, swaras are the winners and niraval is the poor cousin. It’s a pity considering that some yesteryear musicians considered niraval the highest manodharma challenge. Sriranjani’s Bilahari alapana was both sparkling and detailed, visiting all the classic twists of the raga, with caressing touches while descending to the madhyamam. Badrinath again distinguished himself with a slick, no-gimmick essay. ‘Sree Chamundeswari palayamam’ by Mysore Vasudevachar is one of the best compositions in Bilahari and Sriranjani sang it in an engaging kalapramanam as industriously as it is meant to be sung. The song also has a beautiful chittaswaram that has sarali, janta and even a korvai built into its structure. The rendition gained more majesty with the multi-speed singing of the chittaswaram. There was an intelligent swara sequence with laya plays and a fiery finish. No stone was left unturned to give a wholesome feel to the concert as Sriranjani sang pleasing viruthams in Vasantha, Khamas and Madhuvanti (pasuram ‘Kondal vannanai’) followed by a Lalgudi Jayaraman thillana. Sriranjani’s voice was sprightly and aligned well to her ideas. With time, it will acquire more refinement and a softening of the higher flights. Chidambaram Badrinath delivered another strong performance on the violin. Mridangist Akshay Anand lagged behind in the first part of the concert but came alive later, especially with his thani. The sub-senior slot could be expanded beyond the crammed 60 minutes to allow the artistes to show off their skills better.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/bilahari-at-its-best/article33524794.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Some sparkling exchanges||S. Mahathi’s concert proved to be a rewarding experience, more so as it was a full-length Tamil recital. ‘Vallabhai nayaka vandanam,’ a beautiful Mohana Kalyani varnam by Lalgudi Jayaraman was the opening piece and within minutes, she had succeeded in weaving a web of charm with her gifted voice. She then crafted a dazzling Suddha Hindolam with a majestic alapana. On the violin, L. Ramakrishnan’s response was equally impressive. His aesthetic sense makes him a desirable accompanist. Subramania Bharati’s ‘Saagaa varam arulvaai’ (misra chapu) on Rama, was the chosen kriti. He entreats the Lord to grant him immortality. The swaraprastara was at ‘Nithya, nirmala.’ ‘Vazhi maraitthirukkudhe’ from Gopalakrishna Bharathi’s Nandanar Charithram stood out for its imaginative rendering in an unhurried Nattakurinji. Pleasant Madhyamavati Madhyamavati is a raga that has a pleasant musical architecture. In the exhaustive alapana, Mahathi succeeded in weaving patterns that brought out its essence. Again, Ramakrishnan portrayed the raga superbly. Papanasam Sivan’s brilliant creation, ‘Saravana bhava guhane’, in a leisurely adi tala fitted well with the singer’s mood of improvisation. In the kalpanaswaras, she conveyed the emotive aspects of the raga through beautiful voice modulation. The swara exchanges between her and the violinist were sparkling. N.C. Bharadwaj (mridangam) and Sai Subramaniam (morsing) struck a wonderful partnership in the thani. Mahathi enlivened the closing phase of the concert with Bharathidasan’s ‘Isai amudhile en uyirkkili’ in Desh. She wound up the evening with her guru T.N. Seshagopalan’s thillana in raga Niroshta. Overall, a well-spent 90 minutes indeed.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/some-sparkling-exchanges/article33524800.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Emotion added to spark||To say that Sudha Ragunathan’s voice had spark is not news. But what brightened the mood at her concert this week was the sensitivity and emotion she lent to the two main pieces in Suddha Saveri and Kiravani. The first two songs followed the script. A brisk ‘Sami ninne’ (Thodi varnam) and ‘Sudha madhurya bhashana’ (Tyagaraja, Sindhuramakriya) provided the verve and tempo that her concerts are known for. The twist in the lyric of the first line in the second song was not lost on the sharp listeners. Creative volley Thenatural laya and swaras at ‘Sudha’ offers interesting kalpanaswara manipulations and Sudha, along with Charumathi Raghuraman (violin), came up with a volley of creative patterns reminiscent of Madurai Mani Iyer. The overall feel of the Suddha Saveri alapana was distinctive and engaging. Perhaps the Hindustani touches, short low-tone phrases, and haunting journeys around ‘da ma ri’ made it sound different. It matched the Dikshitar version of Devakriya, the song being ‘Sri vatuka natha’ in misra chapu. Sudha paced the kriti well, with a good swara segment, her staple, at ‘Deva devakriya.’ Charumathi’s music and persona is unassuming but intense. ‘Ennai nee maravadhe’ (Amritavarshini, Dandapani Desikar) was a breezy filler that helped Patri Satish Kumar to do a ‘breathless’ on mridangam. With her choice of songs, Sudha ensured diversity in the tempo. She overcame a quivery start to sing a highly classical Kiravani, with impactful phrases at the tara stayi. She managed to keep the wear and tear of her voice to the minimum. Dwelt at leisure Charumathi’s Kiravani had plenty of sowkhyam . ‘Chandrasekaram ashraye’ in kanta triputa composed on Kanchi Mahaperiyava by scholar Dr. V. Raghavan has depth in raga and lyrical expressions, allowing Sudha to dwell at leisure in the kriti and the niraval at ‘Kara abhayamudram’. These moments in the concert were quite sublime. And in the last piece, Dr. Balamuralikrishna’s thillana in Brindavani, Sudha poured energy. Charumathi added melodic value to the concert, while Patri Satish Kumar capped his brisk contribution with a good tani avartanam, with Raman on the morsing. Raman also got some opportunities to show his skills. Sudha Ragunathan’s tenure at the top of the rasika charts extends further, thanks to her presentation style and on-stage abilities.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/emotion-added-to-spark/article33524796.ece
08 January 2021||January 08 2021 00:00 IST,||Unexpected departures||Abhishek Raghuram’s concert was, well, good. There was nothing in it to get excited about, nor was there anything to take exception to. Of the four main elements — Jaganmohini (Gopalakrishna Bharati’s ‘Sivakamasundari’), Kanada (Dikshitar’s ‘Balambikaya’), Saveri (‘Undu mada kalitran,’ a Thiruppavai) and Mohanam (Tyagaraja’s ‘Evarura’), the most enjoyable was the one on which the singer dwelt the least — the Saveri piece. The text-book Saveri began with a brief alapana which went up to the crest of the curve and, without bothering to ski down the descent, Abhishek took up Thiruppavai from the last two lines (beginning with ‘senthamarai’). There was little scope for violinist H.N. Bhaskar except to keep up. Overall, it was a neat Saveri. The concert opened with Jaganmohini, presented in considerable detail, with too many sangatis in the opening line, which was perhaps a bit unwise because the rendition took too long to move on. A brief alapana The Kanada alapana began low and slow and, given the long anchoring in the lower notes, one expected the raga to be sketched out fully. But Abhishek strangely chose not to go beyond the upper sa and abruptly picked up the pallavi line of the composition. An alapana, however brief, is expected to be full-fledged; any departure from that tradition must have a reason. The piece, therefore, has to be stamped ‘incomplete.’ Then came Saveri, the second Mayamalavagowla derivative within 20 minutes, following which the vocalist took up Mohanam with a plain-jane alapana. Abhishek stopped at the upper notes and let the violinist present his essay of the raga. When Bhaskar finished playing, the singer seemed to go back to the alapana, but after a karvai on the upper ga , he plunged into a Tyagaraja kriti, choosing to begin it with the anupallavi line (‘Savana rakshaka’). After you move to the pallavi line, returning to the anupallavi becomes somewhat of an overkill. But the rendition of the composition was good and he took up the line beginning ‘Ijaalamu’ for niraval — the only niraval in the concert — going through it like rafting in the rapids. When the niraval ended, instead of attaching swaras to the niraval line, he landed them alternately on the words ‘Evarura’ and ‘Ninnu vina’. The accompanists made up for the lack of an audience. While Bhaskar’s admiration for the vocalist’s singing seemed to border on devotion, mridangist Delhi Sairam displayed his approbation by nodding his head vigorously, a compliment that the singer returned when he played a nice thani.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/unexpected-departures/article33524802.ece

08 January 2021||NEW DELHI,||Rows of tractors take over highways||In a massive show of strength, thousands of farmers on Thursday took out a tractor rally from the Singhu border at the Capital’s periphery with rows of tractors taking over the highways. In what they termed as a “trailer,” farmers who have been protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws at the Capital’s borders for over 40 days now, said that the parade was just a precursor to what the rally on Republic Day would look like. ‘Just a trailer’ The tractor rally, which took off from a site several kilometres away from the main protest site at the Singhu border, saw thousands of farmers make their way to the highway, while several others stayed back near the tents and trolleys to arrange for langars. Rashpal Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Jalandhar, said: “Today’s tractor rally is just the trailer. Currently there is a great deal of churning going on in the country and the way in which humanity was ending is being arrested through this movement. Farmers are the backbone of this country and what is the point of forcing something on us which we do not want?” Stating that agitations against several issues would follow, Mr. Singh said, “ Aab Inquilab aayegi ” [There will be revolution now] and now it will not stop at only farmers’ issues. The only good thing that the Prime Minister has done is bringing unity among the farmers. Earlier, there were various strands and now all of us are one unit. We are certain that we will win through this agitation.” Holding placards and raising slogans demanding the repeal of the three laws, a group of 25 women from Punjab’s Patran town said they had reached the Delhi border three days ago for the rally. ‘Take back the laws’ Rajinder Kaur, one of the women present there said, “It looks like the Prime Minister cannot see us or hear us despite us being in such large numbers. He has forgotten that we are the ones who have voted him to power. Through the tractor rally we would like to tell the government that it better take the laws back.” Seated atop a tractor, Gurwinder Singh, a farmer from Patiala said: “This tractor rally was just the prelude to the main parade. Through today’s [Thursday] rally we were successful in displaying our preparations and strength to the government and give them an idea of how the rally on Republic Day will look like. We are an extremely peaceful lot and we have no intention of getting into face-offs with any person or authority of any kind.” Taranjeet Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Nawanshahr district said, “Through this parade we have given an idea about what the government can expect for the rally on Republic Day. The rally that day will be similar and in fact, on a much larger scale as we are going to call for more tractors to join us at the border.”  We are an extremely peaceful lot and we have no intention of getting into face-offs with any person or authority of any kind Gurwinder Singh  Farmer from Patiala||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/rows-of-tractors-take-over-highways/article33525101.ece
08 January 2021||new Delhi,||SC notice to Rajasthan House Speaker, 6 MLAs||The Supreme Court on Thursday sought responses from the Rajasthan Assembly Speaker and others on two separate petitions against the merger of six BSP MLAs into the ruling Congress legislature party in the State in September, 2019. The apex court was hearing separate petitions filed by the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and BJP MLA Madan Dilawar against the August 24 last year order passed by the Rajasthan High Court. The High Court had dismissed the BSP’s petition against the September 18, 2019 order passed by the Assembly Speaker approving the merger. It had however given liberty to the BSP to file a disqualification petition with the Speaker raising plea of defection of the six legislators. The High Court, while dealing with the plea filed by Mr.Dilawar, had asked the Speaker to decide within three months the disqualification petition filed by the BJP MLA against the merger.  ‘Boost to Gehlot govt.’ The merger was a boost to Ashok Gehlot-led State government as the tally of the Congress increased to over 100 in the House of 200 MLAs. The pleas filed by BSP and Dilawar against the High Court’s order came up for hearing on Thursday before a Bench comprising Justices S.A. Nazeer and K.M. Joseph. “We will issue notice,” the Bench said while seeking responses, including from the Assembly secretary as well as the six MLAs. Senior advocate Satish Chandra Mishra, appearing for the BSP, referred to the Assembly Speaker’s order and said that nothing would be left to be decided in disqualification proceedings now. At the outset, the Bench asked Mishra, “Why are you not going before the division bench of the High Court?”. Mr. Mishra referred to the sequence of events in the matter, including the order passed by the Assembly speaker and the proceedings before the High Court. In its plea, the BSP has said that the High Court had dismissed its petition holding the September 18, 2019 order passed by the Speaker to be an administrative order and not an order adjudicating the claim of merger under paragraph 4 of the Tenth Schedule.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/sc-notice-to-rajasthan-house-speaker-6-mlas/article33525094.ece
08 January 2021||NUH,||Four farmer leaders involved with tractor rally preparations detained||Four farmer leaders involved with the preparations for the tractor rally on Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway from Nuh in response to a call from Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a joint front of farmer unions, were detained by the Nuh police on Thursday preventing the holding of the rally. The proposed tractor rally from Nuh’s Rewasan village to Palwal on the expressway was part of the five batches of tractors scheduled to march around Delhi on the Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressway in protest against the three farm laws. The Nuh police team picked up All-India Mewati Samaj president Ramzan Chaudhary from his house around 8 a.m. and took him into preventive custody. “First, they took me to City Police Post and later to Nalhar police station. Later in the evening, they took me in preventive custody and produced before the Sub-Divisional Magistrate court,” said Mr. Chaudhary. Another social activist and farmer leader, Umar Padla, claimed that a police team reached his house in the morning and stayed there till around noon preventing him from going outside. ‘Barricades placed’ “The police had been calling me for the past few days seeking details of the proposed tractor rally,” he claimed. Two more farmer leaders, Azad Kheri and Rashid Advocate, were taken to the local police stations and let off in the evening, said Mr. Padla. Salamudeen Meo, president, Mewat Vikas Sabha alleged that the police had put barricades at several intersections, including Badkali Chowk, and did not allow the farmers to come out on the Gurugram-Alwar Highway (NH-248A) to reach the KMP. “Around a dozen tractors from each of the six blocks were scheduled to be part of the march, but the police did not allow it. Eventually, around 30 people in half-a-dozen cars reached Palwal from Nuh to express solidarity with the farmers,” said Mr. Meo. Swaraj India national president Yogendra Yadav also tweeted around noon about the detention of Mr. Chaudhary and warned the government against any ill-treatment against him. Narendra Bijarniya, SP, Nuh, said that only Mr. Chaudhary was detained.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/four-farmer-leaders-involved-with-tractor-rally-preparations-detained/article33525096.ece

08 January 2021||New Delhi,||Air quality of Delhi ‘poor’, slight improvement likely from tomorrow||The air quality of Delhi, Gurugram, and Noida was in ‘poor’ category on Thursday, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. The national capital’s air quality is expected to stay in the ‘poor’ category on Friday as well. “The AQI is likely to marginally improve and stay in the ‘poor’ to ‘moderate’ category on January 9 and 10. No sudden deterioration of AQI is expected in the next few days,” said a statement by government-run monitoring agency SAFAR. The effect of stubble burning on Delhi’s air quality remained low on Thursday. The “mixing layer height”, which is the height from the ground level up to which pollutants can be dispersed, was “moderate”. This led to lesser accumulation of pollutants near the surface. Also, the speed of surface-level winds was “moderate”, which aided in lesser accumulation of pollutants. Faster surface winds help in the dispersion of pollutants. The AQI of Delhi was 255 on Thursday, as per the CPCB’s 4 p.m. bulletin.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/air-quality-of-delhi-poor-slight-improvement-likely-from-tomorrow/article33525099.ece

08 January 2021||JAIPUR,||Marketing support for women self-help groups||As part of the strategy for economic empowerment of women self help groups (SHGs), three departments of the Rajasthan government have come together for branding and competitive marketing of their products through online platforms. A new web portal will be shortly launched here for helping out the SHGs. A retail counter of the Rajasthan Grameen Ajeevika Vikas Parishad was also set up at the government-run Rajasthali Emporium, popular among tourists, here on Wednesday for promoting the sale of handicraft items manufactured by women artisans. Bagru Khurd village’s Komal, an SHG member, inaugurated the counter by cutting the ribbon. The Rural Development & Panchayati Raj, the Women & Child Development and the Local Self Government Departments have jointly formulated a plan to empower the SHGs with focus on quality, branding and marketing of their products. The strategies are expected to make a significant value addition to the production by SHGs. Additional Chief Secretary (Rural Development) Rohit Kumar Singh said on Thursday that a common web portal for SHGs would incorporate different aspects of value assessment, marketing, innovations, training and online applications. “Our emphasis will be on enabling the SHGs to make their presence felt in the market,” he said. Mr. Singh said the women SHGs would be encouraged to gradually shift from farm sector to the non-farm sector with diversification of their activities, which would help their members increase their livelihood.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/marketing-support-for-women-self-help-groups/article33525092.ece
08 January 2021||Guwahati,||Meghalaya lawmakers asked to unite for ILP||An umbrella organisation of NGOs in Meghalaya has asked the State’s three MPs and all 60 MLAs to unite for the implementation of the Inner-Line Permit (ILP) and hit the streets of New Delhi together, if need be. Implemented under the British-era Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, the ILP is an official document issued to let an Indian citizen enter a protected area for a limited period. Pressure groups in the northeast view this permit as a shield against the entry of illegal immigrants. The Confederation of Meghalaya Social Organisations (CoMSO) said MLAs of the ruling coalition headed by the National People’s Party (NPP) and the Opposition Congress should leave aside their political rivalry for the 2023 Assembly election for the greater interest of the State. “Election-oriented political rivalry is understandable. But they must unite on important issues such as ILP, protection and recognition of language and border disputes,” CoMSO chairman Robertjune Kharjahrin said on Thursday.  ‘Raise the issue’ “We appeal to all the three MPs of Meghalaya to please raise the issue and see how the Prime Minister and the Union Home Minister respond to it,” he said. The CoMSO said all the 60 MLAs of the State, who had passed the ILP resolution unanimously, should pursue the matter with the Centre and stage protests in New Delhi.||https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/meghalaya-lawmakers-asked-to-unite-for-ilp/article33525091.ece
